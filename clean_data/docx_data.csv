Hi Mentee,
Is that... ✨ growth ✨ I hear? Isn't that incredible that just a year ago, you were planning what courses to take, running around and finding your buildings/classes, getting to know your friends and profs, and adjusting to a new city, and now, you can confidently say things like that? I probably sound like a broken record, but you make your mentor proud and you should be proud of your hard work too! 🥹
By 2nd year, I'd say I had found my bearings also. You spend your 1st year learning about yourself and adjusting, so that in the 2nd year, you can know what to expect and apply what you've learned as a student. You also build the skills to feel more confident in taking on additional responsibilities like part-time jobs and co-ops, without them interfering with your academic success. I think 3rd year is when I took things more seriously, because depending on the school you're interested in, they might take your upper-year grades into consideration for Masters (Graduate) programs. Dependent on the school and program, of course. 
I guess while I'm on that topic, is it too early to think about what Graduate program and school you were interested in getting into? Course-based, thesis-optional, thesis-required? There's so many options! I pulled this from UBC's Biochem & Molecular Bio Graduate Program admission requirements just as an example, but I'd recommend following a generic blueprint to be as eligible to as many of your goal programs as possible, keeping your options open across BC and Canada. I'd imagine you'd not only want to be in a program, but also in a lab, which according to this Grad program, 20-25 students get a lab placement out of 100 applications. If you were aiming for the researcher trajectory, it seems you're right on track!  
Masters Program
You should have advanced laboratory experience in a biochemistry research environment, e.g., summer student research project, co-op work experience, a directed studies laboratory research course, or employment as a laboratory technician in a research or relevant industrial environment.
At the minimum, you should hold or be in the process of completing a four year science BSc or BScH.
You should be knowledgeable in organic and physical chemistry beyond the introductory level.
You should have taken an introductory Biochemistry course, an introductory Biochemistry laboratory course, and at least two advanced Biochemistry courses.
Courses in genetics, physics, microbiology, or cell biology are strongly recommended.
North American degree holders must have obtained an overall transcript average of B+ or have a first class standing in 12 credits of combined 3rd and 4th year relevant coursework.
Non-North American degree holders must review the minimum academic entrance requirements as set by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. 
I was poking around UBC's other graduate programs and thought that Medical Genetics sounded very interesting and possibly aligned with your interests and degree. Give it a browse if you're curious! I could totally see a genetic counsellor Mentee, an epidemiologist Mentee, and let's not forget, researcher Mentee. 😎 
Congrats on your final grades! You worked hard for those and I hope you celebrated a bit before you hit the books again! And you're going to get a Summer position, I can already feel it. 2024 is going to be lucky for the both of us 💕 ! With that said, I wonder if it'd be worth while to also make a CV? I think resumes and CV's are different? To be honest, I've always used a resume when asked for a CV, but I do recall being specifically asked for a CV when I was applying as a lab volunteer back in undergrad. But it's been so long though, maybe I'm just getting old and forgetting haha 👵 !
Let's stay in this section for now, so you can refer to the resources as you apply to your Summer jobs. Let me know how it goes!
I've got to get back to studying too lol! 📚 Talk again soon!

Hello! Happy New Year!
I think the first floor of the library is our go-to study spot because we're able to talk but also get work done, and it's kinda central. I spent most of last year studying on the library's second floor, and I haven't studied there at all this year. 🤷‍♀️
My finals went well, and I'm happy with my class grades, which is good. The interesting thing I've found with the second year is that we're all just better at school. Classes are more difficult, but we know how to study, we're more relaxed for exams because we know how they work, and we better understand what we need to do to succeed. 
Okay, I feel the same way about if January 2023 me talked to December 2023, so much happened last year (most of it good) but ultimately it was a good year for personal growth!
How did the December (mid-year) performance review go? Did you get a raise?
MCAT studying sounds exciting and stressful! How's it going?
I appreciate that we're in the getting hired section because I'm about to start applying for a summer job! I'm going for the same approach as last year, getting a job in a lab at UBC. So I've updated my resume and getting my references in order. Wish me luck!
I've got to get back to studying 😅

Hi Mentee!
WELCOME BACK TO MENTORING TO THE BOTH OF US! Goodness, 2 months pass just like that and now look at all these upgrades ReMBC has for us... I'm not even sure what half of these buttons mean, so let's have fun trying them out as we get back into the swing of things. Like are those... Emojis?!  (I think we can stick with using our Apple ones for the variety though so shhh 🤐 ). My heart felt so warm reading all your life updates, because I always feel like we have this telepathic understanding that we can go off and do life and come back and update each other! So let's catch up, shall we?
Ooooooo Notion! As a student I used a coil-bound agenda and handwrote to keep track of things (still do), but now, being the corporate girlie I am (but am I really if I work in publicly-funded health care? LOL), I use OneNote. How are you finding it? And I was always amazed at how people used Excel as a means of tracking things... But maybe it's me? Hi? Were my ugly spreadsheets the problem? It's me? HAHA. It seems like your program arsenal is getting more stacked every year, look at you getting Premium Grammarly. Only the best for my mentee 😏 . 
You know what they say, a healthy body is a healthy mind. Especially now that it's getting darker and colder, it's good to hear you're sticking to a healthy routine that will take care of you now and later. And it's even opening up your social circle beyond classmates! There's this fun meme about your closest co-workers being nearly double your age with kids, and it's so true. It's like that in my workplace too, so I'm glad it's similar to you making friends with your grandma/grandpa gymrats! 
I think one of my first university tips to you was to find a favorite, reliable study spot and just like a full-circle, you've found one! And sounds like your friends have found yours too! What makes that place your go-to study spot? For me, my place was in the basement of the library (quiet floor), where the desks were large, used comfortable computer chairs, well lit, and each desk had a 2-4 socket outlet. Bonus points for being only 1 floor away from the coffee shop! 
So, I did end up going crabbing a few times! I imagine it'd be similar to fishing, where the appeal is being out in the sun and open waters, waiting for a catch. I ended up using the waiting time to read a book, but the interest dwindled down as the weather got colder. But you know who really took a liking to crabbing? MY DAD. Haha, I turned this man into a fisherman, and we even got traps of our own! And truthfully, I don't eat crab really. I just came so my dad could catch more (he's more of the crab fan) 🦀 .
- GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FINALS. You're prepared, you're confident, you've got this. The only mountain is you, and you've moved them last year and you'll move them again.
- Rock climbing seems so fun! I remember doing that waaay back in high school and a few times after that in college, but it's just another cool thing to mix your physical activity up a bit!
- I've never seen a moose in person but I've seen videos and they are actually massive. That is intense that you've seen them while going on your Twilight runs through the forest (I'm sorry I had to #TeamEdward LOL). Running, gymming, rock climbing, what will my mentee get up to next? Find out in our next mentor message!
- -6 °C to 0°C being warm is crazy sounding as an Islander. But you know? I'm still so proud of you. You moved out of your town, out of your comfort zone to be in a completely different city and environment and the weather is still the least of your challenges! Just like you've been along for the ride in my job hunt, I feel the same way in seeing your growth from high schooler to now university student. Cheers to seeing our self-growth, and double cheers to seeing more of it!
Updates from me to you!:
- I'm not sure if you've seen those memes floating around like ""If January 2023 me met December 2023 me, they'd be flabbergasted"", but I feel like that sums up my year. 😂  I went into 2023 with certain expectations, but am exiting the year with a changed perspective - Instead of expecting this is how things will go, I'm going to accept how things do go. Feels less stressful that way! Looking forward to what 2024 brings!
- Something you may come across in the future are performance reviews, which tie into pay adjustments (raises!). You work on goals you've set throughout the fiscal year, so it may look something like setting your goals at the beginning of the fiscal (April), having a mid-year check-in (December), and a final review the following year (March). I have my mid-year one tomorrow, so wish me luck! Manifesting that raise 💰 
- Making use of the benefits at work, just like you're taking advantage of what's available to you as a student! I've been getting massage therapy every month which sounds heavenly and is. I also joined my work's ethics journal club!
- Something that I'm working on and is quite significant has been starting my MCAT studying! I'm projecting to take my exam next Summer, but it's been admittedly more challenging having been out of the student mindset for a while. If you know any materials you think might help, let me know! I think the 'Chemistries' might be my achilles heel for this behemoth of an exam!
- And at last, being in the adult world... It's been a gratifying experience working steadily towards my goals and filling my life with meaningful experiences. Trying something new, making new friends, saying yes to more things, you feel like there's so many opportunities everyday, and there are, so long as you don't close your eyes and your mind. I hope you keep the stars in your eyes once you graduate, because I know there will be so many doors open for you!
Good luck on your exams, Merry early Christmas, and as always, I've got your back.

Hello!
Okay, so it's the end of November.... 
I'm back; sorry I was gone for 2 MONTHS. Time got away from me 😅
The school has been keeping me insanely busy.
My priMentor software for everyday school includes Grammarly (Premium now), Notion, and Microsoft programs. Excel is a game changer for keeping track of everything.
I have 8:30 am classes five days a week. However, I've been getting up at 5:30 am to go to the gym every day, so by the time 8:30 am rolls around, I've been awake for 3 hours already. Morning classes are still a drag, though. I'm just avoiding the 8:00 am lab times. 😬
I'm on campus studying in the same spot all the time. People know where to find me, and it's very random to have people walk up to me and say, ""I thought I'd find you here. Could you help me with this?"" I guess that's just small university stuff.
It's great to hear that work's going well. I feel like I've been a long for the ride regarding your job search and everything, so it's good that you're settled in now. 😊
Did you take up crabbing? Like fishing for crabs? That's so cool! Do you eat all the crab?
As far as my life updates: 
- I'm still an academic wepon. Finals start in two weeks, and I'm stressing but confident
- My roommate and I went rock climbing as a residence activity on Monday, and we had a lot of fun, so we're thinking of starting that as a hobby in the new year. The indoor rock climbing place in Prince George has a good student discount.
- I've seen so many moose this year. I've been running through the woods every weekend and seen them there and walking through campus. As I was walking to the gym on Wednesday, I passed by two. Let me say they're massive and scary. They will attack you if they feel like it.
- I'm friends with many elderly seniors at the gym now. The thing with going that early in the morning is that's when the old people go. So, I've become friends with them, which includes going to Thanksgiving dinner with one of their families.
- For the end of November, Prince George is warm with little snow. There was 3 to 4 feet this time last year, but it's basically melted today. The temperature hovers between -6 °C and 0°C, which is warm for this time of year.'
Things have been very academically focused this semester, which is good, but my social life has also grown, which is nice.
How have the past couple of months been for you?

Hi Mentee,
$15 for a software you can apply to not just all your classes, but resume building, scholarship essay writing, etc! That is so neat and kind! It's those little things like punctuation that can make your work look that much cleaner and put together. 😄 I'd also like to think people can review your work more comprehensively VS getting distracted by the typos and run-ons. While we didn't get Grammarly as our handout, we did get other software a bit more specific to our program like Tableau! On the topic of software, aside from Tableau, more program-specific software we frequented (not free and on school computers lol) was Microsoft Office/Project, SAS, OpenEpi/Epi Info, and the likes. What softwares have you been finding you've been using more or are new to you? A thought would be to brush up on them from time to time, as you never know when they may be applicable for future research positions, co-op's/job placements, and more! Spoiler: Know Excel. Lol. Excel is everywhere.
Now that you're in uni, how are you finding those 8:30am classes?! Are you choosing those intentionally?! 😂  I thought a strong appeal of being in post-secondary was being able to pick out your schedule... But to be honest, I was on campus by 8am everyday too lol. Even if I didn't have classes until later, I'd use those mornings to get some readings/reviews/homework in. Super quiet in the library especially, which is where I'd be 99% of the time. Are you just staying on campus until 3:30/5:30, or what do you do to kill the time in between? 
Updates updates! Let's see... So I'm back to work! Project work has been ramping up which has its impacts, like say... You want to build something and you're assigned a builder who will help you. But that builder is also assigned to other projects at the same time, so you can only do so much as reesourcing is limited. Wanted to mention that as we often think resources to be things like time, money, materials, but people are resources too! Something also coming up for me in the next few months is goal planning and vacation planning. There are personal goals, but there are also performance goals in the workplace. These are what they sound like, being what you plan to accomplish in the next year. I think one of my goals I'll be aiming for is to create some new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documentation for the team as I enjoy doing that! Vacation wise, I've got to think of my plans for 2024. I know what you might be thinking - Already? How would you know what you need off this early? Lol. I kinda don't. But in the healthcare space, planning vacations a year in advance makes sense, doesn't it? But don't worry, these are just to plop some time off and secure them (especially for in-demand times like Summer and Christmas). We can always move them around as, naturally, we don't know what tomorrow brings, let alone what may happen a year in advance. Just some possible things you might experience in your future workspace! Life-wise, I had to make the tough call and skip ballet this year. Crabbing took its spot as a hobby while the weather is still nice 🦀 ! There's always next year though, so I'm looking forward to putting 🩰 on my 2024 vision board and all those fun things I wanna manifest. Any updates you'd like to share? School, life, whatever floats our boat! 🛥️ Hope you're doing well, my mentee! Your mentor's got your back. :)

Hello, 
Welcome back!
I'm back at university, and things are going well so far. My classes seem more reasonable this semester compared to last semester. My school got us a Grammarly premium for $15 for the year. It's great my punctuation is much better! 😁 Other than all that, I'm just waiting for stuff to pick up so I'll have something to do between classes (I have an 8:30am-9:20 am class and no other class until 3:30 pm Monday and Wednesday or 5:30 pm on Friday)
Anyway, update me on what you've been up to!

Hi Mentee,
I'm back! ... Albeit a week later than I said I'd be. LOL. 
My apologies for underestimating how bad I'd be hit with jetlag; it's been... 7(?) years since I've travelled across the ocean and significantly different timezones? I think I'm just getting over it now, but that first week back had me d e l u l u from adjusting to my whack sleep pattern lol. But yes! I've returned from my family vacation 🥹🗾🚄🍵🍱🍣🍜!
I'd be happy to share some story times or tips, but firstly, I'd love to hear how you've been! Congrats on the honey by the way LOL, local, fresh honey is the best! Have you tried just eating it straight from the honeycomb? It's soooo sweet but soooo good! 🐝🍯
Looking forward to getting us back on track with mentorship now that I'm back!

Hello,
Congratulations on finally going for that well-deserved vacation! 
With the sayonara and the emojis including sushi, I'm guessing you've gone to Japan?
Also, just a random bonus of working in a lab where half the people study bees: Honey! I got a big jar of honey for free, which tastes so good.

Hi Mentee,
I wanted to stop by here before I get swept up in all my vacation planning, panicking, and packing on top of work this week, but... GUESS WHO'S FINALLY GOING ON VACAY (and literally leaving this Friday lol)?! I wanted to share the story of how I'm going to _____, and how everything happens in its own way. That sounds a bit spiritual, doesn't it? Divine timing, manifestations, and the like. I'm not sure if you believe in those? No judgment either or - While I think it's important to acknowledge outcomes, I've been leaning towards stoic practices in the past year. Fortify yourself in what is in your control, so you can be resilient across what isn't! Anyway, I digress. Story time! ✨
Back when I started university (I only graduated 2 years ago but why does it feel so long?!), I told myself and everyone around me that I'd be going to this country once I graduated. Love the food, interested in the history, fascinated by the culture, and I've been told it offers something different every visit. Fast forward through the semesters and even while convocating as a ""pandemic graduate"", I still told everyone that I'd be going to _____ with my mask on. Well, COVID had different plans for me, and as borders weren't opening up in the foreseeable future, I decided to start my future early by applying for jobs. Now in my career where vacation days (and vacation pay!) are a thing, I unknowingly booked time off at the same time my brother and sister-in-law were planning to go travelling. They've been waiting 2 years to go, and throughout those 2 years have been asking me if I'd meet them there. I'm not sure if I'd shared this yet, but initially, I had planned to go to Chicago this year - Attend a music festival, see the museums, eat their pizza, so I said not this time. But life brought all of us together in the form of a wedding (not mine ofc lol)! So sayonara to Chicago and hello to... Have you guessed where I'm going yet?🎋🌸🍜🍣🍱🍡🍵🥢🚄⛩️
I guess where I'm getting at is: Your life starts everyday. Although you can plan and prepare as best you can, there is only so much in your hands and the rest is out of them. Maybe something doesn't go exactly as expected, but maybe it will work out for the best, we really don't know. It's all about perspective and strengthening your mind, body, heart, and soul!
I don't mean to pressure you by calling you my Nobel Prize winner; As cheesy as it sounds, you'll always be a winner in my books. I just know you're going to do your best, and that's already the best thing you can do for the world. :) I refrained from opening another conversation because I thought I might be lost when I come back lol. Let's start a new one together when I return? 
Fri., 21-Jul-2023 until Mon., 14-Aug-2023 - Mentor's vacay!
Let's catch up on our Summer when I come back! If you head off somewhere too, just let me know via here too!

Hi Mentee,
I'm so happy to hear everything about the lab is going well, especially the immaculate ✨vibes✨. It must be exciting learning hands-on and just getting the feel for what wet labs are all about - What a fun and productive way to spend your Summer! Keep those ideas tucked in the back of your mind for next year (or maybe even this upcoming Fall semester), when we look into possibly applying them for student research grants and proposing them to PIs. An added benefit to your research experience is now having built connections with those in your lab, as your colleagues could very well be your future co-workers (happened to me, my friend and I are on the same team at work lol)! ... It's the fact I YouTubed ""bee dissection"" for me... 🐝⚔️
Honestly, you're going to feel imposter syndrome anywhere, everywhere. As a student, as a researcher, in your career, maybe even as a person (hello existential crisis lol). I wish I had some sure fire advice to give you, but to this day, I combat those feelings of, ""Why am I here?"" ""Why was I hired?"" ""I'm not good enough for how long I've been here"". But like you said, you just have to trust the judgment of those who placed you there. They believed in you, so try to find that part of you that believes in yourself. I have gratitude for the day, even the hard ones - Because I know it's all a part of life's story, and you learn from everything and grow through everything. Look at you go! Mentee about to enter her dry lab era 🔬💻. But just like how those grad students are finding a bright undergrad to learn from, you never know where or who or how you'll learn about something that will apply to your studies and life! Stay curious!
That's my future Nobel Prize winner right here, folks! For real, can't wait to see where you go in research, because I know it's not a matter of if, but when you'll make a breakthrough. No matter how big or small, I'm sure it'll be meaningful to humankind. 🏅I'm gonna be that Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme like, ""HEY, I MENTORED HER."" LOL.

Hi Mentee,
As you can tell by the timestamp I'm writing this, this is me doing my usual drop-in before work LOL. I'll get back to you as soon as I can (but I skimmed your reply and saw dissecting a BEE? So I can't wait to read what that's all about!). I'll fill you in with adulting just like you've been filling me in with studenting 😄.
Quick question for you in the meantime: How do you build your study habits/routines around life, or do you build life around your routines? I haven't been consistent with my studying, especially when life gets busy, and just want to get something going. 1 page a day is better than 0 pages a day, as they say! I want to reach my goals ideally next year, but whenever I'm ready too 😅 Maybe I need to start off with an end date like a SMART goal. What do you think, my mentee?
See you super soon!

Hello,
The summer position is excellent. The vibes in the lab are perfect and I'm enjoying the research. I'm learning a lot which is great. I've been introduced to many new ideas, research techniques, and scientific concepts which is amazing! I've been taking care of two cell lines and then infecting them with viruses or doing knockdowns. I can't think of any funny stories but there have been some moments where I'm just surprised something is even happening since it seems so out of place. Such as the lab paying for us to go to a bird sanctuary, but nobody is doing anything to do with birds. 
I watched someone dissect a bee. ONE OF THE WEIRDEST THINGS! They pull out the stinger and the guts come with it and it just keeps coming. It's like one of those clown magic tricks where they pull a hanky out of a pocket and it just keeps coming. 
I've learned a lot about working in academia and myself in that field. I went in with the experience you get in labs at school which is basically nothing and I respect those who are more advanced in their education who believe in me and are willing to teach me even if it takes time away from their projects. I was talking to another undergrad working in the lab and she said, ""the imposter syndrome is real"" I just said ""same"" because I've really been feeling like I don't have enough background knowledge to be in the position I am in. When I feel that way I just remind myself that these are smart people I'm working with and who hired me, if they didn't think I was capable I wouldn't have been offered the job. I still panicked when I was asked to present something at a lab meeting but I did it and it went well. I've also been asked to look into a course that teaches you how to analyze mass spectrometry data using Python. Which I was game to do because I enjoy coding and I know a little Python. But then a couple of the grad students were like ""hey if you figure out how to analyse data with Python instead of R could you teach us?"" and I was like ""...sure?..."" But I'll give it a shot and needing to teach someone is motivation for me to learn it better myself. 
What drives me? good question. Science is always something I've wanted to pursue and it's because I like the feeling. There's this moment when things just click, kinda like a runner's high but nerdy. 😁 I like the search to know more. My brain gets very excited when I learn something and let's be honest science is important. The world needs people researching everyone so we can be healthier, more environmentally intelligent, and better people. 
Should we move on to another topic?

Andddd we're back to regular programing with me, your host, Mentor! 🥳
First off, oh my goodness, please don't feel bad for keeping busy! It's funny, because I also had this kind of ""That's So Raven"" pause last week and thought, ""Oh my gosh, mentoring. R a c h e l. M e. We both just fell off the planet."" LOL. But I think we also have this back-of-the-mind, mutual understanding that we're both working through life (literally and figuratively) and will eventually come back to each other! (That commute really do be a synonym for brutal tho... 4-5 hours of commuting a day. #Commited🫠😭)
You had mentioned that you'd gotten a Summer position with a UBC graduate student, so how has that been? What have you learned so far? Any funny stories to tell? While you'll naturally learn skills in new environments, being able to make connections, nurture your interests and fuel your passion will take you even further. My dentist often tells me, ""If I did dentistry for the money, I would've quit a long time ago!"" What drives you to want to do what you do, pursue post-graduate education, and achieve your dreams? Keep those in mind as you continue to grow into the student, professional, and person you want to be! Interesting enough, I'm going to be talking to my mentor today about how to explore ones interests and sustain consistency, so if there are some valuable, applicable tidbits I can share with you, I'll for sure let you know! Edit post-meeting: He said finding your passions early on is advantageous, as when you begin to build commitments to things (e.g. family, income, mortgage), it's difficult to take risks for your passions. 
OKAY, GO OFF MS. MASS SPECTROMETRY! 🙌 Add that to the list! And who knows? Maybe the next lab job that's hiring or your next research project may require these skills and you've already got the experience! Always keep your mind open to what you'll learn and how applicable it can be to other positions. You'd be surprised at how much overlap there is, and how transferrable everything is. Can't wait to see what doors this position opens for you, but by this time next year, I think we'll be gunning for you to start your own research project 😉.
Anchor text question time!
If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better?
It's hard to say if I've had a lot compared to the average person, but I do believe I've had plenty of job interviews. My uni program actually had mock interview clinics, where we would be interviewed by real professionals in the industry and get their feedback. Looking back, that was an incredible resource - We all treated it like it was the real deal (both sides dressed up, gave resumes, had interview papers), and it was a very real opportunity to meet some people who could be our future hiring managers. If your university has something like this, I highly encourage you to do it! Like mock-MMI clinics or something!
What I do well in interviews is maintain eye contact, speak clearly, and be able to relate the questions to a skill / story on what was included in the job posting. These are standard. But I've also mentioned before that personality has often been a factor in interviews - Have you heard the recent saying that during an interview, it's 50/50? They're interviewing if you'd be a good fit, and you're interviewing them if you want to fit. Just as much as you can offer your skills, you're in the position to see if this is where you see yourself working, and more importantly, growing. So I really encourage being yourself during interviews (while of course, maintaining professionalism! 🤪)
If you have never had a job interview before, what are some things you’re nervous about, and what are you comfortable with?
Oh, you know what? I've definitely been asked what my greatest strength and weakness are during an interview. The trick is to answer honestly, but leverage your strength to improve that weakness. Why be honest, you ask? Personally, integrity is my core value. I want to be true to myself. Professionally, I think they'll eventually find out if I embellished the truth, if not through my references, they'll see it once I've started working lol. For an example, I've said that my weakness was being shy and reserved, never speaking up unless spoken to. But my strength is being friendly and hardworking. I acknowledge that I'm shy, but with my bubbly persona, this shyness eventually goes away. I work hard to build rapport with my colleagues, and in turn, that reduces my shyness and builds connection = Leveraging my strengths to strengthen my weaknesses. (And yup, I got the job with this one!)
ASK your mentor to tell you a story of a memorable job interview. It might be the story of a successful interview – or it might be the story of the worst interview they ever had.
How fun! I think it's important to see the good, the bad, and the funny side of job hunting, so enjoy! Spoiler alert: I'm employed! LOL!
Best interview: I applied to be a research assistant with 0% research experience, 100% research interest, and ""got the job"". How? Again, never underestimate the combination of honesty, personality, and being able to reflect experiences to meet what they're looking for on paper! I was very up-front that I had no research experience - COVID unfortunately happened during the time I was trying to get research together, and it made it hard to continue (honesty). However, despite this, I had still tried to apply for volunteer research opportunities, which showed that I was determined to get experience in the field (personality). I had experience with computer programs and was already working within a Health Authority under my belt (what they're looking for). I'm sure there were applicants with actual research experience, but I want to believe they saw my spirit haha! After everything, I did reach out to the program manager, to which she commended my grit to do so. The reason I put it ""got the job"" in quotes was because while I did get the offer, I didn't end up accepting it, because...
Worst interview: Not to say the interview itself was bad, but the circumstances before and after it were less than ideal! So this job had 3 parts: After applying with your cover letter and resume and waiting weeks for the job posting to close (1), you participate in a screening call and wait a few more weeks to see if you make it to the next stage (2), and then were given an assignment to present during the final portion in an interview with the program director (3) and then wait some more. After passing the screening, I put a lot of effort into the interview assignment I was given, which was creating a powerpoint on how I could fix a sample problem (yes, an interview assignment, but I'm thinking they used that to screen out serious candidates). I was maybe 2 days out until my interview and I did it. I dropped my laptop. I dropped my laptop with my presentation, my notes, and it was what I had been practicing on. It literally died that day and possibly part of me died with it lol. See WHY I stress the importance of autosaving places like Google drive / Onenote?! Luckily, I had been making my powerpoint on Google slides, so all hope was not lost, but it was definitely a scramble to rehearse it using a tablet, seeing if the tablet would launch your slides AND hold the interview call, all within 2 days. Honesty, hardwork, and hustle... ""Got the job""! Uh oh, that's in quotes... So you know what that means...
Shortest interview: Like you, I basically met my supervisor and manager in what was like a coffee break chat. But funny thing is, I had no idea it was an interview - I literally thought I was just introducing myself and networking. Imagine my surprise to get a call from HR, saying I got the job? LOL. Not in quotes, because I accepted the offer!
Funniest interview: Basically at the start of the pandemic, so everyone is still transitioning from in-person to virtual everything, including my co-op interview. My dad went into the kitchen (which is by the table I was interviewing at)... And whispered, offering if I wanted some soup after my interview. I can't stop grinning remembering. ""Mentor... Do you want some soup? I'm going to cook some soup..."" Me whispering back: 😃 ""Not right now..."". My interviewers laughed about it and it opened up a conversation on how we're all adjusting to the pandemic, how many of us were wearing pajama pants on the bottom but business wear on top, etc. It was so funny! And yes, I got the job. When I asked for feedback on why I was chosen, the manager told me that while I may not have been the strongest technical candidate, she appreciated my personality, and that was what she was hiring for her team. She said that while you can train people up to fit your team skill-wise, you can't train people to fit your team team-wise!
I don't repeat the things I tell you just because they're important, but because I've experienced them myself! So I hope you were able to see something from these rollercoaster rides of interview stories! But don't let this handful of successful interviews fool you, I've definitely not gotten the job after the interview, and even more so, not even been able to land the interview. But throughout it all, I stuck to my 3: Honesty, personality, and performance! You'll have your own interviews to share with me one day, and I can't wait to read them with you! Cheers!

Ahhhh hello!
 
I feel so bad for not sending anything for OVER A MONTH!? but I was dealing with moving back home from university and starting work and my days are very long (8hs at work with 2-2.5hs commuting each way)  so, I basically get home, eat dinner, shower, and go to bed. 
I've really been enjoying working in the lab at UBC and I have some downtime today so I thought I'd reply to your message... from April.
I appreciate the resume tips and I will remember to add them when I'm adding this summer's experience to my resume. I've been keeping a list of everything I'm doing and learning because if someone asks me, I will forget. 
On the topic of technology, I've got to say my Microsoft Excel skills are improving via this job. I've done a bit of Mass Spectrometry data analysis and learned some basic, but helpful Excel hacks.
Onto the second anchor text question:
If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better? 
I don't think I've had a legitimate job interview yet. For the job at the grocery store (my first job) they basically were like ""are you okay working somewhere that's cold? how are you with lifting heavy stuff?"" and then they asked me if I could memorize the produce codes (which I never did), and what my availability was. 
For this job, I basically had the job by the interview, and it was just a chance to meet the person I'm now working with. 
Nobody's asked me what my greatest weakness is, to describe myself, or any of the other basic interview questions.
I know I'm told to ask this question but I feel like it could be interesting, do you have a memorable interview story? I feel like a lot can happen in an interview, especially those group interviews.
Anyways, how's life going? It's been a while!

Hi Mentee,
You mean to say... You actually learned skills applicable in real life aside from the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell????? But it's the ""personal info they said to remove"" on your resume for me 😂. Thank you for keeping us safe in the ReMBC space! But HOLY ACHIEVEMENTS, BATMAN. That's my mentee right there 🥹! If I could suggest improvements to your very aesthetic resume:
Just a minor tweak in adding periods to your UNBC extra curriculars, just for consistency across all your sections. 
You can just say ""Collaborates"" rather than ""Can collaborate"" under Team Play(er?)
My co-op advisors taught us to use past tense for jobs you've done in the past and present tense for those you're currently doing, so I'm looking at your Girl Guides and customer service parts.
It might be just the way the link converted your resume, but some of the -'s at the end where your achievements are listed had some -'s looking longer than the other (e.g. October 2022 vs June 2021)!
What's the difference between using | vs - in your achievements section (i.e. April 2022)?
And honestly, good for you! You don't need brand name gym clothes to get the same pump in. 💪 Literally wore my ""free t-shirt when you sign up for a gym membership"" when I went yesterday 😆. Also started journalling recently, so we in that mental and physical self-care era 💖.
Alright, let's talk the first page of our Discussion Questions for this week's message!
Communication
Being bilingual is so cool (speaking as a bilingual baddie myself LOL), but also very useful. With your French immersion, besides being able to apply for jobs that require French fluency (e.g. government jobs), did you know there are also schools/programs that have French specific streams? For example, the University of Ottawa has both an English and French stream for their medical school. Although I'm not certain if their requirements are different between languages, I would imagine less applicants due to teaching in a fully French curriculum.
Additionally, your time in Girl Guides means you're experienced with speaking in groups, specifically youth (""engaging younger Guiding Members"") and public speaking (bronze award at the Science Fair / debates in model UN club ).
Responsibility or Dependability
As you've been a senior Girl Guide, you've been responsible in helping guide your more novice members. I'm sure you could also speak to your dependability being in your clubs, whether it be planning and succeeding in your fundraisers, how you progress and meet project deliverables, and of course, being timely like you said!
Quick Learner
This one is a bit harder to describe on a resume, more so they'll have to see it in action! But something that came to mind as I thought more on it... I've been told I'm a quick learner as well, but what's impressed my managers up to now was my habit of creating How-To like documents that enable others to learn quicker as well. Which is a great lead up to...
Team Work
24 HOUR HAND IN? The way some people would highkey fail if that was standard across all classes 🥲. But YOU'RE ONE OF THE SAVIOURS WHO START GROUP CHATS🙌! BLESS YOU LOL! I owe my 4th year sanity to whoever started my cohort's discord channel where we could just talk and help each other during the height of the pandemic. But that is a great example to speak to if team work is brought up! You're able to take lead in a group in-person and remotely, encouraging engagement among your peers.
Technology
Oh man, Mentee. Believe me when I say that older generations will find your skills cool! Even for me, I'll find myself pointing out some Office shortcuts you would just do automatically, but there's a lot of appreciation for even those little things! And of course, it's not just that awesome feeling of helping someone, but also being able to learn from each other. Something I keep in mind is to keep an open mind - What can you teach someone and what can you learn from them? And overall, if you're bettering yourself, that has a compounding effect in bettering the world, and bettering humanity. :)
Let's talk about the 2nd anchor text when we're ready! I hope your exam went well!!!

I'M ALIVE
this semester is trying to kill me but I'm surviving, I have one final left on Monday and then we're good! This is going to be a quick reply.
I didn't catch Alphalete's birthday sale, I'll be honest I had to google the company. My gym clothes are just random pieces I've picked up on sale from a variety of places. 
I emailed the people at UBC to see if there's anything I need to know ahead of time and though I do have a bit of googling to do it sounds really interesting and I'm looking forward to it!
I feel like writing resumes was the one actual life thing they taught us in high school. So they've been making us write them since like 7th grade. Therefore, nothing in the article was new information to me. 
Ok here are some of my amazing skills
• Communication
I can communicate in more than one language which is an asset. 
• Responsibility or Dependability
I am rarely ever late, on time is late for me and if I am running late for some reason I'll send a text or something. Also, as written in my resume under ""responsible"" I excel at managing myself and others.
• Quick Learner
University. Also, at my last job in the grocery store, they would tell you something once and you were expected to just understand and do it perfectly (unreasonable? yes). I got pretty good at expecting what was expected of me and it got me on my manager's good side real quick once I learned to predict how she would want things and to in general just learn stuff quickly.
• Team Work
Again from my resume, I can collaborate well with others and works well individually when needed. A real-life example is labs. My bio lab this semester was brutal (did I mention the 24-hour hand-in period for lab reports, well 21 because you lost 3 hours being in the lab) but our class had a group chat where people would help each other and even in class we would all help each other out with concepts we understood well. (I was the one who started the group chat and let's just say it saved grades). In general, I've gotten good at trying to include people in stuff and seeing people as teammates and not as competition.
• Technology
I can code which is cool, I'm good with other programs like Office and Canva and all that which to me doesn't seem cool but I guess for adults who haven't grown up with the stuff it's a real skill. I am good with Excel too, I put all my assignments and exams into one colour-coded document organized by the due date. It scares people to see that we have/had over 130 things due over 12 weeks but it helps me stay organized. 
 
I'm not about to find a job I can apply for but I'll send the resume I sent for the UBC gig. https://gounbc-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/smid_unbc_ca/EdE4mt1FDMNDiAxl3KsJoewBbQxp8u2nnTxcH4w8_fjg_w?e=0yteoW 
let me know if the link works or not.

Hi Mentee,
I chose to open this conversation as you'll be interning this Summer for a Masters student at UBC. While you get that experience, exposure, and learn from this opportunity, it's always important to keep your resume up-to-date with the skills you're acquiring! I know this is much ahead of its time, but as you build your skills, building your network is also just as valuable. A prime example was how you networked with the UBC professor from your Science Fair (award winning!) presentation, which helped open these doors. I like to believe it was meant for you, but you still worked very hard for this! Anyways, before I go on my usual tangent of how proud of a mentor I am for you... LOL. 😂  Perhaps you'll find someone who can be comfortable speaking as your reference, especially as you consider future Summers where you may very well lead your own research project! Perhaps you'll find your future PI/supervisor, maybe you'll get inspired for your future! Some of my best references (and some I still use to this day!) have come from my co-op supervisors. Co-ops, being paid work-studies for about 2-6 months are basically internships - The same amount of time you'll likely be working for the Summer, you may foster some very strong, meaningful connections! Keep them close, and value them accordingly. :)

Hi Mentee,
OMG, that shouldn't even count as a Reading Week!! Girl needs a do-over LOL. You know what I don't miss? When professors would either assign something right after reading break or the absolute carnage that was the lead up to reading break where it was just exams on projects on presentations on due labs. As crazy as it sounds, I actually preferred the latter so I didn't have the anxiety that something was about to smack me in the grades when I came back lol. IT SNOWED HERE TOO! Like... 🛑 stop it, go back into the clouds or something 😭. It made the ground so icy, I was waddling to and from my car 🐧. A quick Google search says that:
Spring 2023 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on
Monday, March 20 2023
Will that actually happen? We'll have this chat to look back on to see if Google was right. 
I'm not a gym rat by any means LOL, but did you catch Alphalete's birthday sale a few weeks ago? I'm definitely a believer in that you don't need name brand items to execute the same thing, but hey, I was ordering joggers for my friend anyway and thought to pick a few things out for myself. Hopefully they arrive soon so I can give us a cheeky review like a YouTuber HAHA.
I'm going to go ahead and close this conversation and pick our next one. :) I do have to say though, your answers to these were just mindblowing. I know you're mature for your age, but you speak with such clarity and maturity! Just beyond your years! Makes me excited for when you'll write your first research publication, because I know it's going to be written with honesty, passion, and super smartly of course! 🤓

Hello,
ugh, reading break is almost over and I need another week off! It's been between -20°C and -30°C here this week, with lots of snow and lots of wint. Walking back to my dorm after the gym this morning was more challenging than my 1.5 hours of workout. And my plan to catch up on sleep was interrupted many nights in a row by the people downstairs partying (I called the RA on them at 1:30 am) and the fire alarms going off at 12:00 am the following night (walking outside in -30°C weather after just getting out of bed is not fun).
Sorry to hear that you're sick and happy belated family day to you!
I liked your responses to the questions. It's good that fencing is turning out so well and as someone who goes to the gym 5-6 days a week for 1.5-2 hours at a time, I'm happy to hear you're doing that too!
What should we move on to next?

Hi Mentee,
The last few weeks on my side of the province have been absolutely bonkers as well, so I'm sorry for the delay too (but we've been  together for so long that I feel like we just know that when the other goes MIA, it's never intentional! 🥺) I'm actually typing this from bed because I got sick as the 🍒 on top of it all, but I thought... Oh my gosh? I'm actually in one spot long enough that I can do my mentorship? I'll take it! LOL. And since it's family day, I'd like to wish you and yours a Happy Family Day and superb long weekend! ☀️ 
Mentee!!! That internship is amazing news, I'm so happy it worked out for you! Sure the commute isn't pretty, but what an incredible opportunity to get firsthand experience! You get to have a behind the scenes look as to what being a STEM grad student entails, what it involves to write a thesis, finding and working with a professor/PI, etc. And yes, a great chance for you to catch up on some reading. :) I've been going to the gym more frequently and use my cardio time as an opportunity to listen to philosophy videos (currently into Stoicism right now!). While you can use that time to study for sure, I think squeezing in some time to study your interests will help with that balance of not having to constantly be on 100% of the time.
Thank you for that tidbit on left-handedness! There aren't any lessons tonight because of the holiday, but I will say that there is a left-handed fencer in my session who uses a left specific foil (blade). Since our last message, we've gone all the way up to being on the piste. So that means we're now connected to the scoring machine via retracting cables, wearing electrified lames that trigger the scoring when poked by the foil, and fencing against each other. I'm sure you've heard of the term, ""En garde""? Yup. En garde, pret?, allez! is how we start our matches (I'm too lazy to find the accents on my keyboard right now forgive me LOL)! It's definitely a workout, and with such a welcoming community, I'd encourage you to give it a try if you get the opportunity! Or as the weather gets better, maybe there's an outdoor sport that you're interested in giving a try? I'm lowkey eyeing tennis, volleyball, or a martial art after this... 🤺🎾🏐🥋.
 Let's try the Self Care Action Plan together!
Self-Care Action: Go to sleep at a more consistent time 
How I will make it a part of my life: I've been telling myself to get to the gym earlier, so I can come home earlier, thus sleep earlier. However, if I get to the gym later, I compensate by staying later, since I want to get my workout fully in. I will try sticking to a certain arrival/leave time this week, so that my weekend mornings aren't just me catching up on zzz's that I lost.
Self-Care Action: Balancing hobby time 
How I will make it a part of my life: I've been baking a lot recently, which although I enjoy, I go to bed realizing I didn't get to pick up where I left off in my book again or that I wish I saved time for this or that. This leaves conflicting emotions that I'm ""procrastinating"" or having to pick and choose between two hobbies that make me happy, which ultimately takes away from the joy of the hobby. Thus, I think I can slow down with baking every evening, or start reading as my goodies bake in the oven? :) 
Self-Care Action: Organizing/Cleaning my room 
How I will make it a part of my life: Likewise with you, I would generally classify myself as organized, but maybe it doesn't look like that all that time LOL. I want to find the time to regularly clean my room so that it brings peace/is a space for relaxation instead of looking like chaos. 😅 My plan for now is to stick with a schedule that helps keep things controlled, so laundry regularly so it doesn't pile up, putting things away once done with them, etc. Hope to get a better system in place soon too. :)) 
Mentor Q's:
How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have?
I think everyone learns about self-care in their own way, as you mentioned, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. How I prioritize self-care is by understanding what works for me to help me feel good, not for the sake of outwardly looking good, but also internally feeling good. For example, skin care. While I don't have a 7-step skin routine, I'm comfortable with the time and effort it takes to do what skin care I do use, and the results? Outwardly, yes, it's nice to maintain one's complexion. But internally, it's even better knowing that I can take care of myself and I can see the differences. Tips I would give would be to try and find what works best for you, your schedule, your circumstance, etc. Not everyone can spare 30 minutes in the morning to journal, but if you find it helps, how about 5 lines of a journal prompt? Or if you want to get into fitness but it's too physically demanding, how about a low-impact exercise routine? And what works for your self-care routine now may not necessarily be applicable in the future, and that's okay. It can be easy to fall into the hole of depriving yourself from self-care, but starting small and building the habits up so they aren't ""treats"" but actual practices is important for living well. 
Can they share any time management tips?
If possible, ""eat the frog"" aka get the hardest thing done out of the way. But I find starting with a routine with room for flexibility can help. Say you plan to get XYZ done within 2 hours, but then you find Z is taking you much longer than expected. There's no need to stress if your schedule can be flexible and accommodate for that. What will be important is prioritizing what does need to be done today, tomorrow, some day (kind of like the Moscow method). 
How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult?
""Survive and then thrive"". Brilliantly put. Being out of school and now working, I would say my stress was just shifted into a different direction in my life. How self-care plays a part in this is through mindfulness. Self-care would be taking a nap after studying for hours straight. Now, it's valuing work-life balance and seeing the sun/breathing fresh air during lunch breaks. It's not always as elaborate as getting a massage, treating yourself to something nice, booking a vacation. Yes, self-care does encompass these things, but the simple things can be just as healing.
What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and post- secondary student?
It's important to find an employer who values you and work-life balance as much as, if not more than you, when you enter adulthood. My team mates will ping me on Microsoft Teams or email me, reminding me that there's always tomorrow to get things done and to log off. We are also encouraged to take our vacation days to rest and prevent burn out. It's funny, but also a kind gesture. However, at the end of the day, we have to be responsible for ourselves and know when to just put things down and come back at it tomorrow with a fresh mind and pair of eyes. And when things are getting tough, knowing when to book those days off for yourself. I find self-care can be more regular as an adult, as your work schedule can be stable/expected (job dependent). So you know when the best time to schedule a massage, or go for brunch with your friends, or go to the gym is. 
Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.)
I had to laugh out loud at your answer because last month, I literally shocked my body into going to the gym 1-1.5hrs everyday. Would I recommend it? Probably not. But did it work for me? Very much so. LOL. But again, it's all about what works for you and routines work for me! 😆 There's a quote: ""The best time to start something was yesterday, the next best time is now."" Hitting rock bottom and having to face yourself with ""I don't want to live like this anymore"" is difficult, so forming good habits to counter the bad ones will help to prevent spiraling to that point. I love your analogy about jumping over a bar without practice, because that's exactly it! We don't have to start big, we can start with what we can, and building this to regularity and consistency until it fits what we need it to in our lives. We should also practice forgiveness and extend this to ourselves like we do to others. We shouldn't condemn ourselves and backtrack on our progress. We now know better, so we can do better. What's important is our courage to keep going.
Wishing you great health and let's blossom like the flowers in March!

Hello,
These past couple of weeks have been super hectic (hence the delayed reply).
First, the joke with the flowers was so funny, I showed it to my roommates the moment I read it and they enjoyed it too.
About the UBC thing, looks like I'm going to be interning at UBC this summer! The person I knew put me in contact with a graduate student working on finishing her thesis so I'll be helping her with some of the daily tasks. Am I looking forwards to the two-hour transit commute every day? not really but it will be a good time to catch up on reading I guess?
Fencing has always seemed so cool to me, my school has a fencing club that I understand to be quite popular. Have you had any more lessons? I'm left-handed and I've heard I have an advantage in most combative sports because people will typically train against right-handed people and won't expect hits from left hands to be as strong. I read once that the fact that most of our population has been right-handed for an extended period without fluctuations in left and right dominance could be an example of how humans can survive without hand-to-hand combat. Because left-handed people have the advantage of surprise so they would beat all the right-handed people, and the population would become predominantly right-handed and keep flowing between the two sides. This theory is of course dependent on genetics being the main way handedness is determined. They do say that left-handed people are more likely to die earlier and get injured in more accidents. This is a valid point because it is definitely a right-handed world out there. Let's just say whoever created left-handed scissors deserves an award.
I don't think we've done the self-care action plan so we can move on that. This is something I've been somewhat working on in counselling because I'm not really one to relax. She told me today that at younger ages we're not really designed to be able to sit and relax for long periods and trying to get yourself to sit still and be calm can be like trying to get a puppy to calmly lay next you. Once our metabolism starts to slow down (typically later in life) it becomes easier to be calm and relaxed. 
Self-care action: taking time to unwind before bed 
How will I make it part of my life: I've been trying to get better at relaxing and unwinding for a while. My counsellor suggested I try using other parts of my brain that aren't focused on logic and processing information, she suggested I listen to more instrumental music while doing something mindless with little-to-no structure. 
Self-care action: Keep my room more organized 
How will I make it part of my life: Idk because I'm an organized person but when I get supper busy it's easy for things to pile up. But it doesn't make me happy to have my binders spread out all over my desk so I need to think of a new system.
Self-care action: moving in gentler ways. 
How will I make it part of my life: I spend a lot of time at the gym lifting weights, running, and biking. All that stuff is great but it can be demanding physically to constantly be putting myself through that physical stress. Therefore, I want to incorporate more gentle movements such as yoga and stretching into my routine to help myself recover. 
I'm going to answer the mentor questions too because why not?
How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have? 
You need to work on understanding yourself, your routine, and your habits before you can go and change them. Working to understand what makes you feel good and what doesn't can help determine where you need to make changes. Nothing is one size fits all and though stuff like going to the gym, reading, meditating, and journalling has been helpful that may not be the case for everyone. I am a firm believer that self-care encompasses more than the mainstream idea of self-care (bubble baths, candles, face masks), though those are great they don't fulfill your baseline needs. Making sure you're eating nutritious food that also makes you feel good is self-care, moving your body is self-care, allowing yourself to feel things (this is where I slip up) is self-care, and being able to remove yourself from bad situations is self-care.
Can they share any time management tips? 
The concept of a mandatory minimum (Knowing what's the minimum amount of time you need to do a task and making sure you designate that time to it.) This can include tasks like doing laundry, completing assignments, and whatever else might be needing to be completed. It makes it easier to schedule your time.
How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult? 
It's become less fancy. Self-care is about making sure I'm able to first survive and then thrive. ​​​​​​​ 
What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and postsecondary student? 
Less time to actually take care of yourself.
Having set tasks you do regularly and making taking care of yourself part of your routine.​​​​​​​ 
Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) 
We usually do such habits because they're easy. You need to make it easy and enjoyable to do good things. For instance, watching TikToks late into the night is probably revenge bedtime procrastinating, making going to bed an enjoyable experience. Listen to music or podcasts (I like Sawbones it is about medical history). Also having snacks that are easily accessible that are nutritious. It's also good to lower the bar. Imagine trying to jump over a 5ft bar with no practice. It would be almost impossible, you'd get discouraged and give up. What about stepping over a 0.5ft bar? Seems doable. Habits are the same way. Let's say you want to start going to the gym. Going for 1.5 hours 5 days a week is intimidating. But going for 30 minutes every Sunday? That's doable. Once you get the basic habit down to a routine you can add more to it. Spend more time doing your habit, make it more complicated, etc...
Also, it's okay to slip up. Missing a week at the gym, eating fast food, whatever it may be. Life is more than your habits and routine, being able to pick yourself up and continue where you left off (or near that point) even after you haven't done something for a while is how you build sustainable habits and routines.

Hi Mentee,
""Imagine not being able to photosynthesize"" LOL it's giving... 
🌺: U hungry
🌸: I could use a light snack
Good luck on contacting the department head at UBC that you met during your science fair! 🍀 While I'm hoping for the best with that contact, as you apply for opportunites with other PI's, remember to keep your a CV/Resume up to date, have a copy of your transcript, and know your reasons as to why you want to research and research ideas you may have swirling in that bright mind of yours! And I respect the hustle - As valuable as experience is, you should get compensated for your work, and thankfully, I think most professors are aware that students need money to live lol. Also a reason to keep your resume up to date so you can just fire them off to where you want to apply and just customize the cover letter or get reference letters, etc.
I did end up signing up for fencing and took my first lesson last Monday! 🤺 The stance you take is something between standing and squatting, where you form a right angle with your feet, depending on your dominant hand. Are you right or left-handed? They say that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed fencers. I think I've heard something similar with tennis players?
Good gravy... 5 courses (8 including labs). But you know what? When you pursue professional studies in the future, being able to demonstrate the ability to balance full work load with high grades will look so favorable. 💪 Keep special attention to maintain your standard of excellence! I believe UVic Masters programs look at your 3rd/4th year grades, but thinking long-term, what if you pursue a Masters at UBC? Out of province? Out of country, even? I guess your best bet is to just continue killing it from first to final year and keep your mind open to all the opportunities ahead! Also keeping in mind possible programs that you don't actually need to complete your degree for (e.g. Certain medicine, pharmacy programs you can apply to in your 3rd year going into 4th!)✨
Bro, here I am, having seen exactly 0 moose and you and your roommate ran into 3 of them. I'M GLAD Y'ALL SAFE THO? BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE MASSIVE??? Although your semesters are full, so are your memories :) It really warms my heart to hear how you and your roommates / friends are doing, and although I've always regarded you as mature, I feel like I'm reading about you growing up! 🥹 Not me getting sentimental during mentorship for the millionth time, but I digress... LOL. 
Anything else about self care we care to explore as we continue to look into student research/employment opportunities for you?

Hello,
Thank you for sending over some job opportunities! Today I'm hoping to email the person from the science fair I did at UBC who said some opportunities might be available. If I don't get a reply by next week I'll start sending out other applications. I want paid work this summer because life is expensive and I don't want to work for free for 4 months. 
Good deals on groceries aren't a weird flex rn. Prices are insane and I cringe every time I go into a grocery store. 
Congrats on 6 months at your job! That's honestly a pretty big deal. Fencing seems so cool! I did ballet as a kid and it wasn't my favourite thing but I still remember the teacher telling us to make pizza slices with our feet for the first position and telling us to open and close the blind when doing plies. 
My life is going. I have an even heavier course load this semester. I have Functional Anatomy (with a lab), Biology (with a lab), Chemistry (with a lab), Health Care Systems, and English. Basically, eight courses because labs are so much work. I'm currently cringing about my 6:30 pm - 9:30 pm bio lab tonight. 😬
My roommate and I went for a walk this past weekend and ran into three mooses. We didn't stay long to say hello, because that's dangerous but it was quite an experience. We also learned that bathroom mirrors and windows go great with whiteboard markers. So our bathroom mirrors have motivational messages and science jokes on them with some gems including ""Imagine not being able to photosynthesize"" and drawings of the AmongUs characters. Our living room window has a bunch of cyclohexane and benzene on it from the organic chem we were doing last night as well as to-do lists. University life is definitely an experience.

Hi Mentee,
NOT ME REPLYING ON THE DIS- AND MIS-INFORMATION CONVO TOO LOL. I was looking for the questions you were answering like... Why am I still looking at misinformation for the 2nd month in a row? Okay, let's do this properly, shall we? I'll try the warm-up question with you because why not x2? :) 
Think about the circumstances or situations when you're most and least healthy. Physically? Mentally?
Most healthy - I think you're right that it's not selfish per se, but self-focused? I was a pandemic graduate and now I work from home, so my version of health involves going outside, getting fresh air, and interracting with people outside of a computer screen. I really value maintaining my relationships, and doing things that mean something to me, like building a life I'm proud of.
Least healthy - Similar to you, when I'm super busy and stressed, I tend to let go of things I can ""catch up on"" later. For example, I'll sometimes bring my lunch to my desk so I can keep working instead of taking my lunch outside and reading a book. Luckily work-life balance is very emphasized now a days, and it's encouraged for us to take our breaks, not just because we're entitled to them, but because we need them to maintain a healthy balance.
LOL @ ""I'm already sad"" and continue with their lives. It's giving... Doctor: Have you tried exercising to help with your depression? And the jump rope with your own tears meme.
Create a list of your own ‘warning signs’ that you might be in need of some self care. (Eg: low energy/mood/creativity, often tired, procrastination, irritable, etc).
I can tell it's time for a little TLC when I procrastinate things that I know will make me happy, I stay up way too late (which snowballs throughout the week), sleeping in too much, forgetting to eat, low mood, and just knowing that it's been a while since I took care of myself.
Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy. What lifts your mood or brings you joy? (Eg: making art, reading, spending time in nature or with friends, etc).*
Self-improvement / growth! Over the last few months, this has meant driving more, but I'm hoping to start going to the gym again to get my body moving (as I work a very, very sedentary role). I love eating delicious food with my friends and family. Doing my skin-care routine. I also like listening to podcasts and videos, especially the types that move me in the direction I want to go in life. I've also heard of ""finding a vacation in everyday"", which has helped me reframe how to enjoy the little things, like grocery shopping and finding a good deal (which like... weird flex, but I found cucumbers on sale for $2 each and bought like FIVE LOL 🥒 ). 
Mentor Q time!
Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re
feeling low, or not like themselves?
Totally agree with the first step being acknowledging that you're in a funk! I think I have the same answer as you. :) Go back to things that ground you as a person, and give it another go. Before bed, I always tell myself that ""Tomorrow is another chance for a better day"".
How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources?
During post-secondary school, self-validation was important to me. You invest so much of your time and energy into your education, and sometimes the best person to go to when you need support is you. And it never hurts to have things to look forward to, whether that be a hangout with friends after class, or the samosa you packed for a snack later.
As an adult, my schedule is much more predictable, so I can make more time for myself. While self-validation is still important, I like to find effective ways to ""rest"". For example, if work is getting too much, I'll take a quick minute to play a song on the piano to help myself relax and glide across another type of keyboard haha. I believe clinical psychologists or other mental health professional services are covered under benefits (will need to check that), so that could also be an avenue to explore.
What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult?
I'm again reminded why we were a match made in e-mentoring heaven, because same. Whenever I go through periods of mental hardship, I think back to when I experienced significant loss. Nothing truly compares to that distress, especially living through it and going through the aftermath. I literally thought this a few days ago too, ""If I can survive that, I can survive this"". 
But typical challenges that one should expect upon entering post-secondary / adulthood can be: Peer pressure, societal pressure, pressure to succeed, making ends meet, creating and maintaining relationships, making time for oneself, failing (especially when others are impacted by your decisions), what's to come next in terms of career
Mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult: Dependable schedule you can choose (students choose their courses and adults choose a job with hours that work for them), maturity is hopefully easier to come across in people, having time to build a life outside of being an adult
What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health?
Whoa, you covered all the bases and then some LOL. I'm not sure what else I could add to your A+ answer... But I guess mindfulness? Like how you said mindset can make you or break you, it's all about perspective. Anxiety can be a challenge, but socializing however you're comfortable, and moving around to get your endorphins released. Doing things that contribute to your life but don't dig you in a deeper hole, like how scrolling on social media for hours is such an addicting time sink, that you sometimes feel worse because of how much time you spent on your phone looking at mindless things. 
Work situation: The end of this month marks my 6 months in this role! I still think back to the bridge I burned having to make this decision, but I come to peace with it everyday, knowing I made the best choice for myself. I don't regret it. I hope you never have to be between a rock and a hardplace like that was for me, but there will come times in life where you just have to make a choice and accept the consequences of that. Improving your decision-making is a life-long skill.
Life wise: Because I'm closing in on 6 months, I'm feeling comfortable to start exploring new hobbies outside of work hours. As you know, I do mentorship, but I was thinking of also volunteering at our local homeless shelter. Recreation wise, I've been getting ads for introductory fencing and ballet, so... Catch me having crazy footwork in the coming months once I look into them more! 🤺 🩰

Hello again, 
I just realized that I sent my last message in the Dis and Misinformation channel so that's fun.
Alright, I'm going to answer the warm-up questions because why not?
Think about the circumstances or situations when you're most and least healthy. Physically? Mentally? 
I'd say I'm least healthy when I'm super busy and stressed. I tend to let smaller (though still important) things go when life gets super busy. So I might take a break from doing yoga, meditating, etc... stuff that helps keep me healthy and sane
I'd say I'm most healthy when I'm on my own. At times what it takes to be at my best is more on the selfish side (though I don't think selfish really works here). But me going to the gym, taking time to do things for me, and even eating healthier meals, can be slightly annoying for those around me. For instance, I'm happy with each quinoa grain bowls, but my father is not. So it's challenging to have a meal with both want that is healthy sometimes.
Onto the article. I like that getting enough sleep and eating well are considered basics. ""focus on the positive"" isn't always helpful as toxic positivity is a thing, but I get the point.
The “If you smoke marijuana all the time, you will be sad."" line made me chuckle. I don't smoke anything, but I would love to see a poster that says that around my uni. People would probably just say ""I'm already sad"" and continue on with their lives. 
Create a list of your own ‘warning signs that you might be in need of some self-care.  
Procrastinating, going to bed later (revenge bedtime procrastination), not picking my clothes up off my bedroom floor, wanting to scroll on my phone.
Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy. 
​​​​​​​Going to the gym, reading, food, learning stuff.
Like last time I'm going to answer the mentor questions.
• Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves?
Assess where you're at and start fresh. You need to realize you're in a funk to get out of a funk. Figure out what's causing you're funk -> take a break -> try to get rid of the cause -> start fresh.
• How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources?
Having people around who can help you take breaks is helpful also working to understand when you need to take a break. Sometimes I'll be so done that I'll knock on my roommates' doors and see if they want to do something. 
I started going to counselling once a month, it's free so why not? 
The basic things you can do for your mental health in any situation are good, but it's good to only have a few things you do regularly. For instance, I go to the gym a lot, I do weights and run. When I'm stressed I've learned to go for a run. There is a logical thought process to going for a run (or doing cardio) when stressed because stress triggers the fight or flight response which releases hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. The thing is, 1000 years ago, humans didn't exactly need to deal with finals but they were probably running from something or each other. For me, running is an easy and effective way to give the fight or flight response what it wants. 
• What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult?
I mean it depends on your life. I'm at a point where my mindset is the troubles school causes me is no match for what I've been through (mostly with my mom dying). Basically, there is nothing school can throw at me that is worse than what I've already been through and if I was able to get through that I can get through this.
Challenges to expect, failing, being afraid to fail, coming close to failing, social issues, relationships, and money problems.
Mental benefits to being a Uni student, free therapy, lots of people having good friends too, and living away from home can be good for a lot of people.
• What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health?
keep yourself functioning (eat, sleep, exercise), aka do even when you can't do much do the bare minimum
building up endurance and skills when you're in a good place can help you get out of a bad place. For instance, meditation has short-term and long-term effects. Just because you may not need to have these practices or skills in place in the moment they can really help you in the future.
mindset can make or break you
sometimes if you have low energy, depression, or are really stressed even everyday tasks like showering, eating, or doing your homework can be really challenging but anything is better than nothing. If you don't have the energy to shower can you wash your face? If you can't make yourself a meal do you have a granola bar or some cereal in the cupboard you can have? even better what about an apple (you don't even need to cut it up)? This is where planning ahead can be helpful because you can make sure you have okay food on hand that's accessible. Don't think you can write a research paper? Can you at least set it up? Maybe make a graph?
So what's up with you? How is the work situation?

Hi Mentee,
Just realized this definitely belonged in the Dis and Misinformation Conversation, but since I already closed that... 😅 imma put it here: When I was browsing social media, I came across an article about Canada minting a new black toonie in remembrance of the late Queen (now Googling it, I also see it on an article as the 'Goth Toonie'... Like who is calling it that?? LOL). Though I didn't click into the article itself, I hit share to DM it to a friend... When suddenly, a text box pops up like ""You're about to share this article without opening it. Sharing articles without reading them may mean missing key facts."" with the options to open the article or continue sharing. I thought that was an interesting measure added to prevent the spread of dis and mis information! I'm not sure if it was always this way, but I can see the intention to get users to stop for a second and think about the news they're consuming.
SO, I totally know it's finals season right now and right after that, you're headed into your winter break until the new year and NEW SEMESTER OMG. When you get back to this message, how did your finals go? How does it feel to be officially done your first sem of uni?! Any plans for your winter break? Look at you go, superstar! ✨💪 Couldn't be more proud of you, my mentee! I know I'm forward-thinking here, but did you have any classes / profs that particularly stuck out to you this semester that you feel comfortable enough to reach out about possible research opportunities? I know you were hoping to get started on research as early as possible, and while I'm not sure the timelines of profs getting research grants (aka money so they can research and possibly hire students), it doesn't hurt to plan ahead. If not, there is also the option to possibly go into a co-op for the Summer sem if you're not taking any classes, which I'd totally be happy to help you with too!
I opened this Self Care Conversation next because finals + starting a new year and new semester + all the while snow is blasting and Mariah Carey is telling us all she wants for Christmas is us for the millionth time is a stressful time! I also went to the dentist the other day, and they were crazy busy and saying tis the season for people to be stressing (i.e. clenching their jaw, grinding their teeth) so take care of yourself and your teeth at this time! 🦷 Breathe, un-tense the shoulders, and relax the jaw. :) 
I'm off to go last minute Christmas shopping for the 4th time 🥲 but let's get started on this convo and our Summer semester thoughts and plans next message!

Hi Mentee,
Happy new year and welcome back to school + e-mentoring! 💖 Hearing about all of those flights that got stranded in YVR had me worrying if you arrived and came back home safely (which you did, thank goodness). A three hour delay is not cute, but I'm still glad you were able to make it home for Christmas! There was definitely something in the air during that time, and suddenly we were covered in a blanket of snow ❄️ And you know how the memes go, once it snows on the mainland/island, nobody knows what to do lol. I was supposed to go up-island for some site visits, but we turned all of those meetings online because driving up and down the Malahat was a no thank you. It's too bad your break was so hectic, but I bet seeing your friends and family healed you in a different way too! ✨ 
And no, it wasn't just you! Especially the days between Christmas and New Years... They were just... there. Like... What a weird time. But look, we made it to 2023 and we're going to keep making it!
You absolutely rocked first semester, and you took 7 courses, right?! I find that initial transition from high school to university can be quite steep if you're not prepared, because students tend to underestimate the demand and overestimate their capacity. But you finished it gr-ACE-fully (get it... bc you basically aced your semester??? ok I'll stop LOL). Once you establish your routines, study habits, etc., university can be quite straight-forward. Sure, you learn more and the expectations grow as you advance, but there shouldn't be any surprises if you prepare yourself well.
Not me going to UNBC's website to find out why you can't do co-op as a biomed major?! Like why is it on their website if they're just going to be like ""no"" 🫠. But like you said, we're going to make it work:
1. Something that came to mind was FSWEP under the Government of Canada, and doing some clicking on there, I also saw their Research Affiliate Program for students. Just to note though, I haven't gone through FSWEP or their Research Affiliate Program, but when I was at Service Canada, a lady recommended I check it out after hearing I was a university student AKA I don't know what it really offers either. I have worked in a Summer job that was funded by Canada Summer Jobs though, which I believe is a grant with the same requirements through the Government of Canada (i.e. Have to be a full-time post-secondary student, between a certain age range, etc).
2. Checking out your local health authoritities for opportunities you're eligible for and interested in, like a casual or temp position.
3. Literally Googling ""Summer student co-op"" or something along those lines! OMG. I GOOGLED ""BC HEALTH RESEARCH STUDENT"" AND CAME ACROSS THIS? https://www.bcchr.ca/ssrp I think this is totally up your alley! Please look into this and if you want me to double-look into it with you, I definitely will!
4. If I come up with anything else, I'll let you know! But I just wanted to add that it's not necessarily where you work, but how you'll be able to find meaningful connection and gain skills for your future. I didn't have a health oriented co-op 2 out of the 3 times I went on one, which definitely worried me coming from a health focused program. However, I was able to leverage the skills and networks that I developed, and still ended up working in the field that I studied. So keep an open mind for opportunities that are the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" type!
See you in my next message!

Hello and Happy New Year,
Okay, so I read your message during finals but forgot to reply. On the plus side, I'm back at UNBC from my winter break, I got back this morning. My flight back to Vancouver was an experience. My flight was delayed over 3 hours, and the rest of the flights after mine from Prince George's to Vancouver were cancelled for a few days. I was so lucky to catch the last flight to Vancouver that left before Christmas. For context, I went home on the 18th, which was when that lovely snowstorm hit Vancouver (and the lower mainland in general). I left Prince George when it was -25°C, clear blue sky and sunny, and I arrived in snowy damp Vancouver 😑. Also, my winter break was supper hectic, I had to catch up with friends and family and I only got one day where I didn't have to do anything or be somewhere. I feel like I need another break.
Also, was it just me or did Christmas and New Year just kinda happen? Like they were just normal weekdays for me 🤷‍♀️.
my finals went fairly well actually. My grades were good (mostly A's). I'm happy with my first semester and worried about this semester because I have an extra lab but I'll make it work.
My plan with research is to contact the department head at UBC who suggested I email him after the science fair I did. I'm going to email him this week and I'm hoping I can get in there or somewhere. For some reason, my school doesn't let you do co-op if you're major is BioMed, which mine is. Soooooo I can't do co-op which sucks but I'll make it work. But if you know of any opportunities for students, please let me know. I've been looking at a few places like the government of Canada, and the Health Sciences Association of BC (by looking into them I know they exist but not what they offer).
Thank you for reminding me to unclench my jaw btw 😬.

Hello,
On the topic of spreading information, I've noticed that everyone in science, whenever we say an uncertain fact we always say ""fact check me on that"" or ""I can't cite my sources to on that"". It's funny how quickly everyone has become so vigilant about where they get their information.
HOW IS IT BASICALLY DECEMBER???
I have finals next week. AHHHHHHH

Anyways, should we move on to another discussion?

Hi Mentee,
Oh my GOODNESS, look at that snow! ❄️ Thank you so much for sharing those pictures! You know, even with the snow covering most of your campus, I can tell from the infrastructure / architecture that it's so pretty! Something that I really admired about my old university was how nice the campus looked among the foliage and greenery, and I bet UNBC will look just as stunning once it becomes Spring time. (Ps. I love how when I Google image searched ""University of Northern British Columbia"", there was already snow-covered campus pics! I think that's part of Prince George's charm ✨). But you know what's not pretty? Being woken up by the fire alarms LOL. I'm sorry that happened to you twice. It's not even December yet, so I hope they don't wait until it gets even lower in temp or later in night to start doing it a third time 🙃 ... Pls tell me I'm not jinxing it rn. It snowed in Victoria once earlier this month, and you know everyone was losing their minds (including me l o l). 
*GASP*! You did NOT tell me you got into your uni's Model United Nations club executive team, but you just did! So congratulations! Reading that for the first time, I was thinking... 'Wasn't Mentee literally the president of that club in her high school?' AND THERE YA GO. What position are you, if you don't mind me asking? I hope with you now being older and in uni, you'll be able to have a wider reach with the work that you'll be able to do with MUN. 😄 Oh, you know what? I think UVic had something similar for volunteering to be a patient for med students! I'm glad you're giving it a shot and I hope it gives you more perspective on health and the healthcare field. Let me know what kinds of ""illnesses"" you've come down with if you're ever chosen for a case study. 🤪
Onto the questions with the fake news unicorn 🦄:
How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media?
I think as we age, there isn't as much of a need for external validation on the internet. When we were younger, those comments and likes were valuable... But now? It's all about that internal validation, baby! I'm also the same with you, I hardly share anything on social media, because... Frankly, I don't really care. LOL. 🤷‍♀️ I'm here for the memes!
Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation?
If I scroll past something that piques my interest, I will take the time to verify it myself. How many times have we passed by a headline of a famous celebrity passing away for what seems to be the third time? Misinformation can really draw you in, especially with ""click-baity"" photos and titles - I try to be aware that these are tactics for more views, shock factor, and may not necessarily contain the information they claim to have.
What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading or false information?
Seconding you on older adults. Facebook is not a reliable news outlet, I'm sorry! Lol. I'm sure they mean well, for example, they share an article about foods that help to de-stress. However, it'd be nice to recommend research articles/academic journals/reliable sources that can help support those claims.
How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student?
THE CORE COMPETENCIES STRIKE AGAIN LOL. Critical thinking is a valuable skill when browsing digital media, but also extemely valuble just in general, as you said. Being able to move forward without every step explained to the tee, ask ""deeper"" questions, and evaluate the task at hand is going to come in clutch no matter what.
Second set!
How prevalent is dis- and misinformation in their world, as an adult and post-secondary student?
As an ex-post-secondary student, very prevalent. As an adult, very prevalent. Dis-/Mis-information will always exist in our society, especially in a digital world where we will all eventually be ""online."" 
How does the importance of being able to identify dis- and misinformation differ between being an adult/post- secondary student and being a minor?
As a minor, there is probably more leniency due to lack of maturity and knowledge. At most, you probably lose social credibility among your peets. As a post-secondary student, there is risk of losing marks, like you said, because you can't just cite Wikipedia and call it a day. As an adult, I'm sure there are also risks, depending on how dis-/mis-information is a part of your life. I personally don't work in media, but I can imagine the PR nightmare if mishandled and it was your profession.
Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information?
I get very ""digestable"" news like everyone else, the internet. For fact-checking, I seek databases, academic articles, scientific journals, etc. Sometimes you'll even want to narrow it down to more current events, like news from within the last 5 years, to make sure it's up-to-date and what you're citing is that much more credible.
What are some habits they’ve built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation?
Avoid click-baity videos that look like ""NOT CLICKBAIT!!! (FOR REAL)"" because they are 1000% click-bait, save your time and brain cells. Try not to mindlessly scroll, because there will be some dis-/mis-information mixed in there that you may not even realize you're subsconsiously consumming (then later, you're thinking... Where did I see that from? Was it true?). Always fact-check, do your own research and if you're sus about it, take it with a grain of salt and see for yourself.
Your responses were great, don't worry! I can't believe it's almost December, and soon the new year...! Keep warm, keep healthy, and keep trying to be the best Mentee you can be!

Hello!
I'm back. University is busy. I'm doing less of a variety of stuff than I was in high school (fewer clubs, extracurriculars, no job) but I'm still busy. Have I told you I got onto the executive team of my uni's Model United Nations club? At our first meeting, they were like ""we need someone for this position"" and I went up after and was like ""I ran my club's school for this in high school so I can do this"" and the next thing you know here I am. Everyone there is surprised I'm in Health Sciences because MUN is not a very science club but I enjoy it so who cares. 
Another thing, I'm in my school's Health Sciences Student Association and I found out I can be a patient for the med students here. So I'm working on doing that. I guess all the med schools in BC have something like that where you can be a guinea pig for the med students. Seemed cool so I'll give it a shot. 
OMG, do you want to see the snow here!?
View from my dorm
View from the lab building 
The walk back to my dorm
The coldest it's been here was -29°C, which does not as cold as you'd think. What's great is people waited until it was -20°C to start setting off the fire alarms. In the other dorm building, one night they went off at 2:00 am because someone vaped into the hallway smoke detector and another night they went off at 3:00 am because the R.A's craft cupboard caught on fire and set off the sprinklers, flooding part of the first floor. The alarms in my building have gone off twice. Once was a drill but I was in class that same day at 7:00 pm because people had some cooking issues. 
 
Ok, onto the discussion
First, I would like to start by saying I love the unicorn. It's a good symbol of fake news. 
How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media?
Very little. I rarely share anything on social media. I don't post on my Instagram story and I post like one set of photos a year. My ""clicking"" on social media consists of scrolling through reels.
Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation?
University has made me so vigilant. I've gotten used to doubting stuff and checking sources. I'd like to think I am a careful consumer. 
What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading or false information?
With older adults, it's such a regular occurrence. My habit is to ask them where they got that information and did they fact-check it. People will fight you all the time when you call them out but the moment you pull out a research article that proves them wrong they shut up. 
How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student?
noooooo not the core competencies. Critical Thinking is great but writing a self-reflection on your ability to think critically is not great. Being able to think critically is important. Being able to question is important. I feel like no matter what you do being able to think critically is important.
The second set of questions:
How prevalent is dis- and misinformation in their world, as an adult and post-secondary student?
Very. 
How does the importance of being able to identify dis- and misinformation differ between being an adult/post-secondary student and being a minor?
you have more depending on your accuracy. If I spread misinformation in school I lose marks. 
Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information?
Credible news sources credited scientific journals. 
something I look for from news sources is if they release statements and corrections when they make mistakes. 
What are some habits they’ve built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation?
questioning everything, fact-checking. 
Ok, I need to go so I'm not sure how great my responses are but I need to go. Have a good week!

Hi Mentee,
""Cite your sources."" LOL. It makes you think that once you're getting up there in the 10s of references and they're taking 2+ pages of your paper, if the prof or TA are even checking that they match... (Spoiler alert: They do lol). I was hoping to pop-in to see how you were doing, and just like the sudden snow, all these midterms came falling down! Best of luck, you absolutely got this! I didn't even know bio papers were a thing, but there we have one. I'll be dropping in to reply to the anchor text + questions later too. :)

Hello,
I have more midterms next week and, I have a bio paper to write which is fun. 
I have heard about dis- & misinformation in ALL OF MY COURSES! ""don't read articles that aren't peer-reviewed (even then be careful)"", "" Always find the original source for news articles,"" and ""aim to only read stuff regarding First Nations peoples written by First Nations peoples"". It's funny because someone will tell me something, and I'll be like, ""cite your sources"".
Since I have so much to do at the moment, I will read the article and answer the questions later. 👍

Hi Mentee,
I've just opened the newest conversation pick, Dis- & Misinformation. Now as a post-secondary student, in what courses have you heard these terms and in what context?
Before I read the anchor texts above, I'll start off our discussion by saying that ""misinformation"" seems to be a word quite commonly thrown around nowadays. Haven't heard ""disinformation"" all too much though! When people are misinformed, or have misinformation, it can definitely lead down some rabbit holes and another popular word, getting ""cancelled"". That's why it's important to question your sources of information, question their credibility, and frankly, not believe everything you hear and see right off the bat (though I'm sure you already do that!). 
I think as information becomes more widly accessible and our generation grows more tech-savvy, this increases both the spread of true and false information... Like, sorry dad, but no... You didn't actually win a free iPhone or cruise from that spam website. LOL. 😂 But seeing my dad flip through the newspaper the other day did make me think, man, we're right in between the generations of people using paper and people using devices for their day to day news. When the next generations after us come, I wonder what they'll be using? 📱

Hi Mentee,
THOSE GRADES THO 🙌 ✨. Not gonna lie, I did crack a smile when I read the ""(once you round it)"" because that's when you know you're really thinking as a post-secondary student. LOL. So long as you get anything .6% and above, that's a round UP, baby! But for real, I knew the Thanksgiving week + week after would be swamped full of content, so I wanted to give you some time to do what you needed to do and take time to recover too. And as always, so happy to have you here on Mentor City!
Don't we just love reviewing content that looks 2000% testable and it's completely MIA from the exam itself? Like... I could've used that brain space and time for more things...🫠. Ah well, that's just the luck of the draw, right? I remember one time, our prof gave us a list of 10 questions that he would pick 7 of for our exam. I studied my answers for 8 of them. Guess who was surprised that the 2 questions she didn't study appeared on the exam? 🤡 Yeah. I probably played myself, but again, just the luck of the draw! Lol. But on the plus side, I bet those notes on the Krebs Cycle will be useful for the final exam!
I'll go ahead and close this conversation and open the next one you pointed out. See ya there!

Hello,
Last week was busy, I had 4 midterms so lots of studying! So midterms were a lot of fun, but I spent over 32 hours studying and doing assignments last week, which was fun. (When you add that with how much time I spent in class that's over 40h of school) On the very positive side, I got 82% on my bio midterm (an A) which put me in the top 9% of the class. I got 80% on my chem midterm (once you round it) and I got As and Bs on everything else. So the hours of studying were worth it. 
What's great is I (and everyone else) spent so much time working on learning the citric acid cycle and there were like no questions about it. Here is a parody of Macklemore's Thrift shop that goes through the cycle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMBIs_Iw0kE 
Moving on to the next topic sounds good! What about Dis & Misinformation? I keep hearing about that in my classes.

Hi Mentee,
Hmm... That's a tough one! School can feel a bit like they're putting you inside a hamster wheel, where you just keep going, hop off and get some water (reading break), hop back in until you're done the semester, then repeat the cycle (LOL weird analogy I know, but I hope it makes sense!). Something to think about is that while students are put on a schedule to learn everything by the profs, profs are also on a schedule to have grades in at a certain time by the university. So it's almost the balance of the profs giving enough material to ensure students are well rounded and prepared for the upper level of the course (quantity), while leaving it up to the students to ensure that they are getting the knowledge they need and producing it at an acceptable standard (quality). Not comparing your progress to your peers is a great outlook to have - Focus on what you can do to be the best Mentee you can be! The best student you can be! 
Noooo! I hope those girls from the bathroom stick it out, because having more women represented in STEM is always 💯! But I'm also thinking those feelings might be a part of a bigger picture, like the imposter syndrome of, ""Oh wow, I'm actually here""! Because if you think about it, just this time last year, you were all just high schoolers planning university applications, and now you're all university students actually doing all these university things! Going through that transition of being responsible for just your grades to now being responsible for all aspects of being a student is huge! But you've got the right attitude (as always, my mentee 💖 ): You CAN learn anything, everything, and more. You ask the questions you need to, seek out your TAs and profs during office hours (and hopefully they DON'T trauma dump on you??????), and keep on top of your health and studies. Actually, I eventually have to learn the Krebs Cycle myself, so if you have any tips of learning it, send them my way!
CHIM = Certified/Certification in Health Information Management
CHEM = crying LOL JK
My turn to answer the mentor question!:
What factors did they consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there?
That is so interesting, because I knew SFU was close to you and that we reviewed your UBC application together! But your reasoning to attend UNBC, I think, will take you in just the right direction you need to go to reach your educational goals. I mean, with your smarts, you were going to succeed anywhere 🤷‍♀️. But I think the smaller class sizes really do give you that opportunity to know your peers and professors on a more personal level. This can open doors to deeper connections, references, etc. And imagine making your way full circle by being able to contribute what you've learned to smaller communities (as you studied in a smaller school)? How beautiful would that be! 🥹
My circumstances put me in a bit of a pickle back when I was choosing schools 😅. As you know, I took a gap year after high school to save money while finding a program that I was happy with. I eventually decided to attend BCIT for their Medical Laboratory Technology program (so yes we could have both been on the mainland!), because I loved the idea of a career that combined science, health care, and living somewhere new! Unfortunately, there was immediate family illness back to back, and after some discussions with myself and my family, moving away for school at that time was just not feasible. So, I made the hard decision to study at UVic instead. My program, HINF, was never on my radar, but I found myself excelling and now I'm actually employed full-time in the field. The factors that kept me at UVic actually ended early on, so it wasn't as important once I was in. Now that I'm done school, as crazy as it is, I'm trying to get back in (in the form of medical school)! 
Cheese! 🧀

Hello,
Can I just say I am loving the constant feeling that a could/should be doing more. Like for every assignment, reading, notes, etc., I never actually feel like I accomplished anything. At least everyone is feeling this way. I'm not even comparing my work to others I can work alone for 6 hours, finish two assignments, do the readings for a class, and make notes for another and still feel like I did nothing. 😐
Regarding the 7 courses two of them are labs but the work load for labs is just as much as for my lectures BUT THEY'RE WORTH LESS CREDITS! 😡 Anyways, the prof went over the krebs cycle in biology yesterday and I went to the bathroom after class, girls were in there talking about changing their career plans to eaiser things. WHICH SUCKS. Sure the krebs cylce is complicated but I can learn anything (I think). 👍 I hope that puts school right now into perspective. 
Also my TA for First Nations Studies trauma dumped on our entire class for a good 45 minutes yesterday. 
What is CHIM? I read it as CHEM but I'm guessing they're very different.
I thought I'd look at the second portion of this discussion, I'm going to answer the question for the mentor because I'm not about to do a bunch of research for schools when I'm alredy where I want to be,
• What factors did they consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there?
Location: I liked the idea of going somewhere new and having a fresh start. This was actually a HUGE factor in my decision (certainly since no one wanted me to go here because of how far it is). I enjoyed high school and had lots of friends (my dad likes to say I was popular but idk). The idea of being able to start from the beginning and make something of myself again was nice. 
Program: UNBC actually has some very good programs. I got into a great program that I'm enjoying.
Size: UNBC is smaller, it was easier to get into the residence, lectures are smaller, and my labs aren't even 30 people. There are opportunities actually to ask questions. Also, you get to know people better (In my option at least) The lady in the dining hall who checks me in every morning knows my name (her's is Victoria). I doubt you could become so familiar with people and a place as fast in a big school.
Cost: though I am paying more since I'm living on residence my tuition is still less than it would be at UBC or SFU. Living in residence is a good experience though. 
I asked my roommate why she chose UNBC and she said cheese, so different perspectives. 🤷‍♀️

Hi Mentee,
Gosh, I've said it before and I'll say it 10x over - I love your answers. They're just so honest and sincere! As you were a part of my career finding journey, you'll know I'm a bit in that middle state of having just graduated school and starting a new job. So I can speak to both what you're saying and the perspective of someone in ""the adult world"" (but the imposter syndrome is still so real! lol). Firstly, I wholly agree with you! Someone's got to do it... So why not you? If everyone just ""settled"", we wouldn't have Olympians, we wouldn't be deflecting asteroids in space, and we wouldn't be making small and ground-breaking discoveries everyday. I know some peers who've decided that they're not going to pursue XYZ due to factors like age, resources, time, etc. But really, who is making that decision but yourself? Who is really gatekeeping you from chasing your dreams... But you? When I told my brother about my interests in medicine but doubts due to how long it'd take, he responded with: ""You're going to be 40 anyway. Might as well be 40 and a doctor."" 🤷‍♂️ HE'S NOT WRONG LOL.
But now being out of school for a year and a part of the working class, I can emphathize why it may not be that simple. You just gain so many more responsibilities after graduating! There's bills to pay, commitments, responsibilities, scheduling issues, lack of free time, and I'm speaking as a childless person! Imagine the added costs and responsibilities associated with also having a family! Now you're not just thinking for yourself, but thinking about your partner, your kids, pets, and more. That may be why security is deemed more attractive than taking chances, and why we choose the safer, more realistic choice over chasing our dreams. And sometimes, it's not up to you, but what works for everyone, and even then, it's still up to a number of factors in and out of our control.
What education you need for BOTH careers you researched.
Realistic: So this might be cheating a bit as I'm already in a career, but I can say that I required a bachelor's degree to be where I'm at today. However, a bachelor's degree in my particular program isn't necessary, as I have teammates who graduated with designations (i.e. CHIM) and are from different health-based backgrounds (e.g. computer science, lab work)
Dream: Did you know that you actually don't need your bachelor's degree to get into med school? Depending on the school, you can apply starting your 3rd year of university (which if successful, you'd enter 1st year of med school during the year you were supposed to take your 4th year of uni). But that's also the thing, while you don't necessarily need your degree, you do need to make sure you meet the right admission requirements.
Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary
1. Education just introduces you to the coolest ideas and people
2. Opens doors to new experiences. Post-secondary isn't just about studying, it's about gaining work experiences (co-op), taking part in clubs, research, etc.
3. Helps you get to where you need to be. If you want to be a dentist, you have to go to school. There's no going around that.
Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example: cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions.
1. You mentioned it, but cost. School is so expensive, even when you're a domestic student. Luckily, I was able to get by my undergrad through co-ops (paid work experience), but that won't cut it in med school where you most likely will have to take loans.
2. Length of schooling. 4 years seems like both a short and long time, but it's a lot of yourself to commit. Especially with what we're both considering (medicine and PhD), those paths take a long time to complete. But I can't wait to call you Dr. Mentee! And I'll be Dr. Mentor! Oooo!
3. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes there are factors in and out of our control. What if the person reading my application had a bad day? What if the post-doc program you're looking for is competitive/hard to come by? We do what we can and love, but at the end of the day, sometimes it's just a lottery.
How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why?
I mean, it's always going to be worth it once you're there. But instead of focusing on the goal, we can try focusing on the process to feel more fulfilled. It's not just about getting into med / post-doctoral programs, becoming doctors / researchers, and that's it. With that type of thinking, when would we ever stop moving the goal post? I found it helped to think about becoming someone who will make an impact, make a change, no matter how big or small. 
Your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? Why or why not?
Totally! Like you said, someone has to do the job, so why not us? It is a bit wishful thinking to go in, do everything by the book, and expect it all to fall in place linearly. But everyone's success story is different, and there's no regrets in giving it our best.
I'll do the second half of the discussion questions another time with you!

Hi Mentee,
Okay, so I totally got sick last week as well. We really be twinning with your roommates on with whatever was going around lol 💃. But I'm feeling much better and I hope you are too! 
GIRL, you said HOW MANY courses?! 7?!!? I should've taken a closer look at your class schedule when you sent it to me, because that is bonkers! LOL. But you're enjoying them, and from the sounds of it, balancing them well, so all I can really say is to keep it up and stay healthy. :) I do think 5-courses per semester is considered as a typical ""full-course load"" (depending on the program), so by doing 7, you are just on another level!
As requested, here are some midterm study tips from Mentor had a little Midterm 
1. Find out what you need to know
Sometimes your professors will tell you the cut-off for the content that will be covered on the exams (check your syllabus!). So I find doing an overview helps to find: the topics you know inside out (requires less review time), topics you need to brush up on (moderate review time), and topics where you're just ?????? (most review time). Ask yourself if this is testable material, is the prof's exam style more lecture-heavy vs reading-heavy, what type of subject is it (memory-based vs problem-solving vs interpretation), and allocate your resources that way.
2. Study guide it up from high yield to low yield
Once you have a grasp of what you need to know, try nailing down the topics / concepts that you feel will be heavily tested on, from highest to lowest yield. Once you've got those down, you can start going into and studying the details. Lastly, if time permitting, you can go in even further and study those ""little things"" which we're always convinced won't be on an exam, but by sheer luck, are always included anyway. I think by doing it this way, in the worst case scenario that you don't quite know the exact answer, you'll at least be able to write what you do know and not just leave it blank.
3. Consistency
While we ideally want to know everything, that's just not realistic. That's why it's so important to maintain the habits that keep your studying motivational, healthy, and consistent for you. Midterms are stressful, but being well-prepared leading up to them can help cut that stress down to size. So if you need to take a run to clear your head, do it! Will an all-nighter really help that much, or should you call it in early for the night? Especially when you've got exams back to back, it's important to know yourself the best.
And OMG 😱 did you just say co-op?! Co-op is my JAM. LOL. If you're able to attend those info sessions, that'd be awesome! I'd be happy to fill in whatever I can from my own experiences too. :) 
Conversation answers will be in my next message too! Cheers!

Hello again,
I'll respond to the first discussion topic now and I'll do the other one another time.
Dream career: being able to travel to different countries to study infectious disease
Realistic: (I mean people are doing my dream job so why can't I be one of those people...) frankly Idk realistic would be? I worked in a grocery store and I was good at that!
What education do you need for BOTH careers you researched?
Dream: probably a Ph.D. in some kind of science, work experience, or lab experience.
Realistic: I did the job in high school so I didn't even need a high school diploma for that. There is probably extra training if you want to be a manager.
• Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary
- Education is always a benefit
- Meet new people & network
- Learn more about yourself and what you want from your life
• Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example, cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions.
 
- cost is a quality challenge. It's costing me about $20,000 per year with residence, meal plan, etc... I did get an email telling me I got a $2,000 bursary from Girl Guides of BC last night so I've won over $7,000 this year. 
- School in general is challenging and it's not going to get easier when I'm trying to get a Ph.D. or something similar. 
- Lots of people want the experience for entry-level jobs and it's hard to find people who want to work with those who are beginning their education. I'm hoping my school's Co-Op program will help me overcome this challenge though.
• How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why?
So far, so good. I'm enjoying university and I'm willing to put in the work and study for a long time to get to where I want to be. I'm enjoying the journey so far. 
 
• Your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? Why or why not?
I've done hard things before and the career I want isn't the only good possibility for me. It may not even be the right one. I can change paths as needed but for now, I don't see why I shouldn't go for the career I want. Maybe I'm naive but someone needs to do the job so why not me?

Hello,
I am sick! So that's fun, my three other roommates aren't doing too good either. 
Regarding enjoying my classes, I am really enjoying my classes. 7 courses is a lot! I have midterms the week after thanksgiving weekend and I have no clue how to study for midterms (I didn't have many in high school). So if you have any advice for studying for midterms I could use that.
Someone visited my chem lecture today to tell us about the school Co-op program and it sounds like I can work during the summer semesters (which I was planning to do anyways), and they will help me find work within my feild and it will show up on my transcript. So, I'm planning to go to the info sessions next week.
I think the equivalent of shadowing for non doctors wanting to become doctors is shadowing a vet. Lots of people who did Co-op in high school did that if they were interested in medicine. 
I'll go through this topic in another message.

Hi Mentee,
Y i k e s . Well, at least you didn't have to find out the hard way! Learn by example, but don't lead by example when it comes to testing your prof's due date / time strictness... LOL. But your classes are going well? You should be coming up to your first midterms, right? The one thing I remember about uni was as quickly as the semester started, it'd seem like you'd be magically halfway through the semester, grinding through everything before holidays / breaks. Although the grind can be brutal, I preferred it over having something due right after a long weekend - how about you? Team get everything done before the holiday or Team assign it when we come back from holiday? 😄
Things change, feelings change, people change too (isn't this a Drake song? LOL). Anyways, I think you're in a good position to explore your options. I believe most STEM programs are structured to have similar 1st and 2nd year curriculums to allow for that flexibility. Not every pre-med will stay a pre-med, but that isn't to say their courses won't be valuable (or transferrable) to say, becoming a biomedical engineer or physiotherapist. Though I'm totally manifesting a research position for you and a nice grant so that you can still get that coin while you do research and research career options lol! 🙏✨  Something that came to mind while I was talking to my friend the other day: Say dentistry is calling out to you. You could take a walk to your local dental office and talk to the dentist there if they have time. Being a dentist for the military (which I believe they help pay for your education?) vs being a dentist + business owner may have dynamics you may or may not want in your future career. Similarly, if you go down the medicine route, although I believe shadowing isn't recommended is B.C., even just talking to a family doctor or medical student can give you an idea of ""Can I see myself doing this for the long haul? What will the future be like for me by the time I graduate?""
And regarding what's next, actually, you know what... I opened this convo just to see if I could and if any of the content had changed since we last did it. But now I'm thinking... Wouldn't it be fun if we revisted this topic again, after your first semester or your first year at UNBC? Just to see how much things have changed since you were in high school? 
I'll keep this topic open for now, but is there a topic you'd be interested in going into next?

Hello,
Regarding handing things in a couple of minutes late, my chef prof takes off 50% when you hand stuff in late. AND THIS MAN IS NOT JOKING! 3 people handed in their chem problem set ONE MINUTE late last class and he put them in a separate folder for late work.
Regarding citation style, my English class is MLA, my First Nations studies class is APA, and my science courses ask for CSE (which is new to me).
This place was definitely designed well, it’s also accessible for people with disabilities which is good.
To reply to your second message: I’m going through life right now with the idea that my plans are probably going to change. What I like about my program is it’s considered pre-med so I can do that, go into research, or do whatever else may spark my interest. 
What’s next?

Hi Mentee,
Don't mind me, just picking a convo about post-secondary planning... While you're already settled in at uni LOL. I just wanted to check it out to see if there were any new anchor texts / questions / resources since the last site update. Actually, while I'm here, there is something I could speak briefly on the topic before we get into it... I know you're all in for science, being a scientist/researcher, and being the Nobel Prize winner I know you to be 🥹! But recently, a few of my friends who've recently graduated university have gone back to school and switched their programs up. For example, I know someone who is now in massage therapy school, one who is considering going back for pharmacy, and an ex-STEM major now studying design. And you also know me, who'll be attempting the pre-med route soon. :) Being in school and being in a career are two completely different worlds, but at the end of the day, I think it just comes down to fulfillment. What you're studying now doesn't mean you have to be in science or research for the rest of your life. Similarly, if you find something that you like, but then it isn't sparking as much joy as before, you don't have to stay put. I think the beauty of knowledge is being able to share it, and that also includes applying it to different fields in different ways. Don't feel you're limited to a certain direction just because of your education, because really, the sky's the limit!

Hi Mentee,
So let me get this straight... You had a quiz that you couldn't go back to review your answers on + time limit + minimum % threshold to pass + you didn't know how many questions you had ahead of you... That stressed me out just reading it! 😩 But hey, good work on the 6/8! In the wise words of my past Math 100 professor - ""[Professors] don't know what you don't know."" I'm sure I've mentioned this before and I know it seems like common sense, but when you come across a question on your exam that seems like boss battle music should start playing in the background, just give it your best shot and show your work! The worst you could get are no marks, but the best could get are partial marks for having the right idea. Another thing that just came to mind was giving yourself at least a minute to submit your quiz/test/exam. I find that when everyone is trying to submit at the same time, right at the deadline, it takes a few extra seconds to submit fully, and sometimes your quiz/test/exam has a ""review"" page before the option to do a final submit. Especially if your prof is strict on time limits and gives no clearance that it's alright to submit past the time limit, please save yourself the stress and submit it a minute or two before. Again, I know this is like, ""Of course I would do that?"" but it's always the moments when you least expect it, and your mentor's got your best interests at heart!
Different syllabi?! HUH?! I guess all universities standardize their syllabus differently. But you've got the right idea with making an Excel spreadsheet! I personally used Google Calendar because I needed a system that alerted me 2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days, and 1 day before anything was due lol. It also helped me book specific hours for group meetings! But use the system that works best for you, whether that's Excel, a planner, Google Calendar, your phone, etc. AND GIRL, I KNOW! Plagiarism scared me too!! I've also heard that profs can run our papers through a program for plagiarism checks 😭. But really, if you just cite and reference your work properly, you're totally fine! I was by no means immune to quick citing machines, but cleaning it up with Owl Purdue was my go-to combo. Totally random fact, but I think I used APA 99% of the time in uni, with 1% being MLA and literally 1 assignment I had to cite in Chicago style. Let me know if it's any different at UNBC!
Omg I love how you specifically highlighted the froyo machine because absolutely that is the best part LOL. But WOW, I think my favorite perk of your campus is everything being connected! Talk about meaningful engineering for the students. Hope you enjoyed the party and I totally respect your honesty! As your mentor, of course I'll never condone harmful activities, but I got nothing to worry about with you having such an awesome head on your shoulders. Just make the best of your time, make lots of memories and friends, and remember, uni isn't about grades, it's about learning and getting to where you want to be. :) And I'm with you every step of the way!
Oh, they are totally faded out for me too AKA I have to unlock the convos again. Actually, if you wouldn't mind, I'll probably open one we've done before just to see if any of the contents have changed. Who knows, maybe our answers have changed too since last year!

Hello,
YOU'RE BACK!🥳
Wow, so the travel agent just didn't do the main part of their job -_- that sounds like a very stressful time. 
As far as my uni experience so far it's going well. I just finished one of the most stressful pre-lab quizzes (it's 8 questions, you need at least 50% to pass, and you have 15 or 20 minutes to do it (note: you don't know how many questions there are when you start so you're rushing to get it done) and you can't go back to questions you've answered.) I got 6/8 right, the last two were based on information I had not read, nor could I find it in any of the pre-lab stuff. At least the pre-lab quiz for my bio lab was reasonable. 
In terms of the syllabi, EVERY SINGLE ONE IS DIFFERENT! My goal was to collect all my due dates, put them into an excel document and arrange them by the due date, well I spent more time trying to find what was due than actually entering stuff into the document. 
The plagiarism speech scares me because I'm afraid I'm going to plagiarise without knowing I plagiarised.
Another fun thing, the bookstore screwed up their book orders. Most of the textbooks were supposed to come with access codes for online quizzes, lessons, etc... (most are required for classes), but they ordered the ones without the codes. So now my name is on a list for my biology textbook (along with at least 100 other people), for this code so I can access my assignments. My bio prof is understanding though so he's willing to push back due dates because of this. For chem and English I bought the digital versions of the books from the publishers so I had no issues but for those who didn't and got their copies from the bookstore...they're having problems.
Overall I like my dorm and my roommates, the dining hall food is good (They have a frozen yogurt machine), the gym is super nice and I enjoy going there, and best of all, all the buildings are all connected (other than the dorms and the gym) so in the winter when it's -30 or colder, I won't need to constantly be going outside for my classes. 
I went to a party on Friday. It's a thing here to stick notes under the Appartement doors in the dorms. So everyone in my building got a note under the door on Thursday night inviting us to the party. It was in the middle of the woods, next to a lake, and it was very dark. But I went with two of my roommates and we had hiked to the lake a few days before so we knew the route. The best part was the dining hall the next morning ( I didn't drink, smoke, or snort anything at the party so I wasn't hungover) most people looked absolutely miserable and hungover. 
It's always interesting to see how our answers to the discussion question differ. 😁
Shall we move on to the next topics? I wonder If they changed the ones that are now locked (even though we did them) do you get a different...experience?

Hi, it me! Back at it again, but this time, to respond to our conversation (☞  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) ☞:
Okay, first off, I'm glad I read your message before reading the contents of our conversation topic because whaaaaaat is going on with the format. 🤪 I clicked into the discussion questions by mistake and it redirected the page when I was already typing stuff out LOL just sharing in case you do that too!
Sharing 3 people in my life that could be allies:
My past co-op supervisors: Although co-ops aren't very long (typically 3-4 months), I was very fortunate to have served 3 supervisors during my time in uni, 2 of which I still keep in contact with and who act as my references. What I really appreciate from their allyship is their genuine support in my endeavours, and while I haven't actually read their references of me, they've always been happy to write them whenever I reach out. And well, I got this job, right? So I'm sure they're saying something nice. LOL.
My current supervisors and people I've met in this field: I don't think I'm doing this right, but I'm gonna keep going with it because I've already started 😂. But my current supervisors were so supportive during the whole ""Is Mentor going to Vietnam or not???"" saga, and not just that, but have been very flexible in my desire to learn more outside of my position. Additionally, on my way to getting this job, I've met with researchers and other staff who just have so much encouragement to give. It just reaffirms my decision of being in this field. :)
You!!!: It's not because you chose me as one of yours, but because I really feel that we've built a great connection over the past year that helps me keep going! When I chose to become a mentor, it wasn't just about helping a student with advice I would've valued at their age, but also wanting to learn from them too. I really value what you say, and look at me - Now I'm jumping rope and reading books again haha. Thank you! Can't wait to see what my future Nobel Prize winner will teach me next :D !!
My turn to answer the mentor questions below (great job trying to answer them too btw!):
Do they have any tips for identifying who would be a good ally? These could be tips for identifying professional, emotional, and/or personal allies.
I think for a professional ally, you'd want to look for someone who will encourage you, critique you (in a constructive way), but also support your professional growth. An emotional ally would be someone who can empathize with your reactions and knows the right language (e.g. love language) to ensure you feel emotionally supported. Personal allies are those who, I suppose you personally choose to get close to you and who know you well. Their allyship can keep you accountable or support you in how you need to be (while still respecting boundaries on both sides).
How do you get someone to be your ally? What can you do to build trust and respect between yourself and someone who you want to be your ally?
Your response was so funny LOL. ""Will you by my ally???"" I totally agree in that you should look to build that connection first, and see what kind of allyship you're looking for (just because they're say, your boss, they may not necessarily be the professional ally you're looking for, but could be, say, a networking ally).
How do you approach someone to ask them for a reference letter?
Before ceasing my employment or volunteer role, I typically ask my supervisor if they would be comfortable being my reference. From there, it'd be a matter of reaching out for the reference letter, being mindful to give them a date you need it by and if necessary, a reminder of what you did in the role.
Do they have any tips on networking?
I'm honestly still working on this skill myself, but what I've done so far has really been shooting my shot 🏀 lol. For example, I reached out to a research manager a few months ago and she said she was impressed at how I just put myself out there and we had an awesome conversation about her work. No harm done on either side aside from the nerves of sending that initial ""are you free to chat?"" email.
How do you know who is trustworthy and who is not, when you are seeking emotional or personal support from your allies?
Totally agree with you!!! I think it's a combo of trusting your gut feeling + seeing how this person interacts with others + knowing that person well enough to confide in. You wouldn't want to be vulnerable with a wolf in sheep's clothing, right? Trust yourself first and foremost.

Hi Mentee,
MENTOR IS BACK!!! I am so so sorry for dropping off the face of the planet like that so suddenly! o(〒﹏〒)o Man, my heart when I got your message checking up on me... That should be my job as your mentor! lol. To explain my disappearance long story short, 4 months ago, I was planning a trip to Vietnam to attend/take part in a wedding (not my own obv hahaha). So, here I was, a sitting duck still waiting for my tourist Visa to process through, 2-weeks until we fly out... and we come to find out that the travel agent didn't apply for the right Visa. B r u h. I didn't even have time to be mad LOL. It. Was. Crunch. Time. I was calling embassies, resubmitting Visa applications left and right - Anyways, what came of it was that I did what I could in the last few weeks, but it was way too last minute to fly with everyone else since my Visa is still processing (+ the ticket prices were growing to be like $4000+, not including spending money, insurance, etc... UM!?!). Told my managers I'm staying put and now I'm here, sitting in front of my laptop, finally having the chance to tell this story to my lovely mentee and catch up with her!
SO, with that all out of the way, how have you been?! Have you been settling well? How was your first week of going over syllabi? Did you memorize the whole 'plagiarism is bad' speech they make in every class? I want all the tea! LOL. 😂 Throughout this whole time, I knew in the back of my mind like ""Oh, it's Mentee's first week at school! I wonder how she's doing?"" And now I'm so excited to hear all about it! I couldn't wait to send this first, so I'll be responding to the conversation message right after! 
By the time you're reading this, you've survived your first week as a freshman at uni! You go, Mentee! (it's giving me 'You go, Glen Coco!' energy ✨)

Hello,
Well, it's Sunday night and I leave for Prince George on Wednesday. So that's fun. Also, thank you for handling everything with the email.
Somehow I am still in pain from my wisdom teeth surgery. It's only on one side though so IDK what I should be doing, but the swelling has gone and I no longer look like a chipmunk. 
I had to fill out a questionnaire with lifestyle questions in my residence application. They asked questions like ""what time do you wake up?"", ""What time do you go to bed?"", ""How tidy are you?"", ""Are you comfortable with partying?"", ""Are you comfortable with drinking?"", ""Are you comfortable with smoking"", ""Are you comfortable with your roommates having overnight guests?"", ""Are you planning on having overnight guests?"". So I doubt I'll get placed with a messy person who goes to bed at 4:00 am and wakes up at 12:00 pm (I hope).
Ok so UNBC sent out a course I had to go through to get to know the uni and the resources they offered. Free tutoring!? and they have people whose job is to help you find undergraduate research opportunities within the school. Free workout classes and gym access. At this point, it seems like UNBC has more resources for students than my high school.
Looking under Agency in the World they definitely modified the layout. Maybe that's why they re-locked the conversation? I'm not a fan of the text being aligned in the center instead of the left side of the screen. It looks like a poem.
List of allies:
My Ranger Leaders:  
Helped me gain leadership and community service opportunities -- They both wrote me very nice reference letters
You :  
Why not? you've helped me out A LOT this past year and you would absolutely qualify as an ally in my books. 
The example only listed two so that's what I'm going to stick with. But I will attempt to answer the mentor questions.
Do they have any tips for identifying who would be a good ally? These could be tips for identifying professionals. emotional, and/or personal allies.
A good ally is someone who supports you/wants the best for you and in this context, I'm going to add someone who is older and wiser than you. 
How do you get someone to be your ally? What can you do to build trust and respect between yourself and someone who you want to be your ally?
I wouldn't recommend walking up to them and asking ""Will you be my ally?"" because they will be confused (Very few people use the word ally in this context). Ask for mentors, or if it's a group leader, coach, teacher, etc... build a relationship as you would normally with someone like that. 
How do you approach someone to ask them for a reference letter?
""Hello, I am [working on scholarships/applying for uni/applying for a job/etc..] since you've known me for [length of time] and I feel like we have a good relationship would you be able to write me a reference letter? [offer to send something such as a brag sheet to make their life easier]. ""
if they say yes make sure to say thank you many times and give them a deadline for it that's a few days or weeks before you actually need it. I've had people forget when I've been depending on their reference and it just stresses everyone out.
Give them more than 2 weeks notice. 
Do they have any tips on networking
It's okay to email people randomly because you're interested in their work. 
How do you know who is trustworthy and who is not, when you are seeking emotional or personal support from your allies?
Well, don't go and approach a stranger off the street and start trauma dumping. 
You need someone who can listen and offer quality advice and who will keep your secrets.

Hi Mentee,
For your first message: Thanks for letting me know that you got that email! Though a bit odd as I wouldn't think mentees would get it too, I've reached out to e.mentoring to personally request continued access for both of our accounts - If I hear anything back, like if they say my mentee has to request continued account access on their own behalf, I'll let you know! But for now, your mentor's got this 💪.
For your second message: Have you lost teeth since we last spoke? LOL. But the impeccable timing of your wisdom teeth removal though?! I'm sure your swelling will be down in time for your first week of school. :D But still... Rest up, take your medications well, and eat when you can. 😄🦷. Let me know how your recovery goes!
Oh, you know what... I scrolled up to look at my wheel and I see what you mean. In the mentor perspective, once I've unlocked a conversation, it's usually bolded out, but more than half of our wheel has been unbolded... Weird? I can only think that they're making preparations for the new mentors/mentees coming in for September 2022 school year and resetting stuff? Wondering what'll happen if I click into a convo we've done before and unlock it again. I'll probably unlock our last one (Agency in the World) to test it out.
Honestly, that sounds awesome! I've never lived on res, but seeing those layouts where you'd have to dorm with 1-2 others in one shared bedroom made me feel like you wouldn't have the chance to have your own personal space. I think this would be a great opportunity to practice having that independence and freedom, while still getting to know your roommates. Say you move after university, you'll already have an idea of what to expect when renting with another person, what you would and wouldn't buy again, shared living courtesies, etc. Were you given a questionnaire to pair you with similar roomies? I've always wondered how that would work, if say you're the type to sleep early and someone else was a complete night owl. All you can eat, 7 days a week with study rooms. Sounds like a dream combo for studying for finals LOL. 
I know this is going to sound like, ""HOW???"" but I remember meeting this girl in my first year who lived on residence, but she was still late to every class 😭😭😭. This goes to show that while living close to school is convenient, it's still only but an ingredient to success if not applied correctly. I was thinking of other ""just uni things 🤪"" 😂:
Find out who your undergraduate academic advisor is, find out who your co-op undergraduate advisor is (for when you need someone to help point you in the right direction; for when you are interested in getting some on-the-job experience during your summers)
I think when you're registering your student info on UNBC's website (i.e. your student account), they ask for your preferred contact number. In my case at UVic, it was my cell number. When something happens on campus, they send a campus-wide text to everyone, even if you're not at school (e.g. School closed due to inclement weather), similar to when BC sends everyone an amber alert text. 
Totally go to Orientation! I unfortunately missed out on mine because I was coming back from vacation, but you can explore campus with other freshman, get toured by your RAs, and best of all, get SWAG like shirts and stuff lol.
Explore on your first day/week, because that's when clubs will be trying to recruit new members! I think they recruit year round, but I recall first week back to school, many of them had booths to attract new students - See if there are any that speak to you! There might also be some vendors, like I remember getting these really good mini donuts on my first day back lol.
Once you're more settled in, I'd bus into Prince George and see the city life there if you're not familiar already! I'm sure it'll be a place you go often with your friends - Coffee dates, study dates, trying new restaurants, sightseeing, picnics, hiking, etc. 
More related to school, but looking at your library reserves could also be something to try (Basically, it's resources that you can't sign out but can look at in a special part of the library).
You can also look at the copy store, say if you want to buy past exams for the practice questions, or an assignment requires you to print and laminate.
If anything else comes to mind, I'll keep adding to this list! Until then, I'll unlock our Agency in the World convo and see where that takes us (again).

Howdy,
I just got my wisdom teeth pulled today so I'm like on three different kinds of drugs, just enjoying allowing myself to chill after having four teeth pulled out. I took tomorrow off work too so I'm taking care of myself as I should for once 😁.
I'm just replying to your messages in General Disscussions because a couple of the modules we have already done have been locked for me. 🤷‍♀️
I'm going to be living on residence, the only thing I know is I'm going to be staying in Keyoh (which is one of the two residences) UNBC has an intelligent design for their residences because there like small apartments. So I get my own room but I share a kitchen, bathroom, and common space with three other people. There are also study rooms, common rooms, and laundry rooms on every floor. My meal plan is also ""All you can eat, 7 days a week"". 
I got noise-cancelling headphones for Christmas this past year and they are an absolute game changer! I don't think I could study without them anymore.
Luckily for me, I have a 5-minute walk to the center of campus and it's a 15-20 minute bus ride into the city of Prince George (The bus stops right at the school too!).
I get my student card the day I move in and I will start getting to know how to use it ASAP. (I copy and pasted your list :) ) 
OK, I def need to fix my sleep schedule 😬 My sleep schedule is quite regular but not what I need for university.
Thank you for the rest of the tips too! I copy and pasted them to a note on my laptop desktop so I can be reminded of them regularly.

Now for your second message!
I liked your short story. Especially the part where your teacher would have been satisfied but you weren't, it's good to work for what you believe is good.
I like your definition of grit vs. agency because I was still confused when I answered that question.
Well, this was actually quite interesting as a topic!

Hello,
Before I reply to your last messages I got an email the other day from ReMBC (I'll just copy and paste it to save myself time)
eMentoring for the 2022-2023 school year
Hello mentors!
With the new school year approaching, we'd like to invite you back for another year of eMentoring!
If you would like to be a mentor again this year, please let us know by emailing (their email It won't let me send the message if it's included) by September 2nd at 12pm. On the afternoon of the 2nd we will deactivate anyone's profiles who has not reached out.
Thank you, and we hope you will join us again!

Hi Mentee,
I know, right?! It just goes to show that there are truly many careers out there to discover. As you progress through university, I'd encourage you to reach out to professors, graduate students, and even your peers, to learn more about their path and how they came to study/research what they are. Who knows, perhaps you'll pull some inspiration and maybe even open some doors you didn't know were there!
Omg... That 6PM ENGL class... RIP. I do, however, find that ENGL classes go very quick (I mean, they are only 50 minutes long)! While it really depends on your prof's teaching style, I found success in writing down the points my professor would make, versus what I already knew / what was provided on our handouts. For example, if your assignment handout states that there will be an oral presentation, but your professor mentions points on how to effectively present an oral presentation, that's what I would be focusing on jotting down. It's all about pulling key information from lecture - But you already knew this! 😋
OKAY, THANK YOU MENTEE'S COUNSELLOR!!! I was wondering where your entrance scholarship was, but thought you just included that with your UNBC acceptance. I also believe you have a strong chance with getting in-course / renewable scholarships, but always keep your eyes open for awards you do have to apply for. There's no risk to shooting your shot! It's free money! LOL. I wouldn't mind my mentee being showered with more scholarships 😂🤩😎😏. Keep me updated!
I'll choose a topic for us! I don't see a ""End this Conversation"" button on my end for this one, so General Discussion will just stay open. We can come back to it for any topics that may come up outside the Conversation.
For Mentee's pre-med friend:
So, you might have noticed that medical school in Canada is a bit more ambiguous compared to the US. We don't have nearly as many schools, and each school has their own requirements. While I'm definitely no means an expert, and you may have done this already, you may have more luck browsing your university of choice(s) medical school site versus the university site itself. Let's take UBC for example: https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/admissions/before-you-apply/
Here, you're able to view valuable information like Admission Requirements, Admission Statistics, Evaluation Criteria and more. While some schools may evaluate your application hollistically, it is still important to be aware of both your academic components (e.g. course load requirements, MCAT, AGPA vs OGPA, etc.) and non-academic components (e.g. Experiences, employment, research, etc.) to best reflect 'you'. For example, strictly speaking for UBC, you'll notice that the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) is a requirement for applying to their med school, with minimum scores required in each section to successfully apply. While I cannot speak for adcoms, approaching your course selection to best equip yourself for success (especially for components like the MCAT) is what I could recommend to you. As cliche as this is, pursue what interests you and do your best!
Long answer short, I'd check the Admission Requirements > Prerequisites section for the schools you'd be interested in applying for and build my semesters that way. Do I need to have a full-course load to apply? What do they count as a full-course load? Are there any course requirements like minimum English courses taken? How will they evaluate my GPA? What is a realistic 'competitive' GPA / MCAT? These are some questions to think about while looking into these schools. You could also seek your academic advisors for assistance in meeting your med goals, and look into additional resources like student forums (e.g. Premed 101, though I wouldn't recommend always checking those out). Focus on you, you got this, future doctor!

Hello,
 
The job sounds really cool! I didn’t know jobs like that existed but I think you’ll end up helping a lot of people. 
 
January schedule take 2: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sejghp6j57sdh4i/January%20semester%20schedule.jpg?dl=0 
I couldn’t schedule the courses I needed without that big space of nothing in the middle and I’m already cringing about the 6:00 pm course but there isn’t much I can do about it.
 
More about the scholarships: 
I was talking to my counsellor at my school’s awards night about my post secondary plans and such, the next day she calls me to her office, asks me if UNBC has offered me any money (they have not) and now she’s going to call UNBC and ask them to give me an entrance scholarship because “if UBC is giving me money (which they never do apparently), then UNBC should as well”. 
 
 Ok, Dr. Mentor!!! 👏👏👏 I definitely think you’d make a great doctor and I like that you know you have some work to do before you can go to med school. 
 
Since we’re continuing and I can’t think of any topics should we choose another topic? 
 
Your Mentee,
 
 
P.S one of my freinds is thinking of taking the med school route aswell. They’re wondering which courses they need to take. The university websites are uselss. How could thye find the courses or do you know which ones you’re supposed to take?",Mentee

Hi Mentee,
THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've been spending these last few days looking through the offer letter + onboarding documents while they process my background check. So while I'm not completely out of the woods yet (offer is conditional on passing the background + reference checks), I'm still so appreciative that I've gotten this far. So my job is to help support eHealth in rural and remote communities, mainly focusing on First Nations communities across BC. I'll be helping train health professionals at these sites with using systems like EMRs (electronic medical records), by creating how-to docs, training videos, and supporting them in person/remotely. That's why I asked you so many questions about rural living, as I'll be going to these communities with my team in the future, and I thought it would be a disservice to not educate myself about rural environments. To me, it was an opportunity to expand my knowledge about healthcare access in BC, primarily to our underserved communities, and it's almost like mentorship in a way! 
Sorry, Rach, did you send me two September sems by chance? But looking at them... Yikes, I do NOT miss those nearly 3 hour blocks. But what's nice is, I found that many professors take a 10 minute break in the middle to allow students to stretch their legs, get water, etc. I mean, it is a long time to be sitting and be focused in lecture so, I'm hopeful your profs will give y'all a break time too. :) There's nothing we can do about lab times tho LOL. They really do be like that. I know 5 classes seems overwhelming, but I totally believe in you + a full course load may be necessary for certain things down the road like scholarship renewals, professional studies, etc. I just want you to have as many doors open as possible! But if you're finding it's too much, I would recommend balancing your semesters so that you're not taking all of your ""heavy"" courses in one sem versus the other (dependent on your preferences and strengths). We can talk about it once you're more adjusted!
LOOK. AT. MY. MENTEE. GO!!! LET'S. GO!!!!! 5 SCHOLARSHIPS?! FOR REAL FOR REAL??!?! Omg if I could give you a ""Best Mentee Scholarship"", you could count that as your 6th. 😩❤️!!! You're incredible! Seriously, you deserve those awards! I can only imagine what UNBC has in store for you too!
Honestly, I was hoping you'd want to continue, because I'd love to too! 🥹 It was so bittersweet to think that I'll be sending my mentee off to post-secondary and I wouldn't know how she was doing, if I could help with any of the questions that come up after getting into university and settling down, etc. So of course, if you would allow me the privilege to continue being your mentor, I'd be ecstatic to, Mentee! And to answer your question, I likely won't be assigned another high school student as I've already graduated. This program is for current post-secondary students to support current high school students, and new mentors would have more up-to-date knowledge for their mentees. And truthfully, they made an exception for me to mentor last year as I had just graduated... Then they paired me with you and the rest is our history! 🥹 I totally feel the same way - I've never felt mentorship was a drag, or a bother, I truly look forward to messaging you and guiding you as best as I can! Your future is so bright, young star! Thank you for letting me do this. 🥰
---
I know I haven't mentioned this to you, and truthfully, I wanted to tell you at the ""end"" of our mentorship. However, since we're both hoping to continue, I thought I should tell you anyway! But I'm hoping to eventually apply to medical school sometime in the future. I have quite a ways to go before I'm ready, in terms of growth and comfort (especially with studying for the MCAT, which I'm finding difficult as a non-traditional student). But I hope we can both achieve our dreams! I'll be rooting for you forever, my mentee scientist! So please don't mind me if I ask you some beginner Chem/Bio/Biochem/Physics/Math questions. LOL.

Hello,
 
OMG! Congrats on the job offer!!! 🥳 Inspirational queen energy 👑 (I’m smiling typing this, hearing your news made me happy) What would you be doing in this position? 
 
Regarding the schedule, I did it all on Monday at 9:00 am. My chemistry teacher was happy to let me do it during class which was great. I’ll try and add pictures of my schedule but I have a full course load. 5 classes and 2 labs per semester and let me tell you I’m questioning how I’m going to balance it all. My residence application is due by July 1st,  so I’ll do it this weekend, I just wanted to register for all my courses before I did that. The notice for registering for courses was a little short but overall UNBC made the process very easy. I had an issue part way through so I emailed my advisor and she replied in 10 minutes which impressed me. 
I am happy with my first semester schedule more than my second semester but I have time to figure out what works for me once get started, and considering my experiences so far with UNBC I should be able to make changes.

Also, because we talked about scholarships, so far I’ve won 5! 
The one from the Vancouver Regional Science Fair (UBC Science Entrance Award), but since I’m not going to UBC I can’t use it.
The 2022 Lougheed Bursary (from Girl Guides). I also got  my Trailblazer Gold (the highest award you can get in the youth area of Guiding)
District/Authority Scholarship, I just had to prove I was involved in a specific area and I won it. I did french because I’ve been in French immersion since kindergarten, I’m in a French book club, I’ve done lots of french clubs, and I tutor one of my friends in french.
The PAC Exceptionality Award (one of the ones from my school)
The Kamyar Edonddin Hamidi Scholarship. I don’t know if you remember but there was a plan that was shot down at the start of 2020 on its way back from Iran. One of the people on that plane was a student at my school who was in my grade (he was also in french, which is a close community, so we knew each other well). Anyways everyone on the plane died and in honour of this student, a teacher and the student's grandfather collected money to create a scholarship in Kamyar’s name. And I was one of the winners. 
 
As far as continuing mentoring I would love to (if you want to as well). Would you still be able to help another high school student if we keep doing this? 
You have helped me so much this year. I don’t think I would have done so well this year and in general, survived this school year without you. You helped me so much with not only university stuff but everything else and I look(ed) so forward to your messages. To be honest I’m kinda doing a bad job expressing how much your being there for me has helped me this year. You made this school year so much better for me and every piece of advice and encouragement has helped me. 
So if we could keep doing this that would make me very happy.

Hi Mentee,
So I reached out to Juliet Oshiro, the project manager of ReMBC. She told me that for as long as we'd like to continue communicating with each other in our mentorship relationship, we are free to do so on the MentorCity platform! So, ""when does the program end"", exactly? I guess whenever we want it to. LOL. But with that being said, there is absolutely no pressure at all to continue - I already know you'll do so well at UNBC. As opposed to ReMBC's pre-post-secondary approach, we would likely just progress through post-secondary as you experience it, and I would support / mentor you that way. Anyways, I just thought to pass on that info to you as a possibility if you were interested. 🥹💕

Ps. I noticed that some UVic students had their course registration dates recently / coming up in the next few days. Have you registered for your courses yet? Or is UNBC still being whacky?

Hi Mentee,
Well, here we are! The final Discussion on the wheel (well, until I figure out the details of when the program ends LOL). Isn't it wild to see how many Conversations we unlocked, discussed, and completed since last year? You've made so much progress, and I hope throughout this whole mentorship, you've gained even a little crumb of post-secondary knowledge! 
With that being said, anything you've been curious about that we can go over (that we hadn't had the chance to cover in other Conversations)? This is a broad topic, so anything goes!
Have a happy Monday, and an even happier rest of your week. 😊

Hi Mentee,
This conversation personally interested me, as the most memorable comment I’ve received from a past professor was having “grit”. So on this topic of mentors and grit, I’m gonna plug in my own short story below if you were interested in reading (and hopefully are able to pull some value from it):
One evening after class, I asked my professor if he could read over my paper to see if I was on the right track. The feedback was good, and if I were to submit it as it was, it would likely get me a B. A B? Not bad, I thought, but not quite there. That night, I made the changes my professor recommended and then some. Next evening’s class comes and goes, and I stay behind again to ask for a second read through on my paper. He commented something along the lines of that the paper was satisfactory already, and while I agreed, it was me who wasn’t satisfied… And that’s when he mentioned my quality of “grit”. That night, instead of working away at yet another revision of that assignment, I googled “grit”’s definition… And it’s been a word that I hold dear to my character ever since. :) And if you were curious, yes, I got an A on that assignment! 
---
After watching the video, here are my answers to the questions:
What are your experiences with feeling like an outcast?
Similar to you, while I've had unique experiences, I wasn't ostracized by my peers for them. For example, English is my second language, which meant I was taking ESL lessons throughout school. Did getting pulled out of class from time to time to study English make me an outcast? No. On the contrary, classmates would ask if they could come with me to ESL, and I was able to build a strong foundation in the language while making some long-time friends along the way.
How did or do you handle “outcast” feelings?
I think the closest to feeling outcast I've had has been those isolating moments during class where you don’t really know anyone. Though this wasn’t to blame on my peers, but more so was / is the consequence to being shy and introverted. While I’ve improved as I’ve gotten older, I’m still admittedly not the type to spark a conversation first (wow the irony of being a mentor in a conversation-based program LOL). So I guess I didn't / don’t ""handle"" being an outcast, it’s more so I’m trying to work at what causes these feelings so I can stop gatekeeping myself from making friends lol.
What is the relationship between “grit” and “agency”?
Grit is knowing how to do it, knowing you can do it, and doing it until you do it as how you’ve envisioned.
Agency is applying that drive in a direction.
What are some of the skills you already have that can help you move towards your goals?
Independence in knowing that at the end of the day, I'm the only one that can make them happen. Hard work, honesty, and a mindset that always grounds me.
What resources did the students in Anindyu’s stories have access to? Do you have access to similar resources?
They had mentors! And omg when you mentioned I was your mentor and that you had me, my heart just melted LOL! But mentors helped guide those students in directions that improved their lives - Everyone has access to mentors, it's just a matter of finding that fit.
How do you know when to ask for help? What are some of the obstacles we can face when asking for help? How might we overcome these obstacles?
Yikes. LOL. That's a trick question, because I am also guilty of not asking for help, but more so for emotional things. For things I don't know, I generally just ask. Having a heavily detailed answer doesn’t mean much if that answer isn't even in the ball-park of what they’re expecting right? Obstacles that exist when asking for help include: Introversion / shyness, self-consciousness in how one may be perceived asking ""dumb questions"", wanting an applied answer but receiving a ""theory-based"" one, self-expectations for one to be able to “just get it”, etc. We can overcome these obstacles by reframing our question to be more applicable to a wider set of scenarios thus limiting how many questions we ask (i.e. Instead of asking what Avogadro's number is, ask how Avogadro's number can be applied), asking experts and different people (getting a range of answers sometimes helps), researching on our own to fill our gaps in knowledge, and being confident in our own knowledge and expectations.
What are your mentor’s experiences of asking for help? How can their example help you?
While I don't have a mentor for myself (at the moment), I hope you will grow to become more comfortable with asking help academically. Of course I'm always happy to help you as best I can from here, but there are so many qualified, accessible, and willing TAs at UNBC, your professor has office hours and contact info for this reason, there are classrooms open for things like Math Help and Chem Help, and having a good study group will help you get far. Reach out, because you'd be surprised at how many hands are willing to pull you up. :)

Hi Mentee,
LOL you're too funny! I think being in your late teens - early/mid twenties is that transformative time of being able to make selfish decisions, but also having the forgiveness of youth and time, so if we need to backtrack or change our minds, we can do so with little risk to others. You just graduated high school (and I just graduated uni), so pensions and retirement aren't really in our cards yet. However, it's never too early to make meaningful decisions that could influence the course of our lives.
Have you figured out your living situation? Residence or renting? Something that I've been noticing lately on university forums have been students asking about what appliances they can bring into their dorms. If you're going to be living the dorm life, I would look into what is acceptable to have in your room (e.g. mini fridge with a freezer). UNBC actually has this neat list of recommended items that could apply for living either on res or renting: https://www2.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/sections/housing/moveinchecklistwinter2021.pdf. And can I just throw in noise-cancelling headphones? Because I think I use them more as a means to block out noise than to listen to music, honestly LOL. 
And from here, find where your bus loop is, where all of the parking lots you need are (those close to your classes and library), bike racks, however you're choosing to commute to school, find where you'll need to go. Not only will it help you, but it will also help future instances where someone may be picking you up or dropping you off and they've never been to UNBC before. In that latter case though, I would always have a set parking lot where I'd get picked up, as to make it easier for everyone to remember.
Picked up your student card yet? I'm not sure how they may be doing things ever since COVID, but getting your ID and U-Pass (which again, is literally your key to so many things!) set up early can be less stress on future-Mentee. When you pick up your student card, why not practice using it? Here are some things that you could try:
Try loading up your student card somewhere (e.g. cashier in the cafeteria)
Try buying something using your student card
Try printing something off in the library and releasing that print job* 
*It does cost a couple of cents to print, so be sure if you're printing that you have sufficient funds! But you can also cancel the print job if you're just practicing
If you've paid to have access to additional services (e.g. athletics centre), try swiping into the building
And I think I've said some of these things last year, but as a refresher:
Get your sleep schedule fixed if it's not already!
Time management / study management are key
Find your favorite study spot both quiet and loud
Don't worry about buying your textbooks right away - Your professor will tell you on the first day if it's truly mandatory or not. If it is mandatory, go ahead and buy a used one or find one using certain resources (nudge nudge wink wink lolol)
Have a good water bottle (and maybe find some of the water bottle fountains throughout campus)
Familiarize yourself with Gmail/Docs/Drive/Google Calendar/etc.
Introduce yourself and make friends! You're all on the same boat! It's going to be a ride for the next 4 years, so get to know your study buddies, your all-nighter buddies, and be yourself. :)
Similarly, get to know your professors! These are experts in their field, possible mentors for your research, references, and more. Stop by their office hours, ask questions, and put yourself out there as an aspiring scientist. You've got this!
Lastly, I'm sure you know this well already, but as your mentor, I want you to hear it from me: Life happens beyond school. That letter on your transcript, that exam, that test, or quiz is just one instance, one snapshot, of your knowledge on a specific topic from a specific timeframe. Don't let grades dictate your college experience, make the most of this time in your life! At the end of the day, all of us care about Mentee, not Mentee's grades - and that should include you.
I'll be answering the conversation in my next message!

Hello,
I watched the videos and here are my answers to the questions:
What are your experiences with feeling like an outcast? 
I don't like the word outcast, according to google it is a synonym for rejected. Some things have made me different than my peers but I haven't been an outcast/reject. As far as things that have set me apart, my mom died when I was seven (That doesn't mean I was rejected by my peers), people just saw me a little differently and they treated me a little differently. They would avoid mentioning mothers in general and would downplay things like their parents getting divorced because 'I have it worse (that's BS, my philosophy is we can't compare our problems because they all suck no matter what). Let's just say that I was immune to 'your mom' joke as a kid because people would make one of those jokes and I would just say ""My mom's dead""😐 and they would panic and apologize. Again, I haven't been an outcast.
The closest thing would probably be in the computer science-focused electives I've taken. The most amount of women in these classes (from my experience) was 3. I was dismissed more than the guys around me but I proved myself by the end and ended up getting better grades than the guys who dismissed me. 
How did or do you handle “outcast” feelings? 
I don't because I don't have them...
What is the relationship between “grit” and “agency”? 
Grit is an individual trait while the agency can apply to groups of people. Agency can be taught and encouraged.
What are some of the skills you already have that can help you move toward your goals? 
I don't need to rely on other people for motivation, encouragement, etc... I'm quite independent and I'm good at problem-solving.
What resources did the students in Anindyu’s stories have access to? Do you have access to similar resources?  
They had mentors and were mentors. I have you as a mentor. I haven't had the opportunity to mentor but I might end up helping some people from my high school in the future with their Capstone projects. 
Opportunities. There are lots of opportunities out there to improve yourself. I've found lots and I've had many people suggest some to me and help me find them. 
How do you know when to ask for help? What are some of the obstacles we can face when asking for help? How might we overcome these obstacles? 
I suck at asking for help academically. Everything else I can typically ask for help easily but I have trouble with asking for help when I'm struggling in school (it was constantly mentioned by my teachers that I needed to ask for help in school). Sometimes it can feel like you're a failure when you ask for help. I know there is nothing wrong with needing help but sometimes when I feel like something should be easy to learn or understand it makes asking for help hard. And when people act annoyed when you ask for help, or if they make you feel bad for asking for help it makes it more difficult in the future.

How's the job going? The different opportunity sounds great! I guess with the world as it is you gotta start thinking about retirement soon???? IDK I just graduate high school so that hasn't rcrossed my mind 😁.
Ok, so I start university in a couple weeks what are you best tips/peices of advice? Is the anything I should get for uni that I wouldn't normally think of? Anything I should know? This summer is going by very fast, I really need to focus and get ready.
I need to get ready for work so I'll watch the video and answer the questions when I get home or tomorrow.

Hi Mentee,
Picked this new topic because it sounded like we could be secret agents in the world LOL. Messaging so you've got access!
Something that came to mind as I sent my last message (not related to this Convo though): I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but I think it would be super valuable for you to look at the bulletin boards at school. I believe most students pass by them or passively read them while waiting for their coffee order to be called (I know I did). But I remember seeing paper postings hiring students P/T for on-campus work, and some were for STEM related purposes like labs, research, etc. Sorry that I can't provide more specifics because it's been so long since I was on campus, but always keep your eyes open at those bulletin boards in your Student Union Building, the buildings where you primarily take your science and lab classes, and just generally around campus. You never know if these same positions would be posted in your student job board or where they could lead! 
Alright, have a go at our newest Convo, and I'll see you in our next message exchange. 💕

Hi Mentee,
Now it's my turn to apologize for taking a while to reply! I spent all of last and this week settling into my new career, which has taken a lot more time to adjust to than I anticipated for a remote job. Who would've thought? 😅 But... Surprise! Where I planted myself actually ended up not being with the rural opportunity I was talking so much about. Unfortunately, before I started, I was offered a different position I couldn't refuse - Permanent, F/T, with benefits and a pension. Gosh... Just going back and reading this again... but PENSION???? LOL. It's giving me ✨Retirement energy✨.
As I close my job hunt saga and start this new job chapter, and really, before we hop onto the new conversation (which I'll choose!), I spent this time also thinking about how I could produce some advice for you for when you go off and look for a part-time job, lab position, TA position, or other work commitments during uni:
1. Don't do what I did if you can help it. LOL. 
I mean, rescinding that offer before I even started was essentially severing those potential networks and blacklisting me from that workplace. Looks pretty unprofessional, unreliable, and just not a cute look. Ideally, you want to spend time in a field, taking that opportunity to learn new things, learn about yourself, and building those connections. However, that ties into my next point, being -
2. Do what you feel is best for yourself.
That sounds quite selfish, and really, I did make a selfish decision. However, I knew I made the right choice because it didn't keep me up at night. You'll know what works best for you, so trust your gut feeling! I want you to go forward with the same confidence in knowing your worth, knowing what you want, and knowing that even better opportunities are out there for you! Sometimes opportunities aren't always there when we look, but I want you to be the person who will create the opportunity!

I've been seeing a lot of news of emergency depts closing, call-outs for short staffing like nurses, and just an overall stress in the healthcare industry because resources have just been completely exhausted in these communities. Have you also heard of the lady who put an ad out in the newspaper, looking for a doctor to help renew her husband's prescription, because they haven't been able to find a new GP? PriMentor care is growing to be a very scary situation for many B.C. citizens, so I really appreciate your feedback on my question! 
Welcome back from the Cariboo, by the way! I truly missed mentoring and I missed you! ❤️

Hello!
Apologies for taking so long to reply but I was just in a rural community, so that fits with the conversation a bit.
I like your question, I have no clue how to answer it. 😁 I think the growth of the online world is helping with the situation. Being able to see doctors over something like Zoom has been helpful to a lot of people. Yet, at the same time, this past week some rural communities were without hospitals and ambulances. It was mentioned amongst the people I was staying with in the Cariboo this past week that the ambulances they have (there are very few) work for a HUGE area. Getting an ambulance can take a very long time and people suffer because of that. I think if young people were more aware of the need for rural doctors, nurses, vets, paramedics, etc... there may be more people being pulled to those jobs. Lots of the people who live in these rural communities are retired so encouraging younger people to move to these places could help. 
I think the city is seen as a glorified place of opportunity for young people (As seen in movies). I think there is a bit of a reputation that rural communities don't offer the opportunities that cities do. That could use a fix.
(I wrote the part above without reading the rest of what you wrote) I think sometimes in the chaos of everything it's easy to forget the rural communities. Sometimes because their populations are so small it's probably easy to prioritize larger populations (ie. It's better to make sure 1 million people have enough access to health care over 1 thousand).
I will absolutely be looking into that type of award. Thank you for doing some research too! What would I do without you?
I am ready to move on to the next topic.

Hi Mentee,
Loved your feedback to the questions!
I agree that it's easier to visualize yourself living in a city-setting when we've both primarily experienced living in one! While there are differences in both settings, there are factors that both draw us to and detract us from each. I, for one, love going back to the Philippines because there are qualities in life there that you just can't get in Canada, primarily with culture, food, and definitely the weather!
As we touched on in this conversation and earlier ones, resources, resource allocation, and retention are significant factors to living in rural areas. Being an aspiring scientist and researcher, how do you feel we can tackle resource/access issues with consideration to the biological, physical and socio-cultural components to living rurally?
Thinking about this question, I thought of how many students move from their small towns to study in bigger cities... And end up staying there for good. My brother actually did a poster presentation on this topic, being his research about youth migration in Japan. His study was about how young adults moving from the countryside to the city and deciding where they'll settle down can create demographic imbalances as populations begin to age. Which begs the question, how do we get students to study but come back to share their knowledge back in their hometowns? A very prevalent example of this is BC trying to incentivize students to study medicine in rural areas, such as UBC's Northern and Rural Pathway for streamlining students interested in practicing medicine outside metropolitan areas, the Rural Physician Retention Program, and more.
Actually I wanted to squeeze this in somewhere, but my brother's research was actually a paid opportunity through an award called the JCURA (I've mentioned this a couple of times!). You're mentored by a supervisor in your faculty during your 3rd or 4th year of full-time studies to conduct original research, and may even present it too! You do have to apply for these or be nominated, but what a combo: Research experience + building a network with your supervisor + presentation experience + $$$! Did a quick Google and saw that UNBC may be offering something similar once you're in those years of undergrad: https://www2.unbc.ca/events/51608/research-project-awards.
Let me know when you want to move onto the next Convo, whatever that one may be!

Hello,
 
Here are my answers to the questions:
What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? 
I agree with what you said about the background music! I also found the beat started to sound like a ticking clock.  It started following how the people lived off the land then moved on to making comparisons between the people living off the land and modern alternatives, then it switched to living in a city. I think the director was trying to communicate that though they are different, there are still some similarities. 
What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? 
I don't think I related to the images. Sure the city can be more intense and rural areas can be more relaxing but that's not exclusively true. 
How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? 
The music made me feel stressed. Was becoming more, and more intense as the video continued. It made the city
In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? 
​​​​​​​I mean I live in a city near Vancouver, and if anything the people are what you should be concerned about. The tall buildings, transportation, etc... just kinda leave you alone, but I've crossed paths with some...interesting people in the city and this video missed that in terms of what's intimidating. I've spent a good amount of time in both settings, and I can see myself living more in the city because of the fast-paced. For me, rural areas have been where I go to chill out a bit. So, the fast-paced city made sense to me.
I like the connection to Mean Girls 😁

Hi Mentee,
Opened up part 2 for us!
And to answer your jeepney concern, I actually asked the same thing to my cousins when I was last there: ""What if someone just pockets your change?"" To which they replied, they would have a hard time to, and culturally, it would be quite embarrassing. While jeepney's are similar to busses, they are a unique form of transportation in the Philippines, where you're actually seated in 2 rows sitting across and facing each other (one row on the left of the jeepney / one row on the right). Not only you, but everyone in the vehicle would watch the person pocket your change... omg. Imagine the audacity and awkwardness one would have to be able to steal the equivalent of bus fare in front of 15 other people?! 😩😭 Like... We're all just trying to get to our destinations here! LOL. 
Onto our conversation!
What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city?
Something quite prominent in the video was this almost ""walk, jog, sprint"" approach in the background music. As the movie begins, the music starts as a repetitive and calm beat, which I felt could draw from a more simplified, nature-approach to living in the country. As the movie progresses, the beat is joined with more vocal accompaniment, complementing the cross from country to city. Lastly, the movie ends with even stronger vocals, yet the beat is still faintly heard, to which I felt the director may have been drawing on how while country living and city living may be perceived as ""two different, detached worlds"", they are never completely detached from one another.
What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film?
As we've touched on in the previous part, while I grew up in Canada, I still have many roots back in the Philippines. In the part of the movie where the family seems to move to the city, I related to that ""shock"" one could receive from going from completely different cultures, climates, environments, etc. Like from my interpretation, the young lady in green seemed to be taking everything in around her as life continued moving with or without her.
How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you?
Hm... I would say the music impacted me more. I felt as though I was going through a movie's climax, with the build up in beat, vocal, volume. 
In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling?
I don't believe I'll be moving anytime soon, however, I believe the film shines light on a very honest, natural response to moving from rural to urban settings. This movie is actually almost 10 years old (2015), and is still relatable.
You know, thinking about my last sentence... Okay, not to compare with Mobilize, but for example, Mean Girls is nearly 20 years old and is still a cult classic. It pulls from stereotypes, memorable quotes, and is part of that coming-of-age genre where everyone can relate to something. I can't believe I'm talking about Mean Girls here but (LOL) what I was going off with this was, despite how much time can pass with a film, the feelings can still be applicable no matter when you watch it.
4 for you, Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco!

Hello,
Thank you for your advice on choosing electives, sadly I don't think I have room for electives until my third year but I'll keep your words of wisdom in mind. :)
The Jeepney sounds cool! I'd be concerned about someone stealing the money but I suppose in a community like that where handing money down a row of customers to the driver is a custom, people would trust each other not to steal.
Shall we move on to part 2?

Hi Mentee,

What an achievement! Not only did you study and graduate during a worldwide pandemic, you graduated with Honours with Great Distinction (what a story to tell in the future, eh?)! That was by no means an easy feat, and you've done exceptionally well! Congratulations again, my mentee! Your photos are soooo cute too, I love them! 😍 
While it can be easy to get caught up in your ""core courses"", I mean, you've applied as a STEM major not English major, there is so much knowledge and value to pull from those ""easier"" courses. Reflecting back on our old discussion on electives, back in university, I chose electives that I felt would not only be academically challenging, but also intellectually fulfilling. When you begin to choose your electives, keep in mind the things you've been interested in, how you may grow from this curiousity, and where that class can lead you! When you think about it, these professors are incredibly educated people who are teaching you in their expertise. You never know what new things you'll learn and be exposed to. (☆ω☆)
Please let your friend know that they're welcome. :) Thanks for letting me mentor through you a bit LOL.
So I've never lived rurally, but thank you for your answers, as you know I'll be working with rural / remote communities in the future! I do however, travel back to the Philippines every 5 years or so, and while our city is by no means small, I believe I could pull some rural community qualities to my answers:
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it.
1. Like you mentioned, community. We have this term in the Philippines called ""Bayanihan"", which can mean uniting together for the betterment of the community. It can be found in even the smallest interractions - When riding one of our local transports called a Jeepney, we hand our payment down to the hands of other customers until it reaches the driver. The driver, in turn, hands back your change, and it goes down the line hand to hand, until it comes back to you.
2. Similarly, nature! Although we're already so fortunate in BC to live surrounded by all this greenery, palm trees are literally in your backyard in the Philippines. There's just something about the fresh air, sunshine, and breeze combo! Nature is also incorporated in some beliefs, for example, the first rainfall of May is said to help heal your body - You may find people just standing in the rain like in those romance movies LOL.
3. Appreciation for different livelihoods. For example, what it means to harvest your food to eat and sell, and seeing the work that is put into businesses so that you may enjoy them. I believe there is more opportunity to be a small business in these areas, and with that, you are able to support these businesses to improve their livelihood and in turn, your own community.
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each.
1. There is so much overlap in our answers! Great minds think alike! But I would say, access to resources as well. While we have these small convenience stalls sporadically around town, to get to our closest grocery store, mall, movie theatre, you definitely have to commute. But luckily, there are markets if you'd be more interested in the fresh catches of the day and picked vegetables versus packaged goods.
2. And agreeing with you again, I do empathize with the efforts of what it means to live so far from these resources. While there is strength in having community, at the end of the day, you will have to figure out how to fix the wiring so your electricity is back up and running, making sure you have a consistent water source, and so forth.
One question you have about living or moving to the city
1. Again, I live in a city no matter if I'm in Canada or the Philippines. But I've always been interested in the more mountainous areas and the surrounding industries, as my family has properties in the mountains where there is a strong coconut harvesting presence. I'd love to go back home and see what they've seen and grown up with in terms of farming!

Hello!
Sorry for taking so long to reply. My last day of school was Friday and I had to work hard until the end. Also, commencement was Sunday at SFU (I'll include a pic). Let's just say those gowns,  33° weather, and no shade made the experience...uncomfortable. Still, I graduation with honours with great distinction. I have no clue what qualified me for that because my average is an A but not a high A, but I'll take the win.

Ok, I've been so focused on my science classes and the stuff that my degree focuses on that I haven't considered how things that I consider easy (such as English) will be and how I should learn from them. So, thank you for reminding me that I have other things besides science courses to think about 😬.
My friend said ""Aw that is so sweet! Tell your mentor I say thank you"". They really appreciate you advice and the little encouragement. 
I like the topic choice of from rural to urban. I guess I should take it and flip it because I think Prince George is more rual than Port Coquitlam. But I do have experience in rural areas.
Here are my answers to the questions (based on my experience with rural communities)
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. 
There is more sense of community: People tend to rely on eachother more. But since there are less people you have a greater opportunity to get to know your neighbors and help eachother out. People are (generally) more friendly in rural communities. They wave when you pass eachother and will quickly stop to help strangers.
They tend to be more connected to nature: from my experience people in rural communities spend more time outside and because they're rural there is more outside to spend time in. 
They're creative: at times, supplies can be limited, take time to arrive, be more expensive, etc... Peopel in rural communities tend to have neat ways of repairing things, decorating, and improving the community. There are kids who cross country ski to school, people who decorate their homes with old stuff they find on hikes, walls built out of pop bottles (they're used as bricks). I even know of a school that had so few students it go shut down (sadly) so the community turned it into a community center/thrift store (and place to donate stufff)/library/bookstore/computer access, etc... It's used for community meatings and a bunch of other things. 
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. 
resources are limited: things can be harder to get and they can cost more. Also, things like doctors, hospitals, dentist, vets, aren't super close. 
It can take a lot of work to live in rural areas: (this doesn't apply to all but many I know) it takes a lot of work to make sure you have enough wood to burn for the winter, they're aren't garbage trucks that comes to you house so you need to drive everything to the dump, eveything is farther, maintaining property throughout the various weather, keeping your property protected from forest fires, etc... People I know who live up there always seem to be working around their property.
One question you have about living or moving to the city 
I live in one so I have no questions.

Hi Mentee,
My 1:1 did go quite well... So much so, that it ended with a job offer! I know it sounds cheesy, but thank you for being a part of my journey! 🥹 I really appreciate your support and patience as I was navigating through that job hunt - I guess it's a bit of a sneak peak into what a future post-graduation will be like 😉. Something that really resonated with me throughout it all was ""growth exists outside of your comfort zone"", and I couldn't help but remember our conversations about challenging ourselves and self-improvement. I'm happy to have been offered a position that I feel will challenge me professionally, yet fulfill me personally, and I wish you the same for when you enter university. Don't be afraid to be curious, take pride in being a trailblazer, and continue on the path that you've set for yourself. I believe in you!
My #1 tip for meeting new people is to open yourself up to situations and environments which enable you to meet new people. Self-confessed shy introvert over here! But what worked for me was talking to my friends online versus face-to-face in the beginning - This helped me grow comfortable, so when we did talk in-person, it wasn't quite as quiet. LOL. 
Again, there will be plenty of opportunities like clubs, living on campus (residence), introducing yourself to your seatmates (in class and in labs), and more. It's also quite the digital age now, so I'm sure you could also have success on certain social media apps! 
I believe it might? I did get an email from the admins of ReMBC, but I hadn't had time to really look it over. I'll review it and we'll see how things go! For now, I'll unlock General Discussion for us and we can go over any odds and ends that we want to but didn't get to throughout the school year.

Hi Mentee,
Oh my goodness... Has it really been nearly a week since our last message? 🥺 I'm so sorry about that! Lots has been happening this past week, and while I kept mentoring in mind, I didn't think it was really a week since our last chat... 😭 OMG LOL. But in return, I'll give you an update on how the job hunt is going: 
So the 1:1 went absolutely splendid. I met the Director of the team I would be joining, who turned out to be an alumnus of my university program! My program is a bit of a smaller one, so finding fellow ""HINFers"" as we call ourselves, helps to build that connection before we even met. Actually, I did get a call today from her to see where my application is at, so I hope to call her back once I'm done work today (ya, currently mentoring on my break bc I didn't wanna wait until I got home hehe). But I ALSO got a reference to apply to a job at nearly the same time, so there's also that??? Times are pretty wild, but always grateful for what comes my way. 🥹
✨ Mentor's Advice Corner ✨ (I love it!)
Random advice for today: If I were to go back in time to 4 years ago, I would have definitely gotten more involved on campus! Not only does it help you network with likeminded peers, but I think it'll help enrich your university experience in its own unique way. There are clubs, research opportunities, career fairs, etc. Once you feel comfortable in your study / life system you've got going for you, try getting to know your classmates (possible study buddies / future group projects / assignment partner), your professors (for future research opportunities, volunteer opportunities, references, guidance with what was went over in class), and academic advisors (when you begin considering future careers and post-graduate studies, they will help you in making sure you're on the right path). Not just getting involved, but just exploring what your school has to offer too! Finding the best snacks on campus, favorite study spots, food that doesn't taste like cardboard... LOL. 
Hm... Us mentors did get a message that our mentees school year's are winding down, and I did want to leave some time in the remaining weeks if you wanted to ask any more questions under the General Discussions Conversation (which I can unlock). How does that sound?

Aaaaaand we're back! Thanks for your patience, my mentee! :)
So my weekend was pretty something ngl, so I apologize that it's taken me a couple more days than usual to get back to you! To explain myself (and spill the tea LOL), do you remember the rural job opportunity we talked about a few conversations back? Well, the director actually reached out to me last week to ask for a 1:1 meeting... Like... OMG? What is HAPPENING?! 🥲 I'll be having that 1:1 with her next week, so fingers crossed that this can lead to a new open door!
Oh! And before we move on from the topic of course selection, I thought to mention to you that a ""full course load"" in Canada is typically considered as 5 classes a semester. You might come across scholarships that require you to maintain a certain GPA while managing a full course load, or if you consider professional studies like medical school in the future, it's just something to keep in mind. A ""typical"" academic year will go from September - Apr/May and a full course load is 5 classes, so it'll look something like:
Fall semester: Sept - Dec (5 classes)
Winter semester: Jan - Apr (5 classes)
and your Summer semester can be full of research, co-op work terms, volunteering, traveling, etc as some courses aren't as available during that time/many programs operate on that timeframe. If you have any questions about that, just give me a shout!
Onto the convo:
What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What attitudes do you think he is hoping to change or challenge? Is he successful?
Watching the Tedx Talk, I believe Jeff was trying to help bring attention to Indigenous innovators, their voices, their ideas, and how we could incorporate Indigenous ingenuity with western culture as well.
Are there any inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovation.
The foundations of lacrosse being Indigenous! However, there aren't many sporty bones in my body, so I wasn't all too familiar with the sport in general 😅.
What do you think of Jeff’s intention to use The Seven Teachings to guide his business? How important are these values to how you might like to live your life? Which one seems the most difficult to live by, and why might that be the case?
I really respect his implementation of The Seven Teachings to guide his business. As Jeff mentioned as we move from product to knowledge-based systems, it's inspiring to know that some businesses still value values over dollars (as you mentioned also!). Without having heard of The Seven Teachings prior to this conversation, I suppose I've tried to live my life as well-roundedly as I could. I try to live as true to myself as I can, without compromising my morals or damaging my integrity, even if I have to swim upstream to do so. For myself... Hm... Perhaps wisdom might be difficult? But courage is so hard to muster up at times too! I think in order to gain wisdom, you need the courage to learn the lessons that come by you. So perhaps I struggle a bit with both haha.

Hi Mentee,
Sorry, just popping in to drop a quick message for now (as mentors get dinged if we take over 72 hours lol)! I'll totally let you know what I got myself into this weekend in my next message. Expect it later today! :) <3 Have a great Tuesday and I'll catch you later!

Hello,
It worked! 
Thank you for your advice on course registration. This is all very new to ma and my school is useless. I would be lost without you. <3
What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What attitudes do you think he is hoping to change or challenge? Is he successful? 
I think Jeff is trying to teach non-indigenous people about how to incorporate indigenous customes into their lives. Jeff is trying to teach people that there is value to indigenous traditions and that people can benefit by using some of their techniques. 
Are there any inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovation. 
We've been learning about indigenous pepoples for years in school so I'd heard of everything before. No surprises for me. 
What do you think of Jeff’s intention to use The Seven Teachings to guide his business? How important are these values to how you might like to live your life? Which one seems the most difficult to live by, and why might that be the case? 
The Seven Teaching are a good idea. I think it's a nice simple way to keep some key values in mind. I think it's a good way to guide a business because there should be more to companies than just profits. They'd be good to keep in mind. The one that would be most difficult for me? I gotta agree with Jeff, courage is something that I rarely think of. Everything else I am fairly familiar with but courage just doesn't come up often.

Hi Mentee,
That is so odd that the link to Part 2 didn't show up for you! I thought to just reply on this thread instead so maybe it'll auto-direct you. :S Weird! But no sorries needed. :)
Anyways, from my experience, course selection starts in the Summer if you're starting in the Fall... While I don't remember off the top of my head, I think May-July you should receive something from UNBC. CHECK YOUR EMAIL (INCLUDING JUNK/SPAM)! Because typically your school will email you about your SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME you can start registering for courses. This date and time is usually dependent on the year you're going into and how early you declared that you'll be studying in that semester. Don't sweat it if you missed your date / time provided - This is just how early you can register for classes. You can always register after that date / time and even up until classes start, so long as the classes you're registering for have room (or have room on the waitlist). However, I would recommend you register as close to the date / time as possible or better yet, exactly on that date / time. Yes, sometimes the registration time is like 6:30am or something super early. But most of your classmates will have the same date and time, and when that's the case, it's really first come first serve when it comes to classes filling up. The site will be slow because a lot of students will be on there doing the exact same thing as you are, but so long as you're registered and (fingers crossed) not on the waitlist (but that's not too much of a biggie, don't worry if it happens!), that's what matters!

Hi Mentee,
Thank you so so so much for your in-depth insight on what rural community living is really about! As you know, I've been busy preparing for job interviews over the last month - One of the jobs involves travelling via sea plane or boat to help rural medical centres with their health information systems. I thought to myself that this is an incredible opportunity to be more exposed to the beauties and realities of living in B.C., in particular, with the factors like limited resources as you listed. I should know the outcomes of my interviews at the end of the month, so I hope to update you with good news!
I've passed your thanks onto my friend - He's happy that he was able to help and wishes you luck on your studies! Now passing it onto you in terms of our mentoring... What conversation strikes your fancy this time? :)

Hello,
Tell your friend thank you for the advice! I appreciate it very much.
Rual communities are generally quite welcoming to new people (of course it depends on the individual some people aren't nice to anyone). For the communities being rual there tend to be lots of parties and community events so it's easy to meet people in your area. We have family friends who moved to Pressy lake a few years ago and everyone was very nice. In some of these areas there are people who only live there part time, so there is a good variety of people. For lots of these rual areas neighbors depend on eachother for a variety of things. So people are used to asking others in the community for help. Integrating into a tight-knit community is like integrating anywhere, talk to your neighbors, attend some events, etc... people tend to be more relaxed and friendly away from the city. When you pass people on the roads almost everyone waves. 
Charms of rual communities vary. It depends on where you go. It can be nice knowing your neighbors and lots of the places tend to be surrounded by nature. You see foxes, deer, bears, and more. The sense of community can be great and if you don't like the busyness of a city it's even better. Things tend to be slower too, which you don't really get living in the city. 
Limited resources are a problem. There is a huge demand for physicians and many people resort to returning to the lower mainland for doctor's appointments, dentists, eye doctors, etc... Another issue is that hospitals aren't always near by and if it is something serious chances are you will be air lifted to Vancouver. I know of a family friend who fell head first of his deck a while ago (really bad accident), they got an ambulance (wait time is long), the ambulance took him to the nearest hospital, they didn't have the resources to deal with that injury so he ended up being air lifted to Vancouver. People have a higher chance of dying from treatable accidents and health emergencies because it can take so long for help to arrive and some of the places are hard to find. Some medical conditions make living in rual communities not so accessible, lots of people end up needing to leave their homes as they age. 
Food and gas prices tend to be higher too because the stuff needs to be transported further. You will also need to drive further for those things. Where I live it's a five minute walk to a proper grocery store for some people it can be an hour drive or more. People tend to plan ahead a lot more and will do a big shop once a month or every couple weeks. A lot of the time if your neighbors are going grocery shopping they might ask if you need anything which is nice. People also harvest their own food more. In the summer and fall people go berry picking, mushroom picking, hunting and fishing is an all year round thing. Many freeze or preserve their food to make it last longer. 
Education is also an issue. Often it can take over an hour to get to school for some students. Some parents opt for home schooling while other students will live closer to the school during the week and only come home on long weekends. There was a kid that lived near one of our family friends, he would ski across the lake to where the school bus would pick him up in the winter because the back roads were too icy and not great for driving on. 
There are some places that are more rual than others. Chances are you won't be in the middle of the woods but communities can be easily found (at least from what I've seen). People tend to be brought together by a shared experience. In the BC interior forest fires are a big issue and people are quite united because of them. Neighboors who are staying in evacuated zones will keep the property of the neighboors wet to try and keep their homes from burning. People in not evacuated areas offer up their extra homes/bunk houses for people who are evacuated. It's heart warming to see.

Hi Mentee,
Happy Spring Break! Us mentors get notified of when our mentees are going through high school exam season, winter / spring breaks, etc., so I was just thinking ""I hope Mentee is relaxing"" the whole time! But thanks for dropping by, you're always always welcome ٩(๑･ิᴗ･ิ)۶٩(･ิᴗ･ิ๑)۶!
Actually, during this time, I did ask my friend who moved from Duncan to Victoria on their experience with moving for uni, and this is what they said:
Q: ""Do you have any advice for high school students moving cities to attend university?""
A: If you're going to be living off-campus,
Get comfortable with your surroundings. Find your grocery stores, pharmacies, bus/transit routes for campus and for getting around, and their proximity from where you live. 
Secure your essentials like toilet paper first (LOL). Once you're more adjusted, you can begin incorporating things that will help you settle in better. But having food, necessities, and knowing how to get to school are the big three.
Get organized, but don't stress. One step at a time. If you use a planner, this could help with making sure you get everything you need to done.
A: If you're going to be living on res (residence/on-campus),
Get to know your neighbours / classmates.
Join clubs if you're into that.
Set up study groups (ideally with people that will help you successfully study)
Q: ""Do you have any tips on finding a landlord and roomies?""
A: Looking for places to stay can be hard. Checking Facebook group postings on rent/roomies, Craigslist, Kijiji, etc. Friends or family that can room with you could be fun.
Q: ""How would you recommend staying budget-conscious as a student?""
A: Give yourself a rough approximation on budgets for food, essentials, transit, and use the leftovers to treat yourself to some outings, coffees, etc. Be mindful of the budgets you set for yourself, and keep tabs each month on how much you went under/over and adjust where you need to.
Q: ""Any other advice you could pass on?""
A: Check out academic advising, undergraduate or student union buildings, and learn about their help resources early on. I like to go on campus before the first week of classes to find where all of my classes are and in what buildings. Get to know the campus a little before it goes into a flash mob mode. Find good study spots!
- - -
And there you have it! I can't stress how valuable the last bit of advice is, because I have literally called and messaged my friends because I got lost in a building trying to find my class LOL. But students are quite a friendly bunch - I've had an engineering student walk up to me and ask if they could help me find my building, and then they accompanied me because their class was there too. This came back around when I was in my 3rd year, with a student coming up to me and asking if I knew where their class's building was. In the end, having a tour of the campus will be good for you! If UNBC has freshman tours before classes, I think it'd be worthwhile to sign up and see how beautiful your campus is. :)
Thank you for your insight on rural communities too! I don't get off the island enough so I definitely had to Google where Port Coquitlam is but WOW I think you're closer to Vancouver than I am LOL. I love it! I guess I'd love to know how they take to newcomers moving in, as I've heard from other mentees that they know everyone who lives in their community. How do you integrate into a tight-knit community like that? What are the charms of rural community living? How do they manage with limited resources (e.g. physician shortage)? :) 
Have an awesome rest of your Spring Break! I'm so happy your dad's ex recommended our program to you, and that they paired you with me TT v TT.

Hi,
Ok, I know I replied to you eight days ago but I guess it didn't send. (I really love my school's wifi)
If you happen to hear any advice about moving away for university, it would be most welcome!
I've been okay, it's spring break (fianaly)!
So funny story... I don't live in a rual community. ヽ(´ー｀)┌ This mentoring program was suguested to me by my dad's ex and it seemed cool. I live in Port Coquitlam which is about a 40 minute drive from Vancouver (not supper rual). But, I'm not completely lacking in the rual community knowledge. My time is bassically divided between lovely Port Coquitlam (when I have work and school), the Cariboo, and the Sunshine Coast. We have lots of family friends who live in rual communites and I do spend a lot of my time with them. I can probably tell you most of what you want to know about life in a rual community from my experiences and stories I've been told. Something that might be worth checking out would be Facebook groups for rual regions. Rual communities survive off neighbours helping eachother so they share a lot on these Facebook groups. Try ""South Green Lake Community Group"" and ""Pressy Lake Strong"" (The whole area got burned by forest fires in 2017 and countless people lost their homes, hence the strong part), look for big lakes and smaller regions then their Facebook groups. As you probably know, older people post EVERYTHING!
If you have any specific questions about living in a rual community I can probably help you out.

Hello,
Congrats on the interviews! I hope they all give you job offers!
I think I've decided to go to UNBC in the fall, so that involves moving away from home. Now the majority of my thoughts are about how I'm gonna manage, what I'm gonna need and everyone and everything I'm going to miss. I think the change will be good though. It won't be easy but it will push me out of my comfort zone and no matter what happens I'll grow as a person. 
Thank you for the finding inspiration advice. It does help to look to others for inspiration and I should appreciate how far I've come more than I do.

Hi Mentee,
While our experiencees are unique, I think we're sharing the mutual emotions of uncertainty / slump-ness (most defs not a word LOL) at the moment! But we're reaching our breakthroughs, I just know it.
Like you mentioned in one of our earlier messages in this conversation: Sometimes, we need to get out of our comfort zones and take the chance. The structure of school as you've known it for the last 12 years will definitely change come this Fall... and it's going to be different each semester for the next 4+ years. I think coming in as a freshman, you really can't fully prepare for what's to come - With added freedom comes added responsibility. You're going to be in charge of your own learning for the first time and that's a big deal. But you've taken and are still taking the steps you need to put your best efforts forward. The first semester will be a learning curve, but you must've felt that way with something new, whether it's a new skill to learn, or a new concept in class. But you learn, adapt, and grow. No matter where you end up in September, you'll be surrounded by so much intelligent people and so many new opportunities. I know and you know that you've got what it takes to not only maintain, but to reach even higher standards of success and learning. Take it step by step and enjoy the journey, even if you're not sure of where you're headed!
Just as a note for the next couple of weeks: Right now, I'm in the middle of applying for and interviewing for new jobs, so that's been keeping me very on edge and busy - I apologize in advance if my responses take a bit longer than usual during this time!
Question: Where do I pull inspiration from, especially when nothing seems inspiring?
Answer: I genuinely look to the people that inspire me the most, and my own experiences. For example, seeing the efforts of strangers on the internet is something, but if you personally resonate with them and their story, you'll gain something more than someone else. But say you personally know that person, and this puts you in a position of truly knowing their story and why their success is extra meaningful. Additionally, although I like to plan and plan and plaaaaaaaaaan for the future, sometimes, we need to look back and see how far we've come. While we always move the goal post further, it's valuable to acknowledge our own efforts and achievements too. When I went through a rough first semester of university, I thought back to how hard I worked in high school, and how this wasn't the reflection of ""me"" that I wanted for myself. That time really inspired me to get my grades back up and go for what I knew I could achieve. I hope these words helped you out!

Hello,
It's nice to see that we had someone similar ideas about the quality of the video. XD
I have mixed feelings about the last few months of high school. I want to be done with my school, I'm honestly getting bored. At least my schedule is easy so I'm focusing a lot on scholarships...and trying to recover from last semester's burnout which may have been what put me into this slump. I am happy to say I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm getting close to being out of my slump (I hope). Even though I want to be done with school I'm also a little scared because there is so much uncertainty. I still don't know where I'll be in the fall but I do know I will be going to university. School has been a safety net for the past 12 years. I've been able to rely on it always being there, no matter what happened in life I would still be going to school in the fall. That's kinda gone now. At least it looks like I'll be having a proper grad! 
Question: Where do you get your inspiration? Especially where nothing is inspiring you. I need something other than Pinterest.

Hi Mentee,
I've also been in a slump myself (＞﹏＜). But I found working bit by bit, day by day, to change factors that contribute to the slump can help melt the layers that built the slump snowball in the first place. Whether it's making big strides or baby steps of change, as long as we're moving forward, getting up, and trying again. •́‿•̀｡
Also, keep that mindset of yours! Back in university, my friends would recommend me ""easy A"" / ""GPA boosting"" electives that, while nice for the grades, wouldn't be satisfying for my own learning. I opted to take courses in health research and ethics, which ended up being some of the classes that inspired me the most. Keep being purposeful with your choices, and know what you want for your own future!
With that being said...
Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words
What I interpreted from the video was that different scenarios, backgrounds, and experiences will influence how one will come up with their idea. While some may want genuiness in the form of related experiences, others will pull ideas from beyond that.
Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea
Ngl... The video was quite dry and the background music did not help LOL. But I thought that we could tie the theme of intention and spontaneity together when forming creative thoughts. While you can begin with the intention to plan, sometimes it's impossible to know further ahead than that. That's where a quote like Lea Pool's comes in: ""Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life.""
Questions you might have about the idea(s)
Tbh, none really. (._.)
How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future
It's really about knowing yourself, your situation, and how far you're willing to go to make that connection.
Thanks for asking about Atomic Habits! Truthfully, I haven't gotten too far in the past couple of weeks due to February being a jam packed month. But I'll definitely pass along my favorite / useful quotes to you when I come across them! <3 How about you? How are you feeling about these last few months of being in high school?

Hello,
I am in a little slump so this is a good topic for right now. :)
This is not what I was expecting for this topic. I watched the video about the creative process, interestingly enough we just finished focusing on the creative process in my creative writing class. (I only took the class because I needed to change my schedule and when my counsellor suggested it, I was scared she would suggest drawing or sculpting which isn't what I want to do).
To answer the questions:
Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words
Everyone will have their impressions of creative and non-creative works and our pasts will influence how we see the world and the creative stuff that comes with it.
Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea
I got a little bored. It didn't make me feel anything. '_'
How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future
Right now I want to go into science. I know there's a strong aspect of creativity in science. 
I didn’t notice the quotes until after I attempted to answer the questions. I would like to comment on Denys, I think you should also take chances and look at other experiences and leave your comfort zone sometimes.
Anyways, how is Atomic Habits going? Any good tips?

Hi Mentee,
I love that attitude! ... Probably because I share the same characteristic. LOL.
At the moment, I'm most inspired by ambition and motivated by my past. I mentioned this in my profile, but I went through a time of study defeat and redemption after a significant life event. I really lost my way when it came to academics, which reflected on my grades. But then I thought about if this was the type of student I wanted to be, if I was giving it my all... And then a switch got flipped. Got up and got those grades higher. I aimed for my best and for my own standard of excellence. Now I'm thinking of my next steps, which is where the ambition comes in! While I want to think practical, I'm also dreaming big... What are the steps I need to take in order to make leaps?
My brother also told me that we'll all be 40 eventually. Might as well be 40 and had given your dreams and goals your best shot!
Have a happy Friday and an even happier weekend, my mentee!

Hi,
Thank you for the hug and high-five (even if it was virtual) and the compliments!
Finding inspiration 👍
My future inspires me, thinking about everything I want in life is what keeps me going. I am also very motivated through spite, when people tell me that I can't do something, that I shouldn't do something, I want to prove them wrong and do it anyway. When I don't get up in the morning I think of everything I've put into what I have and everything I still need to do for what I want.

Hi Mentee,
Before we get started on this new topic, I just wanted to give you suchhhhhhhh a big hug and high five on completing your Capstone Project! (つ≧▽≦)つ Reading your Capstone Project paper, your hard work and effort really shined through, and I couldn't be more proud of the work you've put in. Thinking back to when you first started MentorCity, you would mention your Capstone throughout our conversations, the research and hours that you were pouring into it, finding people to contact, and I just knew your efforts would pay off. You deserve that 100% and I hope you did a little happy dance getting that grade back, because the entire time reading I was like, ""OKAY THERE, MENTEE. YAS, TELL ME MORE ABOUT CRISPR AND EBOLA."" (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ I felt the education running through my veins- LOL. Alright, now that your mentor is done gushing about how proud she is of you, we can look into this new topic that we just unlocked (lolol).
So... Finding Inspiration. Before reviewing the contents of this conversation, I wanted to start by asking ourselves, ""From where do we derive our inspiration from""? So, Mentee, what inspires you to pursue what you do, and where do you find those ""sparks"" of inspiration in your day-to-day?

Hello,
I thought I replied but I guess not. 🤷‍♀️
I doubt they would stop an entire grad year from getting their dual dogwoods, there are other requirements (a certain number of French classes for example). It's not in our control and we might still do them it's just because of staffing shortages. 
 
I don't see the Finding Inspiration option yet.
 
I completed my Capstone and presented it Tuesday, I got 100%!!! It's worth 50% of my grade for the class and I worked so hard. I'll attach the link to the research paper I wrote.

Hi Mentee,
Welcome back! I had a feeling you had a lot going on in terms of school (and let's be real, everything else LOL), but I just knew we'd get back into mentoring when we got to it. Honestly though, what is in the 2022 air recently? The days feel extra long even when packed with so many things to do. I hope you're managing it all well, which I know you are! :D
Hm... I just checked the gov's website and that's a tricky one. Is there anything your school could arrange for students wanting to graduate with dual Dogwoods for the 2021/2022 school year? Maybe getting a dual Dogwood post-graduation could be a possibility? But I guess with the cancellation of all provincial assessments, it's more so a waiting game to see when they'd resume them... Whatever the case may be, fingers-crossed that they resume soon so you can get that on your graduation!
Speaking of graduation, congratulations on your DELF B2 score! Having another language you can speak and operate confidently with is such an asset and is just so neat to have. I know there are some university professional programs that offer seats exclusively for their French-speaking streams (off the top of my head, UOttawa's MD Program), and certain government positions you can only qualify for as a bilingual candidate - These are just more doors open for you in the future!
Finding Inspiration coming right up! (Sorry if this convo is a bit on the shorter side, just gotta get ready for work! Lol! Will get more into it for our next one. ^__^)

Hello,
I just realized that it's been 8 days since you sent that last message. Finals weeks is so much fun 🥲! Anyways, hectic two weeks since returning to school and I am grateful that I don't need to go back to school until next Tuesday...I still have work to do though for my Capstone and chemistry. My French Immersion Literacy 12 Assessment was supposed to be today but the government cancelled all the provincial assessments until further notice, considering I need to pass the French Literacy to get my dual Dogwood, I am not sure how that's going to work. Though on a postive note, I got my DELF B2 exam marks back and I passed (one of the top students in my class!), so now I am officially considered bilingual on an international level. (Just means I can study and work in a french speaking country) 
Firstly, maps on the inside of books are great, especially when they're super detailed. 🗺 I've seen Eragon before,I haven't read it though. Is it any good?
""be 1% better every day"" is a quote I'm fairly sure I have heard before. I aim to be better than the day before and if I'm feeling down I try and figure out how I can be better than the day before and it's not that difficult to do. There is no way you can be 100% better overnight but after a few months of improving 1% every day, 100% better than when you started seems much more attainable. Good things take time.

Hi Mentee,
Not me reading a book on building good habits and posting this at 2AM...🤦‍♀️ (Testing these copy and paste text emojis too! Yours work!).
Okay, that's what I was also thinking. Thanks for the encouragement! I'll give reading two books at the same time a shot this week, with my combo likely being Eragon for fiction and Atomic Habits for self-help. I bought the Eragon series back in the Summer time as it was my best friend's favorite series growing up and I was intrigued as to why that was. I'm also a sucker for books that have maps of the land on the inside. x) As for Atomic Habits, I've only read maybe a fourth of the way, but so far so good. I haven't actually gotten to the ""building habits"" part yet, so I can't attest to the hype, but I definitely recognize some of these quotes as posts I've seen on social media. What I've kept in mind from what I've read so far though is ""be 1% better everyday"" - Without having read the book, what do you take from that quote? Do you apply similar methodologies to your own life?
Omg it sounds like we have a mini book club in our convos! So cute! LOL. (´꒳`)♡ Speaking of convos, was there anything else you'd like to talk about in the topic of Paying for School? Wanna complete it and open another?

Hello,
I made note of this conversation and I hope to refer back to it in a few months once I am starting my post-secondary education.
Reading multiple books at once is something I highly recommend! I am usually reading at least two books at the same time. I like to have non-fiction and fiction but sometimes if the fiction is dragging I will read a book I know I can get through super fast, I'll even have an audiobook going at times if I know I will be doing something where I can listen. At the moment I am reading Astrophysics For People In A Hurry by Neil DeGrasse Tyson (non-fiction) and Girl, Serpent, Thorn by Melissa Bashardoust (Fantasy). It's great because you feel like different types of books at different times and sometimes I want to learn, other times I want to escape life, having multiple books going means there is always something I can be reading which makes it easier to read more. 
People tend to question why would I read multiple books at once, saying I will get mixed up but if you think about it, it's kinda difficult to get mixed up between a fantasy novel and a non-fiction book about the creating of the universe. 
Is Atomic Habits good? I keep hearing about it, is it worth the hype? ~(˘▾˘~)

Hi Mentee,
Totally agree! I tried to get into research a bit too late in my degree and it unfortunately didn't work out. But, that's why I'm here - To help pass on what I learned from my experiences to help make yours even more stellar (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ ｡･:*:･ﾟ’☆. To branch off the advice you were given, I'll give you the advice that my research professor told me: You should have interest in the research you're doing. I know that sounds really simple and well, obvious, but interest will help you keep pushing through the more mundane parts of research.
What I personally learned in my short-span of research was:
While finding a professor who is actively researching, also look into their work. What fields of research do they specialize in? Is that something that would align with your interests? Keeping in mind that some professors may have past published work that isn't reflective of their current research today. And as you mentioned, even if their research isn't directly related to your studies, this could be a great opportunity to learn a different specialization / field of STEM you weren't exposed to before.
When you meet up with that professor, have an idea of the kinds of research you're interested in, the skills you can offer, and more. Just like a job interview, you should be prepared to answer their questions too!
Some professors might not have any positions available, some may lose their funding, and some might not even get back to you - and that's more than alright! It's still worth it to get your name and interest out there, because they'll be able to keep you in mind for future opportunities.  
Personal example 1: When I talked to a professor, while he wasn't researching at that moment, he was willing to network me with a doctor he knew who was.
Personal example 2: A professor emailed me months later about an upcoming grant they had, which also meant funding for a research student!
Looking back, while it was unfortunate that the pandemic affected this opportunity, it's neat how I can still somehow pass my knowledge onto someone (my mentee)!
I've been recently reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, and had a thought to start one of the books you recommend at the same time. Have you had success reading multiple books at once? Or just finish them one at a time?

Hello,
Research and even working in a science lab seems like a really go idea. For my Capstone project I talked to a few professor's about their research, as well as some grad students and the general two peices of advice I got were to network with professors and other people working in labs and to get working in science as soon as possible even if it's not directly related to your studies. 
Thank you for the scholarship resources! there were a few I hadn't heard of. ヽ(´▽`)/

Hi Mentee,
ASDFGHJKL I am SCREAMING. As your post-secondary mentor trying to set an example, I can't say I encourage illegal content, and I can't say that I may or may not know of that site or similar ones on this platform. But... being a post-secondary graduate, and with you being an incoming post-secondary student, I think we have an unspoken, mutual understanding LOLLLL (☞°ヮ°)☞ ☜(°ヮ°☜).
Truthfully, I think I've given you all of the limited tips that I do have for scholarships, so I did a bit of exploring inside and outside of the box:
Inside the Box:
https://mentorcity.com/en/mentoring_resources/1845
These were the scholarship sources found under the Resources section of the ReMBC platform. Let me know if you can't access it / if there are any scholarship sources that you wanted to look at together!
Outside of the Box:
https://students.ubc.ca/career/ubc-experiences/nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards
https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/students/student-awards/jcura/index.php
I was thinking, especially with the direction of your studies, that you would get a lot of value out of conducting research during your undergraduate degree. Funding and payments for these opportunities could be found via grants, awards like NSERCs and the JCURA, as well as networking through your faculty / labs / professors. You have to apply for these awards and meet the mininum criteria (usually high academic standing), but although they're not explicitly stated to be scholarships, successful applicants do get financial payment in some form. I've also heard of students publishing their work in an academic research paper as a first, second, etc. author, which is such a cool opportunity as an undergrad! If you plan to do grad studies, apply to professional programs (like med school), or would like to contribute to research, I'd highly encourage you to check opportunities like these out at your chosen school(s) to see what they're about. ⁽⁽◝( • ω • )◜⁾⁾
Hm... On that note, I think you could also look into some on-campus work-study opportunities, like a professor needing a lab assistant. Or posting on your school's job board that you're available for tutoring for certain classes and for your chosen rates. Just thinking of some side hustles that I saw while I was a student! 
I'll think of some more money-saving and lifestyle tips throughout the week as we message! Have an awesome rest of your week!

Hi,
I know a website, you may know it too, https://z-lib.org/ it has digital versions of every book for free. Is it legal? Probably not, but it saves money. I have found my school textbooks that they give us in class on it simply because I also didn't want to carry mine around. It's also good for novels and reading for pleasure if you don't want to spend money on a certain book. 
(From my understanding it is illegal to upload pirated content but it is legal to download it.)
ヽ(´ U`)人(´∇｀)/
What are your scholarship application tips? 
I'm finding it hard to find scholarships in the first place and sometimes it feels pointless to apply to some of them. 
We've kinda touched on this already, but do you have any more tips for organizing your finances in school and paying for school? Or any tips for life in general? Those are always welcome (＾ｖ＾)

Hi Mentee,
Not the both of us being Friend 4's... (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞. Getting asked about plans 4 months in advance and we're still booked and busy?! I mean *shrug*. WE GOTTA DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO LOL. 
So I've moved onto page 2 of Paying for School, and it seems like this is what we were looking for on page 1! Looks to have a lot of scholarship, bursary, grant, and loan information that we can go through together, and even some money saving tips for post-secondary. Which reminds me about their point 2, Textbooks and Materials: 
I'd encourage you to try not to buy your textbooks ahead of time, or at least wait until your first day to see if you really need them (though most STEM classes I've needed my textbooks). I used to buy my textbooks as soon as the list came out, trying to beat the rush and get ahead with my coursework and readings. But come first day, the professor is going over the syllabus and drops, ""Everything testable will be on my slides, the textbook is just for optional, additional readings"". I wish I knew that during my first year before I was lugging my body weight in books! I also opted for digital versions of my textbooks if available, but always bought used texts if I could (seriously, the used ones go so quickly because they're typically in such good shape!). Lockers do exist on campus, but I found they'd be so far out of the way from my buildings, that it'd be much more convenient to just carry everything in my backpack like a turtle. 
It's probably too early to see Fall 2022's textbook list, but if you wanted to see Spring 2022's list and get a feel for looking up what books/materials you'll need in the Fall, you can try clicking through SFU's Bookstore.
You'll first select which campus you'll be attending, then the courses you'll be taking the first semester. Say, Chem 110, Math 100, Phys 101. Once you've got all your classes in, you'll then be able to see what new and used materials are available in the bookstore! And note: Some classes don't have a textbook, so that's why it might be blank. This process should be the same if you wanted to explore UBC's Bookstore as well as your other schools of choice.
Happy weekend!

Hi,
That meme is very relatable :). Now that everyone has clubs, jobs, classes outside the timetable, homework/studying, sports and more it is so hard to find a time where all my friends can be together. We've been so busy this year that we've gone weeks without eating lunch together at school, which seems like the easiest time to meet up but I don't think there is the easiest time anymore. I've been friend 4 too, my friends learned that if they wanted me to attend something I need at least 2-3 weeks notice and even that wasn't always enough. I remember one person gave me four months notice and I wasn't able to make it then because I already had something planned. \_(°~°)_/

Thank you SO much for your recommendations! (*＾ω＾)人(＾ω＾*) Omg, The Night Circus cover art caught my eye already... And the ratings are so promising (´♡‿♡`). I'll be taking your list with me when I next go to the used bookstore, so I can't wait to pick some of these up! 
I really love how you phrased the goal: ""Honoring commitments and promises to myself"". You're so right - Why is it that we uphold our end of pinky swears for others, but when making pinky swears to ourselves, we're more easy to let those slide? Not on our watch for 2022! And yes, please make time for friends and family regularly! They will help you recharge in ways that only they can do.
There's this meme of making plans as an adult that goes something like:
Group: Let's catch up! When are you all free?
Friend 1: Yay! I'm free on Fridays!
Friend 2: I can only meet up on weekends
Friend 3: I'm free on Mondays - Wednesdays only
Friend 3: I can meet on the next full moon
Friend 4: I'm free in 2023

I was literally Friend 4 at one point LOL. I was booking hangouts like a month in advance... it was so sad and not cute!!! So yeah, if you've got a free afternoon, take advantage of it!

Hi,
Book recs! I've got so many, I am just going to list all the books I gave 5 stars to in 2021 to keep the list short.
The Hill We Climb - Amanda Gorman (it's the book version of her Inaugural Poem)
The House in the Cerulean Sea - T.J. Klune (Adult fantasy+Found family+good plot+good characters+ Queer representation+good ending)
When God was a Rabbit - Sarah Winman
The Sun and Her Flowers / Milk and Honey - Rupi Kaur (as a woman I related to a lot of this)
Peace and Good Order: The Case for Indigenous Justice in Canada - Harold R. Johnson (I read it in 2019 and I read it again this year because of how relevant it is)
The Book of Two Ways - Jodi Picoult 
The Night Circus - Erin Morgenstern (One of my favourite books, to describe this book in one word it would be ✿magical ✿) 
Night - Elie Wiesel (short, about his experience in the Nazi concentration camps)
The Midnight Library - Matt Haig (It's supper popular but I liked the concept and way the story was told)
5 stars for me means best or the best, to think I only gave 9/86 books 5 starts this year... shows the high standard I suppose. 
I like the idea of being more committed! I try to be in a continuous state of improving myself and moving forward while also going easy on myself. I'm starting to realize that something as small as watching an episode of a series can have positive benefits for me, and it's okay to binge watch an entire series in a day every once in a while if I need a break from life. 
My (very rough) goals for 2022:
Do something (ex. Coffee, walk, dinner) with at least one friend and family member each month.
Take a propper break daily (even if it's only 15 minutes)
Honour my comittments and promisses to myself. I'm good at keeping them with other people but not myself. 
Lastly, trying to be more productive and doing more ahead of time. (We shall se how that goes ┐('～`)┌) 
I'm ready to move onto the second part of paying for school!

Hi Mentee,
86 books?! That's amazing! Could you recommend me some of your favorites? I used to read quite a bit when I was younger, but as bigger responsibilities began taking more and more time, books were sadly pushed further and further down my priority list. I did *try* getting back into reading last year as a means to ""unplug"" from electronics (literally read 1 book LOL), but you made a great point of maturing with your reading. I'll have to check out books that are more aligned with my interests now that I'm older. ( o˘◡˘o) ┌iii┐
I totally feel the same! Someone asked me how my 2022 was going... And I just responded with, ""It feels like 2021 but in January"" LOL. I usually give myself a to-do list everyday and that'll carry through throughout the week, but having January 1st as a starting point doesn't feel all too different than having January 3rd, March 4th, etc. But giving it a thought, I told myself I wanted to be more committed this year. Committed to even minute changes that help improve the Mentor now and tomorrow. It's not a firm resolution like ""give up junk food!"" (as if I could give up french fries!!!), but I'd love to meet my goals through conscious efforts of discipline and a commitment to be better.
Let me know what your 2022 goals are when you've got them! And when you want to move onto the second part of Paying for School, let me know that too!

HAPPY NEW YEAR! ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
Winter break is extended because of COVID, we're supposed to be going back on the 10th but they might make us go online (・へ・).
Mentor's Advice Corner (I like it!), good advice! It got me thinking about what I used to do for pastimes that I don't do anymore. I've been consistent with lots of mine, reading is one of the bigger ones (I read 86 books in 2021). I noticed lots of my pastimes, like reading, have been maturing with me which is interesting. I think the only big pastime I had when I was younger that I don't do anymore is art. I used to draw and paint all the time now I find I need to be encouraged to do it. I'll do the odd artistic thing but nothing as elaborate or time consuming as I used to. 
As far as new year's resolutions... elementary and middle school kinda wreaked them for me, we would always spend so much time on them and I never really saw the point. Personally I noticed that I never really feel a big change between December 31st and January 1st, which makes it hard to find goals and resolutions to start the year off with. I try and set new goals all the time, so I haven't been able to think up anything, I've tried though! Of course, I want to do better than the year before but I know that in September lots is going to change and I am trying to be as realistic as possible. What are your resolutions? I should spend some time thinking about what I want from 2022 during my extended winter break. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Also, I don't know where you've been getting the emojis from (I still don't get why mentorcity got rid of them) but I've just been copying them from a Wikipedia page but some of them are so elaborate! This is one is someone flipping a table -> (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ I wonder who came up with that?

OMG... Not me thinking that Google's ""Year in Search"" was a yearly recap of everything I've Googled over the year... I was about to cringe until 2022. LOL. But I've actually never seen these videos before, so this was so neat! Thanks for sharing! When I come across something not so meme-y and more inspire-y, I'll send it along your way ٩(๑･ิᴗ･ิ)۶٩(･ิᴗ･ิ๑)۶.
Extended winter break because of all the snow we've been having? Because what the h e c k a r o o is going on like weather pls... T__T. But also with all these illnesses going around, please be safe! We'll make it through this!
Yeah! I'm not sure about other schools so you'll have to check their FAQs, but I used my student card for everything. Loading your card with money and spending it that way offered discounts when buying food, textbooks, etc. I totally recommend it if you're going to be buying a muffin on campus anyway, might as well save $ where you can. And nice, there's nothing like a sprinkle of worry to top off an already stressful time (ノ°∀°)ノ⌒･*:.｡. .｡.:*･゜ﾟ･*☆. But seriously! Trust in yourself more! You know what you're doing, you know the direction you're going, and while you may make mistakes and life will throw some spicy days at you, you've gotten up stronger each and every time.
I guess we can use that as a segway to Mentor's Advice Corner! 乁( • ω •乁) Hm... Something that I've been thinking about recently is how we're at this prime age of discovering who we are and learning more about the world. So while we give love to the planet in the ways we already do, we shouldn't forget to give love to ourselves. This naturally comes in the forms of self-care (physical, emotional), but it's also present in trying new hobbies, re-visiting old pastimes, and my personal favorite, really going for our goals and dreams. So, let's ring 2022 with the mindset that while there are only a finite number of choices we can make every moment, we've still got unlimited possibilities everyday! 
Any new years resolutions for you, my mentee? I've got 24 hours to come up with mine still! Lol!

Hi,
Happy holiday season to you too! At this point it look like I'm getting an extended winter break which has its pros and cons. ;-;
Thank you for you tips regarding paying for school and saving money. I didn't know that your student ID card does so much. They really don't tell you how much you need to be considering in your grade 12 year... even for post secondary school wether moving away or staying home I've started having these moments where when I'm doing something I think about how it might be affected next school year. Fun times ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Hi Mentee,
Wishing you, your family, and friends a happy holiday season! Hope you get some time to relax and the opportunity to do the things you love during your Winter break (besides the ever present Capstone project). ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆
So, paying for school. I totally had the same mindset as you when I first started post-secondary: Avoid student loans at all costs (if I could help it)! Ideally, you'd want to hit the ground running upon graduating... Not struggling to stay afloat after being buried in student debt. I paid my way through school completely on my own and that's something I've been very proud of. I hope by sharing my experiences that you'll get inspiration on how to do so too! I'd be happy to share with you how I did it on the caveat that our experiences will be different. You can get an idea of how I was able to fund my education, and see how you could fit the structures that apply to you for your own schooling. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) Now, onto...
""How did you pay for school?""
I took a gap year. I worked nearly full-time / studied part-time after graduating high school and while I was in my University Transfer program at college. This was done because at the time, my mother was quite ill, we had lost a stream of income, and I helped care for her after class. While I used part of my income for household bills, I saved everything else for future full-time studies.
After transferring to university, I switched to full-time studies / part-time work. I would work at my local grocery store on the weekends to earn tuition money!
I did this for 2 years, until the Summer of my 2nd year at uni, where I went on my first paid co-op work term. I would do this every other semester as per our program's model, but typically, you'd find Summers are the best time to work (usually no classes). I earned enough at the end of each work term (3-4 months) to finance my next semester of study. 
Co-ops can be a minimum of 12 weeks to a year, depending on the position. Not to be confused with unpaid internships, co-op positions are paid work placements where students can get experience with real employers! Yes, you can even work for your uni (I did hahaha)!
Schools typically post co-op positions, student work/study positions, on-campus positions, etc. on their job board. Students can also find positions themselves and work with their co-op coordinators to see how it fits in their curriculum. Just like ""real"" jobs, some of these positions will be looking for students from certain fields of study (e.g. Lab assistant / research assistant postings may be looking for STEM majors with lab experience). Find what you're interested in, see if you can realistically incorporate it into your schedule (without jeopardizing your studies), and build meaningful networks while also feeding your bank account!
I had a bit of money from scholarships (i.e. BC Passport to Education) and winning an award from university. Although my winnings were modest, it was still appreciated. Think about it, you're getting paid because you're doing well in school! How neat because you were gonna do well anyway. 8)
""Scholarship application tips?""
Similar to what was mentioned in the articles, you should try to shoot your shot to the scholarships that you qualify for. Although I didn't apply to scholarships I didn't qualify for (and frankly, didn't apply to as many as I should have), I'm not sure if I could recommend it. The worst outcome is you not getting chosen, but the best outcome is winning it! Where's the loss in that? :)
You also have the right idea to apply to your local/personalized scholarships from your school. Look into grants and other funding that you don't have to pay back!
Just did a quick Google (literally ""bc scholarships"" LOL) but maybe exploring pages like these and seeing if you qualify? BC Excellence Scholarship.
As we talked about before too, some scholarships you don't even have to apply for, as your school will notify you if you've gotten one! Typically these are renewable so long as you maintain a minimum grade point average per semester (For example, my friend had to maintain a 3.7+ / 4.0 for her scholarship).
""Do you have any money-saving tips for University / College?""
I lived at home. I know this may not be possible or applicable for every student's case, but this was the most substantial way I've saved money, as the money that would've otherwise gone to rent, went into tuition. 
I did not use private transport. As mentioned in our Post-Secondary Considerations chat, bus passes were incorporated into our tuition payments. While I could have used a car and paid for parking, I thought to make the most out of what I was already paying for and commute to school via transit everyday.
I tried to pack my own food. Emphasis on tried. Campus food is expensive. I repeat: Campus food is expensive! LOL. No, you won't go broke getting a $5 coffee everyday, but it does add up. You can probably pack more nutritious, cheaper in the long run meals, but do keep your account topped up in case you get hungry in between study sessions (by account I mean your school ID card, which also serves as your bus pass, school ID, library card, form of payment, etc). 
I personally wish I did this, but I found out my friend was working part-time on campus in a computer lab. He was a computer science major, which made this experience applicable to his field of study. But during times when the labs were quiet, he was able to work on his homework, assignments, labs, etc. Literally getting paid experience that's relevant to his degree while being able to study at the same time! Triple KO! 
Your SFU essay was so cute! I love the part of the Little Library, because honestly, some of the best childhood moments are made from reading words on a page. I did notice some elements of your UBC app in there too! What your strength is in answering these questions is your forward-thinking: You answer their question, but you round it out by explaining what you're doing now, and how it'll shape your future. Let me know if you want another pair of eyes (or rather, four-eyes since I'm a glasses wearer lolol 8) ) to look anything over! 
Happy holidays again, my mentee! Sending you a virtual hot chocolate on my side of BC. :)

The topic: What personal experiences and events have shaped your outlook on life and how do you feel this will contribute to you being a positive member of the SFU community? Why do you feel this makes you an excellent candidate for your chosen area of study at SFU?
 
my response: I cut oranges like my grandmother. I still tell the joke one of my childhood friends declared to me in second-grade math class. I remind myself of advice that my teacher whispered to me because I struggled to believe in myself. Many big moments shaped my life. On my first day of kindergarten, my world opened up. My life has never been the same since the day my mom died. And the pandemic has made me want to pursue a career in infectious disease research. Were it not for those events I would be a completely different person. But it's the small skills and experiences that I have gathered from other people that formed who I am. People change. Every new experience, every new piece of advice, every new day and every new person shape who we become. We are all exceedingly unaware of the impact we have on each other. I started learning Latin during the summer, now one of my friends randomly says Latin words and phrases in conversations, like me. My coworker washes towels using the trick I taught him to get even more dirt out. My french teacher still references the inside joke I started in September. I have changed them. I care about the people and the world around me. I have learned that the world does not change with one person working their own. Nor does it change with one big move. Tiny changes, millions of good ideas and teams of people with a common goal change the world. One step forward is better than standing still. So every day, I take small steps forward. 
At school, I run the Model United Nations Club. I see how a little encouragement and teamwork can provide people with more confidence and less nervousness when speaking before a group. Maybe they're not ready to speak in front of a massive audience, but they are more confident than they were before. I maintain my Ranger Unit's Little Library. I never imagined how important it could be to people. A few weeks ago, I stopped by to add more books in time to overhear a young boy excitably saying to his mother ""I want to stop and get a book!"", his mother told him that he could grab one after his swimming lesson. I smiled, knowing that he might get to read one of my favourite books from when I was a child that I had added. Soon, I will pass on the Little Library to one of the younger members of my unit. I am sad to let it go; but happy that someone else will get to impact Port Coquitlam the way I have. I care about others. I am a passionate, critical thinker and long-term thinker. Small steps change the world, and I've already started walking.

Hi,
I have been accepted to the University of Northern British Columbia (Bachelors of Health Sciences - Biomedical Major). So that's cool.
Winter break is finally here - not that school is over (I just spent three hours working on my Capstone project),
So, paying for school! The Maclean's video was interesting and I read the article that went with it. I skimmed the MyBluePrint one, it was super long and I am tired. We use MyBluePrint in school and it's not bad so I might take a deeper look at it later. 
I expected it to help a little with finding scholarships and all that. To be honest student loans seem like a bad idea and they are something I want to avoid. 
I applied for the SFU entrance scholarships yesterday (I will include my essay down below) and I am hoping to apply for a scholarship that is supper specific and only for students at my school in the spring. 
Other than the questions above: How did you pay for school? Scholarship application tips? Do you have any money-saving tips for university/college?

Hi Mentee,
(つ✧ω✧)つ Okay, we stan a STEM variety queen! Infectious disease sounds SO cool!!!
I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I did a university transfer program from college to uni, and a few of my friends did also. What I found was that university transferrable courses were offered at much more affordable prices at college compared to if you took those courses at university -- Why? Idk. LOL. But that can save you mad $$$, which will somehow end up being invested back into school anyway (sigh) hahaha. 
But personally, I found I preferred and thrived in the large class sizes at university compared to the small class sizes of college. My friend preferred the opposite. If used as a stepping stone, college can be a smart way to kinda ""dip your toes"" into post-secondary before wading into the university pool, while saving hundreds of dollars. Otherwise, both institutions provide quality education and it's really all about what you're looking to get out of school.
With all this said, let's start this topic!

Hi,
For Douglas, I applied for the science program. I can't remember if I mentioned this but, my plan (if I end up going there) is to transfer to a university after 2 years. For the other schools, it was a variety of microbiology, immunology, health sciences, (might have been an infectious disease in there), I gave myself options based on what the school offered. 
I am looking forward to your advice on this topic! (/◕ヮ◕)/

Hi Mentee,
I realized after I completed and closed our Conversation that I asked what program(s) you decided to apply for in college in my last message (but only if you were alright with revealing that). Like... I really just asked that and dipped LOL. My bad! If you wanted to talk about it before starting this topic, we can do that. Otherwise, we can just dive right into how we can pay for school! Probably one of the topics I have the most experience with! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

Hi Mentee,
Congratulations! °˖✧◝(˃ᴗ˂)◜✧˖° (If MentorCity removes emojis, we're just gonna have to improvise LOL).
While Douglas College may not be your first choice, it's still an acceptance nonetheless! Do you mind me asking what program(s) you've decided to apply for?
The reason I ask is because my friend actually entered university as a General Science major, or something along those lines. They didn't know what they wanted to go into right at the jump, and waited before declaring their major - Now they're in Biomedical Engineering and loving it! Although you sound like you've got your plan down pat, I thought it'd be worthwhile to mention that it's alright to explore your options before committing to a degree. Taking courses that can apply to others (e.g. Math 100, Chem 121) can give you that flexibility should you be interested in finding out what sciences have to offer first, before deciding which you'll graduate with.
I guess talking about scholarships was a great segway into opening the next Convo... Onto Paying for School we go!

Hi,
I got accepted to Douglas College yesterday, it's conditional but the only thing that would get my acceptance taken back is if i get lower than a C in english 12 and considering for the past 3 years I've had over 90%...I think I'll be fine. Douglas isn't my first choice but it's comforting to have that option if my other four options don't work out. 
I did not know about the ""in-course scholarships"" or department nominations, so that is very good to know!
I guess Paying for School would be a good next category.

Hi Mentee,
Woo-hoo! One application down, more scholarship applications to go! :D I know it probably feels like a marathon, but it'll be so worth it - Keep it up! You're doing great, and you're almost there!
On the topic of scholarships, I will mention that while there are scholarships you can apply for once you're in uni, there are also some that you don't have to. The one's you don't have to apply for are mainly merit-based, most commonly in the form of scholarships you receive if you achieve a certain GPA per semester or higher (I believe they're called ""in-course scholarships""). Basically, the university lets you know that you've qualified, and some of these in-course scholarships are actually renewable (even better)! You can also come across some money through department nomination, as I personally have upon winning an award within my program. Post-secondary is expensive, so if you can find ways to supplement funding your education (e.g. Co-ops, working on campus, side hustle), it'll definitely help with the financial stressors of school.
On this topic of self-care, however, I think we've covered what we needed to! We just need to apply self-care now. LOL. But actually, on my end, I'm able to complete the Convo, so we're actually done here. You ready to pick out our next move on the Conversation Wheel? :)
Sending you good vibes for the rest of the week!

Hello,
 
Let's pretend I sent this sooner...
 
THANK YOU!!! Your suggestions were super helpful, I submitted my application Sunday and I am happy to be done with it. On to scholarship applications now I guess. 
I like what you said on the topic of self-care with getting regular sleep and all that. It's almost like a habit and I find that when things get more busy, stressful and tiring, it's habits that help keep me going,
Anyways, what's next? Is there more for this topic?

3 / 3 - Academic Explanation Essay
I am not going to waste time pretending I have the best grades. (Good, but you are coming in strong! LOL)
It is obvious math is not my best class, that french is not my best language or that I found chemistry 11 easy. (Although they have your transcript in front of them, I feel like saying ""It's obvious"" will draw even more attention to lower grades. While it might have not been obvious then, it's for sure obvious now!)
Suggestion(s): Maybe a less direct approach than ""It is obvious"". When explaining lower academic performance, always shine light on your improvements and how you've overcome your hardships (as you've done below).
Despite all this, I work hard, and I care about what I do. (Good.)
I have spent years working to improve my grades, and I am proud of how far I have come. (Good.)
I am not going to let my grades stand in the way of my goals. (While true, keep in mind that you're applying to a university, where they very much care about your grades. Though I know you as my mentee, how do you think a file reviewer might interpret this?)
Suggestion(s): While I understand your intention with this sentence, I think we can improve its wording and delivery: There is value in aptitude, but also in attitude. That is what you're centralizing your essay on, and if you can deliver this sentiment effectively, I think it'll be really impactful.
I've wanted to be a scientist since I was in the third grade. I've always jumped at science classes, camps and science shows. (Both sentences feel a bit out of place... Is this the best place to bring this up? If you need an extra sentence or two, I would replace these sentences with those. Maybe talk about the trends in your grades (i.e. Upward trend as you changed your mindset).)
So, maybe my grades aren't the best, but I am much more than my grades. (Good. Ties everything together.)
Alright, I think we've reviewed all of your questions so far! Thank you for letting me help you, and I hope these reviews were of help to you. As we've also reached the end of this Conversation, do you have any other questions before we complete it? What Conversation would you like me to unlock next?
I know we just talked about self-care here... But imma head to sleep now. LOL. Remember... We're always on a self-care journey.

2 / 3 - ECs
My mother registered me for Girl Guides when I was four years old. (Good.)
She had been a Girl Guide when she was younger, as had my grandma, and she wanted me to do it too. (Good.)
Thirteen years have passed (and) I am still a Girl Guide.
Girl Guides has given me countless opportunities; I've gone ziplining in Whistler, river rafting in Chilliwack, and snow camping in Manning Park. (Good.)
I've met with girls and women from across Canada and around the world. (Good.)
I've seen how Guiding, and by extension (comma?) feminism, is around the world. (Good.)
Girl Guides has challenged me, pushed me, and given me experiences that many in my peer group have not had. (Good.)
People have an idea of what a Girl Guide is. (Good.)
Yes, we camp, tie knots, and sing songs around campfires. (Good.)
Yet, I've also had hands-on experiences with; (You don't need a semi-colon here) travelling, serving my community and building new skills.
Through Girl Guides, I've also joined the Girl Guide Youth Leaders, where I regularly represent youth in Guiding. (Good.)
I've helped make Guiding in Canada more accessible and welcoming by helping to change policies and customs that exclude certain groups. (Good.)
 
At the end of grade 10, my math teacher suggested I join my school's Model United Nations club. (Good, so idk what Grammarly is seeing.)
I was hesitant. (Good.)
Almost two years later, I am now leading the club. (Good.)
Being in the club has allowed me to improve my debate skills, consider other perspectives and be more aware of the logistics regarding world politics. (Good.)
Leading the club has been a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. (Good.)
We are in the process of planning a mock conference, so club members attending VMUN in the new year can gain some practice with how a conference works. (Good, and nothing we can do with that word choice, so! Sorry, Grammarly!) 
I've made presentations, taught club members about decorum, committees and western business attire. (Good.)
Most impressive is how my fellow Head Delegates and I have successfully increased the number of club members from five to twenty-eight in less than three months. (Good, though I would maybe reconsider starting the sentence with ""Most impressive"".)
Suggestion(s): Maybe something along the lines of, ""Our most recent accomplishment...""
One of my basic jobs is running the Instagram page, where we have increased the following from 30 people to over 160. (Good.)
I enjoy leading the Model United Nations club and, (You shouldn't need a comma here) I like the impact it has on my school. 
This was a very thorough and well-worded answer! I really liked it, and your ECs are incredible ... To think, that's only 2 of them! Again, please edit up to what you're happy/comfortable with. Overall - Job well done on this!

1/3 - Father, Future
Hi Mentee,
Working on your UBC application - We love to see it! This is review 1 of 3 for the app questions you've sent, and I'll be leaving # / 3 at the beginning of my posts so you know which of my messages correspond to which question + so it'll be easier for you to find.
Below is a sentence by sentence analysis of your answer, as our goal is to optimize the word count and really be purposeful with each word we choose. While reviewing the question again, I'd recommend copying + pasting everything into Google Docs and comparing it to your original answer, so you can follow along and make the edits you like - Keeping in mind that each sentence should contribute towards fully answering the question!
Again, I'm here to help you review and raise that Grammarly score! Your story is your best asset to your application, and to keep the integrity of the application process, I really want to keep your answers as original as we can (AKA I kept as much of your words as possible and only made very minimal changes to improve flow + grammar)!  With that being said, let's get started:
Growing up, my father taught me to be a leader. (Good.)
To be confident and to make my own choices are ideals I have been raised with. (This sentence sounds incomplete, which could be fixed by simply rearranging it.)
Suggestion(s): He raised me to have confidence in myself and in the choices I make.
For years, he has been encouraging me to pursue my interests, even if I don't have others to join me. (I'm not sure why Grammarly isn't a fan of this sentence, to be honest.)
Suggestion(s): Maybe remove the 'been' and see if that improves the score.
I've learnt (Not a correction, but I personally prefer 'learned' over 'learnt', though both should be correct. Whichever you choose, just stay consistent)
to be independent and, (You shouldn't need a comma here)
to care about what I am doing and where I going. (Where I am going.)
Many things are important to me, yet they can all fit under the umbrella of my future. (Good.)
I've learnt to work for what I want (Comma) whether, (Remove comma) it's improving my grades, exercising or pursuing my interests.
Suggestion(s): I've learnt to work for what I want, whether it's improving my grades, exercising or pursuing my interests.
When I think about my reason for living, I see my future, I see an independent woman who is well educated and who cares about the world and people around her. (I think Grammarly is catching this because it's a run-on sentence.)
Suggestion(s): Separate your ideas with a period.
When I think about my reason for living, I imagine my future. I imagine a well-educated, independent woman who cares about the world and the people around her.
I strive every day to become better. (Good.)
Meaning (You don't need 'Meaning' here) I focus on my education, take care of myself and work to improve relationships with people who help me as much as I help them. 
My future is one of the few things I have truly sacrificed to have. (Again, Grammarly, why? It sounds fine to me.)
I've become good at considering the long-term effects of my actions and choices. (Good.)
I plan according to what I want in the long term, I don't mind studying late on a Saturday after work instead of watching a movie. (A run-on. Separate your sentences with a period, or use a conjunction to combine your ideas together.)
I am happy to exercise, (You shouldn't need a comma here) instead of scrolling through my phone.
It's empowering to imagine and plan for everything I can accomplish. (Good.)
Learning, that being independent does not mean forgoing asking for help, and leaving everyone behind. (I think you could look into this sentence more by playing around with the word order and see if your score improves. If being independent doesn't mean forgoing help and leaving everyone behind, what does it mean then?)
My future inspires me. (Good.)
It's the reason I wake up every morning and try. (Good.)
Overall, very minimal tweaks needed but a solid answer (though I'm not sure what the exact question is haha). Lastly, please just take my suggestions as they are meant to be... suggestions. :) When you revise your answers, while it's important to consider what what the file reviewer would think, at the end of the day, it's whether we are happy to send off that answer as our most honest selves (no regrets!)

Hi Mentee,
I love that journal snippet you included, because until now, I hadn't given it much thought on how self-empathy could be more what our bodies and souls need instead of (what is traditionally thought of as) self-care (e.g. ""Treat yo self"" moments, retail therapy, indulging in chocolates, etc). Like... We really out here staying hydrated to make up for those cry sessions. LOL.
But on this topic, I also wanted to bring up the differences of how self-care can leave us feeling, particularly, with the feeling of fulfillment. I used to be someone who could and would shop for clothes nearly weekly (insane, I know). And while I still love to shop from time to time, I grew to realize that it wasn't having the clothes in my closet that I enjoyed, but more so the shopping experience. As we grow and change, how we care for ourselves will change too. Now, what helps keep my burnouts at bay is having a skin routine that helps me feel and look my best, trying out new recipes and restaurants, and making memories I can fondly look back on! 
Overall, I think the direction we're going is: Catching up on sleep that we've missed shouldn't be classified as self-care, but regularly getting a goodnight's rest is the standard of care we should uphold ourselves to (omg... not me saying this but literally sleeping in like crazy this morning because I sleep D E P R I V E D alllll week hahahaha).
As days seem to blur together with studying/work taking up a majority of our 24 hours, I hope we can reach our goals in a mindful and healthy way - Whether they be academic, career, relationship, personal, etc. But for now, I'll let it pass that you only had 6.5 hours of sleep the other night... Though imma advocate for your brain and say pls sleep more!!! 
More messages to come!

First off, please never feel bad! Legit. I love what I do as a mentor, and seeing how engaged you are hypes me up too. How I see it is, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing as a mentee... Which is asking for mentorship LOL. So thank you for that cute bear, thank you for your response to the Self Care convo, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of your application process! I'm going to happily do my best and you keep it up (No but seriously, I dunno if I mentioned this, but English is my favorite subject and I actually like proofreading and editing stuff lolol). 
This isn't actually my reply to everything tho: I'm just popping in to say that I'll be answering all of your messages this weekend, so I hope you don't mind the extra wait! Just got that killer combo of work kicking my butt + applying for more work/research/volunteer positions + trying to make life happen all at the same time.

Hi,
Self care is such an interesting topic because in the media and all that it’s portrayed as bubble baths and scented candles and I have learnt to not see it that way. For me, self care means being a little easier on myself, it’s not beating myself up when I do less homework one night compared to what I was planning to do because I was tired and couldn’t focus, it’s getting myself a glass of ice water after I’ve bawled my eyes out over who knows what (Ice water after you have a total meltdown is a solid 10/10), it’s exercising even why I’m lacking motivation because it’s what my body needs. I was thinking about this in July and this topic reminded me about something I typed in one of my journals “Self-care is over-glorified in the media and has so many different meanings. From what I see practicing this ‘self-care is not the point, practicing self-empathy is more often than not what you need. It’s taking care of yourself like you are taking care of someone else. Sure sometimes that’s a warm bath with candles around the edge but more often than not, it’s drying your tears, eating food that is good for your body, and doing your homework, it’s reminding yourself to breathe when you forget and going to bed at a reasonable time. It’s not as big and beautiful as people say it is. “
 
Anyways, I’ll include my answers below: 
How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important? It’s easy to accept that self care is important, but do I prioritize it?…. This is such a bad thought but I would rather cry myself to sleep and ace a test the next day, vs. going to sleep happy and geting a C+. I know it’s important I just have other things I care about a bit more, which isn’t good, and I know that but still.  
What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? I don’t plan for self care, it just kinda fits into when I have time. Knowing that I’ll have X amount of minutes to do something is great and I try to make the most of even the little amount of time I have. 
Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life?  My answer is the same as yours. No one I can think of. Some things I am working on for myself though: keeping promises to myself. It’s super easy to say ‘i’ll turn off my phone and go fold my laundry at 6:30’, then at 6:32 you’re like ‘welp I missed it I guess I gotta wait until 6:45’. So working to keep even little promises and deadlines I make with myself has been a big one. I’m genuinely trying to be nice to myself, working to understand how my productivity levels change too has made it easier. 
What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself? At certain points I notice myself slipping and being meaner to myself. So when that happens know I need to work harder to be easier on myself. 
How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? I don’t know, I like what you wrote. 
How good are you at taking care of the basics of self-care:  wish me luck for this next part… 
Getting adequate sleep? Let ignore that according to my Fitbit I got 6.5 hours of sleep last night. On a side note, I discovered something this summer that has helped me so much since I have always had problems falling asleep. On Spotify, there is this podcast called ‘The Get Sleepy Podcast’ and a subsection of that called ‘The Get Sleepy Bookshelf’ REVOLUTIONARY! They’re stories designed to help you fall asleep, I connect my wireless earbuds to my phone and hit play (make sure to click the moon so it stops at the end of the episode), and I fall asleep so fast and it makes going to bed so much less frustrating. 
Eating healthy food? this is something I’ve gotten better at since COVID started. 
Drinking water? I am the poster girl for water drinking. My friends and family have always been amazed at how much water I drink. I’ve counted and it’s over 90 oz a day. 
Regular physical activity? my schedule this year has caused this to take such a hit but I still try to fit it in. Last year school ended at 2:00 (changed schedule for COVID) so I would come home lift weights for an half hout then skip rope for a half hour. It was great. For a workout I highly recommend skipping rope, it's cardio, it’s like running but has lower impact, works balance and agility, and I’ve reached a point when I can do a lot of cool moves. It’s also easy to do in little time and you can take it places.
Taking breaks from work? I try to take the five-minute Pomodoro breaks and not work through them. But if I don’t or I forget about my timer I will not stop working and it’s concerning. 
I agree with you, it was interesting answering the questions. They made me think about where I’m lacking and where I need to put in more effort.

Hi Mentee,
I'm so happy that you chose this one next, because I dunno what it is about gloomy weather, but I find our moods can dip easier when the skies are grey. Let's do our best to keep our self-care up, our relationships up, our grades up, and just overall - up up here we go!
I wanted to answer the questions as a check-in for myself too, aside from providing a post-secondary perspective. You'll find them below :
How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important?
Honestly speaking, I think it's easy to think about the importance of self-care, but it's another thing to implement such care. I'm still on a self-care journey myself, trying to find that sweet spot of work-life balance. 
What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself?
Throughout high school and university, there won't be a shortage of other priorities that could jump ahead of self-care on your queue, but that's where time management comes in! Just as important as it is to set a time for studying and working out, I like to play a little Animal Crossing after dinner and my shower for some fun time.
Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life?
Frankly, nobody comes to mind. LOL. But the cycle can always start with us, right? I've been trying to find more activities that bring me joy but also help with personal development. For example, while I enjoy looking at memes, eventually I find myself mindlessly scrolling and it's such a time sponge. So, I've switched to logic puzzles - While I'm still playing on my phone, it has more mind engagement than just double-tapping a post.
What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself?
My most recent sign has been feeling sluggish due to too much sugar! My dad recently bought these boxes of fruit punch that I was downing like I was in the desert. Even though I'd take them 1 water : 1 juice, over the next week, I began feeling not the best despite no significant changes in my diet. Tried to backtrack to see what was causing it and saw the sugar content of my juice... Now I'm back on just water and feel so much better!
How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? Your mentor may have some insight into this!
The transition into post-secondary is a big step that you can't really be 100% prepared for. As you're suddenly handed so much responsibility over your own learning, like building your schedule and choosing your classes, you might also have to navigate living on your own for the first time and balance that with taking care of yourself. I think the best way forward is to allow yourself the time to adjust, make changes as you change, and not spread yourself out too thin. Just as you're learning in school, this is a time for you to learn about yourself.
How good are you at taking care of the basics of self care: 
Getting adequate sleep?
YIKES. Right off the bat?! LOL. In my defense, I've always preferred being a night owl, but... No... I don't typically get enough sleep, and try to make this up on my days off. This is definitely my achilles heel of self-care, but I'll work on it - Promise!

Eating healthy food?
I would say I have a fair balance between healthy and not.  It's typically every other weekend that I go out to eat, but throughout my work week, I pack my lunches with fruits, water, and a filling meal with vegetables.

Drinking water?
Always! Stay hydrated, friend!

Regular physical activity?
I've been trying to find a good workout routine to get into every morning... If you have any suggestions, or any go-to exercises you do, let me know! While I work on the computer a lot, I find ways to get up and move, and aim to hit my Apple Watch goals throughout the week  (Why, yes... I did wait until the office was empty to run around to close one of my rings before HAHA).

Taking breaks from work?
I am getting called OUT and I don't like it!!! LOL. When I start something, I like to finish it, no matter how late I stay up. I think it's just a characteristic of mine to just go all in, but yeah... Maybe I'll take a self-care break once I wrap my message up!
I actually found answering these questions quite funny, but enlightening. Looks like your mentor still has a lot of work to do when it comes to self-care management! I'm looking forward to reading your answers and we can even exchange our self-care tactics!
Take care of yourself always. <3

Hi,
Thank you for liking and hyping up my answer, it made me smile when saw the message in the morning! I did what you suggested and added the conjunction and I changed 'been able to talk on' to 'taken on' and I went from a 96% Grammarly rating to a 98% Grammarly rating, I think that's fairly good. so thank you for that correction.
I'm happy to move on to the next convo, I can keep asking questions about my application as they arise, and we can work through some of the conversation topics in the meantime. 
Maybe we could do 'Well Being and Self Care' next, that's something I'm trying not to slack on it year.
Thank you for all your help,

Hi Mentee,
OH. MY. GOODNESS! YES, SIS! LOOK AT THAT ANSWER! Hang on, let me read it again (while you pay attention in class!) LOL. 
-- 
First off, thank you so much for allowing me the privilege to read that! It was a very personal, yet powerful work of writing. I'm very proud of your answer and I hope you are too. Frankly, I don't think I could add or edit anything that would improve it further - You answered the question honestly, thoroughly, and it was engaging all the way through. I think if you were bored and after you had finished all of the other questions on your application, you could try and go back and find whatever 4% was missing from Grammarly (but hey! A 96% is an A+ in uni! ). I think if I had to guess, maybe it's catching this sentence? ""I have been able to take on more challenges with the mindset that I can learn and do anything, certain things take time.""  You might need a conjunction in front of ""certain things take time"" (e.g. but/and/yet certain things take time) or you could make it a quote as well... Or... Imagine your Grammarly score goes DOWN after my suggestions and you could just ignore that I even said anything because your writing is just excellent as it is (Ahhhh that'd be so embarrassing hahahah).
So we're actually at the end of this conversation, but I'd be totally fine with keeping it open (i.e. not completing it yet) if you wanted to go over other aspects of your UBC app first? It's still relevant to the ""Post-Secondary Considerations"" topic! But if you had another Convo you had your sights on after this one, we could complete this + in the next Convo, you can bring up questions about your application at any time there too.
Seriously tho... UBC would be lucky to have you. Such a well-written answer! 
Good luck,

Hello,
It took me a long time to reply, sorry about that (I may or may not be writing this in french class ) but I think I've finally finished the 'Who am I?' Portion of my Personal Profile, not I need to answer what is important to me and write a bit about my ECs, which I think will be easier. 
Bellow is what I wrote for who I am:
I may not know who I am but, I am proud of the person I am becoming, even if I'm not her yet. I am self-driven, confident, and focused which, I haven't always been. Looking back, I don't know how I've managed to become someone with the goals, dreams and abilities that I have today. Seven-year-old me would have never imagined having the goal of becoming a scientist, eleven-year-old me could never have imagined believing that I could attend university and thirteen-year-old me could never have imagined being as bold as I am today. In elementary school and early middle school, I had a C average, I was bombing spelling tests, dictées, and math tests, I was unmotivated and frankly a mean person. I now realize I was going through a lot and my lashing out and not leaving my comfort zone was a response to the stress and trauma associated with my mother's death. At some point, I had a moment of self-discovery, and my mindset changed. I am proud of myself, for working to raise my academic average, become more involved and build better relationships with my family, friends, teachers and classmates. I have been able to take on more challenges with the mindset that I can learn and do anything, certain things take time. I work every day to move farther from the person I was by taking a more active effort in my mental and physical health, academics, and life outside of school. I am strong, resilient, and confident, and others would describe me as such. 
Grammarly gave it 96% which isn't bad in my books. I would like a better concluding sentance but at this point I am only about characters away from the limit. What are your thoughts on what I wrote? The mind map idea helped so much for this, so thank you for that idea!

Alright, the last of my message trio!
I took some time to watch some UBC application videos on YouTube to make sure I was up to date with the application process (as it's been a while!). Sounds like it's still as 'fun' as I remember... LOL.  Anyways, questions that ask you about yourself can be a bit tricky, so if I could give you some tips on how to start to tackle that question...
Why not try a mind map with you at the centre? 
It must be so nerve-wracking to write such an important part of your application while you're still figuring everything out! But you've mentioned how mind maps have worked for you, and I saw this used in one of the videos I've watched (Starting at 4:50). I thought it was a cool way to start listing what ECs, hobbies, and experiences have been significant for you, and really start expanding on not only what those activites are, but what they've contributed to you as a person. I think especially applying as a rural student, you have such a unique perspective, and if applicable, tying community in with your personal statement could be a key point.
Once you've got a decent list going and want to start writing, I'd say you'd want to keep your answer as interesting, as concise, but accurate as possible.
If you want to start this question off with a hook, some ideas could be: the words you live by, like the Marie Curie quote from our first convo , a powerful statement, or even a fact about you - just anything to start your personal profile strong, like setting yourself up for a good first impression. But once you've got a hook, you'll want to reel them in! UBC can be quite competitive, and I'm sure they've got thousands of applications coming in from all around the country and world. Be honest while making your words count!
Read, review, revise, repeat!
Just as with any assignment you're about to submit:
Always work on another doc (and save often!)
Read the questions again to ensure you're answering them correctly
Review your answers (maybe even have another pair of eyes read them!)
Revise what you've written to be concise but as accurate as possible
Repeat until you're happy (or until it's due LOL)
What UBC is looking for is what has made you, you. Take this time to really reflect on yourself and your story, and if you're still having a hard time, why not ask friends and family what they would say about you? For example, from my perspective as your mentor, you are a very hardworking and self-driven person, which reflects on your aspirations for post-secondary. 
Good luck!

Hi Mentee,

Hi Mentee,
I guess it's my turn to take the wheel on this convo! As we've already gone over studying quite in-depth, this time, I'll share 1 ""tip"" and 1 ""trap"" based on my experiences of trying to achieve post-secondary academic success.
As these articles are seriously putting me outta business as a mentor (LOL jk), I guess I'll just reiterate the importance of perspective.
Mentor's trap: When I first began university, I figuratively and literally felt lost... No, but seriously, I had to call my friends like it was Who Wants to Be A Millionaire because I didn't know how to get to my class . Going into university with the wrong mindset didn't help me with enjoying my experience, and it for sure didn't help me with my grades. It was when I changed my perspective that I really felt empowered, and almost as quickly as I saw school in a different light, that simple change brought my grades up immensely. 
It's easy to get caught up in the daily mundane: How long until that midterm? Am I going to order food off Skip or cook? Why is tuition so expensive?! But when you think about it...
Mentor's tip: You're there because you have this amazing privilege to learn about what you're interested in, on a beautiful campus, with like-minded individuals and professors who will be a part of that academic journey. You'll learn so much about certain topics, develop your skills, make friends, and really grow into your own person. Like... Heck ya, I'm really out here, getting educated and getting one more degree hotter .
I hope this ""tip"" and ""trap"" will be helpful for you in the future, especially when school gets tough! I'll talk about the syllabus and my advice for your UBC app in my next message!

Hello,
 
I liked the UBC article, I’m writing this after I have been studying and writing and my desk for a couple of hours so the Active Study Tips video got me moving which felt good. 
My answers to the questions:
Which of the strategies described in the article will you try? Which can you implement in your life now?
Well, as I mentioned above, I did most of the exercises. I use the Pomodoro technique when studying, which means that I get a five-minute break every twenty-five minutes, I try and make myself step away from my desk for that time, walk around my house, stretch, get water, use the washroom, etc… I like to avoid checking my phone during that time but it’s good to move every so often. Other than that one, there are a few that I use to some degree, I have a routine that I follow (roughly), it makes a difference because it’s easier for me to get the things done but also because other people start to learn that routine too and they can then know when not to bother me. We kinda talked about the notes when we talked about studying. To be fair I do a lot of these already and the tips were some things that I hadn’t considered. The Cold Turkey Writer app seems interesting and its name describes it well. That’s a bold approach to staying focused. 
 
I think the rest is up to you…I am curious to see what one of your syllabuses looks like.
 
Something else, I am going through the fun process of post-secondary applications. One of the UBC personal profile questions is ‘Tell us about who you are. How would your family, friends and/or members of your community describe you? If possible, please include something about yourself that you are most proud of and why?’ I am lost on how to start this question. Describing what is important to me and the extracurriculars I am doing, it’s a challenge but I’m still trying to figure out who I am and I don’t know how to answer this question. Do you have any tips?

Hi Mentee,
It's all A-OK!  I'm also on the same boat of balancing work, play, and ECs, so let's just try our best and message when we can <3. Hopefully the extra hour we got from Daylight Savings helps - extra hour for sleep and studying, here we come!
Question 11: So I mentioned in my last message how I found the Dal article quite accurate, and that does include what they describe for grades. But as you'll find out in post-secondary, it really does depend on the class, with factors like how the prof grades, their expectations, etc.
For example, I think it'd be difficult to go ""above and beyond"" for more formula-based courses. Like... how do you apply derivatives in a new way? Does the +C mean ""+ new concepts"" for integrals? LOL. From my experience, getting an ""A"" in these courses is equal parts getting the right answer and showing the proper proof on how you arrived there.
What I believe they were getting at was more so with theory-based courses, where getting an ""A"" can be more complex. It's not just about memorizing what the teacher said, but being able to take that, make connections both in and out of the material, and apply the theory to real examples. Ideally in your research, you'll be able to bring in new information to the conversation, and on top of also meeting every other criteria, that exceeds the expectations = A! I hope this makes sense .
Question 13: So... GPA. While you do get a form of a ""report card"" every semester, you'll notice how it's more so given in percentages that equate to a letter grade, as opposed to just A/B/C/D/F.
The GPA given from your class is your class GPA > 
When all your class GPAs are bunched together at the end of your semester, that's your (semester) term GPA > 
When you've completed a couple of semesters, all of your term GPAs get added together as your cumulative GPA.
What becomes especially important with the GPA system is meeting the percentage cut-offs for the letter grades you want. For example, my school would round a 79.5% up to an 80%, which is an A-. But a 79.4% would get rounded down to a B+. While on the smaller scale, both are great grades and the difference is just 1%... But on the bigger scale, it is a letter grade difference, which could change your cumulative average GPA. Just something to keep in mind, as certain scholarships require a certain GPA to maintain, masters programs may look at your 3rd/4th year grades, and more.
Intensity is the right word for sure!  I think the biggest ""shock factor"" of going from high school to university isn't the self-responsibility, but just how quickly things can add up. I was in quite a small program, so our professors were close enough to collaborate with each other to avoid conflicting due dates/exam days. However, this is definitely a limited case, and I expect larger science programs will have many things going on at the same time. Best answer? Time management, time management, time management!
I second ya - Syllabuses are the best!
You down to tackle the UBC article next?

Hello,
Sorry, it is taking me so long to reply to the messages, I feel like I am even busier even after changing my work situation! 
Here are my replies to the questions:
What surprised you: Question 11 was a little surprising. In high school getting an A means doing mostly everything correct for assignments and tests, the way the article describes it does not seem to be the case. 
    Question 13 also was new information to me, I knew that there is more focus on GPA in university than high school but I did not know that’s the main source to see how you’re doing you get. Compared to the A/B/C/etc… we get in high school.
Which of these differences will affect you most? I think that it is much faster and more intense will affect me. We had the quarter system in school last year because of COVID, our semesters were split in two, so we had 2 classes for 2 hours a day for about 9 weeks and that was rushed and I didn’t like the ‘lack of academic diversity as I call it. For example, I had math and Chemistry in one quarter and that meant that for about 9 weeks I was just doing math and it got very tiring very fast. We also needed to learn so much faster and it was easier to fall behind. 
How do you feel about some of these changes? I am looking forward to my post-secondary education, I know it’s not going to be easy but I don’t see that as a bad thing. I like that I will have more of a choice over my academics and my schedule. I 
I also like the idea of a syllabus, since I like to know what’s going on long before it happens. I like being prepared.

Hi Mentee,
YAY! I'm soooooo happy for you!!  Congrats on getting that 4-hour work week and I hope this really frees up some time for you (although you said it's against company policy??? but oh well LOL).
Alright, so how I thought about tackling this page of the Conversation was to maybe divide it into 2 discussions: We can talk about the Dal article first and exchange some questions/advice, and once we complete that, we can discuss the UBC article and do the same thing! Hope that sounds good .
To be honest, I thought every point the Dalhousie article made was accurate, so I thought to focus on the one that I didn't really pay attention to until my 3rd year, which was: 7. There's always an event to attend or something to do.
At my university, there would always be flyers posted, signs on the grass, emails sent out, and sometimes students would speak up before class to bring attention to an upcoming event. Up until 3rd year, I was tuning most of that out, as I was always just thinking of what was next to come - What's due this week? When's that midterm? What time was our group meeting? I never really stopped to look at what those signs said, until one of my co-op's stationed me at a table for one of those said events - A career fair. I would've loved to have attended more events like these because not only were they fun (and had loads of freebies!! LOL), they're a great way to see different companies, career avenues, network, and even learn more about what your university has to offer, like going on international co-ops work terms, studying and completing a semester abroad, and more. Though not just limited to career fairs, attending speaker events, and events hosted by your school can be a treasure of information.. It's just a matter of knowing when they are! Just like the article said, on the first day of classes, you're given a syllabus of what to expect for that semester. But I'd also highly encourage you to discover what's going on on campus during the semester too!
Happy Halloween!

Hello,
I didn't consider talking with medical ethicists, to be honest I didn't know they existed, but reaching out to some is a very good idea so thank you for that! Thank you also for the links they worked the second time and I will look into them. 
I kinda figured out my job situation, I went in and asked them to cut my hours down to four hours a week and they said they couldn't do that because of company policy (which I can understand). I said at one point 'this is kinda my only option, it this or I quit' and my manager paused for a second and said that I could take a break from work (leave of absence). Which I agreed to unless they could cut my hours. I guess they still want me around, which is nice. But now, they changed my schedule so I am only working for four hours on Saturdays. Tomorrow is my last 8h shift and then I switch to just working the four hours once a week. It's against company policy and what is written in the company policy book so I am a little confused but I got what I wanted, so I am not complaining. 
I am happy to move on to the next page too!

If I could give some advice from when I was working part-time in high school, it would definitely be what you're already doing, which is reducing your hours during the week (and resigning when it's just too much!). Especially when it comes crunch time for assignments before winter break but everyone and their mom is also shopping for the holidays, you wanna make sure you make enough time for yourself, school, activities, and friends/family. Again, just keep in mind that your supervisor could serve as one of your references should you apply for things in the future like scholarships, co-ops, other jobs, etc., so it's always good to leave on the best note you can!
And you're right ! While I didn't have a Capstone project during high school, I am aware that some graduate programs will have a Capstone project versus having students write a thesis... So I think that's really cool they're implementing these early on in BC high school curriculums now, so you know a bit of what to expect if you pursue a masters degree that has this option.
Okay, I don't know how they do this mentor-mentee matching system, but I'm so happy we got paired together! I took Biomedical Ethics at UVic, which was a course that analyzed Canadian case studies against the IMIA's Fundamental Ethical Principles (just scroll a bit to Part I. A. Fundamental Ethical Principles (https://imia-medinfo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMIA-Code-of-Ethics-2016.pdf)). The reason I'm bringing this up is because if you were looking for additional resources to reach out to, you could also consider chatting with medical ethicists, who might have valuable answers to your questions from an ethical/law perspective. Additionally, feel free to reach out to University of Victoria labs and professors to cast your net wider for a response! 
While I didn't study Biology, I hope some of these links help you out  :

Hello,
It's taken me a while to reply, things have been hectic in my life. I feel like I have so little time to sit down and when I do sit down I feel like there are millions of things I should be doing instead. I am planning on going into work tomorrow after school and asking them to cut my hours so I'm not working 16 hours a week and if they are not willing to cut my hours, I am going to hand in my resignation letter (that's the plan at least), so that has been stressing me out a lot!
I like what you mentioned for the third discussion question about contacting people in feilds I am interested in pursuing. I'm working on my Capstone project (I don't think Capstone existed when you were in high school because it is only a couple years old, it's basically a huge passion project that you need to complete to graduate). My Capstone question is 'How can CRISPR gene-editing technology be used to eradicate Ebola?', it's a huge question and I have 3 months to figure it out (part of why I am so busy), a key aspect of the Capstone project is reaching out to people, getting mentors who are experts in the feild of your Capstone and networking in areas that may be specific to you future. Ironically enough, I just finished emailing a bunch of people from a couple labs at UBC seeing if I could ask them questions and learn about their experiences with CRISPR teachnology. I've emailed 11 people over the past two weeks and one only one person has replied but I have many more people I am going to email before the month is over. 
Thank you for your advice on post-secondary applications! The tip about quality over quanty for ECs and volunteer postitions is very relatable! We're told to 'get involved' that 'universities love when you do lots besides school'. I'm really seeing that that's not realistic and you don't gain as much when you have a high quantity of things with low quality.
What's next? Have we completed the disscusion topic?

It's me again!
Now let's talk... Post-secondary applications!
Have you ever watched some of those ""College Decision Reaction"" videos on YouTube? Although most of them are for American schools (though you can find some Canadian videos too), I still find them so wholesome since we can understand how stressful the college application process can be and the relief once it's over. However, what can be especially valuable about these videos are what comes after the reaction - Sometimes, successful applicants will make a ""stats"" video on what grades, extra curriculars (ECs), essays, and other aspects of their application that helped them stand out and make the cut.
As I'm also considering pursuring additional studies, if I could offer you some advice and tips regarding making a competitive applicaiton, it'd be what I've also researched and am trying to apply too!:
1. Highlight your story and what makes you ""you""
Like I mentioned in my earlier post, you know yourself best. File reviewers will see thousands of applications come every school year, and while grades are significant, your own experiences and the perspective you bring is valuable in distinguishing you from the crowd.
For example, how could you tie living in a rural community and the experiences that come with it, into your essay? How have your life experiences shaped you to the student and person you are today, and how can you effectively convey this in your application?
2. Personalize your application to each college and program of interest
Similar to how you send a customized cover letter to each job, take the time to learn about the school(s) and program(s) you're interested in, and how you could tailor your application to fit as a prospective student there. As you're interested in the health sciences, I believe it would be helpful to especially highlight the ECs, volunteering, and hobbies that best showcase your forward-thinking approach to a career in health care/science.
3. Have strong references
This is not only applicable for applying to university, but for applications once you're already in, such as applying for co-op placements, scholarships, internships, research positions, and more. Having someone who knows you well and can speak well on your behalf is incredibly beneficial - My past co-op supervisors have told me that my references were what helped them in making their final decision to make me their co-op student. So it's never too early to start networking and building those bridges!
Some references you could seek could be: Your part-time job supervisor, volunteer coordinator, a teacher who knows you well, etc.
4. Take part in ECs and volunteer positions that make your soul smile :)
I was initially guilty of going about volunteerism and ECs for the wrong reasons. I was too focused on quantity versus quality, trying to fill in all of the gaps in my application that I felt that I was weak in. But now, I'm much happier with how I'm spending my time and efforts... All the while still building a portfolio I can be proud of! Pursuing the hobbies and volunteer positions that you can speak genuinely about come across much more authentic, and of course, are much more fun to take part in, versus those that are more for CV padding. Don't spread yourself out too thin, and take the time to find out what initiatives are really meaningful to you, and seek the positions from there. I only found ReMBC during my last year of university, but it's been my favorite volunteer position by far, as mentorship and youth initatives are two things I am passionate about. If you were looking for a virtual volunteer position in the future, I'd highly recommend coming back to ReMBC as a mentor! You definitely have what it takes!
 
Unfortunately, I don't have much advice for reducing the anxiety that comes with post-secondary applications, as I too, was scrambling on hours of sleep to send those transcripts, essays, getting my references ready, etc. We can only do our part by applying early, giving ourselves and our references enough time to respond, and putting our best efforts forward. 4 years seems like a long time in university, but 4 years also seemed like a long time going from grade 9 to grade 12, right? Time will pass you by no matter what, so you might as well be present in the moment and (try) to enjoy the process as much as you can! You're going to achieve amazing things, Mentee! ​​​​​​​ I believe in you!

Hi Mentee,
Whistler! How fun! I hope there will be more opportunities during winter break to have more trips like that . My answers did get quite lengthy for this conversation, so I've split them into two posts: (1) Answering all of the Conversation questions and (2) answering your personal questions you left for me!
Please find the Post-Secondary Considerations Conversation questions and my answers below: 
Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? 
Like you, I explored all of these resources prior to this Conversation. :) And like you said, there are so many careers that don't get much exposure, and thus, aren't readily considered as career options. I'd say that there are also opportunities to apply the skills you learned in your degree into a different field. For example, I know of a Health Information Science alumni who went into the field of finance, my friend who graduated with me went into government work... There are always opportunities to apply your skills into different areas, so long as they are transferable. Say you were interested in taking a research internship for instance, you could describe how the skills your learned from your Business Communications course could be beneficial for the team during the interview (e.g. You could act as a scribe for meetings), which helps you stand out from other students applying to the same internship.
How important is the expected salary to the career path you choose?
Insightful answer! Likewise, I don't believe you could pay me any amount of money to work 8+ hours of my day unhappy and unsatisifed. I am, however, mindful of job satisfaction and its relation to salary, location, job prospects, and stability though. While having a stable, comfortable salary is beneficial, is there room for advancement in this career/field? If promoted, are the additional responsibilities scaled to a higher wage? Workplace culture, learning opportunities, and growth are important factors to me and are what I especially look for in future opportunites - Do you have certain factors you look for in a prospective career?
If the career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option? 
While I haven't had the opportunity to study microbiology yet, I have had the pleasure of taking an epidemiology course, and I'm happy you're looking into a possible career in it! Using this as an example, additional ways you could explore this option and learn more about what a career in epidemiology entails could mean networking with epidemiologists, or getting in contact with graduate schools or graduate students taking their Masters in epidemiology. While I'm sure many of these people are quite busy right now during the pandemic, it never hurts to ask (and often, they are happy to guide you to the answers and resources you're looking for). Additionally, reaching out to those who have already taken epidemiology or microbiology courses is a quick way to get a student perspective on courses of interest. Like I mentioned earlier, I took a course called Epidemiology, Population Health, and Public Health. It was such a cool mix of using statistics to determine disease occurrence and learning how study designs can be effective in disease prevention and health promotion! Paired with this course was also a computer lab, where we used programs like SAS to visualize and analyze statistical data - If you take such a course in the future, I hope you like it too!
How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Ask your mentor to share their experience with how to handle difficult school subjects. 
Again, I loved your answer to this! While it's not necessarily important to be immediately ""good"" at a subject, I believe these subjects are associated with that career path for a reason. Taking the example above: 
You do not need to take a STEM undergraduate program to get into medical school (e.g. ViolinMD on YouTube is a Canadian medical resident who majored in music before pursuing medicine!). However biology in on the MCAT, a test that is largely used by many medical schools in establishing cut-off scores for successful matriculants. So while struggling in Biology now doesn't mean to count medical school out entirely in the future, it's important to consider that: In the short term, biology will be an expected outcome within your 3-4 years of medical school, and in the long term, the life-long learning aspect of medicine will include biology.
Also, as you thoughtfully mentioned, everyone is capable of learning. We will all come across subjects that don't come to us as innately as others; What is important is how we process these hardships. How I could recommend handling difficult school subjects is to balance your workload to how much you can handle. You know yourself best, and what's awesome about university is that semesters are customizable and flexible (so long as the course you're interested in taking is offered during the times you intend to take it). If you recognize ahead of time that a notoriously difficult course is coming up in your first semester, stacked with all of your core sciences, it wouldn't be a bad idea to move that difficult course to your less ""heavy"" second semester for more balance.
More to come shortly!

Hello,
I hope you had a good long weekend! Mine was super busy (I went to Whistler) and I’m just getting back into the rhythm of things. 
I read through the text and looked at the different websites. Nothing was super new to me since I’ve already used some of the programs (such as BC Education Planner) or alternative programs.
To answer the questions:
Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? 
I did not. There wasn’t any new information since we learned about all this at school. The work we did with the program MyBluePrint introduced me to more career options (this was in grade 10). My interest was sparked when I discovered that there are possible careers for things that I've found interesting, I just didn't know they existed before.
How important is the expected salary to the career path you choose? 
I don’t want to constantly stress about money, I want to be financially stable and comfortable but I don’t need to be extremely wealthy. I also don’t want to do a job that makes me miserable just for the money. It’s not worth it to be paid very well just to be miserable every day.
If the career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option? 
I am interested in the health sciences (microbiology/epidemiology/virology/immunology/infectious disease). At my school, we used MyBluePrint for planning out what we wanted to do (as mentioned above). It was a good way to get reliable information including if it is/will be in demand, education required,  salary, and what schools/institutions offered the education needed. It’s how I found out about epidemiology and learnt that there is a possible future for me in the health sciences. I had a 94% match with a microbiologist and a 91% match with an epidemiologist.
How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Ask your mentor to share their experience with how to handle difficult school subjects. 
I am interested in pursuing an academic career. Being good at maths, sciences, etc… are important to be successful. I do believe that it matters more if you enjoy the class more than your academic success. For example, last school year I took Business Communications (Keyboarding), I gained good skills, I can type fast, and I got a good grade, but the careers involving that include things like a secretary. Just because I was good at the class does not mean it’s something a want or should be doing. I liked it because it was easy, but it was also boring a lot of the time. I firmly believe you can learn anything, some things just take more time and I’m not going to give up on something just because it’s difficult and I’m struggling.
what are your experiences with this?
 
I am getting started on my applications for post-secondary schools, it’s kinda overwhelming, do you have any advice and tips for perfecting my applications and increasing my chances of getting into my choice of schools? The resources provided by my school are lacking so I’m figuring out a lot of this on my own (and with Google!). Do you have any advice to make this experience less stressful too?
 
Enjoy the rest of your week,

Hi Mentee,
I hope this long weekend has given you much needed time with your family and friends, ample rest, and plenty of food!  Thank you for your patience as I got Post-Secondary Considerations opened for us.
While all of the conversations we'll discuss on this platform are meant to be an encompassing guide to your post-secondary journey, I believe the one we're about to start on this page may be one of the most (if not the most) significant. I hope you'll get a lot of value from it!
Before diving into the anchor text, I'd love to give you a bit of background of my own experience with choosing post-secondary schools. Then, as we get into the nitty gritty of exploring institutions and career options, you'll have a better idea of how I got to where I am today. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to message them below!:
Upon reaching high school graduation, while I knew I wanted to go into the sciences (STEM), I just wasn't certain on a particular stream of STEM that would lead me to my educational (and eventual career) goals. This, on top of financial and personal considerations, I ultimately decided taking a gap year was for my best interests. 
During this gap year, I explored the exact resources provided on this page, as well as looked at the websites of the post-secondary programs I was interested in - Even out of province ones. While many schools offer the same programs, there are also factors to consider like location, cost, program competitiveness, pre-requisites, campus, environment, etc. 
While I initially had thoughts of studying in an institution (BCIT), ultimately, my post-secondary journey led me to my local college taking university-transferrable courses in a ""University Transfer"" program. After accumulating enough credits to transfer out, I landed at the University of Victoria's Health Information Science program, and the rest is history LOL.
While that was a very brief overview, again, as we explore the anchor text more, I'll be happy to go into more details as applicable to any questions you may have! 
Let's get to post-secondary considering! (Does this even make sense?! Hahaha)

That's great to hear that you have already implemented some of the study strategies! Especially as it's sounds they have become second nature to you.
I also struggle with switching tasks - I feel very driven by completion, and switching delays that I think haha. I honestly have struggled a lot with study skills, and especially with prioritizing tasks.
I definitely don't have any ""tried & true"" techniques for studying that always work for me. I have ADHD so I definitely struggle with planning (and execution) lol. I do study a lot more in Uni compared to secondary school though. 
 
From what I remember of high school, I didn't really study very much. But it's much easier to fall behind in university, and you also have more responsibility over your education. No one is putting pressure on you to go to class, or to study/do homework - so you really have to motivate yourself. 
 
I find my actual studying is a little all over the map, but I always treat deadlines as concrete. I don't let myself hand in anything late, and I don't let myself fall behind (this is more just a mindset to help myself - I don't judge other's for falling behind). I'm really trying to get better at the studying aspect of things though. I've recently been using a Pomodoro timer, which really helps on the days that I'm not very motivated. I usually do 25 minutes on, then a 5 mintute break. I also find that if I can make anything into a challenge or a game, it can be very motivating!
Hope your weeks is off to a good start :)

Hello! I just finished watching the video about the six useful study skills. I actually have tried out most of these skills, specifically the study strategies of spreading study sessions throughout a week, coming up with concrete examples instead of abstract ones, and writing down what I recall from my study session. These strategies did help me a lot, especially with tests involving a lot of memorization, so then they just kind of merged with my learning style. Now, I tend to do them oftentimes.
A strategy that I may find difficult to do though is switching between multiple topics. I find myself very focused on one topic at a time, and sometimes I spend hours studying that particular topic (which is not very helpful for then I get lesser time to study the others). But I'll try out that strategy though, I might just find it as helpful as the others.
Furthermore, do you have your own strategic study skills that you have developed? Post-secondary classes are very much different from high school classes, and the tests probably are too, so do you have any study strategies that changed as you transitioned from high school to college?
I hope you have a great week! :D",Mentee

Hi!
I think you resume looks good! I know it's tough to write them when you don't have a lot of work experience. I think it's important to really highlight your skills to make up for not having previous jobs - and I definitely think you did that. 
 
My suggestion would just be to try to make it stand out. Like if you have any unique experience that would make you a good candidate for a job. When places are hiring people, they're often looking through a stack of resumes, so it's really important to get them to notice yours!
Do you have any questions about them? Or anything else? :)

Hello!
Oooo, that's a very helpful way of thinking! I think I'm in the process of adjusting, but I want to start thinking like that. And thank you! I'll start reading the Conversation as soon as I can.
An improv show sure sounds like fun! I would like to watch one someday! I hope you have a good week!",Mentee

Yes, we got Monday off too! Because it's a professional program and all the material is required we still have to do it on our own throughout the week though (so not really a day off).
I'm not sure if you feel the same way, but I often find the first few weeks are really hard, and then you adjust and it doesn't seem so hard anymore. Looking back, grade 3 would be really easy for me now, but at the time it was definitely hard! I find this persepective helpful to realize that how difficult something is is completely relative and someday I'll look back and think ""it wasn't that hard.""
Hahah that is very classic of parents to say that. I am the youngest of my siblings so I got that allllllll the time hahah.

Hello! Yes, my school got Monday off! How about you? :)
The new school year is alright, but now I'm learning that the 11th grade really is much more difficult than the 10th grade. My teachers love cramming everything into the last minute of our classes and giving us homework every single day. But I really like it for I like doing homework!
And yes! I read about resources in universities and I think they're a very tremendous help. And thank you! One thing I like when asking my parents about ""adult"" stuff is when they keep telling me how quickly I'm growing up 😆
And if you don't mind, I would really want to talk about the ""Getting Hired"" conversation. I'm planning to get a job next year, and I have 0 experience in that matter.

Hi! No worries :)
I definitely know the feeling! How is the new school year treating you otherwise? Are you taking any fun classes?
And I'm sure you will figure everything out just fine! Sometimes it takes a while, and you don't even realize all that you have learned and accomplished. Things may seem overwhelming at first, but before you know it you've gotten used to it! And if you do struggle with it, there are lots of resources at University to help you adjust (ie. mental health, financial literacy, study skills, etc.).
Good work on the extension activity. Parents are definitely a great resource of knowledge! So are friends, teachers, and various resources provided by universities!
Let me know if you have any other questions, and if you want to try another activity! I'm sure you're getting busy now that school is back in session, but I'm happy to continue if you like (no pressure in either direction) :)
Hope you're having a nice weekend!

No worries! I was a little confused about the update too
 
That sounds like a lovely tradition! Keeping it alive wherever you are with new friends (that I'm sure you'll make) is a great idea! 
 
it can definitely be tough adjusting to life away from home, but over time you will find new things that you enjoy. I think there it's good to have a combination of things/activities that remind you of home, and others that are new and exciting.
When I moved from home I definitely missed playing board games with my family, and my parents' cooking a lot. My boyfriend and I found some 2-player games that we really liked. They reminded me of playing games with my family, but we're adapted and became their own tradition. As for my parent's cooking - I got them to send me some of their recipes that I liked and I made them for myself. It was a great way to remember home, and feel closer with my parents. 
 
I think you learn pretty quickly when you leave what you really miss. Sometimes it's not the things you expect either! It's good to get creative with ways to feel connected to home, but sometime you just have to visit and soak it all in during the holidays! Lol",Mentor

Hello! I just finished reading the second anchor text.
About the activity (I picked the second one): Movie nights are a very simple yet special tradition that my family still does until now. We would cook or maybe order food and eat them all at once as we watch a fun movie. Of course, as I leave for college, I will surely miss this practice. I think a very good way for me to cope with this ""loss"" is to invite my friends (if ever I find some) and do the same activity - no phones, just food and one another's company!
Furthermore, may I ask how you coped with ""lost"" traditions that you had already grown accustomed to as you moved on to another level of life? I kind of already have an idea adapting to new places, but I just can't imagine doing so without my family's company 😓",Mentee

I definitely agree with those sentiments. There are so many lovely things about living rurally, but it can get a little boring, especially before you can drive. It's very freeing when you get your licence and you can go places with your friends. 
 
And that's a really good question. I definitely struggled with adjusting to a new place when I moved to Ireland. I think something that really helped was being able to use FaceTime to talk to my family. That had its own challenges thought because they were 8 hours behind me. Luckily I had a friend living in Amsterdam (only a 1 hour time difference) and we FaceTimed a lot. I think knowing someone going through a similar experience helped a lot. You still have your support network of friends and family that you can talk to.
 
It's also important to make new friends where you are living, which can be pretty tough. I would definitely recommend joining clubs or volunteering. Being part of a small group that you see often makes it way easier to make friends - at least in my experience. I really struggled making friends in University because the class sizes were so big and I didn't really have classes with the same people and I couldn't get to know them. If that is the case for you, I would suggest joining clubs for sure!
 
Finding a routine for yourself, and places you like can really help you to adjust too. Whether it is in nature, or a cafe you like, it's important to find places that feel like home and to set down roots. Looking back in my time in Montreal, I really wish I did more of an effort to do this. Right before I moved away I found a couple places I really liked, which made it kind of sad to leave lol. 
 
Hope you had a great weekend. I'm back from my canoe trip now - it was like lovey!

Hello! I just finished reading the first anchor text of the Conversation.
Anyhow, the following are the three things I like about living in a rural area:
The abundance of nature: Unlike in a city, there is a great abundance of nature, specifically animals, plants, and trees, here that makes me feel really connected with Earth! I also love the way people treat animals with care!
The very little pollution levels: In a city, the land and the sky are often overwhelmed with a lot of pollution. In a rural area though, the sky is very clear and paints very pretty colours!
The various opportunities that help my well-being: Unlike the city where I came from, there are lots of ways I can improve my lifestyle and my well-being here. Going to places like parks surrounded by trees and having peaceful road trips with my family are seriously the best!
The following are the two things I don't like about living in a rural area:
Lesser forms of entertainment: There is barely any place here to go to and have fun, and having to drive to a city to do so is very tiring.
Lesser options: There is a limited range of options available here (like schools, etc.).
Furthermore, I have a question about moving from a rural area to a city. How can one make it less difficult to adjust to a new place (especially with no one to rely on)?",Mentee

Yeah I think it's fine just filling in what you know for now. It's so hard to estimate some of these costs.
I just applied for a student line of credit and you need to figure out your budget for them so it is definitely helpful to have some experience doing so. I mostly overestimated everything a little because underestimating might mean I don't get enough money to make things work.
 
I think when you start post-secondary you will have a better idea about your expenses and such. So don't worry if you felt like you didn't really have an idea for some of the categories :)

Hi! Sorry for the late response! My family got Covid and it's been a bit of a mess - we're all okay though!
Reference letters are letters that you get people to write that recommend you for what you are applying for. Usually it's good to ask people of authority that also knows you well - like teachers, bosses, supervisors, etc. If you are applying for a scholarship specifically, it may be a good idea to ask a teacher that you have a good relationship with to write you one. The goal is that they will say nice things about you, so that the committee deciding can get an idea about who you are from a 3rd party.
And I think the main difference between scholarships and bursaries is like you said - scholarships are merit-based (academics, volunteer work, work experience, community service, etc.) whereas bursaries are need-based (you couldn't afford school otherwise). 
 
I may be mistaken about this, but I think you might be able to spend bursaries more broadly, while scholarships are usually just used for tuition. Again, I'm not certain about this though!

Hi!
From what I gather from their website you cannot apply directly out of high school as you need 60 university credits. Most single-semester courses are worth 3 credits (with some exceptions). 60 credits works out to 2 years of full-time school, so you can apply after 1st year on the condition that you complete your second year of studies before starting the program. 
Of that 60 credits, 24 are required prerequisits to get into the program, which include:
- University Level Human Anatomy and Physiology (6 credits):
HHSC 111-4 and HHSC 112-4, or HHSC 105-3 and HHSC 305-3, HHSC 306-3, HHSC 325-1 and HHSC 326-1 or equivalents are recommended. Human anatomy and physiology courses must include a lab component and be completed within 5 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Microbiology (3 Credits):
HHSC 110-3 is recommended. Microbiology courses relevant to Human health must be completed within 5 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Statistics (3 credits):
STAT 240-3 is recommended. Statistics must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Social Sciences with Peoples and Cultures content (3 Credits):
ANTH 213-3 is recommended. Social Science courses dealing with people, languages and cultures must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level English (3 Credits):
One of ENGL 100-3, ENGL 102-3, ENGL 103-3, ENGL 120-3 are recommended or a higher-level transferable English composition course.  English composition courses must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Indigenous Studies (3 credits):
FNST 302-3 First Nations Health and Healing is recommended. Indigenous Studies courses must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University level Psychology with human development, behaviour and/or cognition content (3 credits):
PSYC 101 is recommended. Psychology course work must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
 
Another 24 of those 60 credits must be 200 level courses (which means 2nd year courses... 100 = 1st year, 200 = 2nd year, 300 = 3rd year, etc...). This leaves you with 12 more elective credits to complete as well. It is also important to make sure that all these courses are transferable to UNBC (but if you go to school in BC, they usually are), and you can check this using the BC transfer guide. You also need to have at least a 'B' average in those 60 credits to apply. 
 
That might seem a little overwhelming as a highschool student, but it is definitely doable! What is nice is that you can get these credits at a college or a universtiy! Many people like doing the first 2 years at a college because it can be an easier transition - the class sizes are smaller, the college might be closer to home (meaning you could live at home), the teachers have more time to help you, and it can be easier to meet people and make friends. University has its benefits too though - they are often located in bigger cities (more to do when you have time off), they might have more resources and clubs, you might not need a car, and you don't have to transfer after 2nd year (if you don't want to). 
I hope that all makes sense! Let me know if you have more questions! :)",Mentor

Hi!
I think Nursing is a great program! We always need more nurses. It's too bad thought that ophthalmology is so expensive (I personally think that school should be free - especially health-care fields).
I think that the collaborative program is set up so that students at College of New Caledonia and Coast Mountain College can get a Nursing degree without having to go to university. Colleges can't have nursing degrees on their own, so they collaborate with Universities - which basically means that the students will graduate with a UNBC nursing degree, even though they didn't actually go to UNBC. My local college has a similar agreement with UVIC. 
It also looks like the Northern Collaborative BScN is offered out of Prince George, Quesnel, and Terrace, wheras the Northern BScN is in Fort St. John. As for the actual curriculum - I imagine it is very similar to Nursing programs offered by other schools. I hope that answers your question! Let me know if you have any others.
As for managing difficult subjects, I think a big thing is time-management (which is often easier said than done). I also took as many as I could in grade 11/12, so I've been there. From what I remember, doing my best to stay on top of homework helped. I definitely wasn't perfect though - I once finished writing 4 physics lab reports in 15 minutes before handing them in. It was right before winter break and I was stressed about it all break. I got 41/80 (which I think my teacher just passed me to be nice haha) but I asked him if I could redo them and he let me, so it worked out in the end. 

It's also important to ask for help if/when you need it. There is no shame in getting a tutor, or getting help from your teacher or a peer in the class. If you have friends in your class you can try studying together too. Sitting at the front of the class (if you are able to choose) can be helpful too. It is a lot harder to be distracted near the front - and it's a step that takes very little effort, but might make a big difference. 
I think that you have to approach the subjects a little differently too. Physics is more like math in that you might need to work through the problems a few times before you understand - but once you understand, you can easily apply it. Biology is more memory based though - and being interested in what you're learning can really help in my experience (and I did go on to get a Bachelor's Degree in Biology). Chemistry is somewhere in the middle of the two, and both skills will help.
It can be a lot of work taking many science courses at once, but I am sure you can do it! Remember to try to keep some balance in your life too, and find time for self-care. I think once you're in the thick of things it won't be so intimidating anymore.
Hope you're having a restful weekend :)",Mentor

Hello! Regarding what I would like to pursue education-wise, I was thinking of taking a Nursing program. Although I was also thinking of maybe getting a career in ophthalmology, I disregarded the idea given the amount of expenses required for the pathway.
Anyhow, I just finished reading the anchor point of Post-Secondary Considerations. In the BC Education Planner, I searched for 'registered nurses'. Attached are schools with programs for this career path.
I researched where all these schools are located, just so I could see whether or not these schools are far from where I live, and UNBC is the only school near me. I was wondering how their Northern Collaborative Baccalaureate Nursing Program works?
I was also wondering if you could give me any tips as to how to manage difficult subjects? I'm about to be in the 11th grade in a few months, and I took up all the science classes my school offered. I'm worrying whether or not I can actually do it :(

That's a great point! And being adaptive is a great skill to have for life too.
I'm glad that it resonated with you! I can definitely relate to my own thoughts keeping me awake. My partner falls asleep almost instantly and I'm so jealous of him haha. Meanwhile I'm overthinking some trivial thing from years ago! Haha
Those topics sound great! I'll make sure they're open and we can start wherever you like. :)

Hello! Nice to meet you too! 
Yes, adapting was a major obstacle for me. But I believe that such challenges make life life. And yes, I'm really grateful I had met my friends! 
Your favourite quote is really inspirational, given how I worry about tonsss of school-related stuffs too! I often stay up at night and worry about these countless (often unimportant) things 🥲 Nevertheless, I'll surely remember your advice! 
Moreover, I'm interested on the following topics:
From rural to urban
Paying for school
Post-secondary considerations
Well-being and self-care 
Since my school ends in about three weeks and I have a few schoolwork to do, I could chat anytime throughout the week! But to be sure, Saturdays and Sundays (afternoon) work best for me!",Mentee

Hi Mentee! Nice to meet you.
My name is Mentor! 
Moving to a rural area from the city must be a pretty big change for you. I grew up rural but have since lived in the city for school and it was definitely a huge change for me. I'm glad to hear that you have made new friends - I know that it can be tricky (especially when moving to small towns). Having a good support network is so important!
I really like that quote too! It is true that there is a lot to be learned from our mistakes. I think that some people are more adept at doing so. It's definitely a great life-skill to have.
And my favorite quote (although I'm not entirely sure this counts as a quote) is this:

I am definitely someone who worries a lot about things, so I find framing it in this way can be really helpful. If I have the means to change something, then that means I have some control. And if I can't change things, it is sort of liberating to know that it is out of my power. 
I'm really looking forward to getting to know you better! Let me know which conversations at the top interest you and we can get into some of the topics! I am also more than happy to just chat about whatever you like. 
Is there a day of the week/time that works best for you to chat in the future?",Mentor

Hi there! I’m Mentee, a sophomore in high school. I just discovered this platform and am very new to its structure, so I apologize in advance if I ever get confused or lost in the future. I’m currently fifteen turning sixteen, and this year is about to be my first full year here in Canada! Last year, I moved from a city to a rural area, and adapting to my new lifestyle and surroundings was tough (but fortunately manageable thanks to my family and my newly made friends). For I know almost nothing about the opportunities and options here, I wish to learn them along the way with you!
Moreover, “From failure we learn, from success not so much,” is a quote from the famous Disney movie, The Robinsons, and has been my favourite all-time motivation quote. Whenever I feel unfortunate from whatever defeat I just had experienced, this quote helps me open my mind to the benefit of mistakes — that is, to help us learn. Likewise, I would love to learn what your favourite quote is!

Hello! It's okay!
I just tried out pomodoro using an app I found on the appstore for my pre-calculus exam, and it actually helped me! When I was using it my study session actually felt stress-free, which is absolutely a surprise given all the stress I always have had when studying for exams. I was able to focus more too because I napped during the breaks I had haha 😂
I'll definitely keep using pomodoro for future study sessions!

No worries! Hope you had a good long weekend!!
I have a similar sentiment towards interviews I think. It's easy to get in your own head and stumble over your words - especially when you haven't been in many interview-esque scenarios. It's definitely a skill, which is a bit of a relief because it means you can improve. 
I never really prepared for job interviews in the past (or interviews in general) but I had to for my university applications over the past couple of years, and I think I have really improved!! I would definitely recommend getting friends or family to help you practice answering unexpected questions.
What I find to be the hardest part now (after lots of practice), is getting to feel comfortable with the interviewer. The sooner you relax a bit, and are able to let your personality come through, the better (in my opinion).
As for a memorable interview, my interview for a summer student position comes to mind. I had to take a drug test, and normally they do it after the interview, but I did it before. The guy administering the test said ""compared to the interview, this part is nothing"". And I had to tell him that I hadn't done the interview yet... it was funny but also made me a lot more nervous for the interview. I didn't feel like the interview even went very well because I was so nervous, but I got the job! So I think I was probably being too harsh on myself. 
I'm not sure if that's what you meant by memorable, hahaha but it was indeed memorable!

Hello! Sorry for the late reply, my family and I went out of town during the long weekend and when we came back I completely forgot about this 😅
Anyways, I finished watching the video for the second anchor text! I'll gladly keep these tips in mind, for the future! I have never had a job interview before, just school admission interviews (which at a young age I didn't take very seriously). I think I'll be alright in keeping a professional aura, but not so sure about the talking part. I'm able to sometimes answer questions and speak what's on my mind, with a bit of stuttering in front of a group of intimidating individuals, yes, but there are times when I just completely blank out. That's what I'm worried about in future interviews — not being able to communicate as well as I know I'm capable of. But practice makes perfect and I'm sure I'll be able to practice well enough and prepare myself before such interviews! Have you ever had a memorable job interview before?

Hi! Thank you - me too lol
Sounds great! 
It's definitely tough to know what to put for things like that, especially when they vary in price. I would recommend looking at a University website that you might be interested in. They often have ideas about what the housing market looks like. I'll link an example from UBC below. 
https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/other-housing/off-campus-housing/
https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/residences-rooms/residences/
As for transit - You have to consider if you will have a car (often necessary in smaller cities and towns), or if you will be using public transit. Public transit is easier to calculate as you can get monthly passes, and often you can get it through your university (its included in UBC's student fees for example). If you are thinking about a car, you have to consider gas, parking, and insurance costs (which is a little more technical, and changes depending on gas prices and what type of car you have).
 
Overall, I would say that you don't need to be exact. It is just an exercise to get an idea of what budgeting is like. Just do your best approximation, and in the future (when you go to school) you will have a better idea about what things will actually cost for you, and you will be able to do a more thourough budget! :)
Hope that all makes sense!
and hope your week is going well,

Hi! 
Yeah sports are great, especially when they are just for fun. When I was in highschool I took volleyball very seriously, but soccer was just to have fun more or less. I played on a house team, as well as my school team, and neither were very competetive, but it was great to get some exercise and hang out with my friends. Even if your school doesn't have a lot of sport/club options currently, there might be some opportunities in your local community - might be worth a look :)
Rotary sounds really cool! I have some friends that did rotary at their school and it sounded like it was very rewarding! If you're looking for more things to try you could also start your own club with friends! I have recently gotten very into crocheting and would love if I had enough friends that did it to have a club. Book clubs can be a lot of fun too!

Hello! Thank you for answering my questions on rent and on on-campus and off-campus living! I've gained some insight now on these options :D And yes, I've heard from others that rent in Vancouver tends to be very high 😬 
Moreover, I'm very interested in joining volunteer clubs like that of Best Buddies! I would love to have a chance in the future to join a club like that! I would also love to learn how to play soccer and volleyball, (though my gym class proved my skills to be very bad 😅). 
I'm very interested in extra-curricular activities like volunteer clubs and sports like badminton! Actually, last school year, I joined my school's rotary club, where we did activities like bake sales to raise money. They were very enjoyable and fun to organise and do, and were for a cause too! I also joined my school's badminton team, which was a very fun but tiring experience. I would love to do much more, but my school has very limited amount of extra-curriculars :(

Hi!
Yes, rent can definitely be a big factor, especially in BC as we have a very high cost of living. I am actually just figuring that out for the first time as I was able to live with family during my undergrad, which was a huge help. I'll be going to UBC in the fall and Vanvouver is exorbidant! And yes, alcohol is very expensive - especially at restaurants and bars. It can double the cost of a meal!
I lived off-campus previously, but mostly because I could stay with family for free. I know people that have done both though, and I think that it does really depend where you are. At the small college I went to, I've heard that the accomodation is really bad, and not all that much cheaper in the grand scheme of things as rent nearby is fairly affordable.
I have been looking into UBC housing in Vancouver recently and it actually looks a lot less expensive. My mom stayed in family housing when she went to UBC (she had 2 kids at the time) and I think she saved a lot of money. Currently it is really hard to find studio or 1-bedroom apartments for less than $2000 in the Vancouver area, especially if you want to be close to UBC. Most on-campus housing is less than $1500, even for a 1-bedroom (no roomates). I do think this can vary from city-to-city, and there is more than just rent to consider. Living on campus might mean you can spend less money on transit, but you might be farther from downtown. 
I definitely did fewer extra-curricular activities in University than I did in high school. During my first 2 years I had a part-time job, so I didn't really have time for other activities. I was in a very small program though, so it was pretty easy to make new friends. When I moved to Montreal for my last 2 years of my degree I joined a club called Best Buddies. It is a volunteer organization that sets students up with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to form meaningful connections. It wasn't your typical extra-curricular activitiy, but it was a great experience and it helped me make some new friends (which was a lot harder to do at a big school). 
Now that I am going back to Uni, I think I would like to do more extra-curricular activities. I would love to do intermurals or something. I really love volleyball, and would love to play again. I would be open to soccer and badminton as well. I would also love to do some pottery or sewing classes! 
What kind of extra-curricular activities are you interested in?",Mentor

Hello! I just finished watching the video for the first anchor text, and just read the article that came along with it. I learned that rent is often the biggest factor for expenses (and it's not very surprising) and that alcohol seems to weigh a lot 🤔 
 
Based on the article, I learned that learning all about such finances and knowing how to manage them would really help, and that budgeting is a very important thing to do. As mentioned in the video, rent is the biggest factor for these finances. If you don't mind me asking, did you live on-campus or off-campus, and how did you make your choice? I often hear from others that living on-campus tends to be more expensive than living outside, but it may depend on the school. 
Also, what were some extracurricular activities that you enjoyed doing?",Mentee

Let me know any questions you have! I am more than happy to talk about my finances surrounding school! I know everyone's financial situation is different, but it can be helpful to talk about it with people (even though it can be taboo). It can be a really hard to transition from being in highschool and living with your parents, to living on your own, paying for school, and having to manage your own finances.

Happy holidays and hello again!!! 🎉🎉🎉 I am back from Cancun and also experiencing hectic post-holiday re-adjustment-to-routine-ness, but all around it was very lovely and I'm glad to have been gone for a bit -- and also to be back to enjoy some peace and quiet on my own again, lol! How was your Christmas? Did you do anything special to ring in the New Year? Any resolutions for 2023? :D
Howdy, you too! Hope you had a good time, Cancun sounds pretty hype! I've never been there myself, but if my family and I are still planning on vacation, then we might either go to the Middle East to visit my mom's side of the family, or we might go to Europe :p My Christmas was okay, we mostly just stayed up and slept in late haha. I got an Asus Chromebook lol. Umm, that's a good question, I don't think I have any resolutions in stone for 2023 from what I know of lol. At least not now!
 
Q1: On health things: I'm only half-surprised that it was so backed up in the ER because of flu things... I'd never gotten a regular flu shot before this year (although obviously I've had, like, four COVID shots haha), but my strategist told me that it was a really bad strain going around -- I guess the natural consequence of that is that more people are ending up in the emergency room, but I was really hoping that our infrastructure would at least be more capable of handling that sort of influx by now, what with the years of pandemic-ing??? Seems not. And thank you for your concern, I promise I'm healthy!!! The bloodwork was a one-off order because I switched doctors and the new one was kind of suspicious of my (experimental) transgender hormone therapy, but it actually ended up being no big deal and I never technically showed up for the blood draw, lol. The only real concern I had was whether or not I was getting my vitamins, because I've never had those tested (and those of us with ADHD statistically tend to be deficient in certain ones??? not sure why that is) but I've been meddling with my diet on my own time anyway now that I'm trying the whole vegan thing, so I'm confident that the multivitamins I'm taking would cover my bases there anyway. All of that to say, a big hullabaloo about nothing, thankfully!
A: Yeah, influenza is been going around not only where I live currently, but all over I'm pretty sure last I checked. Good to know, glad you are! My mom talked to my doctor and he said everything was fine. I just do not like bloodwork in general, but it is probably for the better. Oh, I guess I've switched doctors around 3-5 times? I lost track at this point lol. What is transgender hormone therapy and what was it like? Hullabuloo? Haha.
Q2: On Sugar Shack: I've never heard of this, but it sounds really tasty!!! I feel like every town has one local holiday that makes it special. For me, back when I lived on the Island, my hometown did a big annual thing called Light Up around Christmas where a bunch of volunteers would get together and decorate the entire town -- every building, every tree, decked to the nines -- and then sometime around winter holidays we'd have a big day with a market and a parade where we'd all count down to someone plugging all the lights in at once... it was really cool, and if you end up being in the area for the next one, I highly recommend it! ;)
A: Oh that's cool, I think I've heard of something like that lol. It's similar to what my hometown does -- there is this event in December called Winterfest whereas some people do performances on a portable stage like singing Christmas carols (yesssss, I know!), and mostly bands and choirs perform as well! And there is snacks and hot chocolate!!!!
Q3: On flight delays and sickness: I'm glad to say that I somehow dodged ALL of the flight delays, but everyone around me was in absolute havoc for the whole trip because of the state of airports, ngl -- my partner booked his flight home to Florida on New Years Eve and he ended up waiting twelve hours in the airport, getting on and off planes, until he entirely ditched his airline and bought a whole new ticket to get back in time??? It was a whole thing. The most unpleasant thing I did was sleep overnight in the Toronto Airport, but I very much planned for it, so genuinely cannot complain. But I feel you on being sick -- my mum had a cold that she gave me the moment I arrived in Cancun, one of those deep hacking ones that make you test for COVID (negative, thankfully!) and it's been over a week and I'm still under the weather from it... being sick is no joke, you need your rest!!! I'm sure it was frustrating on your end to miss a bunch of school along the way on top of it, too -- but as long as your teachers are understanding and you prioritize your health over gunning all of the remaining homework at once, then I've got faith you'll be able to catch up! QwQ Fingers crossed that all goes smoothly with your bloodwork results, too!
A: Oh, that's good! I heard that flights were still delayed/cancelled and people were still stuck as I've been reading recently? I don't think I've slept in an airport, not really sure lol. Uh-oh, that's not good. Hope you're recuperating! Good that the COVID test came out negative! Yeah, that's true! They were pretty understanding about it, cooking was cooking and guitar was guitar haha. My mom talked to my doctor and he said everything was fine. I just do not like bloodwork in general, but it is probably for the better.
Q4: On the States: It was a cool experience!!! And I've never been to Seattle either, but I'm sorry to hear that life got in the way for you (it really do be like that sometimes) and I hope that you get the chance again someday -- if it's anything like Vancouver up above it, I'm sure it would have a lot of cool stores and stuff to see! Before visiting Dane, I'd only been out to California a couple times to hang out with a previous partner of mine and to check out Universal Studios and all that... and as far as trips go, I feel like the jump from Canada --> places almost the same as Canada in most respects isn't too much of a jolt (even if California was also uncomfortably hot, lol). It's architecturally kind of the same place, just with different accents and money and Cultural Vibes(c). Definitely worth getting out to as many different places as you can, though!
A: That's nice. Nah, it's fine, it is what it is lol. That's cool, Universal Studios is pretty popular! What'd ya see there? Yeah, I can say that California is hot year-round haha. That's true! 
Q5: On having your own place: I can say with absolute certainty that having my own space to exist in is one of the biggest steps I've taken in life to Be An Adult(c) and come into my own, so to speak, and personally I love it! It is nice to have the freedom to listen to what I like, to eat what I like, to make my own routine choices... you really can't imagine what it's like to have that much control over your existence until you move out, honestly, and I did it pretty late all things considered, since I didn't end up living on my own until the start of my Masters degree -- my parents lived close enough to my BA school and wanted me to stick around and save school money, so it made sense at the time, but I also didn't really know what I was missing until I got out here, you know??? With that said, it is hard being at such a distance from everyone; I'm hoping to end up closer to the family for my PhD, one way or another, just to feel like I have more people in my general vicinity. 
A: Yeah. But honestly? It depends on your parents too, because parents have their own way of parenting. One thing if parents are like, ""Okay so-and-so, since you're an adult now, you should already have money saved up to move out, for university classes and what-not."" Yeah true, it's nice to be closer to family so on holidays and stuff, they don't have to drive to you or you don't have to drive to them lol.
Q6: On Zoom meetings: Apparently there are Zoom meetings coming up!!! They're both admittedly at awful times for me -- one's in the middle of a day where I've got tons of stuff to do, and the other is in the dead of night for some reason haha -- but I'm gonna see if I can make it to the night-time on on the 16th and try to stay conscious through it! Maybe I'll see you there!!! :P
A: Oof, I feel ya. I'm not sure if I will be in class at the time or not, but I guess let's see what happens lol. Can't wait to meet you virtually haha!!!

With that said, it is hard being at such a distance from everyone; I'm hoping to end up closer to the family for my PhD, one way or another, just to feel like I have more people in my general vicinity. 
On profile pictures: Ahh, thank you!!! It was a silly spur-of-the-moment gag, but I also feel like it was pretty representative of the year I first signed up for this mentoring thing... an awful lot of being trapped in the house and making the best of it anyway!
On Zoom meetings: Apparently there are Zoom meetings coming up!!! They're both admittedly at awful times for me -- one's in the middle of a day where I've got tons of stuff to do, and the other is in the dead of night for some reason haha -- but I'm gonna see if I can make it to the night-time on on the 16th and try to stay conscious through it! Maybe I'll see you there!!! :P",mentor

Hey, sorry for the late reply, it's mostly gonna be a hectic week and Christmas Eve and New Years' Eve are gonna be two of them lol!! I know that you're on holiday, but Merry Christmas!!! 🎄🎉
Q1: On health things: 5-6 hours??? I wish I could say I was surprised as much as horrified! Unfortunately, the public health system is so backed up rn that it's not necessarily a shock... but I'm really glad that you got in, in the end, and that you've gotten the antibiotics you need! That's gotta be worth the wait. QwQ As for needles, it was far from my first one, but I've had a life-long phobia of the things that's made me break down and have panic attacks every single time I get vaccines or bloodwork -- which, as I'm sure you can imagine, wasn't super convenient during peak COVID times! -- so I'm really glad to see that all of my practice with meditation/deep-breathing/etc is paying off in helping me to keep my cool with them these days. I still get really nervous for the few days leading up to shots, but hopefully that goes away in time, too!
A: I think so, I don't really remember much but it was somewhere around there. Yeah, it was really busy there because turned out most people who were in the waiting room had the flu and it has been going around but I'm starting to fully recover which is good! And thanks! Oh that's not good, hope everything is going well with you. I didn't know you did bloodwork too. I guess most people do it now. Deep breathing/meditation is good. Whatever helps you beat the fear of needles though!
Q2: On Carnival: Honestly, this sounds pretty awesome -- and now that you mention it, parts of this sound familiar from my French class in high school... we might have done a project on it too at some point! Although I didn't know they had dogsledding, that sounds like so much fun!
A: Oh that's cool! I did something like it back in middle school in Grade 8, but my family and I mostly did activities and stuff in an event called ""Sugar Shack."" It's an event that runs in my hometown every year around February. That's where I tried ""toffee on a stick"" for the first time haha! Yeah, from what I researched, dogsledding was mentioned! Yeah lol, Québec is pretty cool when you think about it in a glance haha. 
Q3: On being excited for Christmas: YES!!! I haven't been this stoked in a while, honestly!!! My last couple weeks have been an absolute mess of doing grad school applications, but I'm almost through them now and I'm ready to take an actual break! It's gonna be a wonderful time catching up with my partner and my family and getting some natural vitamin D for the first time in months. QwQ Which reminds me, I should let you know that I head out for that winter trip to Cancun on Thursday and I'm not sure if I'll have reliable Internet over the holidays, so I probably won't be online until I get back to Saskatchewan a few days after New Years (I think the 4th? but Air Canada has been shifting my flights around a lot so it could be a couple extra days in either direction, honestly???). So this'll probably be my last message for a couple weeks -- but I hope you have the loveliest of holidays and that you get all the family time in the world!!!!!!! Once I get back you'll have to let me know if you got any cool gifts... and also if you want to do any more of these program units next year? I see from your profile that you're interested in learning how to combat procrastination, so maybe you'd be interested in looking at the Strategic Studying unit? They're all open for you if you wanna snoop!
A: Thanks a lot! Good to know -- hope you have fun in Mexico!! Yeah, I have heard that flights have been delayed or cancelled due to winter weather -- hoping people get to places safely! Oh yeah, I have been having procrastination especially since I was home sick for a while and probably missed a lot of school (I am doing better now, all is well, I am currently just waiting for the bloodwork results to come in) 
Q4: On Florida: I have been, once -- I went earlier this year over my spring break to visit and got to stay with my partner and his parents for a week or so! (Which was physically bigger but socially more cramped, haha.) It's a lovely place, but a bit warm and muggy for my liking... though going there after living here with pretty much no humidity is a nice change of pace?
A: Sounds like a cool experience! I haven't been into the States yet, but I was supposed to go to Seattle for the summer around 2019, but unfortunately it never happened due to personal stuff. But it happens  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q5: On whistling during chores: Can confirm that this is a thing that I do -- although now that I live in my own place, I more often just get to crank the music and sing along without having to limit myself to only whistling (so long as I don't annoy my neighbours!).
A: Haha, beware of the neighbours! Oh congratulations on your own place! It probably feels nice, hey? Crankin' the music and just dancing around haha! Whistle to your heart's content haha!!! (even though the neighbours lol, I guess it feels like spinning and throwing a baton in the air repeatively!) Happy whistlin'! 
That's all from me for now, but happy holidays Segués, and I'll catch you again in 2023!!! Stay warm out there!!! :D 
Thanks you too!! Happy holidays!!! 🎉✨",mentee

Q1: Catching up: Oh dear!!! I'm sorry you've been under the weather -- did the bloodwork give you any answers, at least??? I recently had my first needle EVER IN MY LIFE that I didn't cry about and that was very very exciting, but I'm still a bit iffy at the concept of drawing blood, I think. And hey, don't congratulate me yet, I'm still doing the paperwork and we'll see who accepts me (but thank you for the massive vote of confidence)!!! QwQ
A: Yeah. Actually, I was in the hospital for 5-6 hours yesterday. And apparently I have to take antibiotics. And my mom and I did not get the results back but it could take a while. So was it your first time having a needle? Oh yeah, paperwork is tiring lol. 
Q2: On belonging: I very much agree!!! I've definitely gained a lot by being willing to be myself despite the moulds that folks have tried to put me in, and it sounds like you've got a really good perspective on it too -- your self-confidence and determination to be authentic will take you far!!!
A: Yeah, I guess I learned a bit after living in Canada for 16-17 years lol. Thanks :) I appreciate it! 
Q3: On staying healthy: Honestly, a dietician is such a cool idea that I've never thought of??? Really, you'd think that idea would be way more common, considering how ubiquitous the act of eating is for literally everybody on Earth, but it's never occurred to me to just... ask a professional what's best to eat. Power to you my friend! I recently started getting interested in veganism, too, so that's a new idea that will need a bit more research before I can figure out how to incorporate it healthily... and hey, if mind-reading was my secret superpower, you'd think I'd know how to read my own, too -- so that's gotta be out! :P
A: Actually, I was recommended to see one (I forgot why.) Oh that's good! I guess it's good to take a break from meat once in a while.
Q4: On living in cozy spaces: Quite a hassle sometimes, but also well worth the fun!!! My apartment is, uhhhh... a bit larger than a living room, but I guess that's subjective? It's like, one large room that has my kitchen/bed/desk area, then a lil hallway off the back that leads to a small bathroom -- I wanna say it's just under 300sqft, if that means anything to you? A good amount of space for one person who knows how to keep their stuff organized, but when my partner visited from Florida last year it was pretty cramped!
A: Oh, that sounds a bit cozy! I hope you're doing okay with the small space! Have you been to Florida?
Q5: On flowers: Yes!!!!! Hibiscus are so pretty -- they make me think of vacations in Mexico! QwQ
A: That's so cool!! 🌺
Q6:  On Beaver Tails, etc: Yo!!! I actually think that's basically the same thing as where I used to buy them?? It wasn't really a whole restaurant, per se, more so an outside set-up at the bottom of a ski hill that felt kind of like a fairground booth but a little more permanent because they never packed up and moved it around? Picnic-table fare, essentially. And I've heard of Carnival, although I've never celebrated -- what do you do for it?
A: Oh, yeah. I actually thought it was a chain restaurant (kinda like Dairy Queen.) I don't think I remember much since we did it in middle school, we learned some history behind it, and I think we just did some activities in general. But for the actual Carnaval de Québec, there's dogsledding, ice canoes, skating, making snowmen, snow forts, and winter sports. (I did some research on it lol.)
Q7: On decorating your door like a present, which I did NOT know you could do but I suddenly absolutely love: That sounds like SUCH a great display ngl -- I might have to do that for my apartment door if I can find some wrapping paper!!! And oi, -10 can be pretty chilly depending on where you are! It's surprisingly pleasant out here because there's low humidity in the air, but I'd be shivering if I was back home in BC!
A: Yeah, my mom thought about it when we were decorating a while ago lol! My mom used  some kind of ribbon and decorated it as a wrapping paper bow!
Q8: Advice for cold winters: This might be a little extreme because I'm getting very used to the -30-and-lower temperatures of Saskatchewan haha, but if it's going to get REALLY cold and it's an experience you plan to have over and over again (because these can get expensive, you'll wanna make sure you'll get your use out of them!), I highly recommend a down jacket and good gloves (or many many layers of clothing if you don't have these)! I've also found thermal longjohns/undershirts really helpful (they're, like, sorta stretchy pajama-material pants/shirts that you wear under your regular clothes that keep the heat in? makes a great difference for me when I need to walk to work!) and to keep your face covered as best you can, especially if it can keep your breath up against your face (which works two-fold because your breath warms up your nose and cheeks AND you don't have to breathe in a bunch of cold air, which I can find unpleasant and really dry around here -- I just wear my COVID mask outdoors or wrap a scarf around my mouth and nose, whatever's more comfy that day!). For super freezy days out here, I have a full-length jacket that goes right down to my knees, good winter boots that go right UP to my knees to leave as little of a gap as possible, proper gloves, a fluffy wool scarf, a touque, and then I pull my scarf up over my face and my hood down over my touque and keep as much skin covered as possible when running around outdoors; it's a hassle to take it all off again as soon as I get inside, but well worth dodging the frostbite around here!
A: Whoa! -30 sounds extremely cold! That's really chilly for winters there! Thanks for the advice :D
Q9: On whistling in public: All the time! Just less so nowadays, because the mask always gets in the way, haha. And TRUUUUE -- you'd be surprised how often I can whistle for a while and then try to follow the tune and figure out what bloody song I'm copying until ten minutes later it's like ""OH that one on the radio that I heard once years ago that was never relevant again, so glad I figured that out!!!""
A: Oh haha, forgot about the mask lol! I feel you on that! I did research the other day, and I found out that some people whistle while doing chores and stuff around the house.",mentee

Happy belated December!!! I still exist, I just honestly had a very unfortunate med change that grossed me up for a while -- feeling much better now!!! -- and my thesis and PhD applications and general school pressures are beginning to mount. I'm very happy to be in grad school and I wouldn't change it for the world, but it's a lot of work, not gonna lie. QwQ I hope you've been good as well!!
A: Thanks, happy belated December to you too!! That's okay, I am still a bit sick and ended up missing a few things here and there when I was sick at first and I have bloodwork coming up on the 9th. I'm okay so far! That's cool that you made it to grad school!! Congratulations :D
Q1: On finding home: I completely agree -- home is a big mix of factors, from the history of a place, to the history you make in a place, to the people you know and what the land itself means to you as you find your place in the ecosystem... I hope that you've found a place that feels like home to you, but if you haven't yet, I know you will! QwQ
A: Yeah, I agree. Sometimes you never know where you belong, and you don't have to blend in just to fit in with the crowd. That's what I've learned over the years in school. I haven't exactly found it yet, but it's never too late to find out and discover where you belong.
Q2: On class structures and COVID: I actually saw a lot of that myself when my university went hybrid in my last undergrad year -- not only did the pandemic itself create learning challenges (for folks who struggled with online/hybrid delivery and plague stress), but it also revealed a lot of learning challenges that I think we're still trying to figure out how to cope with (like the fact that 5 classes a day was A Lot(c) to begin with!!!). I'm watching my current university try to find that balance between returning-to-the-status-quo and acknowledging-that-the-status-quo-wasn't-the-best-to-begin-with-and-maybe-we-should-learn-some-lessons-from-the-pandemic-years -- we'll see how it balances out?
A: Oh boy, that sounds tough, I mean how it depends on how the school system works because every school system works differently lol. I guess it can balance out?
Q3: On healthy eating: Definitely recommend!!! I've slipped in and out of healthy eating in general over these past few years, but you really don't realize how much energy you're missing when you get used to eating too much junk food. I know that kind of makes me sound old, but like, I was stunned at how much better I felt, even at 24, just getting my vitamins and greens in and suddenly having a better outlook on all aspects of life... now I just need to start doing that with exercise again, because omg am I behind on that!!!
A: Yeah so have I! I second that, definitely a good way to stay healthy! I do need to start getting healthier and also I'm getting a dietician soon so that's a good start lol. But I always wonder how you know.. you're like a mind-reader. Is mind-reading your secret superpower?  
Q4: On building book nooks: Yeah, it's basically a mix of building-by-instructions with pieces that are made to fit together (sort of like Lego, but with fewer combinations and more splinters, haha) and straight-up glueing things in place. So you get all the fun of building but also the satisfaction of not having to know how to design something aesthetically pleasing... which for me is good, because I've never done a hobby like this one before and I always like to start off with a build-by-numbers sort of thing just to get the hang of the craft!
A: Oh that's cool! It reminded me of an archeologist when I think about it lol! Awesome skills!
Q5:  On paper-making: VERY messy!!! But fun if you have a lot of paper scraps and wanna make something that's totally unique (and relatively cheap to get into, if you get your supplies from the dollar store and already own a blender!). I just wish I had more space for it -- the paper-making doesn't take up much room, but the paper-drying where everything is laid out across my tiny apartment can be kind of a hassle!
A: Awesome hobby!! I have never done it before but maybe I'll probably do it in the future! Oh boy that does sound like a hassle! That sounds like a complex and cozy apartment! Is it small like the size of a living room?
Q6: On guitar and whistling: Yoooo that's great progress!!! I still don't even know the notes on the guitar honestly, I can learn A Song(c) if I memorize the movements but I don't really know how it works still? Whistling is much easier for me!!! And I whistle all the time, and I guess I'd say sort of freestyle? Although tunes I know from elsewhere (not playing at the moment, but like, the chorus of a song I like for example) tends to sneak in, so it usually ends up being a mishmash of ""notes i made up"" and ""song that those notes reminded me of that I'm now mixing in,"" haha.
A: Cool! Have you whistled outside in public before? That's funny! The moment when your favourite songs tend to sneak in and next thing you know, you're whistlin' them haha!! :D
Questions of the day:
1) What's my favourite drink during winter? Hot chocolate!!! Hot chocolate 100%!!! I have such great memories as a kid of going skiing on Mt. Washington back on the Island and we'd always end off with hot chocolate and Beaver Tails (not sure if you'd have seen a Beaver Tail place before, although I gather they're actually a chain restaurant, but if not, it's like a big deep-fried flatbread thing that they absolutely slather in chocolate and toppings??? I always got Reese's Pieces, it was THE best). Even now I'm finishing a mug while I finally check all my messages, haha! It's just a symbol of coziness for me, health be damned. QwQ
A: Yes!!! I usually have hot chocolate and it's freakin' awesome!! I did have BeaverTails and heard of it too but never went to the restaurant! The first time I tried them was a few years back at an event called 'Sugar Shack' so I'm not sure if you have heard of it or not lol. And also when I was in middle school, we would celebrate this event called 'Carnival' (it's a winter festival that takes place in Québec around February, it's pretty fun although I have been to Québec, I've never been to the festival itself!)
2) Do I like Christmas carols? I used to, when I was younger, but I think working in that grocery store job for six and a half years killed it for me -- they'd start playing them in November, and it would always be, like, the same ten songs, and after a while it drove me crazy! (With that said, my mum LOVES them, and so I always get kind of a silly smile when Christmas morning comes and she rushes to go blast music off YouTube and I don't think I'd ever be able to dislike them at that moment... just the overplaying of them the rest of the year!)
A: Yep, I feel you on that! The Christmas songs on replay can be nerve-wracking most of the time!
3) Do I like flowers? Yes!!! Although there aren't many around here atm, snow and all. My Grandma's garden back home used to be full of them and it was absolutely gorgeous, though. If I had to pick a favourite, I think I would choose hydrangeas -- because they can be all sorts of pretty colours and I used to have a surprising amount of fun dead-heading them when the garden needed tending to! Do you have a favourite flower?
A: Ayy, that's quite the adventure! Gardens are the best! Hydrangeas are fascinating!! My favourite flower is hibiscus!!
4) And how is early December-ing going for you??? Have you had any snow? Does it feel like holiday-time yet, or is that later into the month? (I always find my level of festivity depends on how excited everyone else is around me, honestly, so it feels later than usual now that I live on my own!)
A: It's going good so far -- my family and I decorated our tree and our door (we decorated the door like a present and we put our wreath outside too!) The snow is coming later this week actually! It was cold last week (around -10 or -11? haha!) It feels like the holidays came early lol!!",mentee

I'm watching my current university try to find that balance between returning-to-the-status-quo and acknowledging-that-the-status-quo-wasn't-the-best-to-begin-with-and-maybe-we-should-learn-some-lessons-from-the-pandemic-years -- we'll see how it balances out?
On healthy eating: Definitely recommend!!! I've slipped in and out of healthy eating in general over these past few years, but you really don't realize how much energy you're missing when you get used to eating too much junk food. I know that kind of makes me sound old, but like, I was stunned at how much better I felt, even at 24, just getting my vitamins and greens in and suddenly having a better outlook on all aspects of life... now I just need to start doing that with exercise again, because omg am I behind on that!!!
On guitar and whistling: Yoooo that's great progress!!! I still don't even know the notes on the guitar honestly, I can learn A Song(c) if I memorize the movements but I don't really know how it works still? Whistling is much easier for me!!! And I whistle all the time, and I guess I'd say sort of freestyle? Although tunes I know from elsewhere (not playing at the moment, but like, the chorus of a song I like for example) tends to sneak in, so it usually ends up being a mishmash of ""notes i made up"" and ""song that those notes reminded me of that I'm now mixing in,"" haha.
On building book nooks: Yeah, it's basically a mix of building-by-instructions with pieces that are made to fit together (sort of like Lego, but with fewer combinations and more splinters, haha) and straight-up glueing things in place. So you get all the fun of building but also the satisfaction of not having to know how to design something aesthetically pleasing... which for me is good, because I've never done a hobby like this one before and I always like to start off with a build-by-numbers sort of thing just to get the hang of the craft!
On paper-making: VERY messy!!! But fun if you have a lot of paper scraps and wanna make something that's totally unique (and relatively cheap to get into, if you get your supplies from the dollar store and already own a blender!). I just wish I had more space for it -- the paper-making doesn't take up much room, but the paper-drying where everything is laid out across my tiny apartment can be kind of a hassle!
Questions of the day:
What's my favourite drink during winter? Hot chocolate!!! Hot chocolate 100%!!! I have such great memories as a kid of going skiing on Mt. Washington back on the Island and we'd always end off with hot chocolate and Beaver Tails (not sure if you'd have seen a Beaver Tail place before, although I gather they're actually a chain restaurant, but if not, it's like a big deep-fried flatbread thing that they absolutely slather in chocolate and toppings??? I always got Reese's Pieces, it was THE best). Even now I'm finishing a mug while I finally check all my messages, haha! It's just a symbol of coziness for me, health be damned. QwQ
Do I like Christmas carols? I used to, when I was younger, but I think working in that grocery store job for six and a half years killed it for me -- they'd start playing them in November, and it would always be, like, the same ten songs, and after a while it drove me crazy! (With that said, my mum LOVES them, and so I always get kind of a silly smile when Christmas morning comes and she rushes to go blast music off YouTube and I don't think I'd ever be able to dislike them at that moment... just the overplaying of them the rest of the year!)
Do I like flowers? Yes!!! Although there aren't many around here atm, snow and all. My Grandma's garden back home used to be full of them and it was absolutely gorgeous, though. If I had to pick a favourite, I think I would choose hydrangeas -- because they can be all sorts of pretty colours and I used to have a surprising amount of fun dead-heading them when the garden needed tending to! Do you have a favourite flower?
And how is early December-ing going for you??? Have you had any snow? Does it feel like holiday-time yet, or is that later into the month? (I always find my level of festivity depends on how excited everyone else is around me, honestly, so it feels later than usual now that I live on my own!)",mentor

This is what I have written so far: 
BCIT - You will need to also have to graduate high school (as you would in other universities/colleges.) 
UVIC - You will need to complete any health information science which includes earning the Bachleor of Science if you are planning to go into the science field.  
If you are planning to apply to any university, you will need to have graduated high school.",mentee
,,55268,2022-10-28 19:00:00," 
The schools I've done research on is BCIT, UVIC and VIU. 
Oh okay! I wasn't sure what you were saying lol, it usually takes me a while to fully understand what you meant! Oof, my ASD lol. 
Good choice, it's nice to be closer to family lol. I am moving down with family to Vancouver Island next summer when I graduate :) 
Oh I'm sorry about that. You sound like a good friend, and there's always a rainbow after the storm 🌈
Yeah, maybe. I did not get much done with the word document due to my capstone lol. Are you sure you are okay with it? Just double checking. If so, I will see if my laptop is working and I can try and do my best and send it to you. 
Candy is always the best! And I usually watch Halloween movies with my family and it's scary and funny at the same time! We were actually watching Goosebumps last week and it had some horror but with some funny twists lol! So you're going as a plague doctor for Halloween this year? That's cool! Yeah, I like dressing up! I might be a pirate this year, but not sure! Oh haha, I guess maybe they sorta like Halloween? Not really sure! 
Oh that's nice! Piano sounds great, classic instrument haha. 
I have never heard of an ocarina! What is it? Is an instrument? Sounds super cool! 
Same goes for guitar too! Guitar is an awesome instrument! 
Yeah, country is not really the best, but it's okay I guess. But I mostly like pop, hip-hop, and some R&B. 
Whistling is great! I heard it's supposed to boost your mood I think lol! What kind of genre do you usually whistle to? 
QOTD: What do you like about winter?",mentee
,,55268,2022-10-28 15:29:00," 
Good news!!! From the tone of the last email I got on this, I'd say you're not gonna get in trouble for taking that extra day to do the last activity; it sounds like your teacher is more interested in making sure that you're engaging with the program, and we've definitely got that covered, so don't panic! :D 
I'm good!!! Had a big chaotic week but everything seems to be looking up now -- and it's my cooking day, so I'm currently busy making a tourtière and some beef stew and chicken stirfry, which ain't too shabby at all!
1) Factors as in anything that would influence you to choose one university over another -- for example, it sounds like you're moving wherever your family plans to go, so I expect you'd be more likely to choose a university near them, rather than one across the country? Anything like that. For me, I was really concerned with seeing family, with the sort of funding I was offered, whether or not I would be comfortable with the campus culture, etc -- those were all factors that influenced my decision to come here, whereas for my BA, I just picked the university closest to where I lived because my mum went there and liked it and I could keep living at home! What that decision-making process looks like is different for everyone, and you don't have to tell me how you feel about every single item on the list, for what it's worth -- just think about which ones matter most to you!
2) Many many things! As I said above, it was really important for me to be close to family, for one -- and considering that of my two main offers, one was here and the other was way off across the country, I knew it would be cheaper and easier to get back and visit from Saskatchewan! Funding was also a big factor; this school offered me a major scholarship to make their offer more competitive, because they knew that I was looking at the other school that had a higher ranking, and that other school didn't secure nearly as much funding for me, so I knew I would be more comfortable here financially (especially as I struggle to work and do school stuff at the same time -- having a full-time physical job while doing my papers would be really hard for me to keep up on with my ADHD symptoms/time management, whereas having a part-time tutoring job just a couple days a week to top up my scholarship funding is really comfy!). But I would say that it was the community culture that really sold it for me -- when I had my interview with my supervisor over Zoom for Saskatchewan, it felt so much more friendly than the other school, like a place I actually wanted to be instead of one I just wanted to endure until I had a degree, if that makes sense? It's an unfortunate reality that a lot of really high-ranked schools can be way more competitive in terms of individual students -- as in, the people that you have to show up to class with and make friends with every day are less likely to be friendly/helpful to you sometimes because they all want to be The Best Student(c), which can make you feel more like you're enemies with everyone than friends, and I... didn't want that. I didn't want that as a student, I don't want it as a professor, and I don't see the point of going to university if I'm going to be unhappy in it. That was one of my biggest things. All in all, I'm really grateful for the choices I've made!
3) Oh, that's fair!!! If you want to write down all of the stuff you WOULD put into that document in a reply, I can copy/paste it into a word document for you and you can have it that way, if it helps! I'm not 100% sure if your teacher will check it regardless -- sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, so you might be able to get away with just saying all of the things to me and then I can vouch for us having discussed it if anyone ever asks!
Favourite things to do on Halloween: eat tons of candy, enjoy the lax social rules that seem to come with weird holidays like this one, and particularly to dress up as a plague doctor and stand very still next to extravagant Halloween displays, trying to get people to think I'm a decoration, and then move a little right when they've decided I'm not real. That's such a good trick. How about you? Do you like the dressing up aspect at all, or are you less of the costume type? It's one of my favourite parts but my partner doesn't like it at all, haha. 
I am a very good whistler and enjoy it very very much!!! I also took, like, ten years of piano lessons, and a little bit of guitar and ocarina. I haven't done much musically in a while, but it used to be a pretty big part of my life! Even -- the horror, I know -- very specific country songs because they remind me of days out driving with my mum, but it's certainly not my favourite genre, lol. I miss those radio vibes, though; there's something almost less 'magical' about being able to just put on any song you want these days, whereas when they came on on the radio and you were like ""omg I love this song, turn it up!!!"" it was a treat, you know??? Good times indeed. QwQ",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-27 20:50:00," 
And also it's pretty cool that you used to sing in your car. Do you whistle to music too or pretty much anything or did you just sing? 
And also I'm a music fan, just not a big fan of country music lol.
My babysitter, me and my sisters would sing random songs that came on the radio when we were younger lol. Good times :')",mentee

Hey, how you doing? Sorry for the late reply, was tired when I came home from school. 
Q1: Location of the campus (i.e. is it close or far from “home”, do you want to live in that city?)
A: I didn't think too far ahead yet, but I am moving with family next year.
Q2: Residence and housing options?
A:  I also didn't think about that yet, but hopefully I'll get it figured out!
Q3: Distance to amenities (ie: grocery stores, pharmacy, mall, etc?) 
A: Yeah, it would definitely save time going there and back lol. 
Q4: Food on campus and in the surrounding community?
A: Most likely, it depends if I want to cook my own meals or not. (Definitely not cooking on busy days though!) 
Q5: Exercise and recreation facilities on campus or nearby? 
A: Yeah, good to have them towards campus. 
Q6: Transportation options (ie: do you need a car?)
A: It depends if I learn to drive in the future or not. 
That's a lot of oppurtunities! 
1) Factors as in how the school works? Sorry just confused lol. 
2) How did you find out about the University of Sasketchewan? What interested you to apply? 
3) I do not have access to Word at the moment, but I'll try and do it tomorrow if you're cool with it. I'm not sure if it's due tomorrow. My laptop is also not in the best condition (hope I can get it fixed next year!) But I can try and find a laptop at school and complete it on time.

Oh, hang on, there's one more bit, I didn't scroll down enough!!!
5) Share with me: do you think you’ll be admitted into the program(s) you researched? Why or why not? And then I'll review your final document with all your research and see if I have any info or advice to help you succeed in your applications! 
And THEN we'll be done and good to move onto whatever!!! Thankfully nothing else will be in this kinda rush. And hey, I know it looks like a lot of annoying stuff to write down right now, but I actually think this is probably one of the most useful activities we offer -- researching for university stuff can be a really scary hurdle when you're doing it on your own, so I think it's good that this is offered as an actual discussion. I was really lucky that my mum went to university herself and was able to help me understand some of the confusing bits of university websites and course requirements and all that jazz, so if there's anything that I can make easier and less overwhelming for you, I'm happy to pay it forward!!! :D",mentor

Okay so I had this message finished this morning and I could have sworn I sent it but now it isn't here and I can't find that tab so we are gonna do this again! Technology. :'D
For part 2 of this unit, the tasks are as follows!
1) Look at all of these factors (or add your own!) that might influence you in deciding on a school, and pick the ones that are most important to you in terms of making your own potential university choice:
Campus Location Factors:
Location of the campus (i.e. is it close or far from “home”, do you want to live in that city?)
Residence and housing options
Distance to amenities (ie: grocery stores, pharmacy, mall, etc)
Food on campus and in the surrounding community
Exercise and recreation facilities on campus or nearby
Transportation options (ie: do you need a car?)
Supports and Opportunities for Students:
Cultural Groups
Online learning opportunities
Financial support
Part-time work opportunities
Hands-on learning and/or co-op opportunities
Student support centers, academic advising, peer mentor programs
Accessibility Services & Supports (including mental health)
Campus Culture:
Extra-curriculars: athletics, clubs, activities
School teams and “spirit”
Social climate (“party” vs. “serious study” schools)
Workload expectations
Libraries and places to study
Student Government
Diversity of faculty and students
Size of the school – how many students, faculty to student ratio
2) Look through the list of schools you found on BC Education Planner (ie. when you go to the site that summarized all the different jobs and found the info on them, there was a section that linked to All the Schools That Would Teach You This Job -- that list!) and see which ones might be the best fit for you based on the factors you chose.
For example, if you're really looking for a school with a small faculty-to-student ratio (which means there's one professor to maybe 10-15 students, rather than one professor teaching 200 people at a time -- this can really change your experience of classes and how much assistance you feel you can ask for when you don't understand something!!!), then see which schools in each of your careers boast a small ratio like that! You can find this info on each university's website, or by researching the city that it's in, or by looking up testimonies from students who already go there to see what they say it's like!
3) Share your factors and most-likely-to-have-those-factors schools with me and we'll talk about them! You're also supposed to ask me one question about my experience in this area again, but I'm not picky about what it is -- whatever you want to know about school life is fine in this case, although if you wanna know more about how I researched my university options, we can get into that too!
4) Finally, they want you to list (in a word document/PDF/etc) all of the entry requirements for the universities that you thought fit your bill -- that is, what you have to do or have (in terms of coursework, grades, etc) to be accepted at each university; every uni website will have a page that lists these out! -- and then save that document to your portfolio with the green button to the bottom right of the text box! That makes a copy of it on the website so that your teacher can check on it if they want to.
... And then we'll be home free! :D",mentor

Oh and I realized I forgot about question 3 lol, so I'll answer it here. 
 
Q3: What is your 'average job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it? 
A: (I don't know if you're talking about the job am currently working at or in the future.) If you're talking about my ""future"" job, then here's my answer: My ""average"" job is a computer network technician, you will need a ton of skills with computers, you will need to study computer science or any courses related to computers and you will need a diploma/certificate of training for any of the softwares studied.",mentee

Thanks for organizing the questions Challen! Makes it easier to read them all lol. I will answer them Q&A style if you're cool with it :D
Q1: What is your 'dream job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
A: For my dream job, a graphic designer and you will need to apply for a degree (e.g., Bachelor's degree.) 
Q2: What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'dream job' (eg. school is expensive, this job's more popular in another area, etc)?
A: It requires a lot of schooling, (although you can also be self-taught), and depending on the school, yes, it can be pretty expensive. It is a little bit harder to get into the dream university.  
Q4: What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'average job'?
A: Once again, it requires a lot of schooling, a degree or a diploma and lots of skills as well. 
Q5: How do you feel about the qualifications for these two jobs? Are you excited for it? Anxious? Why or why not?
A: I'd say I would be anxious, because you never know the odds of the two jobs and what your schedule is like every day. 
Q6: Do you think each of those careers would be achievable fo you? Why or why not?
A: Honestly, if I get to my goals, it would be achievable because of how much I wanna aim for my goals and make sure to do them step by step. 
Q7: What do you think are three potential benefits of going to university (just in general, apparently)? 
A: You might learn some new things (things that you might've not learned while in high school.) It's also good for job applications (plus, it'll look good on a résume!)

Hah, the folks' home. Sounds about right lol. 
I mean, Tim Hortons has been kind of the norm recently, it's a good spot to have coffee, donuts and hanging out with friends :D 
My dream places would be to travel to Spain, Australia and probably Seattle :D

Oh, yeah, I know those small-town vibes where all you've got as a hangout spot is the Timmy's -- it was such a meme in my town that when I graduated from high school and did a valedictorian speech, I joked about our town's biggest attractions being the Tim Hortons and the old folks' home, haha. That's one of the nice things about city life, I've found -- there's actually stuff to do, even if I'm mostly a homebody nonetheless! If you ever get the chance, cat café is highly recommended. ;)
Dream place to travel isssss a tough one, honestly! I feel like I've already seen all of the things I wanted to, and travel isn't necessarily a bucket list item for me, so I'm not sure I have one! Do you have a dream place to travel???

Cats cats cats cats cats!!! Perfect little furballs, I love them so much and I'm very much due for another visit to the cat café down the road, it brings me so much joy. QwQ How about you? Are you a cat or a dog person (or neither or both, gasp)???
Also, five days left to get this unit done!!! Here are all the instructions for part one, once you've read the Anchor Text 1 ""What Education Do You Need?"" bit and all attached links:
1) Go onto the website they link with all of the career profiles and look up two careers -- your 'dream job,' or something that you think would be really cool to make big money off of (art, for example?) and one more 'average' or 'traditional' career (something reliable and distinctly average that you could do for money in the meantime while you're trying to set up for that dream job). Then take notes on what you'd need for each of those jobs in terms of qualifications/education. The Rules(c) say you've got to share all this and discuss some other factors with me, so I've made you a fill-in-the-blanks thing you can copy/paste into your own message back to keep you on track:
1) What is your 'dream job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
2) What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'dream job' (eg. school is expensive, this job's more popular in another area, etc)?
3) What is your 'average job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
4) What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'average job'?
5) How do you feel about the qualifications for these two jobs?  Are you excited for it? Anxious? Why or why not?
6) Do you think each of those careers would be achievable fo you? Why or why not?
7) What do you think are three potential benefits of going to university (just in general, apparently)?
Once that's done, you just need to ask me one question about career-planning/school-planning/something on this subject; the anchor text above gives some examples, but I'm open to anything on the topic of work/school life that you're curious about!!! Then we can finish whatever part two of this unit is next, and then all of your graded stuff will be done and we can talk about whatever you'd like!

On living in one place: I think there are some nice benefits to not moving a great deal, at least in terms of familiarity -- you come to know what ""home"" feels like and you know your community, eh? I kind of miss that here sometimes. But on the flipside, I also felt kind of stagnant where I lived, probably because everyone knew me and then I transitioned and still had to deal with everyone knowing me as I was previously and all of the weirdness that entailed??? And it's genuinely good to have some space to work out who I am in the absence of the life-long environmental influences of my hometown/etc. So I guess staying still and moving can be healthy in their own ways!
On cooking: Pumpkin spice latte cake sounds so good!!!!! I think I made pretzels once, but I've definitely never made a cake like that... jealous. :P It sounds like you're enjoying new hobbies early, which can be really refreshing if you've had A Lot of the Same Stuff day in and day out throughout the rest of high school -- good for you!!!
On questions: Yes, you're free to ask me just about anything, I think? With the obvious caveats that we don't share personal info, talk about doing illegal things, or discuss anything particularly inappropriate, and that I'm professionally obliged to tell people if you're in danger or if you're putting others or yourself in danger, all the basic ethical rules of the platform. But like, for real, I'm here to help you learn stuff about life, so if life is out there being spooky and unknowable and you want advice on something that isn't in one of the units, I'm totally here for it!
On Sri Lanka: Sucks to hear that politics have once again ruined good things... I'm sorry to hear that, but unfortunately not surprised. QwQ Admittedly I had to look up the particular district because I hadn't heard of that, but it looks lovely from the distance that the Internet provides -- I see a bird sanctuary and that's all I'd need! Do you remember anything from back when it was still 'nice,' or was that before your time?
On tutoring: I actually don't have a set list of clients! It's not so much a one-on-one thing like you and I are doing here, where folks get paired up and actually get to know each other; it's more like a drop-in thing where a few tutors are available to help with whatever a student brings in that day, and then we're just paired up for half an hour or so while whichever tutor knows the most about X topic helps the student work out the kinks in their paper, and then... well, maybe after that I never get to see that student again, or maybe they really like what I do in particular and make an effort to show up on my shifts when they need help with other assignments in the future, but for the most part it's a one-and-done kind of job. I still try to be personal with people, though -- I really feel like that aspect is lacking, particularly because of our random-drop-in system where we don't build distinct rapport with particular folks most of the time. But I guess it also means that I get to help a lot more people, overall, so maybe it's the best system they've got for writing help? Blasting music is strictly prohibited in any case, lol!!!
On the many many questions: 
1) There's surfing in Tofino??? Really??? I'd never thought about that, but I guess it's possible. They do have some really nice beaches up there...
2) Chard is a leafy green vegetable with a red stem that looks... uhhhhh... kind of like a darker, slightly wilted version of green leaf lettuce? It sounds bizarre when I try to describe it, but it's really good if you boil up the leaves until they're tender and then serve them hot with a little bit of white vinegar!
3) This must make for THE best family Christmas photos, haha -- you all match!!!
4) All things considered, I've been doing okay!!! I'm still very excited for the holidays, just have to, like, make it that far past all the school stuff in the way. Such is life! QwQ
On names: That is actually such a cool name though??? I mightily approve!!! 
What would I say to someone having a bad day?: Depends on what kind of bad day, to be honest -- but in general, I like to remind people (wherever appropriate!) that life goes on, that a lot of the things that really hurt us now can end up making us much stronger and more resilient people in the end, that it's OK to be sad and it's also OK to let go of being sad when you're ready (because feeling like you Have to Be Sad about something as an obligation never feels good), and that while it's OK to have a bad day, if every day is a bad day, then I always encourage them to talk to someone about it. Legitimately, I've seen so many people in my life with mental health issues who just kind of don't realize that they deserve to not have to live with their symptoms, or that they even can have a life without that extra burden, and sometimes just being a person who says ""hey you know you CAN get help/talk to someone/do X thing you're afraid of and it's OK to do that"" is all they need to actually reach out and get meds or therapy or start whatever new chapter of their lives they've been putting off out of sheer anxiety. I do it a lot as a tutor and I try to do it a lot as a friend. I hope it helps them. QwQ
When did I learn to whistle and why?: I kind of picked it up, over and over again, and then forgot repeatedly how to do it? Like, I swear I breathed funny one day, went ""oh that sounded like a whistle"" and then freaked out trying to keep doing it and couldn't make it happen again... and that happened, like, four times? And finally I had one random time when I accidentally whistled, then figured out how to keep doing it on purpose, and kind of just never stopped because I was afraid to forget again, haha!
You're so sweet!!! I do my best!!! QwQ And hey, you seem like a wonderful person yourself, and I'm sure that all of the humans who know you out there in the overworld treasure you very very much!!!",mentor

BC was very fun!!! I got to see my grandma for the first time in a while and we did some painting and Netflix-watching, so no complaints over here! :D 
That's cool, I didn't know you painted lol! And Netflix is okay, but what can I say? Haha. 
Q1: Living on Vancouver Island/in Saskatchewan have both been good experiences for me, but they're very very different ones!!! I'd say I liked the Island because the weather was nice, it had a lot of great scenic spots to drive through and stop for a visit in, and because it had a very contained atmosphere (as in, hard to get lost, I always felt 'familiar' with everywhere I went for the most part, etc). But Saskatchewan has been nice because cities have much more stuff to do, it's scenic in its own way, and the people are so friendly!!!
A: Oh, that's pretty cool, if I do say so myself. I've pretty much stayed in one city most of my life and never moved anywhere else. Although there were some times that we were gonna move to a different city but it usually never happened lol. 
Q2: Cooking and guitar classes sound wonderful -- I wish I'd had the chance to learn guitar in high school! QwQ
A: Honestly, it is! We made some good stuff lately. We recently made pumpkin spice latte cake (yes that's a thing haha!!) and we made bread pretzels too! And guitar is cool, we are planning to learn more songs throughout the course, but both the classes last ten weeks :( but at least it's good to try somethin' new! Except I've started taking cooking maybe about Grade 9 or 10? Not too sure lol. 
Q3: Yeah, I meant other units of this course! Honestly, since it's not for a grade or anything now, I think I'll just open them all for you and you can look through them and see if there's anything that you want to discuss further -- it's a lot of good advice throughout, so I recommend giving it all a look, but feel free to hone in on whatever interests you!!! (Discussion questions are those weird pop-out pages that we Had To Do(c) for these two units, but aren't necessary for the rest -- though you're free to look at them if you want to know what kind of questions you can ask me??? Eh. I'm here to answer whatever, so again, totally up to you, haha.)
A: Oh okay, I know it's been a while since the first discussion when I met you, but thanks for refreshing my memory lol! So like any questions? Even burning questions? Lol. 
Q4: I have heard of Sri Lanka, though I've never been! Which did you prefer, the beaches or the temples? And how does it compare to where you're living now, if I may ask?
A: That's a surprise! Usually some people I've talked to usually don't know what it is unless I explain (which I don't like doing, but I do it anyways lol.) or if they do research on it, which I'm not sure they do until they tell me a fact they've learned about it haha. I guess it used to be an nice country but now there's been a lot of situations involving the government and the system recently. Also I was born in a city called Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia :) I forgot to mention that earlier lol! (it's a suburb in Colombo, but I think there are types of district regions in Sri Lanka.) 
Q5: Generally speaking, tutoring is pretty quiet -- except when there are, like, three of us working and all answering questions at the same time because the room is small?? That's not bad though, a lot of times one of us will have a question we can't answer for a client so we just call across the room and go ""hey, who knows the answer to this???"" which is SO efficient not gonna lie--
A: Oh! I misread this one lol. Oh so you tutor two people then? Haha. That's pretty cool. I was expecting someone to just blast music for fun lol. 
Q6: Oi, if you love Indian food, then when you get to the Island you HAVE to check out Heritage Indian Cuisine in Duncan -- it's the best I've ever had!!!!
A: Cool! I'll be sure to check it out when I move next year haha! 
Q7: I love the existence of beaches, but don't visit them often; same with hiking, although I did once go on a REALLY cool hike where I got to spelunk through an underground cave!; I've never had the opportunity to surf (I'm not sure that's a thing on the Island??? our currents might not be good for it) and doubt I could ever balance on a surfboard, klutz that I am!; my favourite fruits aaaare strawberries, blueberries, plums, Mandarin oranges, and probably avocado, and I'm a really big fan of carrots, broccoli, and chard; and over Christmas, I've always really enjoyed the general feeling of togetherness and the morning activities above all! My parents have been separated pretty much my whole life, so the middle of Christmas Day was always hectic as I would travel from one house to the other to see both for the holidays -- but in the morning, Mum always had a tradition that we'd wake up late, wander out in our pajamas, open some VERY stuffed stockings and munch on chocolates while we waited on Christmas breakfast at my grandparents' place... and it was so peaceful. This year won't be nearly as relaxing, I expect, but I can still remember it fondly! QwQ How about you? Do you have any particular Christmas traditions?
A: That's good! I guess it's good to be active lol. Cool, I've never went in a underground cave! Yeah, I think it is, I'm pretty sure. I know that my friend said that there was surfing at Tofino! I haven't been there myself lol. That's nice, but what's chard? Usually we typically wear different colors every year, not sure what color my family and I are wearing this year haha! Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Hope you've been doing well.  
Q8: Do you have a preference for Jen or Segués, or are both equally good with you? And how does one pronounce Segués? I've never heard of the name before, but it looks pretty! 
A: I think I'm okay with either. I actually thought of the name Segués a lot, and apparently it means ""transition"" but it's a music term, so I don't know the actual meaning behind it lol. But thought it sounded cool. I think you pronounce it as: (segh•wayz) 
(yes, it sounds like Segway as in the hoverboard lol. sorry for the confusion!) 
Q9: And as for the bonus question: I already know how to ski, but snowboarding looks way heckin' harder to do and I guarantee I'd break my legs on the way down, so I'll stick with what I know, haha!!!
A: Ooh, good point there haha. 
Qs-OOTD: If there something you would say to someone who is having a bad day, what would you say to them? When did you learn to whistle and why?
Man, I wish I knew you in real life!!! You seem like a good friend :D",mentee

(All of the units are open and you're free to check out whatever you'd like, but I will say that this unit is one of the ones I would have most liked to see myself when I was younger! Critical thinking is a much more involved skill than people realize, and recognizing and applying it has been one of the most important lessons I've learned at the university level -- that I would have liked to learn much sooner and more directly, haha.)

Oh, that's a good way to keep track of your routines.
Apparently, if I sleep around midnight or so, I usually wake up a bit later (what a surprise lol) 
I usually use pillow spray if I'm having one of those hard nights. Or I just casually wait until I feel tired lol. 
That's cool! Do you cook vegetables and stuff? Or do you usually cook whatever comes to mind?

And on eating and sleeping habits (because I'm working on them too!!!): what would make it easier for you to eat/sleep better, do you think? I know for me, sleeping is usually a matter of setting reminders (so I know when bedtime is) and limiting my YouTube time (because if I fall into a rabbithole with a long video, I'm bound to stay up!), and for eating, it's a matter of bulk-cooking my food in advance (so I have healthy dinners with zero effort, which makes it easy to choose them over fast food!) and limiting the amount of junk food in my house (I recently made a batch of peanut butter cookies and I've been paying for that ever since, haha). Would any of those things work for you, or do you have other methods of keeping on track?",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-21 08:22:00," 
Anytime! That's what learning is for, my friend!!! :D
It's a good activity and we can definitely come back to it later if you'd like, buuuut seeing as we've got one week left to get through a whole 'nother unit before your class deadline comes up, we should finish the requirements up first just in case it takes longer than expected to get through them! I just really don't want you to get a bad grade because of the time crunch... QwQ I will say, though, that while we're deciding, I think the Post-Secondary and Career Planning unit would probably be closest in content to what we would talk about in Adulting 101, if that helps sway your choice any! (And hey, from what I understand, just because your course requirements are due in a week doesn't mean I have to disappear or anything -- if you want to keep talking and going through all the other activities after the 28th is up, I'm pretty sure that's a thing we're allowed to do if we ask, and then we don't have to worry about deadlines! We just have to get through one more now for your class, and then after that the rest is up to you!!!)

The countryside is nice, although I have never lived there. I'm not sure if I've visited though. I've lived in cities most of my life lol.
Oh good to know, because I think you mentioned consuming junk food as a sign of stress so I was like ""oh I wonder if it can make you nauseous or sick?"" 
1) I have a lot of tv shows, so that's a hard one :') 
2) would probably like to live in Vancouver or Seattle :D

Accommodations are anything that an institution will change policy for re: a person's marginalized identities, most commonly disability. So when I got my ADHD diagnosis, for example, I started getting disability accommodations where, for example, professors would be more flexible with deadlines and extensions for me than what was dictated on their syllabi, or if I needed extra time on a test, I could ask for arrangements to be made to provide that for me. Another time, I (unofficially) asked for gender accommodations on account of needing a few extra minutes during breaks for one class (because it was in a building where the nearest gender-neutral bathroom was really far away, so I didn't want to be marked as late back if I ran there on my break). Whether you have any official paperwork or not, I think it's always important to know that you can ask for those accommodations to be made for you!!!
The Adulting 101 activity is more of the same stuff as this last one -- but not just about self-care, more broadly about your life skills! We would take stock of all of the things you're good at, then all of the areas that you think you might want to improve on as you move into adulthood (eg. ""I'm really good at cooking! but I don't know how to pay bills..."") and then for each of those learning areas, we'd come up with concrete steps for improvement! But that's an optional one, so we'll want to get through the other necessary unit first and then circle back around if that interests you.
On choosing universities, I actually applied to quite a few of them when I planned for my MA! I officially got accepted into two -- Dalhousie University, which is way across Canada in Halifax, and here in Saskatchewan. Part of my choice was the distance, honestly; I didn't want to be further from my family than I already am, and the time zone difference would have been hard on me. Another part was the length of the program, because USask's Master's program was a two-year thing, but Dalhousie was only one, and I didn't think that I could learn How to Adult(c) and also write a whole thesis in the same year, haha. And the last part was the funding, because USask offered me much more money and in a place that was a lot more affordable, so I knew I would be more comfortable in terms of scheduling (because I find it overwhelming to have a lot of work at the same time as I do school things, so having to have a full-time job or money stress on top of homework would definitely affect my performance!). There are a lot of factors to consider in choosing a school in general, and I don't think I ever had a dream school so much as a dream situation -- going somewhere I could still regularly connect with my family one way or another, where I worked and schooled but not too hard, and where I was just generally comfortable. I've definitely found that here! :D
Thank you!!! QwQ You're so sweet!
Qs-otD:
1) My favourite shows would have to be BoJack Horseman on Netflix and/or the 2003-2009 Battlestar Galactica (because I'm doing my thesis on it!). I actually don't watch much TV at this point in my life (I intentionally don't have a TV, though I still have the Netflix subscription!) but I think my vagueness here is more that I like too many shows than that I've seen too few of them, haha.
2) City or countryside... is a tough balance, honestly! I think I'm a countryside person all the way, just because I really love nature (and I miss being able to just wander into the woods, you don't really get that out here on the prairies!) and I like the quiet. But with that said, I think countryside home within driving distance of a relatively functional city would be the ideal, because then you can also choose to interact with all the city amenities when you feel like it, you know??? Balance is key, I think!
3) No nausea or anything, mostly I just get stomachaches! But I'm more concerned about how sugar and diet in general interacts with my meds, because I think they wear off faster/have more weird side effects if I don't eat healthy. It's a whole thing.
Questions for you:
1) Right back atcha on these Qs of the day -- what's your favourite show? Where would you like to live? (Have you had any experience with city life, actually? I didn't until I came here!)
2) Just to make sure we really definitely hit those unit requirements, what are three ways that you can improve your self-care in life? In terms of a) three areas that you think you could improve, eg. sleep, eating healthy, exercise, socializing, etc, and b) one actionable step each that you can do to encourage yourself to be healthy in all of those ways?
3) Once that's done, which unit did you want to do next? (Adulting 101 is just an activity, not a whole unit -- all of the unit titles are up in that weird circle at the top; let me know what topic would interest you most and I can open it up, and then once that's done we can do whatever you'd like!!!)",mentor

PS: There's an Extension Activity on this unit as well, called Adulting 101, that seems to be optional (at least wasn't specified in my email?) but if you have the time and wanna do that after all the class requirements are over with, we can pop back to that, too! No worries if not, though -- I want you to focus on what you think is most relevant to you once the requirements are completed, not just check boxes for the heck of it!

Just because I know you need this unit and one other one done by the 28th(!!!), I'll see if I can streamline this so you don't miss anything importaaaaant--
So the self-care action plan part of this discussion asks you to 1) share three things with me that you could change in your life, right now, to take better care of yourself, and for each of those, 2) describe how you would make each of those changes happen. I'll give you one example from my life as an example, because I have not been getting my eight hours of sleep lately -- so one of my three self-care changes would be to ""prioritize my sleep schedule,"" and maybe some things I would do to make that happen would be, like, ""leave my laptop across the room at night so I don't feel tempted to stay up,"" ""go to bed right on time even if I'm in the middle of something and let Morning Challen deal with the clean-up,"" and ""keep the curtains closed so the light doesn't wake me up early,"" eh? I'm convinced I'll do at least two of those things (it's hard for me to stop mid-task, aaa!). And finally, you have to 3) ask me one question about self-care... literally anything at all, but some of the examples they give are, like, ""how do you prioritize self-care? do you have any time management tips? how do you break bad habits?"" Something of that nature, but ideally something you actually want to know so that you get some good advice out of me!!! And then you can let me know what other unit you want me to open and we can start on the next one (and hopefully finish it well before your deadline and then talk about whatever you want! :D)",mentor

Aaaaand here we are! It looks like the modules have changed a little bit from what I've seen last year -- so for now, we'll start with the linked article by Anne Bokma and the self-care action plan video and then have a discussion before moving onto whatever the secret second set of discussion questions are. :P I'll give you my lists here!:
1) ""Warning signs"" that I'm in need of self-care include:
- Feeling ""tired"" a lot. Not just physically, although sometimes I'm just not getting enough sleep either, but mentally tired like ""I want to take a nap so I can stop worrying about X and Y.""
- Compulsively eating junk food. Usually means I'm stressed about something else!
- Compulsively starting new projects as a distraction from whatever I'm actually avoiding. You know when you pick up fifty different ""oh that might be cool"" craft ideas but then you have all of the STUFF strewn around your room from those crafts and none of them are getting done and then you're like, ""well heck, now I have to do FIFTY-ONE things instead of the one I was avoiding because I've spent the money""??? That. I do that a lot.
- Compulsively (see the pattern here haha) playing games, listening to music, or having something ""on"" all the time. I call this ""passive consumption,"" because what I'm really doing is keeping my brain busy so I don't have enough silence to think about whatever's bugging me -- which can be really tiring in and of itself!
- Avoiding talks with family. Sometimes I'm busy, and that's OK and understandable, but I often catch myself feeling ""guilty"" about talking to them if I've fallen behind on schoolwork because I don't want them to ask... which is silly, because they know I'm responsible no matter what and they just want to know what I'm feeling well!
2) Activities that help me feel better when I'm in this state:
- Meditation!!! Bear with me here, because for years I (especially as an ADHD brain) heard ""meditation"" and thought ""sitting on the floor and struggling to be quiet and hating every second of it because Brains Don't Just Turn Off(c)"" -- but having looked more into it and found apps that actually work for me, I can say this one is a lifesaver for a lot of reasons. Firstly, meditation is basically mind-control in the long run -- it's brain-training to teach your mind how to check itself before you go off the rails worrying about something or falling into impulsive habits, and it helps you to control strong feelings that otherwise might ruin a whole day! Secondly, it forces you to turn off most of the other stimulation going on at the time (which helps me to turn off all my background music/YouTube videos that often distract me), but also has active options so you can practice while you're physically moving around or doing chores so that it doesn't get boring. And thirdly... it feels nice? It might be the first time in a long time that I found a way to genuinely relax, so when it works, it really works to get me out of a funk!
- Exercise, in literally any amount. When I'm not feeling super well, it's hard to go do a whole exercise routine or anything strenuous, but even something as simple as getting out of bed and doing a few jumping jacks or a quick stretch can fundamentally shift my mood. When paired with the meditation, this is really helpful in allowing me to check in and ask why I'm not feeling good -- sometimes I can spin myself big narratives of ""oh life sucks and this isn't right and that deadline's coming up and aaaa"" and then realize that the physical sensations I'm interpreting as stress could just as easily be stiffness, restlessness, or dehydration... so resetting my brain with a glass of water and a bit of movement can actually go a long way in shifting my perspective!
- Water -- as noted above. One of my ADHD symptoms is a general un-awareness of my bodily needs/a general un-motivation to go deal with them when I'm engaged with something else, so even though I'm in a tiny dorm that has a sink right across the room, I'd end up getting dehydrated a lot just because I didn't want to get up. Solution? I keep a water jug and a glass on the bedside table so I only have to periodically fill the jug (which I can do when I'm already in the kitchen for something else). Might sound silly for someone who doesn't have the exact habits I do, but for me having the important things Literally Within Arm's Reach(c) does so much for keeping me on track with actually taking care of my body.
- Probably one of the biggest ones: reaching out for help when you need it, esp. in terms of mental health and doctor visits and all that dull stuff no one likes to do. Getting on meds and accessing support services on campus to accommodate my personal challenges changed my entire life here and I'm so grateful that the earlier version of me was willing to go to all of the effort required to set that up. That should probably be number one on the list, honestly.
- And finally... balancing human contact and obligations!!! My first year of grad school was hard because I 1) hadn't gotten the ADHD diagnosis yet and 2) was living on my own for the first time and didn't really know how to take care of myself and 3) obviously had tons and tons of homework -- and one of the biggest things that took a hit was my social life, which left me feeling really isolated and demotivated. Now I realize that it's really important to keep up with people regularly, even if you see yourself as an introvert (as I do!) -- regular check-ins with family and regular reasons to physically get out of the house (bonus points if you have a bike -- I never learned to ride one until this year just because it got me some bonus exercise and a reason to enjoy the fresh air!) are crucial.

Le intro: Hoi!!! Not much is up!!! The visit was really lovely, and I'm also enjoying the peace and quiet while I wait for the next one, haha. Currently switching up my medications again (fingers crossed this one works better!) and trying to get back into the swing of thesis-writing, which is going preeeetty slowly, but at least now I don't have to panic over it. Today's my cooking day, too -- I'm making lentil stew just now! How have you been?
A: Hey! That's good! Oh- I didn't know you can switch medications. I mean, a thesis sounds hard. Sounds nice! Hope it was good. I'm good, just had mint tea from my new tumbler :D
Q1: On setting a bad example: I meant that I did a lot of talking about self-care here, but wasn't really performing it myself until I finally decided to offer myself a break, which I worried would make you think self-care wasn't something to take seriously. It really, really is; it just took me a while to realize how overworked and stressed I'd become, and even longer to accept that that meant I had to prioritize my health over my workload. I'm feeling really good about my decisions on that front now, though! And I do my best to check in with myself where I can -- a lesson that needs to be constantly re-learned, but that's always worth re-learning. QwQ I'm glad you've been taking care of yourself and spending time with loved ones!!!
A: What made you worried? (I might have missed something) And that's good, you've been checking in with yourself!
Q2: On the Gather.town meet: Did they cancel it again??? I didn't get a notification this time about it, but I also don't think I got the invitation I was supposed to after signing up via the Google form they sent out, so maybe that's a bad sign? And hey, I'm not expecting anything, but it's sweet of you to suggest I'm worthy of rewards, thank you kindly! QwQ
A: Yeh, Juliet sent me an email saying that it may or may not cancelled lol. (there's like a 30/50 chance but idk) And no worries! 😊
Q3: On Alec Benjamin: I don't know much about the singer as a person, but I do know that I love his songs, so I'll take any comparison I can!!! Storytelling is my passion regardless of the medium, honestly -- books and songs and art projects are all just different ways of accomplishing the same goal of getting a message across to an audience!
A: True that!
Q4: On chocolate flavours: Rocky Mountain Chocolate was so good aaaaaaaa, there was a store for it in the mall on Vancouver Island and they just had e v e r y t h i n g, I used to love it in there!!!
A: Now I know what to check out when I potientially move down there!
Q5: What's my favourite dream destination? Honestly, I'm not sure I have one! Once upon a time I might have said London, but now that I've been to it and so many other places... I'd say my dream destination is my own house, somewhere I can be cozy and secure and not feel the need to run around all the time!
A: Lol, fair enough XD.
Q6: Why did Peter Parker fail his driver's test? Because he was a bad parallel Parker! This is silly and it made me smile.
A: Glad it did rofl!
Q7: Do I like milkshakes? I definitely used to, although they were the sort of thing that would make my stomach upset in the long run (usually because I'd get milkshakes at restaurants, and restaurants always bring out that second tin cup of extra milkshake and I'd never want to waste it but it would be way too much milkshake for me altogether!). I haven't had a vegan milkshake yet, so I can't say whether or not I still do, but if they're anything close to the real thing, then heck yeah!
A: Apparently vegan milkshakes exist online.. and they're homemade!
Q8: On ""Whether in conversation or in silence"": I just meant whether you wanted to talk about things or not, I was cool with it!
A: I mean, sure if you're willing to, that would be nice!
Q9: Do I have chronic pain myself? By my definition, not anymore; the only thing that I ever considered ""chronic pain"" for me at the time was before my hysterectomy (because I had incredibly painful periods and it would really impact my day-to-day life, probably in no small part due to the dysphoria that I didn't yet realize influenced me on that front) but once that was dealt with, I'm happy to say I've been pretty lucky on this front. My partner has it in spades, though -- so he does everything he can to help with my mental stuff and I do everything I can to help with his physical stuff and we get by. QwQ
A: Awh man, sorry to hear that. I wish you and him nothing but the best.
Q10: And also I looked up Battlestar Galactica, and it gave me Dune vibes for some reason lol This would make sense -- they've definitely got similar aesthetics!!!
A: Lol!
Q11: Do I like sushi? Yes!!!
A: Cool! Not a big fan of the store-bought kind though lol.
Q12: Do I like nachos? Not really -- too salty and I always thought nacho cheese tasted plastic-y!
A: Fair enough lol. There's this one gene where some people think that cilantro tasted like soap, but for some reason it doesn't really taste like soap.
Q13: Also forgot to add on QOTD: What are my favorite movie(s)? Good question! I'm still not sure I have a favourite -- I suppose something like Atomic Blonde, Silent Hill, maybe Interstellar because I watched that one over and over again... I don't have a definite favourite, honestly, and the answer will probably change over time, haha.
A: Cool! I'd probably say my favourite would be Love, Simon!
Q14: On food things: Yeah, it's possible that if I switched back to cow's milk now I would be queasy for a bit... and oi, I don't stuff myself with desserts often!!! I mean, I guess it's subjective, actually -- I think I have a relatively healthy diet, but mostly when my ADHD meds wear off I tend to get sugar cravings, and it's not so much that I intentionally eat a bunch of desserts so much as I tend to eat whatever I have on hand, and if that turns out to be a gluttonous amount of chocolate, then it might just be a night with an upset stomach, haha. All in all, environment is key -- if I surround myself with healthy things, that's what I tend to indulge in!
A: When you mean by ""a night"", do you mean like all night?
Q15: Have I worn leather jackets? I love leather jackets!!! I was a major fan of them in high school and early college, and even now (though here there's never good weather to wear one) I'd be happy to wear a leather jacket if I could get it secondhand or from a thrift store (so that I'm not contributing to the sort of factory farm stuff I generally try to avoid).
A: Cool! They're pretty dope.
Q16: And on a related note, Do I use cruelty-free products? Yes, everywhere I can!!! It's impossible to 100% avoid everything ever, but I really do my best to choose cruelty-free stuff wherever I can (and, in the case of things like leather jackets that I don't need but do like, to go the aforementioned secondhand/thrifting routes so that I don't contribute money back into cruel systems -- same with things I already owned, because the impact of purchasing them from the source has already been made, you know what I mean??).
A: Yeh, most makeup and shampoo companies are starting to take that into initative I think. And I think I know what you're talking about.
Q17: On Owl City, Alessia Cara, and Zendaya: I've only vaguely heard of the last one here, but I used to be a big fan of Owl City and I remain a big fan of Alessia Cara!!!
A: I used to listen to Owl City's music! Haven't listened to them in years XD. My friend used to be a fan of Alessia Cara! And as for Zendaya, I think you might have heard of her if you watched the Spiderman movies (Homecoming, Far From Home and No Way Home) or if you watched Euphoria lol.
Q18: Have I become a professor yet? Not even close!!! I still have to finish the MA degree (by the end of this year) and start and end my PhD (4-5 years) before I can call myself a ""doctor,"" and even then I'm not really a ""professor"" until I've got a job teaching after that!
A: Lol. Me and my sisters were talking about it the other day, and we were thinking that University would take forever and by the time you got your degree, we'd be old haha!
Q19: ""Even though the road is long ahead, it will all be worth it in the end."" Very true!!!
A: 👍🏽
Q20: On hair things: I suppose I used to change it seasonally because long hair was too warm -- but now I keep it short all year 'round and it suits me fine! As for perm stuff, nah, I think I just used one of those heat-up hair curlers? It never lasted long. And by ""like Rapunzel,"" do you mean super duper long??? I don't think my hair has ever been much longer than, say, the bottom of my shoulderblades, but I did have a friend in high school who let hers grow to the point that it almost touched the floor! Which looked really cool, but also really hard to manage, I'd think.
A: Yeh, I do mean super duper long lol. My mom also used to have long hair up to her calf I think when she was a teenager up to her 20s! My mom has a curling wand, but the curls never last long, probably like a day or two depending. Oh dang- that sounds like a lot of work!
Q21: On whistling: Yeah, that sounds about right! Occasionally someone would whistle along with me, but for the most part people thought it was an annoyance, unfortunately -- not that that stopped me!
A: Awh man, sorry people find it annoying. People probably love listening your whistling (much rather than the in-store radio), but they're all probably having a bad day. But really they're all clapping and going ""encore, encore!!!"" (idk if you know what that means lol) Do you still have the grocery job or no?
Q22: And on that note, Is whistling fun? Yes, I think so, but I think I also just do it out of habit because it's some kind of noise to make, you know? If I'm alone in a quiet room, I'm the type to talk to myself out loud to fill the silence, so whistling is just another way of doing that!
A: I guess it is! Whistling is pretty amazing (unless it's off-key in this case) I mean, you do you! Also there's a whistler named Molly Lewis, she does it pretty well!
Bonus question: I'll keep my eyes peeled for any info about the Gather.town thing -- we'll see how everything goes! QwQ
A: Lol, okay!
Qs-OTD: Would you rather surf or go mountain-climbing? Do you like summer or winter? Have you ever whistled inwards or just outwards? And do you hum as well?
Quote of the day: ""-No matter the old the skills, they can help on some parts of your journey, but the rest you have to learn new skills.""
Joke of the day: What did the pancake say to the egg? ""You're looking egg-cellent!""",mentee

Hello again aaaaaaaa -- I emerge from a cacophony of responsibilities to finally announce that I've come out the other end (though perhaps not necessarily in the way that I intended to do so). Long story short, I burned myself out trying to finish that big paper and then got smacked with a conference that I had a great time at but was not 100% prepared for, and then my family came and visited and what little self-management routine I had left is now all over the place. But good news -- I got my entry into my PhD deferred until January, which means I have a few extra months (expensive though they are to keep paying the tuition out of pocket, oops) to write this paper and get my meds back in order and Be a Human Person. Which means I also have time to actually catch up on the many many many emails and messages and friends and obligations and cool opportunities and etc that I've been letting stack up... and I actually have my head on straight enough to come say hi! So hi!!! QwQ
I'm glad to hear that you've been spending some time with your folks and friends over the summer months -- it's really important to make time for yourself to keep those connections going. I'm sorry about all the things going skewy, though; the caffeine crashes are very relatable to me right now, and though I won't pry if it's private to you, which it seems to be, I hope that whatever else is making you feel sick has either hopefully improved or that you're managing it as best you can. I don't have as much experience with chronic physical difficulties as some, but seeing my partner deal with chronic pain has taught me that sometimes looking for a permanent solution to sickness might be missing the point -- to just be as healthy as happy as possible within your circumstances. Whatever that means to you right now, I hope you've achieved it. QwQ And that goes for mental and spiritual healths as much as physical, for the record -- I'm glad that you're not sticking around in toxic dance halls or for classes you didn't enjoy, and I fear that I may have been setting a bit of a bad example as a mentor up until this point by exhausting myself with my own work and repeatedly running up against that metaphorical wall... because honestly, sometimes you just need to take a break and properly rest, or to attend to the things that need attending to the most. So I hope that you've gotten the chance to do that, that's all. Take care of yourself out there, friend, it's the best thing you'll ever do.
A: Yo, what's up? Hope the visit was good! Oh, glad to hear the thing went good! What do you mean that you were setting a bad example? Thanks, you take care of yourself too. And also I saw that question closer to the end and just wanted to add a bit. I am fine now, it was from before. But thank you for checking in. Hope you are checking in with yourself too. But yeh, I did stuff from kayaking and having barbeques with family and family-friends to working out with my friends.
And now the Q&As that need catching up on!!!
Q1: What blue frizz? My bad, I didn't include the hyphens, but I meant ""out-of-the-blue"" frizz as in frizzy hair that was unexpected/outside of my routine -- usually because of weird weather things, in my case!
A: No worries, I think I read it too fast so maybe that's why lol. I thought you had blue hair!
Q2: On staying out of the rain: Oh dear, I imagine that 24/7 rain does make it hard to avoid being out in the damp, haha. I suppose that would give you a very different perspective on it than where I'm at in my weather-based habits. QwQ But maybe that means that you get to enjoy rainy days more, in some ways? At least insofar as folks tend to get used to the weather around them so it might not feel like as much of an out-of-the-blue aggravation as it used to for me? (Actually, living in Saskatchewan has given me a strong appreciation for any weather I can walk outside in without dying -- I used to hate rain when I lived in BC and it was just an occasional annoyance, but around here it's like ""oh joy!!! something that isn't snow!!! i'll take it!!!""
A: Eh. The weather is improving a bit lol. But honestly, I feel like climate change is to blame at most.
Q3: On lactose intolerance: Oh! I'm actually not intolerant or allergic to much of anything, save for sugar in some cases (and even that's more of a sensitivity, because it's just me being cautious about being hypoglycaemic and not wanting to push that into potential diabetes down the line, but it doesn't make me violently ill to have or anything unless I really stuff myself with desserts to the point most folks would prolly get sick regardless). So when I imagine feeling gross from a bunch of ice cream, it's more about all the sugar than the cream part! Although now that I've done the whole vegan thing a while, I suppose real milk might do weird things to my stomach if I tried it again -- I'm not sure how that works???
A: Oh yeah, definitely not! So you just stuff yourself full of desserts? I guess if you're used to the milk you're currently using, your body probably won't be used to it.
Q4: On acting in Riverdale: I definitely agree on this front, haha -- I think I would maybe consider being in Riverdale for the memes, but it would be a very difficult production to actually take seriously???
A: I guess yeah. I dunno, honestly. If you're used to horror, I mean I can't really change people's minds. I guess it's their own opinion.
Q5: On all things hair-related: I definitely feel you on haircuts in the summer -- back when I had long hair and we'd have hot days, it was very warm and annoying to keep up with, at least for me (though I'm also the type to wear extra layers of clothes because I just like to have a jacket around, so wearing a hat/hood/etc in the sun probably didn't help with that any, lol). And in terms of modifications, I have never coloured my hair with proper dye before, though I think I did some temporary streaks once when I was a kid with that stuff that's supposed to wash out in like three days -- and in terms of hair curling, I have had that done in the past, but mostly for big fancy events where my mum encouraged me to ""dress up"" (think graduations, prom, etc) and while I liked it sometimes, I usually found that either the curls got in the way/distracted me when I was trying to go about my life, or that when they did look good, they never lasted long enough versus the amount of work it took to get my hair curled in the first place. Same thing with straightening it, too (which took forever and always got in my eyes) and makeup more generally (which took forever and always made my face itchy and uncomfortable and distracting). All in all, I probably would have enjoyed experimenting with that kind of thing more in my youth if not for my general (possibly ADHD-boredom-related?) avoidance of ""standing still at a mirror doing X beautification task for thirty minutes while thinking about doing anything else"" and/or the matter of ""changing something in my life/routine/sensory environment, however small, is inevitably going to pull me out of whatever else I'm focusing on for the rest of the day."" My mum thought I was no fun in this department, haha!
A: So basically your hair changes during the season? And when you said you curled your hair, did you perm it? And also, I guess your hair has been like Rapunzel's?
Q6: On your Quote of the Day: I absolutely agree with this, and I'm glad to say that doing things because they matter to you feels a lot healthier and happier than doing it for others. Admittedly, it was hard for me to give up on my (terribly unrealistic) self-expectations of success in school this year because I cared about the approval of a lot of folks way beyond my own network... and now that I've reeled that back in, it's seriously a relief to just ask what I want to do with my life -- and to realize that all the closest people I thought would be upset because I 'failed' my initial goal were just glad that I was taking care of myself??? Like, we really don't realize how much pressure we put on ourselves until we let it go, but dang, I'm glad to have gotten that deferral. QwQ
A: Yep 👍
Q7: On the previous Zoom meet: I'm sorry to hear that they cancelled the last Gather.town thing, that sucks! If it helps any, my email just pinged me about an end-of-the-year meet-up that they're theoretically hosting on June 26th, so at least there's another chance to be social if we want it? Now that my schedule has more breathing room, I should be able to make this one!!! I think it's 5-7PM your time? No worries if you're busy that day and/or if you wanted to go but hang out with other mentees or some such, but I'll be there in any case! :D
A: I will be there. I am willing to hangout with you. :)
Q8: Why did I choose to do the MA Thesis? Overall, or instead of an easier project option? If you mean the second thing, I chose the thesis over the project version of the MA because I was told that it would be easier in the long run to get used to writing gigantic papers (so that the jump to writing a 200-400page PhD dissertation isn't quite so much of a leap!), but if you just mean why I decided to do this in general... a lot of reasons, I think! Because I enjoy English, and because it's something I'm good at, because I think I could do well in a job with it, because I think it's an area in which I have a lot of potential to make a lot of change in the world (either by writing stories that change peoples' perspectives on issues or by teaching them directly as a prof!), because I wanted to do my PhD and this is a prerequisite, because I think it's my path in life... I don't have just one answer, to be honest, just a lot of factors. And admittedly, it can be a really stressful path to be in sometimes (I really freaked myself out with the deadlines up until now, I've had to live far away from family for a couple years, it can be really mentally taxing work), but I think that the benefits / other stressful things I won't have to do in the future make up for it (I'm more stressed out by physical jobs than teaching, I'm more likely to have a secure paycheque/benefits, this degree has a lot of transferable skills if I find out that I don't like this job but don't wanna start from square one, etc etc). All in all, I'm doing this particular thing because I hope it will make me happy -- not the degree itself, per se, but the skills that I'm hoping to gain along the way, and the prestige/opportunities that come with it that could get me more skills down the line.
With that said, I don't think that it's the right path for everyone, or even for people like me who theoretically want to do it in certain cases -- it really depends on what your goals are and what you hope to get out of it. I came to terms with the fact that I wanted to do my PhD, but that I wanted a break first more -- and while I'm lucky to have gotten it in this case, I have friends who have had to drop out or whose careers have been halted by non-school things getting in the way of the One Singular Path that academia sort of funnels people into when it tells them that there's one particular way to learn: the neurotypical/colonial/wealthy/privileged/etc way of showing up all the time every time, having no conflicting life duties, doing all of your homework, reading all of the books, never being late or making mistakes, blablablah. And that's just... not realistic. So I think it's the right path for people who are in circumstances that are beneficial to working with and/or around those systems -- for example, my situation of being late on my thesis but still having the money to be able to dump a few thousand dollars down the drain to extend my tuition instead of burning myself out writing everything at once by the end of the summer for free. But I think it's also important to recognize that education is as flawed an institution as anything else, and that sometimes it's not the right place for people -- whether that's altogether, because the system isn't inclusive enough for them or just won't give them what they want at the end, or just temporary, like ""I need to take a gap year or two to get my mental health/finances/family situation/etc together and maybe after that I'll see if university is a feasible and correct path for me.""
Long story short, I chose to do it because it worked out for me and I usually enjoy it -- and the times that I don't, I've been lucky and/or privileged enough (generally both) to make it work anyway. And even when I'm at my most frustrated with it all, I don't see myself doing anything else, so I feel like it's gotta be right at least for now, you know?
A: What a long list.. but it's okay anyways lol. You do you :)
Q9: On learning Greek: That's really cool!!! I never got into the language part, but I definitely remember being interested in Greek/Roman mythology when I was younger... that and Egyptian, after I got inspired by a poster project in like Grade 6. I think that was when I was still trying to figure out that I was interested in storytelling in general, but I didn't have the words to explain that yet, so I would default to getting really obsessed with particular types of stories? Good times.
A: Yeh, mostly Greek gods and all. It sounds in a way you could be Alec Benjamin (just kidding! it's probably because I've been listening to his music more recently lol) but also I keep reading that you like to do storytelling as well so I've been comparing, but no competition there, cool!
Q10: What's my favourite chocolate flavour?: Prior to veganism, white chocolate 100%!!! Used to be my absolute FAV when Easter came around (particularly in my youth when I could chow down on a whole Easter bunny and somehow not end up sick the next day, which is no longer a skill I possess, rofl). But because I haven't been able to find any I can still have, now I guess it's fake milk chocolate??? The best brand I've found so far is Camino vegan semi-sweet chips!
A: AYE, fake milk chocolate? That's kinda weird lol. My favorite brand is... *drum roll* ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE!!!!! (but seriously, there are so many good brands out there lol)
Q11: On emojis: Sorry I spooked you!!! Definitely wasn't intended at all and I'll avoid that one in the future, my b!!! QwQ
A: It's fine. You can continue to use it if you wish to.
Q12: Why is whistling much easier for me? I scrolled back to check but I can't remember what it was easier than! I'm going to assume either dancing (because I'm not coordinated) or singing (because it takes a lot more breath to make the same amount of noise and my lungs run out of air fast, haha).
A: Oof, fair point lol.
Q14: On the previous Zoom meet: I'm sorry to hear that they cancelled the last Gather.town thing, that sucks! If it helps any, my email just pinged me about an end-of-the-year meet-up that they're theoretically hosting on June 26th, so at least there's another chance to be social if we want it? Now that my schedule has more breathing room, I should be able to make this one!!! I think it's 5-7PM your time? No worries if you're busy that day and/or if you wanted to go but hang out with other mentees or some such, but I'll be there in any case! :D
Phew... another long catch-up message completed! I'm glad to finally have a minute of breathing room with everything to get back to you -- and I'm sorry that my life things have gotten in the way so much, I know that we're both human beings out living real lives with deadlines and obligations and friends and family and Things(c) but I do wish I could be here more, and now that I've gotten a bit of a break over here, I'm going to do my best to check in more often. I'm supposed to be working on my mental health with this spare time as I carry on with the thesis-ing, after all... and a big part of that for me is not letting all of the social check-ins stack up for centuries!
All in all, it's good to hear from you, I hope you're well and that you're having the best spring/summer you can, and I look forward to hearing from you whenever you find your own moment of peace between the waves of daily life! Don't let the rain wash you away over there! :P
A: Yeh, I got the email too lol. So far it hasn't rained a lot as it did before lol. And also there's this thing where mentors get awards, so maybe you might get some awards!!! :D Can't wait to hear what tunes you do!!! (whistling-wise)
Q14: On Christmas songs and whistling with customers: Very much true!!! I believe I did mention complaining about my radio at work -- but even then, I gotta admit in retrospect that the silly moments where people really really enjoyed those carols (even whistling along to them themselves!) probably make up for my humbuggish nature in having to hear them all the time. Ups and downs!
A: Oh, I was thinking about the coworkers and how they said that they hated it and that you were the only one who enjoyed whistling whether you were in the workplace, walking downtown, or just in your own house?
QOTD: What's your favorite drink in the summer? What's your favourite dream destination?

,,55268,2022-06-10 13:45:00," 
Hello again aaaaaaaa -- I emerge from a cacophony of responsibilities to finally announce that I've come out the other end (though perhaps not necessarily in the way that I intended to do so). Long story short, I burned myself out trying to finish that big paper and then got smacked with a conference that I had a great time at but was not 100% prepared for, and then my family came and visited and what little self-management routine I had left is now all over the place. But good news -- I got my entry into my PhD deferred until January, which means I have a few extra months (expensive though they are to keep paying the tuition out of pocket, oops) to write this paper and get my meds back in order and Be a Human Person. Which means I also have time to actually catch up on the many many many emails and messages and friends and obligations and cool opportunities and etc that I've been letting stack up... and I actually have my head on straight enough to come say hi! So hi!!! QwQ
I'm glad to hear that you've been spending some time with your folks and friends over the summer months -- it's really important to make time for yourself to keep those connections going. I'm sorry about all the things going skewy, though; the caffeine crashes are very relatable to me right now, and though I won't pry if it's private to you, which it seems to be, I hope that whatever else is making you feel sick has either hopefully improved or that you're managing it as best you can. I don't have as much experience with chronic physical difficulties as some, but seeing my partner deal with chronic pain has taught me that sometimes looking for a permanent solution to sickness might be missing the point -- to just be as healthy as happy as possible within your circumstances. Whatever that means to you right now, I hope you've achieved it. QwQ And that goes for mental and spiritual healths as much as physical, for the record -- I'm glad that you're not sticking around in toxic dance halls or for classes you didn't enjoy, and I fear that I may have been setting a bit of a bad example as a mentor up until this point by exhausting myself with my own work and repeatedly running up against that metaphorical wall... because honestly, sometimes you just need to take a break and properly rest, or to attend to the things that need attending to the most. So I hope that you've gotten the chance to do that, that's all. Take care of yourself out there, friend, it's the best thing you'll ever do.
And now the Q&As that need catching up on!!!
What blue frizz? My bad, I didn't include the hyphens, but I meant ""out-of-the-blue"" frizz as in frizzy hair that was unexpected/outside of my routine -- usually because of weird weather things, in my case!
On Christmas songs and whistling with customers: Very much true!!! I believe I did mention complaining about my radio at work -- but even then, I gotta admit in retrospect that the silly moments where people really really enjoyed those carols (even whistling along to them themselves!) probably make up for my humbuggish nature in having to hear them all the time. Ups and downs!
On staying out of the rain: Oh dear, I imagine that 24/7 rain does make it hard to avoid being out in the damp, haha. I suppose that would give you a very different perspective on it than where I'm at in my weather-based habits. QwQ But maybe that means that you get to enjoy rainy days more, in some ways? At least insofar as folks tend to get used to the weather around them so it might not feel like as much of an out-of-the-blue aggravation as it used to for me? (Actually, living in Saskatchewan has given me a strong appreciation for any weather I can walk outside in without dying -- I used to hate rain when I lived in BC and it was just an occasional annoyance, but around here it's like ""oh joy!!! something that isn't snow!!! i'll take it!!!"")
On lactose intolerance: Oh! I'm actually not intolerant or allergic to much of anything, save for sugar in some cases (and even that's more of a sensitivity, because it's just me being cautious about being hypoglycaemic and not wanting to push that into potential diabetes down the line, but it doesn't make me violently ill to have or anything unless I really stuff myself with desserts to the point most folks would prolly get sick regardless). So when I imagine feeling gross from a bunch of ice cream, it's more about all the sugar than the cream part! Although now that I've done the whole vegan thing a while, I suppose real milk might do weird things to my stomach if I tried it again -- I'm not sure how that works???
On emojis: Sorry I spooked you!!! Definitely wasn't intended at all and I'll avoid that one in the future, my b!!! QwQ
On all things hair-related: I definitely feel you on haircuts in the summer -- back when I had long hair and we'd have hot days, it was very warm and annoying to keep up with, at least for me (though I'm also the type to wear extra layers of clothes because I just like to have a jacket around, so wearing a hat/hood/etc in the sun probably didn't help with that any, lol). And in terms of modifications, I have never coloured my hair with proper dye before, though I think I did some temporary streaks once when I was a kid with that stuff that's supposed to wash out in like three days -- and in terms of hair curling, I have had that done in the past, but mostly for big fancy events where my mum encouraged me to ""dress up"" (think graduations, prom, etc) and while I liked it sometimes, I usually found that either the curls got in the way/distracted me when I was trying to go about my life, or that when they did look good, they never lasted long enough versus the amount of work it took to get my hair curled in the first place. Same thing with straightening it, too (which took forever and always got in my eyes) and makeup more generally (which took forever and always made my face itchy and uncomfortable and distracting). All in all, I probably would have enjoyed experimenting with that kind of thing more in my youth if not for my general (possibly ADHD-boredom-related?) avoidance of ""standing still at a mirror doing X beautification task for thirty minutes while thinking about doing anything else"" and/or the matter of ""changing something in my life/routine/sensory environment, however small, is inevitably going to pull me out of whatever else I'm focusing on for the rest of the day."" My mum thought I was no fun in this department, haha!
On acting in Riverdale: I definitely agree on this front, haha -- I think I would maybe consider being in Riverdale for the memes, but it would be a very difficult production to actually take seriously???
On learning Greek: That's really cool!!! I never got into the language part, but I definitely remember being interested in Greek/Roman mythology when I was younger... that and Egyptian, after I got inspired by a poster project in like Grade 6. I think that was when I was still trying to figure out that I was interested in storytelling in general, but I didn't have the words to explain that yet, so I would default to getting really obsessed with particular types of stories? Good times.
On the Lotus Tower: That sounds amazing!!! Having been to the top of the Eiffel Tower, I can imagine the wind at the top of the Lotus Tower would be just as crazy an experience (when you're that high up, it can practically knock you off your feet!). Thanks for sharing!!!
On your Quote of the Day: I absolutely agree with this, and I'm glad to say that doing things because they matter to you feels a lot healthier and happier than doing it for others. Admittedly, it was hard for me to give up on my (terribly unrealistic) self-expectations of success in school this year because I cared about the approval of a lot of folks way beyond my own network... and now that I've reeled that back in, it's seriously a relief to just ask what I want to do with my life -- and to realize that all the closest people I thought would be upset because I 'failed' my initial goal were just glad that I was taking care of myself??? Like, we really don't realize how much pressure we put on ourselves until we let it go, but dang, I'm glad to have gotten that deferral. QwQ
What's my favourite chocolate flavour?: Prior to veganism, white chocolate 100%!!! Used to be my absolute FAV when Easter came around (particularly in my youth when I could chow down on a whole Easter bunny and somehow not end up sick the next day, which is no longer a skill I possess, rofl).

Why did I choose to do the MA Thesis? Overall, or instead of an easier project option? If you mean the second thing, I chose the thesis over the project version of the MA because I was told that it would be easier in the long run to get used to writing gigantic papers (so that the jump to writing a 200-400page PhD dissertation isn't quite so much of a leap!), but if you just mean why I decided to do this in general... a lot of reasons, I think! Because I enjoy English, and because it's something I'm good at, because I think I could do well in a job with it, because I think it's an area in which I have a lot of potential to make a lot of change in the world (either by writing stories that change peoples' perspectives on issues or by teaching them directly as a prof!), because I wanted to do my PhD and this is a prerequisite, because I think it's my path in life...

Do I like babies? You don't have to acknowledge that I said this next bit at all, you can totally 100% just leave this whole text chunk off your list of things to respond to and it'll be I never spoke and we won't ever mention it again, and if that's what you're comfy with then we're totally good -- but if I'm potentially putting clues together right re: this question plus you being suddenly ill and not wanting to get into it... well, then I won't get into it, because I respect your privacy, but I just want you to know that I hope you're OK. No matter what's going on in your existence right now, I'm rooting for you and your best interests, and I hope that you're safe and well and doing what's best for you in this moment. And I just wanted you to know that, even though I'm a sporadic presence on this platform a lot of the time when my life gets overwhelming, I'm here for you if you need me for something serious too -- whether in conversation or in silence -- and all that matters to me as a fellow random human on the Internet is that you're taking care of yourself at the end of the day. (I will let you know -- just in case it ever would change what you do or don't share with me directly, which is 100% your choice in any case -- that if I were to hear that either you or someone else is/was in danger of harm, either self-harm or from others, I'm obligated as a mentor to let the folks who run the platform know about it. I don't know what steps they take beyond that point, but that's a resource if you ever need it, too.)
You have no obligation to acknowledge any part of the above and I won't bring it up again unless you do. Carrying on!

Q: I'm sad to admit it, but I'm not gonna be able to make it to the video meet this time -- the first half of it is over a trip I have to take to Toronto to present at a conference I'm not even close to ready for, so I know I'm gonna be crunching more homework until the moment I get back home, and then once I get home my family has decided to plunk down in my house and visit while I'm still kinda sorta supposed to be doing school things (because they were originally supposed to be visiting, like, this week, but now I'm so behind on last month's stuff that they didn't wanna add to it, but they didn't ask when would be convenient and so landed in the middle of a conference -- I love them to death, but it makes me wonder, rofl). In any case, I'm sorry I won't be there to say hi, but if you're still going to pop in and try to make friends with other mentors/students/etc, I hope you have ALL of the fun at it, because it's a really cool chance to meet really cool people!!! You'll have to let me know how it goes (and what new weird minigames they add to the Gather.town platform haha) if you do!

Q: Hoooooooly heck I am behind-- QwQ Hey!!! Sorry I'm late -- not trying to be distant on purpose over here, I swear, I'm just running a real risk of Actually Not Finishing This Thesis On Time and I am very behind and that is my entire reality 100% of the day and I can't play games or ride a bike outside or order groceries without getting distracted and somehow losing days of paper time I'm supposed to not need in the first place because the whole thing was due three days ago and I'm about fifty pages short and????? I am e x h a u s t e d if I'm being honest, and as such I am chronically behind on all of my messages. I know that's not fair to you, and I'm sorry that I haven't found the time and energy to pop in this month, and I just hope that you're doing well in your whole general existence. I hope things are good. That's all. QwQ
A: That's fine, it must be stressful. The closest I had done was an essay (forgot what it was about and when.) and also I've been hanging out with friends and also I am probably gonna join one of my friends on Monday (the 8th) for one of her workouts. And also on thw 2nd, I went to the lake with my family and family-friends and had burgers and hot dogs! And also I've been having caffeine crashes recently as well so I am not really as alert anymore as I used to be, but otherwise it's going alright I guess.
Q1: My partner was here for a week to help, and it did help me focus while he was around, but now that he's back home again it's harder to do it on my own -- although today went well, kinda sorta, hopefully???
A: Oh that's cool, good for you. (Don't really have much to say about this at the moment, apologies, but that's good you tried to complete some of it!).
Q2: The wobbly legs after that first bike ride turned out to be a bit of an iron deficiency (which I suppose explains some of my concentration issues lately, whoops!) but I've tackled that and I'm starting to feel much better and more human. QwQ
A: I guess it happens to the best of us. I've been off recently, but it's whatever though lol. (can't do much about it at this point.)
Q3: Your dance stuff sounds really cool, and even though you don't sound like you'll head back to that specific place I hope you find moments at home to keep the skills alive!
A: Meh. Honestly, I'm kinda glad I left. The dance studio I used to dance at was somewhat toxic anyway. So besides me, some other people left as well. We probably wouldn't be able to handle it anyways I think.
Q4: I feel you on dropping French, it's a toughie, but Hawai'ian sounds really cool, so I'm very proud of you for having the discipline to pick it up on your own!!!
A: Thanks :)
Q5: I wasn't particular about what shampoo I used based on particular hair moments when I was younger, honestly, I kinda just used whatever was bought for me -- it worked really well for out of the blue frizz though!
A: Oh yeah. What blue frizz?
Q6: It is very cool that your friend still cross stitches!!! Tell them I didn't mean to ask for anything made for me, but I appreciate the offer, haha!
A: I know, I told her already lol.
Q7: Teleporting is a good choice!!!
A: Cool
Q8: Your quote is very inspirational -- it's important in life to focus on the process, not the product!
A: I agree 👍
Q9: I genuinely don't know what the nicest thing I've said or done is, actually... I try to be nice to as many people as possible, but I think it's less important how you do it than that you do it continuously and make niceness a habit, honestly! What's important is to just spread the good vibes and trust that they'll carry it forward!
A: That's cool, I agree!
Q10: Least favourite song would have to be whatever played the most at the grocery store I worked at back in the day -- something long and repetitive and popular and slightly old... I'm gonna say probably ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, that feels like one of those songs that would play like six times a day at that place, haha!
A: Lol, I think you mentioned that you kept hearing the same Christmas songs before (dunno anymore) and also you mentioned whistling with the customer before lol.
Q11: On rainy days I like to stay in and cozy up with my heating pad and read! (Or do homework, these days, but hey, the general point is to not be in the rain!)
A: Oof, well in my [current] hometown, it pretty much rains 24/7 unless it's summer, hah. Better than getting sick lol.
Q12: Quotes are hard, there are so many good ones... I think one of the most impactful ones was actually a rhetorical question that I once heard it was good to ask when things got tough, which was ""How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?"" because no matter how difficult things are, if you can find a single positive in it, it can help a lot to shift your mindset into things being less scary!
A: I 100% agree
Q13: I have certainly tried cheesecake (and I've even tried vegan cheesecake, which was equally tasty surprisingly!) -- my grandma used to make homemade cheesecakes for her catering jobs back in the day, so I've got a bit of sentimentality for it (even if I always ate way too much and got sick after, haha).
A: Cool! Sounds good I guess.
Q14: I would definitely rather have pizza for breakfast/lunch/dinner -- ice cream is good in small doses, but anything more than that gets my stomach upset pretty quickly, whereas at least pizza could sort of be customized into different meals (including dessert, if pizza = ""anything sloshed together onto a pizza crust"" in this hypothetical!).
A: I wasn't sure I understood but I think I misunderstood when I read this -- I thought you were lactose intolerant (I dunno if you are or not)
Q15: o3o is a silly emoji I remember typing on the Internet back in the day, didn't mean to be confusing!
A: Oh okay, I didn't know until I looked it up -- it kinda scared me for a moment and sent me into fight or flight mode mentally but I'm okay I guess.
Q16: I genuinely have no recollection of what we were talking about mentioning, sorry. QwQ And happy belated Easter!! I don't usually celebrate, but my partner was out visiting and I got a random invitation to a dinner party with some fellow grad students, so we took one single night off from the paper for that and it was actually really lovely (if a little weird because we didn't know anyone that well, lol).
A: Meh, it's fine I guess. Thanks I guess?? And cool, good to take a break from your paper for a day!
Q17: I would definitely rather have short hair!!! I've had both, and short is much much easier to take care of (and gets people to use my pronouns more consistently tbh).
A: Yeah, I agree. I usually get haircuts in the summer at most lol.
Q18: Oi!!! I didn't expect that you'd actually listen to the song! Hope you enjoyed it! QwQ
A: It was good!
Q19: Oh boy, there are many reasons I went vegan, but to make a long story short so it doesn't turn into a Whole Paragraph, the biggest reason was the animal ethics stuff, which I hadn't really learned much about until recently -- and once I did, I just didn't feel right buying animal products and I knew that I could either respond to that by changing my lifestyle or feel bad as I continued to ignore it, and it was frankly easier to change my diet than to keep thinking about it because my brain has really been ruminating on ethics a lot this year??? Idk, that could be me being weird. And after that, I'd say because I'm personally big worried about the environment but I also don't feel like there's much I can personally do to help with it from my current position in life, but one of the biggest carbon sources that we contribute to individually is participation in animal agriculture, so it felt good to be able to feel like I'm doing good things there as well (although I would've done it either way, it's just a nice bonus). Anyway, long story short, outside of not realizing I wasn't getting enough iron and having to learn some new recipes, it seems to be going well -- no complaints!!!
A: Oh yeah. Congrats, you do you! :D
Q19: You actually had me on that April Fools prank for a minute, not gonna lie --
A: OH -- I didn't even realize that. Eh honestly, I don't think I'd really want to guest-star (for that matter) on Riverdale, it's not exactly my type of show I don't think.
Q20: Ooh! Why Greek???
A: Uhhh, good question. I think I was just bored during lockdown a couple years back, so I just started learning it lol. And also I learned about some of it from Greek mythology.
Q21: Tell me more about the Lotus Tower!
A: It's pretty tall around 350m (1,150 ft tall!). It's also a couple feet taller than the Eiffel Tower apparently! It has 8 elevators and 13 floors. And the Lotus Tower kind of looks like the Lotus flower (hence the name lol), I'll find more info when I have the time!
Aaaaand I think that's everything caught up! Finally!!! QwQ
I'm sad to admit it, but I'm not gonna be able to make it to the video meet this time -- the first half of it is over a trip I have to take to Toronto to present at a conference I'm not even close to ready for, so I know I'm gonna be crunching more homework until the moment I get back home, and then once I get home my family has decided to plunk down in my house and visit while I'm still kinda sorta supposed to be doing school things (because they were originally supposed to be visiting, like, this week, but now I'm so behind on last month's stuff that they didn't wanna add to it, but they didn't ask when would be convenient and so landed in the middle of a conference -- I love them to death, but it makes me wonder, rofl). In any case, I'm sorry I won't be there to say hi, but if you're still going to pop in and try to make friends with other mentors/students/etc, I hope you have ALL of the fun at it, because it's a really cool chance to meet really cool people!!! You'll have to let me know how it goes (and what new weird minigames they add to the Gather.town platform haha) if you do!
A: That's fine! You do what you have to do! Good luck and take care until we talk again next time!!! And also I gotta keep my answers short since I have to go eat dinner now lol. Peace out!

Hoooooooly heck I am behind-- QwQ Hey!!! Sorry I'm late -- not trying to be distant on purpose over here, I swear, I'm just running a real risk of Actually Not Finishing This Thesis On Time and I am very behind and that is my entire reality 100% of the day and I can't play games or ride a bike outside or order groceries without getting distracted and somehow losing days of paper time I'm supposed to not need in the first place because the whole thing was due three days ago and I'm about fifty pages short and????? I am e x h a u s t e d if I'm being honest, and as such I am chronically behind on all of my messages. I know that's not fair to you, and I'm sorry that I haven't found the time and energy to pop in this month, and I just hope that you're doing well in your whole general existence. I hope things are good. That's all. QwQ
In short form to the many many many questions we've got logged here:
My partner was here for a week to help, and it did help me focus while he was around, but now that he's back home again it's harder to do it on my own -- although today went well, kinda sorta, hopefully???
The wobbly legs after that first bike ride turned out to be a bit of an iron deficiency (which I suppose explains some of my concentration issues lately, whoops!) but I've tackled that and I'm starting to feel much better and more human. QwQ
Your dance stuff sounds really cool, and even though you don't sound like you'll head back to that specific place I hope you find moments at home to keep the skills alive!
I feel you on dropping French, it's a toughie, but Hawai'ian sounds really cool, so I'm very proud of you for having the discipline to pick it up on your own!!!
I wasn't particular about what shampoo I used based on particular hair moments when I was younger, honestly, I kinda just used whatever was bought for me -- it worked really well for out of the blue frizz though!
It is very cool that your friend still cross stitches!!! Tell them I didn't mean to ask for anything made for me, but I appreciate the offer, haha!
Teleporting is a good choice!!!
Your quote is very inspirational -- it's important in life to focus on the process, not the product!
I genuinely don't know what the nicest thing I've said or done is, actually... I try to be nice to as many people as possible, but I think it's less important how you do it than that you do it continuously and make niceness a habit, honestly! What's important is to just spread the good vibes and trust that they'll carry it forward!
Least favourite song would have to be whatever played the most at the grocery store I worked at back in the day -- something long and repetitive and popular and slightly old... I'm gonna say probably ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, that feels like one of those songs that would play like six times a day at that place, haha!
On rainy days I like to stay in and cozy up with my heating pad and read! (Or do homework, these days, but hey, the general point is to not be in the rain!)
Quotes are hard, there are so many good ones... I think one of the most impactful ones was actually a rhetorical question that I once heard it was good to ask when things got tough, which was ""How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?"" because no matter how difficult things are, if you can find a single positive in it, it can help a lot to shift your mindset into things being less scary!

Q1: On Minecrafting and mental health: Never a need to apologize for being late, I never answer anything expediently! QwQ Yeah, it's a fun game, but I'm still running into some issues with overplaying games over here... though thankfully my partner is out from the States this week to help me focus on my thesis-ing and get me back on track and it's been really healthy for me, which is why I'm finally getting around to my messages! Brain stuff has been really tough lately, honestly, but with good supports and resilience I'm hoping to pull out of the funk. I sense from your reply that you may be in a similar spot, so I hope you've got similar supports?
A: Oh okay. Good to know. I've been a bit of Mario games recently too lol. Oh so he left the States to visit and help? That's cool, good for you! Yeeeee, don't worry about being late! I was out of town a couple days ago (April 2, I think, but it was just a daytrip.) so I'm still trying to get energized lol. And also I guess I got your old font back it seems like (If I remember correctly, I think you said you hated Times New Romans.)
Q2: On biking: The snow is not yet gone, but they've finally got around to ploughing the sidewalks and bike paths, so for the most part I can finally get around! And as for the jelly legs, I'm just veeeeery unfit these days (have been since my surgery a couple years back!), so after that first bike ride I was all wobbly and unstable -- like jelly!
A: Oh yeah. That's good, better than having cold feet I guess lol. Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Hope you're okay <3
Q3: On Wednesday: I meant that I would watch it again if she asked me to, but that I doubt the writing/politics would change any from one season to the next -- which is fine, if I'm watching it to spend time with someone else, but isn't something I would seek out on my own! Agree that the classics are way better, though. :P
A: Well honestly, I can only say that people may have different opinions (yours is good), and yeah, classics are good thanks!
Q4: On trans care and community support: Both of these points are very very fair, and I wish you nothing but the best of luck in each case!!! QwQ
A: Thank you! :D
Q5: On book-binding and dancing: I've never thought about searching the dollar store for that stuff -- it might be worth a look next time I go out! And hey, that's really cool -- I was never good at dancing, but I've known folks who have really gotten into it! Did you dance as part of a group or just on your own? And is it possible to keep brushing up on your skills in your house until programs are running again? It's a darn shame that COVID has knocked so many of us out of the activities that we love, but it doesn't mean that we have to give them up 100%!
A: Oh, great! Mind you, I'm not really an expert but I guess it's probably your best bet if you're towards the cheap side I guess? Good question. It was groups when I had classes at the dance studio. I took ballet, jazz and a bit of musical theatre. Honestly, I forgot about it during lockdown but might not plan to return back as I am moving next year anyways. I guess, yeah.
Q6: On languages: It's funny that you dropped French but picked up Spanish -- I always found them really really similar in a structural sense (though I kept on with French and dropped Spanish because they stopped offering Spanish classes, so I suppose I feel you on having to swap out! QwQ). How is Hawai'ian for you??? That sounds so cool, but I wouldn't even know where to go about finding lessons (around here, at least -- maybe there are in your community?). What are the biggest differences between Hawai'ian and the other languages you've tried learning?
A: Lol, hilarious. I stopped French 'cause it was difficult for me to process certain words. It's going well, I know the basics (e.g, aloha - hello or goodbye, and pehea 'oe - how are you?) No, there are no lessons near me that I know of -- I am learning it myself (thanks, google translate.) As for differences, I'd say there are not a lot, but they're pretty fun!
Q7: On Aussie shampoos: Oh yeah, I remember the purple bottles, this does sound familiar! I think my mum was using it for a while -- my hair wasn't terribly frizzy, so I don't think I actually needed anything of such a high quality, but I believe she was going through a period of dyeing her hair at the time, which I've heard can frizz you up, so I expect that's why she bought it? Either way, it worked really well and was a win in my book!
A: Oh yeh. Like I mentioned before, mostly people with curly and coily hair use it, although I mentioned there were other collections for different types of hair (except oily hair, I think.) Oh nice, was it when you had curlier hair or was it just out-of-the-blue frizz?
Q8: On cross-stitching: Hey, you don't have to try everything under the sun -- sometimes it's nice to stick to what you know you enjoy! What kind of designs does your friend do? o3o
A: I mean, it depends on the person, because they might not have the same interest as other people, y'know? Oof, I'm not 100% sure if she still does it or not, I'll probably have to update you tomorrow (April 11)
Q9: On the quote of the day: This is good advice!!! I'm still working on how to think positively, but meditation and CBT skills have helped a lot! QwQ
A: Thanks! Same here, but its progressing I guess!
Q10: Would I rather be able to read minds or be able to teleport? Definitely teleport -- I think reading minds would be as much a curse as a blessing, and that people should generally be allowed to have some privacy, but teleporting would be SO convenient for getting places on time and running errands and getting home for visits??? So I would absolutely take teleporting. How about you?
A: Yeah, you have a point there. I couldn't come up with anything else lol. And also I think I was half asleep at the time I thought of it :^) Would probably choose teleporting as well.
Q11: On mentioning things: I... legitimately can't remember where I was going with that, haha. Might've been something I rewrote and then forgot to delete, we have such long message chains that I always end up forgetting something! QwQ
A: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q12: On LaPerms: Omg!!! I've never heard of these babies but I LOVE them now -- they're so fluffy and cute, like little clouds!!! QwQ
A: Yeah lol, I was bored, searching up different cats then I saw the LaPerm, I was surprised when it had curly-like hair! Lol
Quote of the day: -Even if you feel different, you are still worth your best, no matter what the outcome is.
QOTD: What's the nicest thing you've said or done? What's your least favorite song? What do you like to do on rainy days? Do you have a favourite quote? Have you tried cheesecake?

Q: Hello again!!! Hope all's well with you -- I'm doing my best to exist and be a student at the same time, but the thesis-writing has got me painfully behind the curve, so I admit I've got my nose to the grindstone right now. But hey, on the other hand, I see you've mentioned it but I just started with Minecraft this week and am actively trying to stop myself from playing it constantly instead of homework because oh god is it easy to just lose hours of your life to Minecraft-- May others learn from my mistakes. QwQ How's you???
A: Hey, sorry for the late reply, it was busy yesterday lol. OH I didn't know you played Minecraft as well! Yeah, my Xbox 360 stopped working a couple years back. Oof, hope you are able to. Usually it takes a while to get bored of something but that's just what I think honestly. I'm okay I guess.
Q1: On talking things out with friends: This is a very good idea!!! I'm glad that you have a strong network of people who get you and whom you can actually be open with. Keep those ones close -- they matter more than you know. And thank you, I'm glad I met you, too. QwQ
A: Yeah, I will try because one of mine graduated last year -- she's still around town lol. I think my other one is planning to stay for a while too I think? Not sure about me but I guess I'll know when the time comes. Thanks, I appreciate it 😊
Q2: On birthdays: well then happy early birthday again which I assume is the 31st but if i'm wrong then happy belated birthday regardless aaaaaa
For real, the most important thing about time is that you spend it happily. Full stop. No matter what that means to you, a happy moment is never wasted. So as long as you take time to appreciate each day as it comes in small, tangible ways -- no matter how clichéd that sounds, because genuinely, I know it does, but it's the best advice I've got in life so far -- it's worth it. Sometimes that's all you need to take the edge off that fear, even if it doesn't just magically go away. I think a lot less about aging than I do about purpose while I'm here... as long as I'm working towards something I really care about, then I figure the actual number of years is secondary.
A: Thanks!! You were very close, it was the 30th lol. Thanks.. I needed to hear this. <3
Q3: On vitamins and field trips: I don't know much about the Kardashians, but I'd be suspicious of any product, let alone a health one, selling on fame alone??? But that could be the cynic in me. QwQ As for field trips, I used to have a bunch in high school, but they genuinely just weren't to interesting places -- I think the most fun I had was a visit to one of the nearby islands once to go hiking, but even then we didn't have activities like yours!
A: That's true, like I said before, doctors (and apparently gynecologists) have mixed feelings about it. Oh yeah, well I guess it depends on the subject at hand (and the teacher as well, unless they're more of a classroom fan than others lol)
Q4: On biking: Hey, can confirm that it's never too late to learn if it's something you're interested in!!! I just got out biking for the first time in mooonths and even though my legs were jelly after like fifteen minutes, it was absolutely worth it, haha.
A: Oh cool, good for you!!! Did you bike in the snow or is the snow gone? The snow is finally gone in my city!! Wdym your legs were ""jelly?"" Lol.
Q5: On Wednesday: Honestly, this is a moooooood. At the end of the day, I don't know if I necessarily expect it to suddenly get better, but if they put out another season and my grandma wants to pick it up again, I'd at least be willing to sit through it!
A: Wdym by that? I dunno either, I didn't have much interest in it. I would probably just watch the classics tbh.
Q6: On trans stuff: As long as you're happy with yourself, there's never a need to change anything For the Sake of Society(c) anyway, at least as far as I'm concerned. You could have the highest voice known to humankind and as long as you felt comfy in your own presentation, I'd say it's perfectly fine!!! And I have no doubt that your generation will be nothing but supportive. QwQ
A: I'm still thinking about it, but I'll probably have to get a lot of stuff out of the way first though lol. I guess they probably would, but not 100 percent sure due to controversy with the LGBTQ2S+ community 乁( •_• )ㄏ
Q7: What is a hobby I've never tried but thought about trying someday? Ooh, I'd say book-binding! I've seen people make their own journals and stuff and it just looks so cool, but I have no idea how it works and I own none of the tools and I guarantee it's all expensive, so I'm holding off on trying it until I either find a friend into it or suddenly find buckets of money, haha. How about you?
A: That's sounds neat! It probably depends on the supplies you need for it, and the cheapest is probably Dollarama (or Dollar Tree in this case lol.) I dunno, I think I have this in my bio but I used to dance but I quit due to COVID.
Q8: On other languages: I took French as my minor in my undergrad! I never figured out how to speak it all that well, but I can write and read and such, albeit rustily, I'm sure.
A: That's cool, I took French until high-school (Grade 9), so I just gave up on it and decided to learn other languages for fun lol. I'm currently learning Spanish and Hawaiian :D
Q9: On Aussie shampoos: I genuinely don't know -- I think my mum used to buy them? If it's the one I'm thinking of, I think it was pretty good compared to the generics I'm buying now, at least???
A: Yeah, they have purple bottles and it smells pretty good actually -- I think most people use it for curly and coily hair but there's a collection for wavy hair, and different ones for volume and frizz control lol.
Q10: On knitting: I did it once upon a time -- my mum taught me a long time ago, but every time I tried I would mess up stitches and then forget how to do it right altogether, so I never got into it??? Highly recommend cross-stitching, though!
A: Oh nice!! Oof, not really an easy skill it seems like. I've never done cross-stitching, but my friend has however.
Q11: On ramen: I used to!!! Never tried it with just veggie stock, though, so we'll have to see if it still holds up, haha.
A: The vegatable stock is okay, I mostly eat the Kimchi brand though lol.
Q12: On bird whistling: As in whistling back to birds??? I can never do it realistically, but I definitely try -- they're so lovely, they deserve a conversation once in a while!
A: Yeah, I guess so -- I saw some of them on YouTube haha :p Yeah they are, just watch out when you have food lol!!

Q: On your poem: I... know the feeling. I'm glad that that isn't a present/real experience for you, but it sounds like you've been there, and I have too, at times. I know that art is just art, sometimes, but if you ever do start to feel that way again, I really hope you'll tell someone you trust and let them in to shine a little light on that darkness; sometimes we don't realize how much power others can return to us just by listening. QwQ I hope you're in a better place today. Be kind to yourself.
A: Yeah, apparently I had a fear of dying for 2 and a half years (I was thinking about what you said about looking forward to the stages of life.) Well I was talking to my friends about it recently and they said they were willing to talk to about it if I needed to. But thank you so much, I appreciate it. I'm glad I met you. :)
Q1: On birthdays and health and field trips and making music: Hello again!!! First off, have you reached your birthday yet? If so, happy birthday -- and if not, happy early birthday -- unless the ""birthday blues"" suggest that it's not the sort of thing you personally celebrate? I've never felt too strongly one way or the other about aging, just looking forward to the many stages of life left to go! Can't complain about gummy multivitamins, they taste infinitely better! And yeah, vitamin D is normally from the sun, but because there ain't much sun around here, I probably wasn't getting enough of it to begin with for my system, and I thiiiiink that vegans need a lil extra vitamin D anyway because it helps us absorb calcium better from other supplements? There's some sciency stuff to it, all I know is that I keep buying the stuff, lol. And on the field trip -- it sounds like you had an awesome time omg!!! That's a lot more Experiences(c) than I ever got to look forward to on a class field trip, by a long shot. I'm glad that you got to try so many cool things, and that your teachers managed to tie it into your curriculum, to boot!
A: Hi, how's it going and no, but it's getting close (hint: it's at the end of the month.) Yeah, feels like its getting shorter by the moment, but I dunno. That's just my fear though. Yeah, better than vitamin pills to be honest. And also it's not really sunny where I live right now -- it rains most of the time. More flavour too, tbh. Apparently there is this vitamin gummy brand going around recently, the brand is called ""Lemme"" (I dunno if you know Kourtney Kardashian) and apparently doctors have mixed feelings about it. And yeah, it was fun! I'm guessing you haven't been on much field trips?
Q2: On many forms of physical activity: Never too late to mention it if you wanted to!!! And I haven't tried that yoga pose, but uhhhhh I googled it for two seconds and there's no bloody way I could hold myself off the floor like that, haha. I would need so much more practice to get to that point! Maybe hiking is a more accessible activity, come to think... QwQ The distinction on bikes makes sense, I don't know much about them admittedly--
A: True lol. It's pretty difficult, but I think there are some easier ones as well I think? Same, I've never rode a mountain bike or a normal bike for that matter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q3: On Wednesday: Yes, I am talking about Tyler!!! Very cringe to have the only character seemingly dealing with his mental health issues in a constructive and communal way end up being secretly Big Evil, in my opinion. Enid was a difficult one for me, because I didn't mind her as a character -- I think irl I would have struggled a lot more with the sheer amount of endless chipper positive energy, but on screen it wasn't horrible -- but, much like my issues with Tyler, I felt that Enid completely missed the mark of her character arc by ending up transforming at the end. Like, they were CLEARLY setting her up to be an allegory for 2SLGBTQ+ marginalization -- with the ""wolfing out summer camps,"" the ""my parents could never understand me"" backstory, the clear struggle to fit into an otherwise homogenous monster-school culture... and so when she finally did wolf out, even if it was To Protect Her Friends, it was just like -- oh. Oh, so it's not okay for her to just be happy unless she also fits into this heteronormative paradigm. That's a shame. Oh well. I felt like most of the marginal representation in Wednesday was that shallow level of critique, though -- being willing to semi-represent different groups, barely and only in metaphor, but then not digging down to actually realize what it meant subtextually to set up those parallels and then not follow through? Idk. It was one of those things where I came away feeling entertained, but troubled the more I thought about it, too. That's how a lot of media is for me, tho!
A: Oh yeah, I respect your opinion. I on the other hand didn't think very highly of Tyler since I wasn't sure if it mattered tbh. Yeah, well her character description and traits just made me snarl in my head honestly. So I didn't think highly of her either. I would honestly rather watch paint dry then trying to listen to her trying to say or do something that would make her regret it later in the series like that, but that's just my standing opinion however. But yeah, I hope the series gets better though I guess (if not, I mean there's not a lot we can do at this point lol.)
Q4: On crafts: I love the energy of ""this was going to be bigger but now I'd rather just make it longer and get it over with"" knitting, haha! Me too, 100%. And hey, Cancun trip sounds lovely! QwQ (I'm not surprised that it's popular, lots of people are really into the tropics!) And oooooh, I can't imagine making your own dresses like that, that's so sick!!!!!
A: Yah!! Have you knitted before? Yeah, I guess mostly like Hawaii, Paris, etc lol. Yeah, it's pretty cool!!
Q5: On transcare and the Island: Oh, no worries! Maybe you haven't had to deal with 'performing' for care, which would be a great step forward for the trans world tbh -- I guess I mean the urge that some of us older folks have felt (and maybe still feel? I guess it depends where you are and who you talk to) to ""fit the stereotypes"" of trans-ness that doctors have come to expect in order to get approved for things... it's unfortunate, but I've heard it a fair bit from friends I have in the community, depending on where they get care and how knowledgeable their specific doctors are about transgender things. I'd like to think that that issue is actually getting better over time, though, especially now that transness is more visible in the medical community? In any case, I've been grateful thus far to find multiple doctors who are attentive to my needs and I've generally felt that I could be honest with them all the way through, so I wouldn't worry about it too much -- I'm hoping your generation has it easier, is all! I'm sorry to hear things are rough with the family situation, though -- I know that money stress can be a BIG thing that contributes to conflict around the house (something that my mum and I went through quite a bit when I was younger), so I hope that you're doing well and that you've got the support you need. QwQ And yeah, if you do end up on the Island, I could very well happen to pass you on the street one day -- you never know!!!
A: Ohhh okay, I just didn't understand what you were saying before. (Thought it was dancing or theatre-wise) Oh yeah. Well I wouldn't exactly worry too much, because I do have some facial hair on my face and my voice is somewhat deep lol. And I know you said before that you had a natural deep voice as well, if I'm correct. Yeah, my generation would most likely as well since it's talked about a lot and there are a lot of campaigns for the LGBTQ2S+ community. And no worries, we are trying our best (even though my parents don't really work anymore due to illness and injury.) Yeah maybe, we'll definitely have to catch up I think!!! I might be between Nanaimo and Victoria!! (✿^‿^)
Q6: What's my favourite video game? Uhhhhhhh, it's really hard to pick a favourite, honestly! My stand-by answer is always Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, just because it's a game that massively defined my childhood and future interests, but I haven't actually played many games in a long time... the only one I'm currently messing around with is a fangame called Poké Wilds?
A: Cool! I grew up playing Minecraft until I was in middle school lol.
Q7: On golf: I've never tried it, but my partner says it's fun!
A: Nice! I didn't know he played golf.
Q8: On the encouragement: Thank you!!! I wish you all the same, my friend!!! And you be sure to be unique, too!!!
A: Thank you!!! You toooooooo!!!!! Sending virtual hugs!!! ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ
Q9: On clothing trends: Ooh, I could absolutely second the grunge and the graphic tees!!! I hadn't heard of waffle-knit until now but those shirts look heckin comfy too, I wouldn't complain at all if this became a thing!!!
A: Yep, it's pretty cool not gonna lie! Yep, I'm pretty sure they exist, but they're probably a bit harder to find these days l think lol!!
Q10: Would I rather be a doctor but wearing tropical clothes or would I be a teacher wearing trendy clothes? I would absolutely rather be a teacher in trendy clothes -- I do NOT have what it takes to be a medical doctor, no matter how many cool Hawai'ian flowers I could have on my shirt, haha!!!
A: Cool choice!! I mean, you're not wrong there lol!!
Q11: On music and apparently Squid Game: I love chill music teachers who actually give you the room to explore the things that you're most interested in instead of sticking you into a pre-set list of songs; honestly, being too confined in the kind of music I wanted to learn was what kinda pushed me out of piano lessons in the end. So I'm glad that you got a chance to experiment! I'm surprised to hear you talk about Squid Game, though (because maybe I'm just a sensitive oldie, but I found that show almost too much for me to watch content-wise, haha -- though it was a pretty cool critique of capitalism up until they apparently started making a completely theme-ruining reality show about it after the fact, which is peak yikes?????). In any case, it sounds like you can officially do more on the guitar than me, so congratulations on that! ;P
A: Yeah, I've only watch bits and pieces of Squid Game but didn't watch the full episodes though. funny enough he used to go to VIU (I dunno if you know him or not lol) and yeah he did make us do one song which was ""Take It Easy"" by Eagles but it was for a class assignment. Haha, thanks!! Nah, I don't think you're a sensitive oldie -- you're generally a cool and caring person and that's all that matters in this case.
Q12: On Immortals: Oi, we do like a show with immortality and psychic powers and ominous-sounding character names -- I may snoop when I have the chance!
A: Lol, you definitely should!
Q13: On whistling: Well thank you very much!! QwQ I'm glad to hear that you've learned to whistle inwards, that's the first step to managing it yourself -- you'll be ahead of me in no time!!!
A: I guess so, you never know though -- but hey, if there is another Gathertown hangout happening, I think whatever you song/melody you whistle comes to mind, it'll be cool!!! And also I've watched videos of people doing bird whistling too haha!

A: Thank you, you too!!! Oh yeah, he said that I might have to start taking vitamins (I take the gummy ones, because I have hate towards the pill) to help my immune system in that case lol. Vitamin D from the sun? Correct me if I'm wrong lol! Oh congratulations on going vegan! I've never gone vegan before but good for you, I'm happy for ya! No worries! I'm back and okay now, I just left for a bit. I have the birthday blues sneaking up on me since my birthday is towards the end of March (yay.) But happy belated birthday though! Hope you had a good one :D I haven't been the best, but I'm trying! And also I guess I'm making music now so yay lol! I disappeared from the platform for a couple days as well due to school (including the field trip.) Which the field trip went good by the way, it was cold and snowy though. One of the teachers from another class read this book called ""Oolichan Moon"" for the last bit the bus ride, I was playing Subway Surfers the whole bus ride though while my class and another class blared music. Funny enough, they played Taylor Swift music on the way back to school lol. We dip-netted for ooclican, and we stopped at a lake (it was like an ice rink and some of my classmates were skating and sliding on it lol) and we cooked it and roasted it over the fire, and it was so good!! We also had donuts, cookies and also one of my classmates bought stuff for s'mores!! So I had a good time :p And also I was video-chatting with my friend (the one who taught me how to beatbox!) Not sure if I'm gonna visit him and his family though, I guess I'm gonna have to plan with my family and find out!

Maybe you haven't had to deal with 'performing' for care, which would be a great step forward for the trans world tbh -- I guess I mean the urge that some of us older folks have felt (and maybe still feel? I guess it depends where you are and who you talk to) to ""fit the stereotypes"" of trans-ness that doctors have come to expect in order to get approved for things... it's unfortunate, but I've heard it a fair bit from friends I have in the community, depending on where they get care and how knowledgeable their specific doctors are about transgender things. I'd like to think that that issue is actually getting better over time, though, especially now that transness is more visible in the medical community? In any case, I've been grateful thus far to find multiple doctors who are attentive to my needs and I've generally felt that I could be honest with them all the way through, so I wouldn't worry about it too much -- I'm hoping your generation has it easier, is all!
I'm sorry to hear things are rough with the family situation, though -- I know that money stress can be a BIG thing that contributes to conflict around the house (something that my mum and I went through quite a bit when I was younger), so I hope that you're doing well and that you've got the support you need. QwQ And yeah, if you do end up on the Island, I could very well happen to pass you on the street one day -- you never know!!!
On the encouragement: Thank you!!! I wish you all the same, my friend!!! And you be sure to be unique, too!!! 
Would I rather be a doctor but wearing tropical clothes or would I be a teacher wearing trendy clothes? I would absolutely rather be a teacher in trendy clothes -- I do NOT have what it takes to be a medical doctor, no matter how many cool Hawai'ian flowers I could have on my shirt, haha!!!
On golf: I've never tried it, but my partner says it's fun!
What's my favourite video game? Uhhhhhhh, it's really hard to pick a favourite, honestly! My stand-by answer is always Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, just because it's a game that massively defined my childhood and future interests, but I haven't actually played many games in a long time... the only one I'm currently messing around with is a fangame called Poké Wilds? 
 
On your poem: I... know the feeling. I'm glad that that isn't a present/real experience for you, but it sounds like you've been there, and I have too, at times. I know that art is just art, sometimes, but if you ever do start to feel that way again, I really hope you'll tell someone you trust and let them in to shine a little light on that darkness; sometimes we don't realize how much power others can return to us just by listening. QwQ I hope you're in a better place today. Be kind to yourself.",mentor

                                                                                   Nothing will make me cry
Here I am, wallowing, not wanting to get out of bed. But there is this emotion wanting to get out of me. There are thoughts picking at me like looking for gold in a gold mine. I feel wrecked. I want to cry until people forget I exist. But why would I do that? I don't know but deep down, those are my thoughts talking.
(Disclaimer: What you read was not a real experience of mine. I have been through something similar like this at one point, but this is something I wouldn't wish upon myself or anyone else. I just wanted to say it in poem version instead of writing thousands and thousands of words.)",mentee

Hey, happy March!!! :'D I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough day -- it's always important to take the time you need, so no rush, but I'm here when you're ready to return. I know how it is to just... have to go Exist(c) sometimes. QwQ My health has been good -- I feel you on the multivitamins, since I've gone vegan I've had to pick up quite a few of them just to make sure I'm getting my B12 and vD and calcium and all that in, you don't realize how important they are until it all catches up to you honestly -- and I hope that you're feeling better, mood things aside!
A: Thank you, you too!!! Oh yeah, he said that I might have to start taking vitamins (I take the gummy ones, because I have hate towards the pill) to help my immune system in that case lol. Vitamin D from the sun? Correct me if I'm wrong lol! Oh congratulations on going vegan! I've never gone vegan before but good for you, I'm happy for ya! No worries! I'm back and okay now, I just left for a bit. I have the birthday blues sneaking up on me since my birthday is towards the end of March (yay.) But happy belated birthday though! Hope you had a good one :D I haven't been the best, but I'm trying! And also I guess I'm making music now so yay lol! I disappeared from the platform for a couple days as well due to school (including the field trip.) Which the field trip went good by the way, it was cold and snowy though. One of the teachers from another class read this book called ""Oolichan Moon"" for the last bit the bus ride, I was playing Subway Surfers the whole bus ride though while my class and another class blared music. Funny enough, they played Taylor Swift music on the way back to school lol. We dip-netted for ooclican, and we stopped at a lake (it was like an ice rink and some of my classmates were skating and sliding on it lol) and we cooked it and roasted it over the fire, and it was so good!! We also had donuts, cookies and also one of my classmates bought stuff for s'mores!! So I had a good time :p And also I was video-chatting with my friend (the one who taught me how to beatbox!) Not sure if I'm gonna visit him and his family though, I guess I'm gonna have to plan with my family and find out!
Q1: On yoga and hiking: Yoga was actually really good for me for the short while that I tried to get into it -- it was something I think I tried alongside tai chi (highly recommend!) and kickboxing (highly recommend but less so because it's hella expensive to get equipment for! QwQ); I find that lower-energy activities that really get me focused on feelings in my body helps to relax my mind in a way that I don't get a lot by accident, what with all the ADHD bouncing around in there. I might have to try yoga again down the line now that I've gotten into meditation -- I feel like yoga is sort of just the active version of it? As for hiking, I've never done super long hikes, but I used to go for an hour or two and follow trails back home! Once the weather is good out here in Saskatoon, I'll be back up to biking, at least (I'm not sure if my bike counts as a ""mountain bike"" in any sense, though -- it's built for rough terrain, but maybe it doesn't count unless it's motorized???).
A: Oh cool! I think my mom was gonna sign me up one time, but she probably forgot by the time school started back again lol. Oof, my not-so-favorite pose from yoga is crow pose. And I heard Chakrasana is pretty difficult to do. Oh kickboxing? Damn, I didn't know you did that! Awesome, the last time I went for a ""hike"" was back a couple years ago (around 2014-2015?) with my babysitter (she was nice, but I think me and my sisters would prank each other most of the time lol. Me and my sisters were in elementary at the time) Neato!!! I think mountain bikes are just like your regular, typical bike but the wheels looked thicker when I looked it up? For off-road biking, I think you might be talking about a dirt bike I believe lol.
Q2: On propoganda and Netflix: I absolutely feel you on this -- infighting and misinformation is everywhere. It's important to get away from it wherever you can for your mental health, at least insofar as possible considering how inundated we all are in our technology... I had to delete my Reddit account for the sheer amount of doom-scrolling I used to do, and though I have a Facebook technically, I check it literally once a year when folks wish me a happy birthday and try not to stay long. I don't even own a TV out here anymore, and honestly, I don't miss it at all, haha. As for Netflix, I do still watch that, but I agree that it's hard to really find anything ""worth"" watching half the time. I mostly use it as an excuse to have social time with my grandma, and finding a show that she hasn't watched, regardless of quality, is almost impossible from the onset; ergo, we literally go down the line and find ANYTHING that's new to both of us, and as long as we can both stomach it, that becomes our next series, lol. I haven't seen much of Stranger Things, but I found Wednesday alright too, albeit lowkey (sometimes highkey) colonial at parts and maaaaybe not technically the best mental health representation (if you've seen to the end and you know which character I'm talking about, cough cough). But I think it's OK to enjoy things while also recognizing flaws like that -- being aware of them is what matters, and it had a lot of good messages about friendship and consent and growing up, too, so all in all I'm glad I watched it! QwQ
A: Yeah I know, it's crazy of what the world suddenly turned into since lockdown a couple years ago (except the recipes were okay like the Dalgona coffee, I thought it was good!) Reddit is okay I guess, I ususally read it when I'm on break at school, or unless I'm playing Subway Surfers or just producing music from the apps I mentioned before lol. Yeah, Wednesday was okay I guess, I didn't like Enid very much though. I watched it with my sisters and family-friends. funny enough, I borrowed from the school's guitar (I had guitar class at the time, dunno if I told you or not but its fine lol.) to practice at home for a test and I decided to play along with her cello solo and it was pretty hilarious lol. Oh wait a minute, are you talking about Tyler? If not, then correct me! Yeah, Stranger Things is due for one more season, but when I was watching it with my family, it was happy, scary and sad. I also watched Love, Simon a few times when I had Disney+ before and it was good and had some pretty life-changing experiences. If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it for ya! (aaaand also there's books for it too lol) Yeah, when I was younger I would watch things like Blue's Clues, 4 Square, etc.
Q3: On cakes and knitting: I think I actually own Rosanna Pasino's geek cookbook!!! It must be back in BC, but I had an absolute craze of collecting intentionally geeky cookbooks back in the day (it was the only thing that engaged me in the act of Learning to Cook(c)) and the name sounds very familiar! As for knitting, that was one of the few things I tried craft-wise that I was notoriously bad at, probably because doing things in the wrong order is criminally unforgiving (in cross-stitch, if you miss a stitch, you can go back and put it wherever you want; in knitting, if you miss a stitch, something looks wonky foreeeeever!!!). It was something my mum really enjoyed when her eyes were good enough for it, though, so I'm still really fond of the concept. QwQ
A: Cool!! My friend was crocheting what used to be a blanket, but I think she said it was a scarf now? Not sure because she made it back in January/Feburary before she went on her Cancun trip, she said it was good!! (apparently Cancun is becoming a popular vacation spot now haha) But now she's making her walkup dress and prom dress which is pretty cool!! Can't wait to see how it turns out :D Lol, but its a pretty neat hobby you picked up there! I mean cooking is a nice thing to do and I guess in that sense, its pretty important!
Q4: On favourite books: I've heard of Heartstoppers and possibly The Immortals (although I could be thinking of a different author on that one???) but don't know much about them -- I might have to check out Heartstoppers on Netflix if it still exists there and I ever get a free day from all the thesis-ing to be a person (aaaaaaa). How are you finding The Immortals? What's it about?
A: Nice!! I believe Heartstopper is still there! The Immortals series is pretty good so far -- It's about a girl named Ever Bloom who unfortunately loses her family in an car accident and develops pyschic abilities and has been turned immortal by a guy named Damen Auguste. (I will not spoil the rest lol.) Oh and apparently there looks to be a movie happening soon but not sure, but when I was looking it up, I saw the announcement on the book author's Instagram page! So maybe there might be a movie but don't know for sure!!
Q5: On music: Yesssss!!! I'm glad we got to rock out on our Gather.town call! :D
A: Same!!! It was SO much fun! I liked how you were vibing, singing and whistling haha
Q6: On how loud I can whistle: Loud enough to hurt my ears, but proooooobably not loud enough to spook the local wildlife -- although I bet I could if I could figure out how people do that whistling thing where they put their fingers in their mouth and make that sharp trill sound??? I've never been able to figure that out, but I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy it if I did anyway, so admittedly I'm not trying very hard, haha!
A: You could watch videos on YouTube or look it up on Google if you want more clear instructions I guess, but it shouldn't be very hard I think? Coming from me, I think you are pretty talented when it comes to whistling tunes like what you were doing on Gathertown the other day, it was pretty awesome! If you can't do it, try again until you get it down perfect, you will get it eventually!!!
Q7: Quote of the day: I'm learning a lot of this lesson lately, thank you for the healthy reminder! QwQ
A: Thanks!! Not sure what you mean though lol. No worries on that healthy reminder though!
Q8: If I could play one instrument, what would it be? I can already play piano and semi-kinda-sorta ocarina, but I think it would be really good to actually know how to play the acoustic guitar that's been sitting here for as long as I remember... and then hey, if I can pick another one, I've always been fascinated by the cello??? There was this band I listened to back in the day called Apocalyptica that did a bunch of covers of Metallica songs, but just in cello, and it was just. Gorgeous. Such a big clunky instrument and probably super inconvenient and expensive to own, but in a fantasy world where I could do whatever I wanted??? Cello.
A: That's cool! I think my French teacher back in Grade 8 would play a video off YouTube and the channel was called 2CELLOS I believe. My friend has a piano too and plays on it and also I have a piano as well, but my sister plays it the most lol. I could somewhat play acoustic guitar, but the only songs I know how to do is ""Put Your Head on my Shoulder"", Red Light, Green Light from Squid Game, and I was learning how to play the Mii Theme :p (I was bored and Guitar class was pretty easy-going at the time I guess and most of the time you could do basically whatever song you wanted to do on guitar. The teacher's chill, he's pretty cool too haha.)
Q7: Which fashion trend would I bring back? I feel like you asked me this one on stream, but: BIG. GOOFY. HATS. I stand by this statement 100%.
A: Haha lol, you do you!! Well most of the fashion trends from the 80s-90s already came back but I'd say flannel shirts, graphic shirts, cargo pants, grunge clothing and can't forget about tye-dye shirts and acid-washed jeans. Although I can't really say if people wear acid-washed jeans anymore lol. Oh and I've been obsessed with waffle-knit henley shirts!
Q8: On coming out and talking to TransCareBC: Omg, I'm so excited for you!!! No need to rush at all, but that's really cool and I hope that everything goes lovely when and if you do take that big step. QwQ When you reach Vancouver Island, if you're looking for a really good transcare doc, I highly recommend Dr. Patricia Seymour at the Coleman Clinic in Duncan  -- you can even tell her I sent you if you'd like, haha! She's so kind and understanding and I didn't feel the need to 'perform' for her at all in order to get the care that I needed, which was such a validating and comfortable experience. She's the doctor who got me approved for my hysterectomy and put me in touch with a really lovely and validating surgeon (Dr. Liston who's also in Duncan, in case that's ever a name you need, but idk what your plans are and transition is always a unique individual journey!!!) and she was just... so sweet. I have an amazing memory of going in to see Dr. Seymour when I had first come out and was all nervous to get my gender marker change paperwork signed off on by an Official Authority of the Medical World(c) (which you need in order to get approved), and I walked in and just told her how nervous I was about doing something that would 'fail' me in front of her, and how badly I wanted to do the thing, and how I would come back no matter how many times she said no, and she just, like, took it and signed it and said ""there you go, now you don't have to worry about that part, now let's talk about your life and how you're doing and see what else we can do for you"" and it was sO WONDERFUL I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS--
A: I'm not 100% sure what you mean about ""performing"" (curse my ASD sometimes.) Cool!! I'm not so sure about the move to Vancouver Island yet because of financial problems, family situations and stuff like that. But my mom said that it's a possibility. Fingers crossed!! I don't know if we will bump into each other at some point or not when I move to Vancouver Island (will most likely be either in Nanaimo or Victoria) if you visit Vancouver Island again lol.
Bonus Question: Thank you for wishing me well on the homework; it's three days overdue and I'm kinda freaking out about it over here, but I'm working hard and doing my best to catch up and show my professor what I'm capable of! I wish you all of the luck with whatever's going on in your life and I hope things get better soon. Take your time and don't let people define you, my friend. QwQ
A: Thank you :) No worries, you show them who's boss!! Don't forget to eat and drink water or your favorite drink (food and hydration are key!!!) And don't forget to stretch and go for a nice walk around the block (if you can lol.) Heck, whistle with the birds to make it more fun haha!! Sending virtual hugs and high-fives :D

Q1: On respiratory viruses: Oh no! I hope you're taking it easy and getting all the rest you need (and hopefully the antibiotics are helping kick its butt by now!). Fingers crossed that you can have a mellow existence until your next appointment and that all goes well! QwQ
A: Ehhh, I'm alright right now I think lol. I do not take antibiotics currently, but I had them before (it was a wild + trippy experience!!!) Yes thank you!! Hope your health is doing good as well!!
Q2: On hiking and yoga: Yoga I've tried, but admittedly I really miss nature now that I don't feel like there's as much ""woodsy"" stuff to see out here -- hiking is a really good one!!!
A: Ooh! How did yoga work out for you? Yes, me too! Helps the headaches and such. Have you been hiking before? I heard people do mountain biking lol.
Q3: On TV/computers and misinformation: It's super overwhelming!!! It definitely feels like the Internet Age has really accelerated how much misinformation we have to sift through, just by virtue of giving us so much more content to deal with... I'm really working on limiting my general social media intake just to avoid the mental health consequences of it all. QwQ With that said, I'm not necessarily nostalgic for any sort of time Before Propoganda(c)??? Because every medium and story comes with underlying presumptions, no matter how wholesome the story tries to be... so I'm not sure I believe that there was a ""good old days"" before that was happening -- maybe just a ""good old days"" before I understood that it was happening and had to put up with it, haha.
A: Yes exactly!!! Especially with COVID news and stuff (old news is no news.) Yep, propaganda is as chaotic as a contruction area. Twitter is usually where [most of] the typical propaganda is. Yeah, I wish there was the ""good old days."" Too much drama on Netflix's end too, I think. Some of their movies are okay. (I just don't really like their original TV shows/movies very much especially that goes for reality shows, but me and my family only watch it for the memey, trashy drama though haha. Stranger Things is pretty good and Wednesday is okay lol. And also most of the good TV shows/movies got removed, including most childhood shows like Blue's Clues :( (they moved most Disney and Nickelodeon TV shows/movies (well except Sam and Cat, Victorious, Henry Danger and The Thundermans) to their own streaming platforms.)
Q4: Quote of the Day: Yes!!!!! I have to tell myself this often these days. QwQ
A: Please do!! :D
Q5: What talent do I have but never use often? I would saaaay cake decorating is one of those niche skills that used to be a daily thing at my job but is now just an occasional ""oh hey, I can do that, there's a holiday coming up and I still have the icing tips!"" sort of thing. Also, certain types of art that I've picked up but haven't done consistently probably count -- I learned acrylic paint last year but have hardly touched it since, same with cross-stitching. Lots of tiny talents that would crop up a lot more if I had more time for them, but for now they can wait patiently and hopefully not rust too much!
A: Oh that's cool! I've been watching baking channels too -- I don't know if you have heard of Rosanna Pasino but she is a really good YouTuber who bakes and stuff!!! Cross-stitching and painting are cool too, rainy days activities galore!! Have you knitted before?
Q6: Do I have any favorite books? Oh so many aaaaaa! When I was a kid I was super into The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, along with Redwall and Warriors (when I was younger -- I think eventually Warriors got repetitive, but Redwall had such good descriptions of things that it might be worth another go!), and as I've grown up I've been more and more into series like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and a bunch of weird one-offs that I've run into in the course of my school things, like Chorus of Mushrooms by Hiromi Goto (just a gorgeous book artistically).
A: Hey hey, that's so cool! I believe I have heard of the book before, but have never read it! Lol, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are nice books too! I recently found out that Heartstopper was a book series lol. (and also it's a TV show and it's pretty amazing) And I have a book series called The Immortals by Alyson Noel, it's pretty epic lol. Chorus of Mushrooms sounds funny (just by title, not sure how it is out of context)
Q7: On music folks: I've heard of a lot of these artists, but haven't listened to all of them -- but I love Alec Benjamin!!! I believe I used to listen to Big Time Rush and Ariana Grande back in the day, too, though I never got much into One Direction (maybe because it was ""cool"" and I used to want to be counter-culture about everything??? glad to have grown out of that).
A: Haha, good to see you're an Alec Benjamin fan too! My favorite would be ""Water Fountain""! Oh that's cool, belting out yesterday's era!! Lol, I listened to One Direction a couple times but never really listened to their songs again. My best friend is a fan of them lol. Me and my best friend also listen to a bit of Zendaya's music haha. Lol, good for you!
Q8: On watching Avatar and loud whistling: Highly recommend the first activity, don't recommend the second, rofl. I can whistle loudly, but I generally try to avoid it!
A: I already watched the first one, it was pretty good to be honest. Oh yeah, especially in public haha. I don't really know how to whistle well, so I can't really say from experience lol. How loud can you whistle anyway? (like extreeeeeemeeely loud that deers can hear, or low whereas other people can probably hear?)
Q9: Would I rather wear tropical shirts or trench coats in the summer? Since my transition I've become a bit of a tropical shirt fan, but trench coats are still VERY cool and I burn like crazy out in the sun, so I'd do both!
A: Awesome!!! That's pretty fashion forward I'd say! The pun: Dressing like a detective on summer days lol.
Quote of the day: -As long as you pick yourself up, you can dodge anything that would try to ruin a perfectly good day.

On respiratory viruses: Oh no! I hope you're taking it easy and getting all the rest you need (and hopefully the antibiotics are helping kick its butt by now!). Fingers crossed that you can have a mellow existence until your next appointment and that all goes well! QwQ
On hiking and yoga: Yoga I've tried, but admittedly I really miss nature now that I don't feel like there's as much ""woodsy"" stuff to see out here -- hiking is a really good one!!!
On TV/computers and misinformation: It's super overwhelming!!! It definitely feels like the Internet Age has really accelerated how much misinformation we have to sift through, just by virtue of giving us so much more content to deal with... I'm really working on limiting my general social media intake just to avoid the mental health consequences of it all. QwQ With that said, I'm not necessarily nostalgic for any sort of time Before Propoganda(c)??? Because every medium and story comes with underlying presumptions, no matter how wholesome the story tries to be... so I'm not sure I believe that there was a ""good old days"" before that was happening -- maybe just a ""good old days"" before I understood that it was happening and had to put up with it, haha.
On music folks: I've heard of a lot of these artists, but haven't listened to all of them -- but I love Alec Benjamin!!! I believe I used to listen to Big Time Rush and Ariana Grande back in the day, too, though I never got much into One Direction (maybe because it was ""cool"" and I used to want to be counter-culture about everything??? glad to have grown out of that).

Quote of the Day: Yes!!!!! I have to tell myself this often these days. QwQ
What talent do I have but never use often? I would saaaay cake decorating is one of those niche skills that used to be a daily thing at my job but is now just an occasional ""oh hey, I can do that, there's a holiday coming up and I still have the icing tips!"" sort of thing. Also, certain types of art that I've picked up but haven't done consistently probably count -- I learned acrylic paint last year but have hardly touched it since, same with cross-stitching.

Q1: On thesis-ing: I'm sorry to hear you have a cold!!! Hopefully that's cleared up. QwQ A thesis is like a really long essay -- 80-100 pages made up of essentially four essays tacked together on one overarching topic! It's the big final boss of my MA program and I'm having a heck of a time of it over here (which is prolly why I'm so sporadic checking in with my messages aaaa); I've got to draft the first 10 pages by tomorrow night in order to send them to my supervisor and then hopefully polish them up as much as I can before we meet next week, and it isssss a lot. Quite a lot. But I'm passionate about it, so it's gotta be worth doing!
A: Oh wow! That's a lot, I understand if you message periodically, we've all got busy lives it seems like! It is worth doing and completing stuff. That's alright, I went to the ER (again for the third time maybe?) and turns out I had a respiratory virus. but still am a bit sick and I have a doctor's appointment towards the end of the month to find out why lol. (I got sick November, December and the second half of January.)
Q2: On meds and non-meds: I feel you on things being equal solutions -- I definitely find that meds can only take you so far, just like anything else can only take you so far, so having a bunch of coping strategies rolled up together that all support each other (whether or not that includes medical treatment, I'm sure for some folks a bunch of non-med strategies just work better for them!) is usually the most successful way to go, I find!
A: Yeah, I mean you're right there. Hiking and yoga are good strategies.
Q3: On surgery: I am totally OK -- it was very much worth it and I have no regrets!!! No need for concern, but thank you for caring. :P
A: Glad to hear!
Q4: On family stuff: No worries, my friend! I know we've got limits to what we can talk about, but at least I can say -- from someone who knows what it's like to some extent -- that things can absolutely get better to handle as you grow up and gain some independence and distance from it all. It may not sound like much, but I hope it helps. QwQ
A: Awh! It did. :)
Q6: On truth and weather: Absolutely!!! I'd always rather someone be honest with me at the end of the day, no mater what. And hey, we've had a lot of those sunny-but-cold days over here lately... I almost prefer it when it's cloudy out, just because it traps the heat in!
A: True that! And cool, I guess so! In my city it's mostly cloudy as well as rainy too haha, the weather in my city is pretty wacky! I didn't know it traps heat haha. 
Q7: On iCarly: It's a meme now??? I didn't know that! Of course, I also didn't know they made a new one, which is... probably yikes. I feel like the very premise of iCarly was tied to its time -- as in, the era in which the internet was this new and strange thing people weren't really used to growing up with to some extent -- and a lot of the comedy that comes from the idea of being a streamer is probably just, like, half the audience's day to day existence now? It was good while it lasted, though!
A: Yeah it is lol. There is a reboot that came in around 2021 but it's not really the same as it was (reference lol.) so I didn't really bother to watch it at all. :/ Yeah, I kinda miss the old days where there were cartoons and funny movies/TV shows and not platforms that spreads misinformation today (I'm talking about you TikTok.)
Q8: Do I have a favourite singer/band? I definitely couldn't pick just one!!! At a glance, picking a random assortment of bands: Halsey, Falling in Reverse, Twenty One Pilots, Mother Mother, Cavetown, Panic! At the Disco, Saint Motel, Icon For Hire, Marina & The Diamonds, Rise Against, Bug Hunter, Sweatshop Union, Waxlimbs, Breaking Benjamin, Downplay, Glass Animals... the list kinda goes on forever, so I guess I really can't say I have a favourite, lol! How about you?
A: Ooooh, I think I've heard/listened to most of these lol. Ummm, I'd say maybe Harry Styles (I listen to his music sometimes), I sometimes listen to Alec Benjamin, probably Ariana Grande, and I recently found out about a music artist named Andrew Bird but I listen to his music once in a while lol, but I think that's pretty much it on my end haha :)
Q9: On the Quote of the Day: Hey, that's actually really helpful for me today, thank you. QwQ
A: I'm glad it helped!!
Q10: Would I rather have the ability to whistle super loud or control water? DEFINITELY to control water, 100% -- sometimes I whistle too loud for my own ears already, so I'd probably find having super-whistling really uncomfortable! Whereas water powers would have all sorts of cool uses -- have you ever seen Avatar: The Last Airbender? Waterbending was, like, my favourite thing from that show!
A: That's cool, waterbending is epic! I have seen snippets and clips from Avatar, but haven't watched the full episodes lol. I didn't know you whistle super loud haha.
Quote of the day: -Even if you don't reach all the way to the top, you will still achieve your goals.

Hello again from the far reaches of the Internet void!!! We're deep in thesis-struggling (not quite thesis-writing!) over here but I'm doing my best -- I hope you're doing OK too! QwQ
A: Oh that's cool! Is it for an essay or something? You can do it, I believe in ya!!!! :D I'm okay, just dealing with a cold again, except it's not too bad lol.
Q1: On anxiety meds: Oh dear!!! I understand not wanting to bring it up if they're not super receptive to the conversation -- that can make things harder to deal with, too. With that said, if they're kind of receptive to it, I wouldn't count them out as supports -- but I would also look up resources on your own time if you can! 
In terms of chemical/brain stuff, I mean to say that I think medication worked for me because I (presumably) have some kind of chemical imbalance that physically causes anxiety to trigger (as opposed to, say, if your brain is producing all the required chemicals to be calm but you're experiencing external factors, eg. traumatic situations or environmental stress around you that influences you into anxiety -- which I think would probably be best looked at in terms of therapy? although as a person with some life trauma, I can say that having it stack on top of chemical imbalances meant that I needed meds and some external emotional support to figure my stuff out, myself, so again, it's all down to what works best for you as an individual). Chemical-wise, I just found that being on meds allowed me to calm and focus myself in ways that no amount of breathing exercises/talk therapy ever could, even though those things helped somewhat (and still continue to -- meditation is really useful for me!!!); so I'm betting that they correct a probable lack of serotonin in my brain that was causing/worsening those symptoms beyond the point where I could tackle it without filling the tank with more serotonin, so to speak.
All of this to say: medication and therapy and meditation and diet/exercise and support networks and all of the other things people use to make their lives easier with anxiety can be helpful, whether on their own or as one of a bunch of healthy coping strategies, and none are inherently better than others -- you just need to figure out which ones work best for you (and don't let anyone else tell you that there's a ""right way"" or a ""wrong way"" to cope -- as long as what you're doing doesn't hurt yourself or other people, then I'd say all strategies are equally good and moral and kind!).
A: Yeah, that's true if you ask me. I have been actually -- especially for ADHD and other ones too! I mean, it depends on what. I mean it could be equal solutions too you know? 
Q2: On acid reflux: Oh no, I wasn't upset with you asking! I only asked why because I was curious to know if you were asking for personal reasons, ie. that you had it too and were looking for advice or some such (the best advice I can really give is not to lie down immediately after eating or to prop yourself upright against a pillow so that gravity keeps everything down a little better!). And hey, I don't think any of us think we're equipped for big scary situations like that until they happen, but I have no doubt that you'd be resilient no matter what life throws at you! I always used to think surgery would be an impossible scary hurdle for me, but it ended up not being nearly as big of a deal as I thought it was when I went in for the first time a couple years back!
A: Oh okay, thank you. That's good to know. Oh hope you are okay from surgery! 
Q3: On families and distance: No worries at all for the vent -- I relate to it, actually. My biological parents split up when I was one year old and they fought over me all through my childhood/teen years in court, so I know how it can be to have Family Tension(c) to a high degree. I get along with both of my parents better now that we're out of that stage and I'm an adult at a distance from them, but I never really got ""close"" with my dad due to all the lost time and the arguments on both sides for why the other parent was evil or whatever; I can't say that I have any good advice on that front, except to keep close to the folks who feel healthy for you to be around and to recognize that your family is (at the end of the day) who you choose for it to be, not just who's related to you by blood. If you want to reconnect with your dad, maybe one day you will when you get the same sort of freedom and distance that I've had moving away and being independent; if you don't, then it's OK to feel that way too, and to heal from whatever grief that leaves you with whenever/however works best for you. Human existence is complicated and it's never gonna be perfect, but I'm glad that you feel comfortable sharing and I hope things get figured out for you one way or another (if anything in life can ever be said to be 100% ""figured out""!).
A: Awh man, that sucks. I wish I could say more, but y'know safety, rules and stuff. Thank you though, you've been a good mentor/friend. Glad you understand :) I hope you get through your stuff too
Q4: On doctors: Then that's a start! As long as you're comfy with this one, I'm happy for you!
A: Thank you!! 
Q5: On dating things (and snow!): Hey, I feel that, things turn out that way all the time -- and it was brave of you to share your feelings either way, and definitely an act of love and growth to be able to respect her in turn and to care about her as a person regardless of her status as a friend or partner. I'm proud of you for this! QwQ And yessss, it's freezing out here right now -- probably too cold for extra snow, tbh, but we've had the same batch just frozen on the ground for months and it never seems to go away, so we get all the fun of trudging through it and none of the days off, haha. (And I'm glad that I can help, thank you!!! QwQ)
A: Thank you for helping me, it's always good to know the truth whether you are saddened by it or happy, it's just good to know one way or the other. And oof, the weather in my city right now is pretty iffy and it changes too lol. It is currently cold but sunny as I am writing this! 
Q6: On trans visibility and customer-service voice: Yeah, you're picking up my meaning on the voice thing -- for some reason I always talked in a way higher voice at work, so that was the part that took me the longest to get rid of when I was training myself to speak lower??? It could be unique to me, though, lol. And on trans-ness in school, I definitely agree that the numbers will go up -- I remember seeing almost no trans visibility when I was in high school (maybe one kid was trans??? and there was one who was gay??? but it was never, like, discussed at all??? which is better than bullying them, of course, but it was sort of a neutral tone rather than a positive support of them, if that makes sense) but I visited my old school last summer and found that they'd started an entire LGBTQIA+ group and I met like five other enbies in one sitting and a bunch of other happy queer kids who were all handing out buttons and advocating for neutral bathrooms and stuff around the building and it was just -- it was so cool. I have no doubt that that positivity will spread as the years go by. QwQ
A: Yeah, that's true. I hope it does, because it needs more positivity all around!!!! 
Q7: On ""business"": My bad, I meant ""busyness"" as in ""my being busy"" lol! And yeah, I've heard rumblings that they could do other video chats in the future, but I'm not sure anything's finalized yet? I'll let you know if I get any emails about it!
A: Yeah, I got an email about a survey about if they should do it again (and so far she said it's been positive feedback!) and I spoke to Juliet about it as well :)
Q8: Quote of the day: A G R E E D
A: Thanks! 
Q9: What were my favourite cartoons growing up? This is a tough one, becaus I watched a lot of TV growing up but we had very few good channels to choose from -- so I was mostly stuck with whatever was on YTV when I was little? Which I guess would translate to, like, early Spongebob, the occasional Pokemon episode when it happened to air at a convenient time for me, aaaand some other ones that I remember just ran all the time so I ended up watching them, like iCarly and such? I'm not sure I ever had a strict 'favourite' because there were so few shows to choose from, but I appreciated whatever would entertain me at the time (usually while I ignored it to play video games anyway!).
A: Hey hey, that's pretty cool! Spongebob is (I guess) full of nostalgia!! Pokemon is cool too! iCarly was too at some point I think -- apparently they made a reboot and it's not really the same as it was before lol. And iCarly became such a meme over the years as well!
Q10: Would I rather have invisibility or super speed? This depends on the details of the power! If super speed was, like, ""you can do anything you want way faster, but without making the sort of mistakes that you usually make when you try to rush through things"" then I would take the speed power 100% -- I never feel like I have enough time in life to get anything done, and to stretch out my days way further and have more time to do the things I enjoy (albeit faster!) then I would love to. BUT. If the super speed is like ""you can do things faster but you're rushing and not enjoying/noticing anything the whole time and you feel like you're in a constant rush every time you use it"" then I'd infinitely rather not have that power, because it would just be a constant temptation to do the stuff I care about, worse, with less relaxation than I already have (which isn't much, because my brain already goes pretty fast sometimes!!!). In that case, I think invisibility would be a really cool power, because it's sort of synonymous with slowing down and being sneaky -- I could do for quiet walks through the woods and see all the animals that are normally afraid of me, or sneak into the movies and stand in the back and see what's worth buying a ticket and popcorn for instead of winging it, or just enjoy getting to wander around and see the world from a new perspective!
A: That's true lol. Speed could do some good I think -- you could get to places faster!! And invisibillity is cool too -- you could go for quiet walks in the woods and sing with the birds!!! :p

On dating things (and snow!): Hey, I feel that, things turn out that way all the time -- and it was brave of you to share your feelings either way, and definitely an act of love and growth to be able to respect her in turn and to care about her as a person regardless of her status as a friend or partner. I'm proud of you for this! QwQ And yessss, it's freezing out here right now -- probably too cold for extra snow, tbh, but we've had the same batch just frozen on the ground for months and it never seems to go away, so we get all the fun of trudging through it and none of the days off, haha. (And I'm glad that I can help, thank you!!! QwQ)
On trans visibility and customer-service voice: Yeah, you're picking up my meaning on the voice thing -- for some reason I always talked in a way higher voice at work, so that was the part that took me the longest to get rid of when I was training myself to speak lower??? It could be unique to me, though, lol. And on trans-ness in school, I definitely agree that the numbers will go up -- I remember seeing almost no trans visibility when I was in high school (maybe one kid was trans??? and there was one who was gay??? but it was never, like, discussed at all??? which is better than bullying them, of course, but it was sort of a neutral tone rather than a positive support of them, if that makes sense) but I visited my old school last summer and found that they'd started an entire LGBTQIA+ group and I met like five other enbies in one sitting and a bunch of other happy queer kids who were all handing out buttons and advocating for neutral bathrooms and stuff around the building and it was just -- it was so cool. I have no doubt that that positivity will spread as the years go by. QwQ 
  
  
On ""business"": My bad, I meant ""busyness"" as in ""my being busy"" lol! And yeah, I've heard rumblings that they could do other video chats in the future, but I'm not sure anything's finalized yet? I'll let you know if I get any emails about it!
Quote of the day: A G R E E D
What were my favourite cartoons growing up? This is a tough one, becaus I watched a lot of TV growing up but we had very few good channels to choose from -- so I was mostly stuck with whatever was on YTV when I was little? Which I guess would translate to, like, early Spongebob, the occasional Pokemon episode when it happened to air at a convenient time for me, aaaand some other ones that I remember just ran all the time so I ended up watching them, like iCarly and such? I'm not sure I ever had a strict 'favourite' because there were so few shows to choose from, but I appreciated whatever would entertain me at the time (usually while I ignored it to play video games anyway!).
Would I rather have invisibility or super speed? This depends on the details of the power! If super speed was, like, ""you can do anything you want way faster, but without making the sort of mistakes that you usually make when you try to rush through things"" then I would take the speed power 100% -- I never feel like I have enough time in life to get anything done, and to stretch out my days way further and have more time to do the things I enjoy (albeit faster!) then I would love to. BUT. If the super speed is like ""you can do things faster but you're rushing and not enjoying/noticing anything the whole time and you feel like you're in a constant rush every time you use it"" then I'd infinitely rather not have that power, because it would just be a constant temptation to do the stuff I care about, worse, with less relaxation than I already have (which isn't much, because my brain already goes pretty fast sometimes!!!). In that case, I think invisibility would be a really cool power, because it's sort of synonymous with slowing down and being sneaky -- I could do for quiet walks through the woods and see all the animals that are normally afraid of me, or sneak into the movies and stand in the back and see what's worth buying a ticket and popcorn for instead of winging it, or just enjoy getting to wander around and see the world from a new perspective!",mentor

Q1: In my experience, starting anxiety meds was one of the best things I ever did -- probably in no small part because they kinda sorta helped with the ADHD symptoms I didn't know I had, too. I started because I was, like you, really stressed in all sorts of areas of life; panicking (plus ADHD symptoms cough cough) got in the way of doing school stuff on time, so I was really freaked out doing all of my assignments last minute, plus I had a lot of emotional dysregulation to deal with (another thing I later realized was ADHD) that was making it difficult to relate to family members and keep my cool in a general sense... so for me, it was very much worth the downtime of being sick and adjusting to them in order to get to a place where I was suddenly a lot calmer and more capable of handling my feelings and intentions in life! But that's not the only path to handling anxiety if you're struggling with it -- finding a professional counsellor/therapist/etc to talk to can help you learn coping strategies that you can perform regardless of meds, and things like meditation still help me a great deal. I think the path that's best for any one person dealing with stress is bound to be different -- for me it was really chemical/brain stuff that I found I couldn't handle without taking a medication approach, but if anxiety is something you struggle with consistently (or even intermittently but in a way that makes you feel like you really can't handle it when it pops up) then I would recommend looking into the whole gamut of options and seeing which one(s) you're most comfortable with! Have you talked to anyone in your family you trust about it or looked up resources yourself?
A: That's true, and I guess in the best way it is ideal. I don't know if I have talked to them about it, conversations usually get heated whenever we drag on topics like that so I try my best not to bring it up all the time. But I do bring it up sometimes however. I try to look at resources whenever possible I guess. Chemical brain stuff? Science? 
Q2: On acid reflux: I have, although not to a really horrible extent -- I think as a teenager my diet contributed to some reflux that, for me, wasn't necessarily painful the grand majority of the time but had the consequence of making me clear my throat constantly? I had classmates ask if I had vocal tics because I did it so often, but I think it was just the back of my throat being bugged by it (and it seems to have largely gone away since I moved out and started cooking healthier, until I eat a bunch of sugar and then it starts back up again). My mum had it really bad, though -- she ended up getting burns in her throat for years that they had to stop via a surgical procedure that wrapped her esophagus around her stomach, such that the acid physically couldn't flow upward anymore... which is a super extreme case, I'll admit, so almost definitely not representative of most folks. Why do you ask?
A: Sorry, that's my mistake. I guess I'm just curious (I have a curious brain, so you might want to keep that in mind.) and also I sorta have it myself. Awh, sorry about her. Hope she's okay. That's a really long journey. She sounds like a strong and brave person, I would never be able to build myself to be brave, strong or courageous, y'know.
Q3: On families and distance: This is also true!!! I think it's harder on my mum because she spent most of my childhood as a single parent and pretty exclusively in my company -- so when I moved away, it was a really big shock to her system, whereas for my step-dad, he was used to having a few kids and they all moved out closer to him for the most part, so while he still misses me to death I think he copes with the distance a bit better? All down to what you and your folks are used to in terms of proximity!
A: I guess so, when you think about it that way. Oh yeah. So it was all like one big family pretty much? I guess so, because I don't exactly get along with my dad anymore so we drifted apart and I would only talk to him from time to time. I don't know how much longer it's gonna go on, but heaven knows. Sorry you had to read this, but I thought I would tell the truth and possibly vent as well. I just don't really like lying about my life to people and being phony all the time. It just feels fake, if you know what I mean.
Q4: On doctor switching: Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing at the onset -- do we like this one???
A: I don't really know, I've mostly forgotten all the previous doctors I had before lol. So maybe I guess?
Q5: On prom and weather: I feel you on being busy prepping for big events like that -- just don't forget to take care of yourself along the way!!! And oi, we used to get rain all the time back on the Island; I used to really hate it then, but now that my weather is, like, 100% snow for at least half the year, I find rain doesn't bother me nearly as much, lol! (And a bonus note on resolutions: it's OK to make goals that you don't reach!!! I used to kick myself about this a lot because I used to believe in this all-or-nothing idea that if you Failed(c) to do 100% of the thing you set out to, then there was no point doing any of it... but really, I go out of my way to set goals I don't expect to attain now, because they can still motivate me to do 10 or 20 or 50 or 99% of the thing and that's still buckets more than I would have done without the initial inspiration!)
A: Thanks, you too! I'll be getting measured for my suit pretty soon :p And last year, I confessed to my best friend and told her I like her, but she didn't feel the same way but that's okay, y'know? It happens. Snow, must be freezing most of the time over there, huh? Actually there was a snowstorm in my city the other day and apparently the power went out for a while at school and we had the day off but we had the go back the next day lol. I like this a lot! Good for inspiration, you really are an aspiring mentor :)
Q6: On voice changes: I actually didn't have any voice effects from my (incredibly low and mostly concentrated wherever I put it rather than free-flowing throughout my whole system) hormones -- I lowered my voice consciously over time when I first came out and trained it to be natural, though! I think mine was always a bit low, but mostly I had to train out the instinct towards, like, ""customer service voice"" if that makes sense? Like, at home I would speak mostly like I do now, maybe a bit higher, but whenever I went to work I had to speak over this big freezer buzzing noise in front of my station, so I got into the habit of speaking in a higher register to cut through the noise... it took a looooong time to break that habit, haha.
A: Oh, I see. In my school, there's currently not really a lot of trans/non-binary students and staff, but their population will probably increase in the next couple years, but that's what I think. Oh, I don't really understand, but from what I've read so far, so by ""customer service voice"" like store-wise? Correct me if I'm wrong.
Q7: On music tastes: I vibe with this!!! Very cool!!!
A: Yeah, I found out about R&B music I believe when I was either in elementary or in middle school.
Q8: On ocarinas: Ayy!!! I admit most of what I've seen of ocarina videos has been people learning how to play the songs from the video game that inspired me to start learning it, but I'm glad you're exploring and I hope you found some neat music! :P
A: Yeah, it's pretty cool what you've told me about lol. Ocarina sounds like whistling though haha!! 
Q9: On the quote of the day: I approve of this message completely yesssssss
A: That's good! 
Q10: Would I rather be 4 feet or 10 feet tall? I think, if nothing else in my life changed at all, being 4 feet tall would be way more convenient to my existence; most buildings/rooms/etc are built for people up to maybe 6 and a half feet tall, so past that you'd run into constant social issues trying to fit in and access basic services, and while I don't mind standing out -- I'm very much used to it haha -- I don't think that being 10 feet tall would offer me enough actual benefits to be worth the extra inconvenience (as opposed to, like, ""would you like to be able to fly BUT you have to deal with having really big wings on your back that make it hard to fit into most cars/through doors/etc?"", which I think I would consider depending on how far I could fly, if that makes sense).
A: True that lol, I guess it adds up, eh? Oh lol -- I forgot about the doors/cars/etc! I am forgetful. Yeah, I think I get where you're coming from ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q11: On Zooming and anxiety and meds and aaaaa: Oi, no worries about awkwardness or business or shortness of answers at all!!! I'm just glad that school was/continues to be going well and that we had a chance to meet up and, hey, it sounds like you're having a lot of fun between brownies and guitar stuff and family-ing it up, so no complaints! QwQ I'm feeling a fair bit better now, too, as the pills settle down! 
A: Well hey, after all it was my first time lol. I made crepes lol. Good to hear you're doing better! The dinner went good :D What business? But otherwise it was super cool to meet you in video chat! There might be another video chat meeting sometime soon but not sure yet!

Happy National Mentoring Month!!! Thank you for your patience with me, I know I haven't been around in a bit; getting back into the swing of things at school has taken up a lot of my time and energy and I'm kinda sorta going through a medication change to try and deal with anxiety (which, while definitely a good thing to be doing, has the un-fun side effect of making you feel gross for a while while you wait for your body to get used to the new dose) -- but we will prevail!!! I'm looking forward to meeting you on the Zoom thing tomorrow too! :D
No worries, I was busy with school and all (I had a guitar test and it surprisingly turned out good! The song I did was ""Put Your Head on My Shoulder"" lol.) And also I was making a lot of goods at school (I made brownies on Friday!) Oh no, I'm sorry to hear about that. I do not know what it is like to take anxiety meds but I have been stressing a lot. Hope all goes well. And also my answers will be pretty short, because I am going out for dinner haha :p
Q1: On vacations, Christmas, and resolutions: Cancun was pretty hype!!! Bit of whiplash getting back to this wintery weather though, lol. It would be really exciting to get out and see relatives, I imagine!!! And congrats on the Chromebook, I think I used to have one of those -- it was really freeing for me getting my own computer and being able to do research whenever I wanted... but also, don't let it suck you in too much, remember to unplug sometimes and spend time with your family! QwQ As for resolutions, that's actually not a bad answer -- statistically, goals are more likely to be achieved when you WANT to achieve them, not just when an arbitrary date comes up. Good on you for holding off until you know what you want to do! 
A: Thanks, I will try my best to unplug sometimes. I think Prom is gonna occupy me for a while lol. Yeah, the weather has been acting up in my hometown right now but no more snow. Just wind, overcastiness and rain galore! (If you were in my hometown, you would probably be sick of the rain so much you will look out the window and start singing ""Rain rain, go away!"") Yeah, I just do not like to have resolutions because I know I may forget to do them or I might not do them at all. 
Q2: On doctor-switching and hormones: 3-5 times is a lot of swapping doctors! I've heard that's more of a thing in rural areas, but I never realized how much so... as for me, I only switched doctors once before I moved, to find a doc more sympathetic to my gender needs, and she was the one who got me on hormones -- which isn't really necessarily just one treatment, because what kind of hormones folks go on to change their bodies for transition purposes can look really different from person to person? I have other non-binary friends who are on really strong hormones that have drastically changed how they look, but I'm personally only using a really small topical dose to target specific areas of dysphoria for me without changing too much of how the rest of my body looks. So for me, it's not ""like"" much at all tbh, because it's been so minimal -- although the changes I have had have made me very very happy, so I'd say it's nothing but positive in my experience! -- but I've heard that it can be a really big difference for others who are on stronger hormones and have to deal with a bunch of changes all at once. I have a friend who's a trans woman and she's described her experience as pretty much a whole second round of puberty, so I'm guessing for her it's probably come with more inconveniences and side effects and monitoring -- but she's also just incredibly happy with the results, so like, no complaints honestly!!!
A: Oh yeah. That's cool! Did your voice change during hormone therapy or was it the other way around? I'm just curious lol. Oh congratulations to her! She is strong, that's for sure! Hope she is doing good :)
Q3: On Winterfest: Yes, that sounds just like Light-Up!!! I love those sorts of events -- especially the snacks and hot chocolate, haha.
A: Totally cool! 
Q4: On flight delays: I'm not sure who's still stuck or not (I'd really hope everyone would be home by now!!!), but I did hear a great deal about WestJet and airlines flying out of certain airports (Vancouver? Calgary?) having BIG issues over the holidays... really hoping it's resolved for everyone! And I'm glad to hear that everything went well with the doctor -- I feel you on not enjoying the bloodwork (and to be honest I ended up dodging mine entirely because I didn't feel like it was necessary in my specific situation!), but it's good to have the reassurance, at least! QwQ
A: Yeh, it was all over the news and airlines were getting ""sued"" and criticized pretty much. But I do hope they get home too. 
Q5: On parenting styles: Oh, absolutely!!! And it's not like you're ever going to feel prepared whether you are or not -- like, no matter who you are, you're still a young person going out into the world for the first time, and being told ""congrats! you're an adult now!"" means, like, nothing??? Nothing, haha. I was encouraged to do some saving for university in high school -- and spent a very long time at a job I would have liked to quit much sooner in order to do it, admittedly -- and while I'm glad that I did, it's still a great deal of luck and scholarships that actually got me where I am, and I can't discount that at all. And no kidding on being closer to family -- there are a lot of folks I just didn't get to see this year and I miss them. QwQ But it was still a good vacation!
A: I guess it depends on the family I guess. Some families are good with it, some are different. 
Q6: On Universal Studios: Well, I didn't go alone, so I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted before everyone else got tired (lol) but I got to see some of the Harry Potter World stuff that they had set up! They had a Hogwarts exhibit and one of those 4D chair rides and everything, which was pretty neat. Also went through the Jurassic Park water rafting ride (where they have a big animatronic tyrannosaur lean down and pretend to try and eat you before the last waterfall, which is very well done) and I think we went through a horror exhibit (which isn't my favourite but thankfully it was so crowded that there wasn't enough room for anything to be scary???). All in all, it was a VERY busy day, but worth it... though I'm not entirely sure why people end up getting season passes to go over and over and over again, because once you've Had the Experience(c), I feel like it might not have as much repeat value over time???
A: That's pretty cool! Extremely :D
Q7: What's my favourite music genre? I don't think I have a favourite! My tastes are pretty broad, everything from video game music to rock to pop to lofi and classical and country and rap and jazz and everything in between -- I'm genuinely not sure I could pick one! Do you have a solid favourite???
A: Ayo, that's cool! Ehhh, I'd say R&B, pop, and I guess lofi too :p 
See you tomorrow aaaaaaa!!!
A: You too!!!
And also I found this YouTube video on ocarinas and it's pretty cool!

On Universal Studios: Well, I didn't go alone, so I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted before everyone else got tired (lol) but I got to see some of the Harry Potter World stuff that they had set up! They had a Hogwarts exhibit and one of those 4D chair rides and everything, which was pretty neat. Also went through the Jurassic Park water rafting ride (where they have a big animatronic tyrannosaur lean down and pretend to try and eat you before the last waterfall, which is very well done) and I think we went through a horror exhibit (which isn't my favourite but thankfully it was so crowded that there wasn't enough room for anything to be scary???). All in all, it was a VERY busy day, but worth it... though I'm not entirely sure why people end up getting season passes to go over and over and over again, because once you've Had the Experience(c), I feel like it might not have as much repeat value over time???
On parenting styles: Oh, absolutely!!! And it's not like you're ever going to feel prepared whether you are or not -- like, no matter who you are, you're still a young person going out into the world for the first time, and being told ""congrats! you're an adult now!"" means, like, nothing??? Nothing, haha. I was encouraged to do some saving for university in high school -- and spent a very long time at a job I would have liked to quit much sooner in order to do it, admittedly -- and while I'm glad that I did, it's still a great deal of luck and scholarships that actually got me where I am, and I can't discount that at all. And no kidding on being closer to family -- there are a lot of folks I just didn't get to see this year and I miss them. QwQ But it was still a good vacation!
What's my favourite music genre? I don't think I have a favourite! My tastes are pretty broad, everything from video game music to rock to pop to lofi and classical and country and rap and jazz and everything in between -- I'm genuinely not sure I could pick one! Do you have a solid favourite???

Q1: On finding ""home"": It definitely takes time to figure out what ""home"" means -- I'm still not entirely sure I've figured that out! It's a complicated mix of factors that means different things to different people, I guess. Like, being a settler Canadian for example, I have a tenuous relationship with 'belonging' on territories that weren't necessarily mine to belong on, so even in BC where I felt at home, I recognize that that looks and feels different for me than it would for someone with a stronger connection to the actual land/ecosystem. And yet, when I moved out to Saskatchewan, that also felt like discovering home because this is where my family migrated from when my grandma was little -- so I've sort of found a generational connection to the territory around me in that way (colonial and problematic though it continues to be -- I'm still working that part out!). Home can be so much -- where you are, why you're there, who you know, who really knows you... I'm not sure there's ever a one-size-fits-all definition!
A: Oh, that's cool! I don't think I've heard the term before, but I immigrated to Canada with my mom when I was a year old. That is very true! And also it's about the memories we make there as well. I guess it's not just the connections we make there, but what we learn from our surroundings too!
Q2:  On world politics and seeing elephants: That is indeed how the world is -- thankfully people who see that as the injustice it is are growing up and will hopefully one day be able to steer things in a better direction than our forebears. QwQ I have never seen an elephant in real life -- that is very, very cool!!!
A: Yeah, I hope the world becomes a better place in the future! Yeah, it's really awesome!! :D
Q3:  On having class-schedule variety: I actually think that system of learning sounds like it could be really productive??? Like, you're probably less likely to get bored with what you're doing, because it's only ten weeks, but then you also don't have too many subjects all at once piling homework up on you! But then, I suppose they're probably way more condensed classes as a result of that timeframe, so maybe it all balances out... have you found it good or bad or somewhere in between, in your learning experience?
A: Yeah, it was structured like that since this year I believe? Last year, I think it was only one class a day for 5 weeks lol. Yeah, before COVID hit, it was 5 classes a day (which most people couldn't handle!) 
Q4: On chard and bulk-cooking: I definitely have never eaten it raw and so do not use it for salad -- I think it's less like a lettuce and more in the same class as cabbage, where the leaves are a lot to digest if you don't break it down with boiling first??? I could be wrong, though. And as for bulk-cooking... I recommend anything that will freeze, as long as it's enough variety to keep you from getting bored (eg. if you eat meat, then I'd recommend choosing three dishes with all different meats, or if you have two that overlap, making sure they're prepared in really different ways/with different flavours)! I just grabbed groceries for my next few weeks, for example: I'm making a family pack of chicken (8+ meals, seasoning the chicken three or four different ways so I'm not just eating the same food over and over) with steamed broccoli and carrots (not super interesting but healthy and I like them), a beef stew with veggies and mini potatoes (which most people think you can't freeze, because potatoes sort of hold water and end up gushy once they've been frozen, but I've found that if you defrost your food in the microwave and take it out a couple times along the way and prick/squish the water out of the potatoes, they turn out pretty normal!), and cabbage rolls with some kinda Knorr rice on the side (mostly an excuse to use up my Knorr packs that've been sitting in the cupboard for quite some time, haha). Once I've cooked everything up and done all the veggies to go with each dish, I cool them completely and then I pre-portion them into Rubbermaid containers (so each one has a dinner's worth of food all ready to go) to stack in the freezer. Saves on a ton of dishes/cooking mess/etc for 2-3 weeks!
A: Oh haha! I thought about lettuce for a second, I looked it up and it sorta looked reddish-purple? Oh that's a lot of food for bulk-cooking! And it sounds healthy too! Definitely gonna try and start eating healthy after my bloodwork. 
Q5: On surfing: I'm suddenly jealous that I never knew in time to try this, haha!
A: It's pretty cool but be careful!
Q6:  On schoolening: Thank you, I believe in you!!!!!! QwQ
A: Thanks!! :D
Q7: On whistling: I can whistle any song I've heard/can remember! It's not a tune-specific skill like piano or guitar (where you have to, like, learn A Song and then practice That One Song until you can get it right) so much as just being able to produce any note at will as long as it's within my range!
A: That's pretty cool! Yeah, the guitar and piano are pretty hard depending on skill! I just learned how to play ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and I am just learning how to play ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" on guitar! Cool that you can whistle anything!!! Do you usually whistle when you're out and about or just at home when doing stuff? And also do you usually whistle along to the radio or freestyle? ツ 
Qs of the day:
1) What's my favourite thing to do in the summer?: Until very recently, I would have said to stay indoors -- but I've actually grown quite an appreciation for getting out and walking/biking when the weather's nice, now that I know how and have new trails to do it! I'm not much of a beach person, but I really appreciate fresh air.
A: That's cool, I don't blame you! I haven't travelled anywhere in a while (especially since COVID lol.) 
2)  What's my favourite animal? Cats!!!
A: Awh, that's cute!!
3)  What's my favourite Christmas movie? Elf!!!
A: That's a pretty nice movie lol. 
4) What's a new hobby of mine that I've tried (and presumably liked)? I recently bought some book-nook-making kits (they're sort of like when you construct dollhouses, but for book/sized boxes open on one side that you sit on a bookshelf alongside all your books and it's like a little world in there and lights up and stuff!) and I've been finding them very satisfying!!! Something about getting a bunch of random pieces laser-cut out of plywood boards and just getting to snap them out and put them together one by one until they make something awesome... this is not a promotion of you spending your money, but since it's not a social media account of mine or anything I think I should be okay sending you the link to the product page so you can see what I'm working on! https://www.robotimeonline.com/collections/diy-book-nook/products/rolife-stories-in-books-series-book-nook-diy-miniature-house-4-sets?spm=..collection_db7b5007-32ec-457f-b7be-9d2cda7c9b10.collection_1.5&spm_prev=..index.header_1.1 I've done the two on the right and have the other two to go -- they're so cool!!!
A: That's pretty cool!!! I don't think I've heard anything like this -- so it's like building things? Super neat!! 
5)  On paper-making: Yes!!! I first heard about paper-making in one of my university classes early this year (it was on the history of the written word/books/manufacturing thereof -- covered everything from ancient Greece to how people in the 1800s made ink out of tree knots and how modern fonts are designed, very dense but very very interesting!) and quickly realized it's, like, one of those weird hobbies that apparently tons of people are into! You make paper by taking your old scraps (usually pre-used paper, but apparently fabric scraps and even dryer lint is supposed to work???), blending them up with a bunch of water and compressing the resulting pulp onto a mould and deckle (which, in my case, is two picture frames with the glass removed and a mesh sheet across one of them, so I can pour the sludge onto the frame with the mesh, put the other one on top, and flip it over onto a towel and squish all the water back out with sponges -- which is a mess, but a fun mess!). Then you just leave it compressed between towels/etc to dry until you have new, albeit slightly lumpy, sheets of paper! I've been experimenting with adding decorative beads/leaves/feathers/etc and paint to change the colour. I don't do this often right now (because it makes a mess and takes up my apartment), but I thought it was a pretty cool side-hobby!
A: Whoa, that's really neat!!!! I have never made paper before! I don't blame you for that, sounds pretty messy! Awesome side-hobby!

Q1: On living in one place: I think there are some nice benefits to not moving a great deal, at least in terms of familiarity -- you come to know what ""home"" feels like and you know your community, eh? I kind of miss that here sometimes. But on the flipside, I also felt kind of stagnant where I lived, probably because everyone knew me and then I transitioned and still had to deal with everyone knowing me as I was previously and all of the weirdness that entailed??? And it's genuinely good to have some space to work out who I am in the absence of the life-long environmental influences of my hometown/etc. So I guess staying still and moving can be healthy in their own ways!
A: Yeah, that's true! I guess it takes time to find a place where you can call ""home"" and to feel like yourself and I guess a place of reflection and memory? I don't really know, but I can say that basically anywhere that you could go can be called ""home."" 
Q2: On questions: Yes, you're free to ask me just about anything, I think? With the obvious caveats that we don't share personal info, talk about doing illegal things, or discuss anything particularly inappropriate, and that I'm professionally obliged to tell people if you're in danger or if you're putting others or yourself in danger, all the basic ethical rules of the platform. But like, for real, I'm here to help you learn stuff about life, so if life is out there being spooky and unknowable and you want advice on something that isn't in one of the units, I'm totally here for it!
A: No worries, I usually do not like to ask questions like that as I know that it can cause consequences. 
Q3: On tutoring: I actually don't have a set list of clients! It's not so much a one-on-one thing like you and I are doing here, where folks get paired up and actually get to know each other; it's more like a drop-in thing where a few tutors are available to help with whatever a student brings in that day, and then we're just paired up for half an hour or so while whichever tutor knows the most about X topic helps the student work out the kinks in their paper, and then... well, maybe after that I never get to see that student again, or maybe they really like what I do in particular and make an effort to show up on my shifts when they need help with other assignments in the future, but for the most part it's a one-and-done kind of job. I still try to be personal with people, though -- I really feel like that aspect is lacking, particularly because of our random-drop-in system where we don't build distinct rapport with particular folks most of the time. But I guess it also means that I get to help a lot more people, overall, so maybe it's the best system they've got for writing help? Blasting music is strictly prohibited in any case, lol!!!
Q3:  On Sri Lanka: Sucks to hear that politics have once again ruined good things... I'm sorry to hear that, but unfortunately not surprised. QwQ Admittedly I had to look up the particular district because I hadn't heard of that, but it looks lovely from the distance that the Internet provides -- I see a bird sanctuary and that's all I'd need! Do you remember anything from back when it was still 'nice,' or was that before your time?
A: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's just how the world is. It's pretty difficult. Oh the bird sanctuary sounds neat! I remember we used to see elephants and I think that's all I remember for now! 
Q4: On tutoring: I actually don't have a set list of clients! It's not so much a one-on-one thing like you and I are doing here, where folks get paired up and actually get to know each other; it's more like a drop-in thing where a few tutors are available to help with whatever a student brings in that day, and then we're just paired up for half an hour or so while whichever tutor knows the most about X topic helps the student work out the kinks in their paper, and then... well, maybe after that I never get to see that student again, or maybe they really like what I do in particular and make an effort to show up on my shifts when they need help with other assignments in the future, but for the most part it's a one-and-done kind of job.

A: Oh that's nice, hope it's going well! That's true, homework must be done!! 
Q7:  On cooking: Pumpkin spice latte cake sounds so good!!!!! I think I made pretzels once, but I've definitely never made a cake like that... jealous. :P It sounds like you're enjoying new hobbies early, which can be really refreshing if you've had A Lot of the Same Stuff day in and day out throughout the rest of high school -- good for you!!!
A: Pumpkin spice late cake is really good!! You should definitely give it a try! And guitar is very cool but complicated! And actually, at my school, we are in two classes for ten weeks, then in the next quarter, we get two different classes - it's weird and doesn't make much sense - but we get through it! Thanks I appreciate it! 
Q8: On the many many questions: 
What would I say to someone having a bad day?: Depends on what kind of bad day, to be honest -- but in general, I like to remind people (wherever appropriate!) that life goes on, that a lot of the things that really hurt us now can end up making us much stronger and more resilient people in the end, that it's OK to be sad and it's also OK to let go of being sad when you're ready (because feeling like you Have to Be Sad about something as an obligation never feels good), and that while it's OK to have a bad day, if every day is a bad day, then I always encourage them to talk to someone about it. Legitimately, I've seen so many people in my life with mental health issues who just kind of don't realize that they deserve to not have to live with their symptoms, or that they even can have a life without that extra burden, and sometimes just being a person who says ""hey you know you CAN get help/talk to someone/do X thing you're afraid of and it's OK to do that"" is all they need to actually reach out and get meds or therapy or start whatever new chapter of their lives they've been putting off out of sheer anxiety. I do it a lot as a tutor and I try to do it a lot as a friend. I hope it helps them. QwQ
A: I really like what you said here - the wall of compassion! You are a compassionate and a generous positive role model and my wish for you is to continue doing it in the future! 
2) There's surfing in Tofino??? Really??? I'd never thought about that, but I guess it's possible. They do have some really nice beaches up there...
A: Yep, I believe so!! Not 100 percent sure lol! My family and I know some family-friends that went to Tofino one summer and got to learn how to surf! That sure is awesome! 
3) Chard is a leafy green vegetable with a red stem that looks... uhhhhh... kind of like a darker, slightly wilted version of green leaf lettuce? It sounds bizarre when I try to describe it, but it's really good if you boil up the leaves until they're tender and then serve them hot with a little bit of white vinegar!
A: Oh that sounds interesting, never heard of it lol! Do you use it for salad? Also what do you recommend for bulk-cooking? It can be anything to be honest - I don't really mind at all haha! 
4) This must make for THE best family Christmas photos, haha -- you all match!!!
A: Yep, it's a tradition in my family! Even my friends tend to mention that my family and I matched lol! 
5) All things considered, I've been doing okay!!! I'm still very excited for the holidays, just have to, like, make it that far past all the school stuff in the way. Such is life! QwQ
A: That's good!! Glad to hear!! You can do it!!! I believe in ya :D
On names: That is actually such a cool name though??? I mightily approve!!! 
A: Thanks, it's pretty cool :p
6) When did I learn to whistle and why?: I kind of picked it up, over and over again, and then forgot repeatedly how to do it? Like, I swear I breathed funny one day, went ""oh that sounded like a whistle"" and then freaked out trying to keep doing it and couldn't make it happen again... and that happened, like, four times? And finally I had one random time when I accidentally whistled, then figured out how to keep doing it on purpose, and kind of just never stopped because I was afraid to forget again, haha!
A: Haha, that's awesome! I wonder if you know any tunes? That would've been awesome!!! 
You're so sweet!!! I do my best!!! QwQ And hey, you seem like a wonderful person yourself, and I'm sure that all of the humans who know you out there in the overworld treasure you very very much!!!
A: Awh, no worries, glad it made your day!!! Thanks I needed that!!! :D 
Qs-OTD: What's your favourite thing to do in the summer? What's your favourite animal? What's your favourite Christmas movie? What was a new hobby you have tried before?

Hi! It's okay, I guess it's a long flight back! Hope BC was fun! I wonder what it is like to live in Vancouver Island and Saskatchewan! And also I started my new classes actually (surprise lol!) which is cooking and guitar!! Thanks, my capstone went okay! There probably is lol. I like your profile picture, cool sign you have there lol! Yeah it does actually, I recently had a shower haha. 
BC was very fun!!! I got to see my grandma for the first time in a while and we did some painting and Netflix-watching, so no complaints over here! :D 
Living on Vancouver Island/in Saskatchewan have both been good experiences for me, but they're very very different ones!!! I'd say I liked the Island because the weather was nice, it had a lot of great scenic spots to drive through and stop for a visit in, and because it had a very contained atmosphere (as in, hard to get lost, I always felt 'familiar' with everywhere I went for the most part, etc). But Saskatchewan has been nice because cities have much more stuff to do, it's scenic in its own way, and the people are so friendly!!!
Cooking and guitar classes sound wonderful -- I wish I'd had the chance to learn guitar in high school! QwQ
Yeah, I meant other units of this course! Honestly, since it's not for a grade or anything now, I think I'll just open them all for you and you can look through them and see if there's anything that you want to discuss further -- it's a lot of good advice throughout, so I recommend giving it all a look, but feel free to hone in on whatever interests you!!! (Discussion questions are those weird pop-out pages that we Had To Do(c) for these two units, but aren't necessary for the rest -- though you're free to look at them if you want to know what kind of questions you can ask me??? Eh. I'm here to answer whatever, so again, totally up to you, haha.)
I have heard of Sri Lanka, though I've never been! Which did you prefer, the beaches or the temples? And how does it compare to where you're living now, if I may ask?
Generally speaking, tutoring is pretty quiet -- except when there are, like, three of us working and all answering questions at the same time because the room is small?? That's not bad though, a lot of times one of us will have a question we can't answer for a client so we just call across the room and go ""hey, who knows the answer to this???"" which is SO efficient not gonna lie--
Oi, if you love Indian food, then when you get to the Island you HAVE to check out Heritage Indian Cuisine in Duncan -- it's the best I've ever had!!!!
I love the existence of beaches, but don't visit them often; same with hiking, although I did once go on a REALLY cool hike where I got to spelunk through an underground cave!; I've never had the opportunity to surf (I'm not sure that's a thing on the Island??? our currents might not be good for it) and doubt I could ever balance on a surfboard, klutz that I am!; my favourite fruits aaaare strawberries, blueberries, plums, Mandarin oranges, and probably avocado, and I'm a really big fan of carrots, broccoli, and chard; and over Christmas, I've always really enjoyed the general feeling of togetherness and the morning activities above all! My parents have been separated pretty much my whole life, so the middle of Christmas Day was always hectic as I would travel from one house to the other to see both for the holidays -- but in the morning, Mum always had a tradition that we'd wake up late, wander out in our pajamas, open some VERY stuffed stockings and munch on chocolates while we waited on Christmas breakfast at my grandparents' place... and it was so peaceful. This year won't be nearly as relaxing, I expect, but I can still remember it fondly! QwQ How about you? Do you have any particular Christmas traditions?
Do you have a preference for Jen or Segués, or are both equally good with you? And how does one pronounce Segués? I've never heard of the name before, but it looks pretty!
And as for the bonus question: I already know how to ski, but snowboarding looks way heckin' harder to do and I guarantee I'd break my legs on the way down, so I'll stick with what I know, haha!!!",mentor

Hi! It's okay, I guess it's a long flight back! Hope BC was fun! I wonder what it is like to live in Vancouver Island and Saskatchewan! And also I started my new classes actually (surprise lol!) which is cooking and guitar!! Thanks, my capstone went okay! There probably is lol. I like your profile picture, cool sign you have there lol! Yeah it does actually, I recently had a shower haha. 
Are you talking about the other units? Sorry, my mind is blank this week lol! I guess we can give them a try, and I don't really understand what the discussion questions are lol. 
Q1: Mexico is indeed very hot -- a little too hot for my liking, honestly, but I'll do what I have to do to see Danish! -- and as for scholarship stuff........ yeaaaaah. It can honestly be really hard to keep up with the sheer amount of opportunities out there, and you never know how much of your effort is gonna pay off; I just spent weeks working on a scholarship package for grad money that didn't even end up forwarded to the agency for review! But it's still a good idea to put in as much effort as you can reasonably spend, so long as you're also spending that energy wisely (ie. maybe choosing one or two scholarships that take up a lot of time to do and really focusing on those, but also throwing your name into the running for all of the ones that are essentially just ""tell us you exist and we'll assess you alongside everyone else"" school-wide opportunities, so that you cover the widest possible area of potential funding... without applying for Literally Everything Ever while the rest of your schoolwork piles up in the background!).
A: Yeah, that's true. There's nothing wrong with that lol, I guess you just gotta roll with it and do stuff one at a time!! I am from Colombo. It's a city in Sri Lanka. And it's pretty hot there, maybe around 30 degrees celsius! I don't know if you have heard of Sri Lanka, but if you don't, it's a small island just below India and it's a pretty nice place! They have beaches and temples haha.
Q2: VIU's courses are indeed good! I've had a lot of fun with them. (Sometimes depends on the professor you get, though!)
A: That's cool! Maybe they are funny too? I guess courses are different lol.  
Q3: I think my hair uuuused to be curlier when I was little, but it was always fairly straight? I think it's too fine to hold curls, there isn't enough volume for them to really be visible even if it was naturally that way!
A: Aww, that sounds cool! I guess some peoples' hair get straighter when they go through changes? Lol :p
Q4: I don't have much freedom to make tutoring fun for my clients, but I'd like to think I keep things interesting -- and I'm always making sure to ask about their lives outside of the homework aspect, both because I want them to have a real conversational experience instead of a transaction and because I think it's really important to pay attention to the non-school things that end up really impacting one's school experiences! 
A: Yeah, true! Sounds interesting I guess! I don't blame you lol! I guess most people have a hard time with certain things. I'm assuming it's lot of work or pressure depending on the person. What's it usually like? Is it like noisy (like musically) or is it usually quiet? (*dramatic pause* silence lol) 
Q5: I love sweet food all the way omg--I like salt, but I could eat sugary things for days. And especially when they blood sugar gets low, it's always the sweets that I crave... probably a biological thing, seeing as my body knows that's what it's lacking? Surprisingly not super big on fast food, though... I'll go to McDonalds or Dairy Queen for the ice cream, but seldom do I actually enjoy the food! 
A: It's a treat lol! I love their vanilla chai (iced), it's the best! I don't really mind what I get anywhere, I mean it's food haha! I heard that VIU has a lot of restaurants nearby (from what I have researched!) I love Indian food too like butter chicken :D
Q6: I've never heard that about my name! I actually named myself after the brand of my first piano, so it has a lot of meaning for me, but linguistically I don't know if it happens to match up with anything else, haha. And as for questions: I'd rather wear denim, my fav cartoon was DEFINITELY Spongebob (I used to memorize whole episodes and recite them, not sure why), I have very fond memories of playing Pokemon games in the backseat on road trips when I was a kid (until it made me carsick lol), and I genuinely don't know if I have a favourite restaurant! Maybe a Mexican place on Vancouver Island called Gina's? It had really good wraps!
A: Yeah, apparently I found it online lol. It was moon in Spanish, pretty awesome! Denim is cool! SpongeBob is very funny indeed! I love tacos and wraps too! They are super good with salsa, hot sauce or a little bit of sour cream I think! I used to have Pokémon Go on my old iPad, but it didn't work super well lol. Oh, I didn't know you get carsick! I usually watch movies/TV shows or I just look at the outside view the whole time! 
Q7: Enby is just a stylized shorthand for ""nonbinary,"" which they used to type as ""NB"" until folks realized that that was already an acronym for something else and then ""enby"" became the standard way of typing it online I think???
A: Oh okay, thanks! It sounds new to me! I am still learning about more new LGBT terms!

Hello!!!! I swear I exist, I've just been so busy these last few days, sorry!!! QwQ After getting back home from BC, I've been hit with a whole bunch of Grad Student Obligations(c) that I think I've finally gotten sorted out, but it's definitely kept me away from my messages for a while -- I hope things have been going well with you!!! Really glad to hear about your capstone being done and out of the way, and even though I indeed cannot see this picture (possibly intercepted by site admins, I'm not sure if we have a rule against photos or not but maybe?)

Yeah, that's true! Good to hear you are doing well! My sticky situations are out of the way :D And my capstone is done!! My final exam was very exhausting lol! Thanks for stacking the questions Challen, makes more sense! 
 
Q1: On bursaries and scholarships: You'll be glad to know -- at least in my experience! -- that those tend to show up more at the beginning of degrees, by the way! Lots of universities have 'entrance scholarships' that they use to lure new students in and choose their institution over others, especially if you go in with high grades or extracurriculars that interest them. And there are sort of 'exit scholarships' when you leave high school, too, sometimes! (On the flipside, it can get harder to get the same amount of scholarship money later in a degree, once they know you're already committed to seeing your schooling through -- but with that said, I still snagged a few based on keeping up my grades/getting involved in outside-of-school stuff over the course of my degree, so it's not impossible!)
A: Yeah, that's true. It's just like swinging from vine to vine (if you know what I mean lol.) with scholarships and bursaries that are like, ""You have a bunch of opportunities! Don't keep them waiting!""
Q2: On relationships: It really is amazing!!! We have visited in person a couple times, too; this time last year was our first meet-up, actually, because Dane flew up for my last reading break and stayed with me for about a week, and then early this year (March I think???) I flew down to stay with him and his family for almost two weeks, and we've got our next visit in about a month because my mum and step-dad are flying to Cancun over the holidays, and they bought my ticket to join them over my break, so Dane and I went half and half on his so he could join us and meet my parents this time around! I'm so excited for it. QwQ And ayy, that sounds lovely! I didn't really date in high school, so I actually also asked all my friends out to prom but just as a friend-group-there-to-consume-as-much-candy-as-possible-and-revel-in-our-mutual-inability-to-dance sort of thing; glad to see someone using prom for its intended purpose! :P
A: Yeah! I mean, it's pretty awesome when you think about it. Thanks! Ooh, Mexico sounds cool, I heard it's pretty hot over there and it's all around fun. My friend I believe went over there one year! 
Q3: On VIU: It's a lovely university and a really friendly community -- I'd highly recommend it if it's the closest one to you driving-wise and has a degree that suits your goals!!! As long as you don't mind stairs. It has lots of those, haha.
A: I did take a look at their website and emailed some of the team members and they said the courses were good so there's that lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Q4: On perms: Yoooo, I've never tried actually getting it curled on purpose -- I'm sure that looks awesome!!! And thanks! QwQ
A: It does! Oh, it's pretty cool but it's a pretty long process (mine took maybe around 3-4 hours?) And also was your hair naturally curly before? (e.g, maybe when you were a teen or a kid?) 
Q5: On whistling in the workplace: I'm the only one I've met who does it, but I'm sure I'm not the only person ever! Depends on the job, though -- I didn't mind making a little noise when I worked in a grocery store, but now that I do tutoring in a quiet room I have to keep myself in check, haha.
A: Do you make tutoring fun for students? You sound like the fun one haha. Oh that's nice, especially when you mentioned the worker and the customer whistle duo lol. And yeah, that's true, some people do get different reactions to whistling, but I ain't no expert lol! Whistling competitions?
Q6: On diabetes: I'm not diabetic, but I'm actually hypoglycaemic, which is a condition where I get low blood sugar! It's sort of the opposite of diabetes in that sense, but it also leads to it a lot because low blood sugar makes you really hungry and less picky about what you eat, so if not managed it can lead to a lot of impulsive junk foodening; I'd say that the best thing I've done to manage that is just... meal prep and make sure I eat on time? The best defence against blood sugar problems is to eat healthy food, and for me that means making sure that that's what's available for me when my blood sugar dips and I start craving -- but the best strategy is just to make sure I don't skip meals in the first place so that I'm never put in a state of under-sugared grossness!
A: Ay, that's smart! I hate those diabetic test needles (my mom uses them once in a while.) Do you usually crave sweet or salty (or both I'm guessing!) or are you a fast food lover? (e.g, McDonalds, A&W, Pizza Hut)
Q7: On food from around the world: I think I would try just about anything once -- I'd like to think I'm pretty open and adventurous, and I think it's silly to travel around the world just to look for the same experiences you have at home, honestly! -- but I'd saaaay the weirdest food I've ever tried is probably crickets? I went through a cricket flour phase where I would put it into all of my baked goods because it's honestly pretty healthy (good source of protein!) and gave things an interesting nutty flavour that was good in cookies, but it was kinda expensive and hard to find, so I don't have any in the cupboard right now, unfortunately! How about you?
A: Oh! That's pretty cool! I guess it never hurts to try new things? Lol :D
Q9: What does the name Challen mean?  I heard it meant moon in Spanish lol.

Hey how you doing? It's no problem. I understand, glad you made it safely. I've also been stuck in sticky situations lately as well, so we're in the same boat I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Hoi!!! I feel you on this, Everything Happens So Much in life sometimes. I'm glad to say I'm having a good time out here, but I'm also trying to keep up with school stuff the whole time and that can be a lot when you're out of your natural productive element, honestly -- although I think being home can also help in some ways, in that a change of pace can sometimes spur me onto changing my bad habits too, if that makes sense??? We'll see how much I get done around here, lol. How are your sticky situations going?
On bursaries and scholarships: You'll be glad to know -- at least in my experience! -- that those tend to show up more at the beginning of degrees, by the way!

Hey how you doing? It's no problem. I understand, glad you made it safely. I've also been stuck in sticky situations lately as well, so we're in the same boat I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Ima stack your questions so I can answer them (if that's okay.) 
Q1: I honestly couldn't say why my step-brother chose UVIC, except maybe that it had the program he wanted at the time? I remember him being pretty annoyed with the long drive, so I think that all of the closer schools didn't have his specific woodworking/joinery program on the roster. And I've definitely heard of Ivy League schools -- but I really feel like that's a lot more about Prestige(c) than quality of the actual program you get into, in my opinion, which means that although they might be perfect for your needs, you really have to decide whether or not the massive difference in cost is actually worth it??? Because, like, unless there's a specific supervisor that you want in a graduate program for, say, MA or PhD work, or there's really something special about the program being offered at the Ivy vs quote-unquote ""regular"" school, then the only real difference is how impressed people are when they see the name listed on your résumé later... but it doesn't always correspond to how good a school actually is in terms of the experience you have or the things that you learn. I'm embroiled in a lot of that right now, as I make the switch from wanting-to-be-a-high-school-teacher to wanting-to-be-a-university-professor, which is one of those jobs where prestige really seems to matter in terms of who will hire you later on, but I dunno, to me it seems like a lot of talk to get folks to pay more for essentially the same degree at the end, unless you're in a position like mine where your employers really really really care about it! And hey, no blame if being a teacher isn't your calling -- it's just the passion that I fell into, but I can definitely see why it wouldn't be for everyone, haha!
A: Oh that's cool! I could definitely say for the long drive, pretty exhausting lol. Yeah, I don't think me and my friends can see ourselves as teachers or professors in the future lol. And I guess it can be from a degree. If you are just thinking to start university or college, I guess that's where the bursaries and scholarships come in. 
Q2: Yeaaaaaah, that was my lesson learned re: not trusting everyone who's behind a desk to know how to do their job. Definitely make sure that you know what you're doing, and that they know what they're doing, before you sign anything!!!
A: Yeah, you're right as rain! Definitely smart!
Q3: How do we make a long-distance relationship work??? Good question. It's a tough one, sometimes, but Dane and I have made it probably about a year and a half by now and we're still going strong, so I guess it's working out for us! :P I think the most important things are 1) finding ways to still spend time with each other even though you're not physically in the same room, and 2) being really really really good communicators. For the first one, we're video-chatting on Discord every day, a lot of the time just at random to say hi but also on particular routines -- for example, we call every night before bed and fall asleep with the call still running (which is hard on my laptop, but I have an old one that I use specifically for this purpose!) so that when we wake up in the morning, we're still together, which is one of the main ways that we still get to feel present, and even if we have really busy days or our timezones are way off (like right now, from BC we're three hours apart!), we know we still get to have that time. It also helps to plan in-person visits (when we can afford it!!!) and to send gifts through the mail once in a while (which is what we did last year for birthdays/Christmas and such!). And as for communication -- well, ironically I think this is one of the things that we do better than most people because we're in a long-distance format that kinda forces us to talk to hang out (lol), but just... being honest about our lives and our feelings is really important! Because we don't see everything the other person is doing, all day every day, we can't always ""see"" how the other one's life is going from moment to moment, which makes it important to be honest when something is bugging either of us or if something is getting in the way of the relationship that isn't immediately obvious (eg. if someone's in a bad mood, it might be easy to assume that it's something the other did wrong, but in reality maybe work/school is just being sucky and that person needs extra support to feel better!). And, of course, figuring out what the future looks like for us takes a lot of talking, too -- it's hard to make things work if you don't ask the hard questions like ""Which one (or both) of us is going to leave their home country to be with the other?"" and ""When will that happen?"" and ""What will our life look like together, realistically, once we actually get the chance to test living in the same house?"" There's really a lot to it, but I think so far we've done super well!!! :D
A: That's amazing, that's an awesome relationship you have there! Have you guys ever visited in person? And also I am also planning to ask my friend out to prom next year :) 
Q3: I have never heard of a Mocha Cookie Crumble, but it sounds delicious actually??? I might have to give it a try!!! And hey, I used to be a MASSIVE fan of ice cream cake when I was a kid, now it hurts my teeth though-- QwQ
A: It's really good! And Vanilla Bean is one of my favourites too! And also they have refreshers as well (one of my favourites being the dragonfruit drink!) 
Q4: I have never learned the skill of beatboxing! How does it work?​​​​​​​
A: I honestly have no idea! But I started off by watching some YouTube videos, but my friend taught me how to beatbox over video call for the most part lol. 
Q5: The coldest cold I have ever experienced was definitely last winter -- it was my first one in Saskatchewan and I was bundled up in a big down jacket and heavy-duty boots and longjohns underneath my jeans to keep double-warm, the whole nine yards, but I had to walk across town to get a COVID test (that thankfully came up negative in the end!) and I just remember this blistering pain in my knees??? It turns out that it was SO cold that the tiny line of just-jeans-and-longjohns that was between the bottom of my jacket and the top of my boots turned painfully red long after I got home... which probably would have meant frostbite eventually if I didn't keep ducking into apartment lobbies and coffee shops along the trip to warm myself back up! Honestly never experienced anything like it in my life (and this year if I really need anything, I'm just gonna call an Uber!!!).
A: Ouch, hope you were okay during all that! I would not be able to survive in a deep freeze like that lol. And great that your COVID test came negative! I don't blame you on the Uber part lol.
Q6: Hey, the coworkers might hate it, but once in a while at my grocery job I used to get a customer across the store who's also good at whistling and then we could strike up a song and it was really lovely!!! :'D I'd really like to think that more people enjoyed it who just didn't acknowledge it out loud! And I DEFINITELY feel like it's better than pacing around freaking out, which was what half my coworkers did, sooooo maybe they could've learned a thing or two. ;)
A: That's nice! A worker and a customer duo haha. The other customers were probably applauding and yelling ""encore!"" Makes the day jazzier! Jazz and pop songs sound like a good idea! Great idea for your coworkers lol! It might make their day brighter :D Are you the only one who whistles in the workplace?
Q7: Oh that's cool! I already have curly hair since I got it permed over the summer haha. And yeah, either way, I think your hair would look great!

I remember him being pretty annoyed with the long drive, so I think that all of the closer schools didn't have his specific woodworking/joinery program on the roster. And I've definitely heard of Ivy League schools -- but I really feel like that's a lot more about Prestige(c) than quality of the actual program you get into, in my opinion, which means that although they might be perfect for your needs, you really have to decide whether or not the massive difference in cost is actually worth it??? Because, like, unless there's a specific supervisor that you want in a graduate program for, say, MA or PhD work, or there's really something special about the program being offered at the Ivy vs quote-unquote ""regular"" school, then the only real difference is how impressed people are when they see the name listed on your résumé later... but it doesn't always correspond to how good a school actually is in terms of the experience you have or the things that you learn. I'm embroiled in a lot of that right now, as I make the switch from wanting-to-be-a-high-school-teacher to wanting-to-be-a-university-professor, which is one of those jobs where prestige really seems to matter in terms of who will hire you later on, but I dunno, to me it seems like a lot of talk to get folks to pay more for essentially the same degree at the end, unless you're in a position like mine where your employers really really really care about it! And hey, no blame if being a teacher isn't your calling -- it's just the passion that I fell into, but I can definitely see why it wouldn't be for everyone, haha!
A: Oh that's cool! I could definitely say for the long drive, pretty exhausting lol. Yeah, I don't think me and my friends can see ourselves as teachers or professors in the future lol. And I guess it can be from a degree. If you are just thinking to start university or college, I guess that's where the bursaries and scholarships come in. 
Q2: Yeaaaaaah, that was my lesson learned re: not trusting everyone who's behind a desk to know how to do their job. Definitely make sure that you know what you're doing, and that they know what they're doing, before you sign anything!!!
A: Yeah, you're right as rain! Definitely smart!
Q3: How do we make a long-distance relationship work??? Good question. It's a tough one, sometimes, but Dane and I have made it probably about a year and a half by now and we're still going strong, so I guess it's working out for us! :P I think the most important things are 1) finding ways to still spend time with each other even though you're not physically in the same room, and 2) being really really really good communicators. For the first one, we're video-chatting on Discord every day, a lot of the time just at random to say hi but also on particular routines -- for example, we call every night before bed and fall asleep with the call still running (which is hard on my laptop, but I have an old one that I use specifically for this purpose!) so that when we wake up in the morning, we're still together, which is one of the main ways that we still get to feel present, and even if we have really busy days or our timezones are way off (like right now, from BC we're three hours apart!), we know we still get to have that time. It also helps to plan in-person visits (when we can afford it!!!) and to send gifts through the mail once in a while (which is what we did last year for birthdays/Christmas and such!). And as for communication -- well, ironically I think this is one of the things that we do better than most people because we're in a long-distance format that kinda forces us to talk to hang out (lol), but just... being honest about our lives and our feelings is really important! Because we don't see everything the other person is doing, all day every day, we can't always ""see"" how the other one's life is going from moment to moment, which makes it important to be honest when something is bugging either of us or if something is getting in the way of the relationship that isn't immediately obvious (eg. if someone's in a bad mood, it might be easy to assume that it's something the other did wrong, but in reality maybe work/school is just being sucky and that person needs extra support to feel better!). And, of course, figuring out what the future looks like for us takes a lot of talking, too -- it's hard to make things work if you don't ask the hard questions like ""Which one (or both) of us is going to leave their home country to be with the other?"" and ""When will that happen?"" and ""What will our life look like together, realistically, once we actually get the chance to test living in the same house?"" There's really a lot to it, but I think so far we've done super well!!! :D​​​​​​​
A: That's amazing, that's an awesome relationship you have there! Have you guys ever visited in person? And also I am also planning to ask my friend out to prom next year :) 
Q3: I have never heard of a Mocha Cookie Crumble, but it sounds delicious actually??? I might have to give it a try!!! And hey, I used to be a MASSIVE fan of ice cream cake when I was a kid, now it hurts my teeth though-- QwQ
Q4: I have never learned the skill of beatboxing! How does it work?​​​​​​​
A: I honestly have no idea! But I started off by watching some YouTube videos, but my friend mostly taught me how to beatbox lol. 
Q5: The coldest cold I have ever experienced was definitely last winter -- it was my first one in Saskatchewan and I was bundled up in a big down jacket and heavy-duty boots and longjohns underneath my jeans to keep double-warm, the whole nine yards, but I had to walk across town to get a COVID test (that thankfully came up negative in the end!) and I just remember this blistering pain in my knees??? It turns out that it was SO cold that the tiny line of just-jeans-and-longjohns that was between the bottom of my jacket and the top of my boots turned painfully red long after I got home... which probably would have meant frostbite eventually if I didn't keep ducking into apartment lobbies and coffee shops along the trip to warm myself back up! Honestly never experienced anything like it in my life (and this year if I really need anything, I'm just gonna call an Uber!!!).
A: Ouch, hope you were okay during all that! I would not be able to survive in a deep freeze like that lol. And great that your COVID test came negative! I don't blame you on the Uber part lol.
Q6: Hey, the coworkers might hate it, but once in a while at my grocery job I used to get a customer across the store who's also good at whistling and then we could strike up a song and it was really lovely!!! :'D I'd really like to think that more people enjoyed it who just didn't acknowledge it out loud! And I DEFINITELY feel like it's better than pacing around freaking out, which was what half my coworkers did, sooooo maybe they could've learned a thing or two. ;)
A: That's nice! A worker and a customer duo haha. The other customers were probably applauding and yelling ""encore!"" Makes the day jazzier! Jazz and pop songs sound like a good idea! Great idea for your coworkers lol! It might make their day brighter :D Are you the only one who whistles in the workplace?
Q7: Oh that's cool! I already have curly hair since I got it permed over the summer haha. And yeah, either way, I think your hair would look great!  
QOTD: What food would you try from around the world? If you don't have one or can't choose, what's the weirdest food combination you have tried before?",mentee

I am alive!!! Thank you for your patience -- I've actually had a heck of a time these last couple days packing, but I'm back on the Island for a week to visit family and it's been really lovely since I finally touched down! QwQ Just a lot of work to get here!!!

I think this depends on if I get to change the thickness of my hair as well -- it's pretty fine and thin, so I like that it has a wave to it when it gets a little longer, but if it was thicker I think it would look better with curls! Hbu?",mentor

This is the updated version since I didn't read the rest of your response lol.
 
Yeah, I guess so when it comes to most of the universities and what they offer in most campuses. Where I live right now, there's one college in town lol. 
Oh that's good! What interested him into going to UVIC? Also, I don't know if you have heard of Ivy League schools but they've been becoming the norm these days lol. And I didn't know you wanted to be a high school teacher. Most of my friends and I do not really want to become teachers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Oh, that's pretty bizarre haha. Definitely check what the requirements are for every career before you start the paperwork for it? That's just me though lol. 
Yeah, I guess it would be better then driving on icy roads. 
Oh, that's nice. Never heard of Bojack Horseman, but I guess it sounds cool. The jokes sounds funny lol. 
And also how did you make a long-distance relationship work? (you do not have to answer if you wish not to! I am just curious.)
Oh that's okay. I usually have Starbucks in the summer. (my favourite drink there is either the Mocha Cookie Crumble or Vanilla Bean!) 
I like Nanaimo bars too! And I like cake, ice cream, ice cream cake and other desserts :D
And also I've been learning how to beatbox, my friend has been teaching me how lol. 
But the annoyed coworkers thing though lol!! You're probably the ""mysterious whistler"" huh? They probably be like, ""Who's whistling super good? I wish I can whistle like that!"" (thought it can make your day!) And also it's better to ""whistle while you work"" rather than pacing around stressed out like, ""Oh my god, I have so much to do in one day, and I am so stressed out and tired. How am I gonna relax myself?"" (If you know what I mean.)

It's tough to plan when you don't know exactly where you're ending up -- I feel you on this! Thankfully, both are very good schools from what I've heard and even if you live in one place and commute to the other, it is certainly possible to get by (though I would definitely schedule half-weeks in that case!!!).
My step-brother did go to UVIC!!! It was for an eight-month trades program in cabinetry, so he wasn't there for a terribly long time (or particularly involved in campus life, so unfortunately I don't have any info there!) but he seemed happy with it! He wasn't super big on school -- really good at what he did, but he definitely wanted it over with, haha -- but didn't have any outstanding complaints about the place, at least???
For me, applying to VIU was fairly straightforward, because 1) my mum already knew how that all worked, having done it herself, and 2) I knew what I wanted to get into, so there wasn't a lot of meeting-with-career-counsellors or anything to contend with. However, I will say that the one big struggle that I faced -- and I have no idea how this happened, it was really bizarre and I probably should have asked more questions when I saw the desk people looked uncertain, in retrospect!!! -- was that I ended up In the Wrong Degree(c) for about a year; when I started, I wanted to be a high school teacher, but apparently the person who did my paperwork with me didn't realize that you needed to specifically be in a Bachelor of Arts program for that, so I spent my first while in a Bachelor of Education... which is only for teaching primary/middle school! So I guess that's my biggest piece of advice, right off the bat: make sure your paperwork gets done right, and that you know exactly what you have to take to get the job you wanna do! I was lucky in that I got about enough scholarship money to laugh about that extra year of school later, but like, for someone who was living paycheque to paycheque affording semesters, having at least ten classes' worth of credits that didn't count towards their degree at the end might be much more of a problem. As it is, I have no regrets about it and I'm actually glad the mix-up happened -- that year or so gave me time to take a bunch of electives, expand my horizons and realize that high school teaching wasn't what I wanted to do after all, so I'm really lucky to have had that time to reflect! -- but it's something to consider. Every school will probably mess up some of your paperwork along the line, so keep an eye on it. (The same goes with choosing courses from one year to the next -- they usually have a program online that'll say ""if this is your degree, here are the classes you need to take to graduate,"" but mine spat out the wrong courses more than once, so uh, actually go on the university curriculum website yourself and count your credits just in case!!!)
Yeaaaah, I'm not a fan of slush either (I DEFINITELY hated it while I was driving, that's one of the worst driving conditions you can have tbh) buuuut sometimes I'd take it over the ridiculously cold days, so??? It's a balancing act!
Oi, I've never actually seen the Zelda cartoon!!! I've heard it's hilarious, though. QwQ
I didn't know whistling had so many healthy properties??? That's so cool!!! (I mean, tell that to my annoyed coworkers along the way, but still, haha!)
Questions of the day:
1) I'm surprisingly meh about Starbucks, probably because I don't love coffee and they don't seem to ever just have... normal tea? Or meal-type food that I'm into. That's one of the things I prefer about Tim Hortons, if I have to choose -- they're a little cheaper and they make good sandwiches!
2) I think my favourite funny joke comes from a show called Bojack Horseman (which can actually be a generally very adult and rather depressing show, but it has some legitimately silly moments!) where one character, Wanda, who the show paints as kind of an airhead -- like, not thinking things all the way through a lot, doesn't seem to be fully aware of what's going on around her, etc etc -- tells Bojack two jokes, one at the beginning of the episode and one at the end, and they don't make sense until you put them together.
So at the beginning of the episode, Wanda asks Bojack if he wants to hear a joke, and he's like, sure, and she says:
Wanda: Okay, so there’s this gardener, right? So, the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking. Like, he gets it right every time. He's the best.
So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on, and he's like, ""18 bags."" So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work. And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing. Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies, beautiful orchid bushes.
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.
He can't believe it. This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy. He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch. He's like, ""Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"" 
So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101.
And Bojack is like... that's not a joke? It doesn't have a punchline?? You're stupid??? And she's just like, you'll get it later. And then, at the END of the episode, she asks him if he wants to hear ANOTHER joke, and he doesn't believe that she's capable of making a joke at this point or even knows what a joke is, but he's like, sure, whatever, and then we get THIS:
Wanda: So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well. One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend. She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are. You know, the drama of young romance. So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too.
Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his [mind]. They get in a huge fight about it. He's all, ""Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He's going to think you're still in love with him!"" And she's just like, ""Relax, Brandon!"" So, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He's like, ""That ex-boyfriend's going to come back for you. He knows where you live!"" 
So, after dinner, he drives her home. She lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway. And he walks her to her door, but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down. He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know? 
Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away, but when he glances in his rear-view mirror, his blood turns cold. 
Guess what's in the back seat.
BoJack: The ex-boyfriend?
Wanda: No! The bag of mulch!
... And I don't know what it IS about that exchange, but the fact that I was puzzling over it myself the whole 20 minutes of the episode only to get the reveal at the end of the story once I'd just about forgotten about it -- well, there's something about that much effort and set-up that still makes me giggle every time I think about it. So that's probably my favourite joke, ngl. I hope you've got just as convoluted a story for yours, haha!
My favourite dessert??? Tough to pick just one, but as a list: Nanaimo bars, no-bake chocolate haystack cookies, peanut butter cookies, Moose Tracks ice cream, Reese's, pumpkin pie, aaaand just about anything else with chocolate involved in it!!!
I whistle for fun all the time!!! :D",mentor

If you are planning to apply to VIU, you will need to have graduated high school in order to do so.  
VIU also has attractions as well as restaurants with different cuisine such as Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Italian, Greek and other cultures as well! They have attractions like the Malaspina Theatre, the koi pond, and the art gallery.  
VIU also has an offer on most courses from medical training to engineering. 
VIU currently has a student population of around 18,000 full-and part-time learners, including 1,100 international students from more than 40 countries, and over 1,000 aboriginal students that are attending VIU today.",mentee

That's nice! I might be either moving to Nanaimo or Victoria due to family stuff. 
Oh, that's great advice! So your step-brother went to UVIC? How long did he go for or does he still go? And what did you struggle with applying to VIU? 
I'll see to get as much as I can. I will try and get it to you this evening.
Oh, sorry about that! Hope you are doing okay. 
My capstone is not due until Wednesday, so I think I should be okay for now. 
Man, winter in Rupert is gonna be cold this year lol. Either it doesn't snow much here or it snows but the snow usually washes away within a couple days (and it turns to slush. Not a big fan of slush! What about you?) Hot chocolate is the best :D
Oh okay lol. I think I've seen different videos of people playing ocarinas lol. I've heard of Zelda but never played the video game, but I have watched some of the cartoon :p
That's cool! It's nice when you just whistle to anything, brings out the best and super awesome :) And did you know? It's supposed to boost your mood and it releases stress and it relaxes your mind too!

Good choice, it's nice to be closer to family lol. I am moving down with family to Vancouver Island next summer when I graduate :) 
Oi, having grown up on Vancouver Island all my life I can 100% say it is a gorgeous and lovely place to be!!! Which end of the Island your folks plan to live on might influence your choice of university, then -- I lived in the central part of the island where it was about a 20min drive to VIU, for example, but my step-brother (who also stayed home during his university-ing) took a trades course at UVIC and had to drive for an hour and a half each way, every day of the week, so watch out for things like that if your intended program is a Monday-to-Friday thing and you choose a university further off from your house, it can get expensive on gas!
Pro tip on that front, actually: if you CAN schedule your own courses, though, it can help to cluster them on certain days of the week -- I would usually pick a couple Mon/Wed courses (where they had 1.5-hour blocks twice a week) and one longer course on a third day (3-hour course but only held in person 1 day a week!) and then I would only need to do three days of driving on top of the short commute; that really helped to keep the car costs down AND gave me half a week of uninterrupted homework time to focus without having to worry about commuting!
Again, no worries at all on me making a word doc for you when your research is done -- I'm happy to copy and paste! But honestly, if your capstone is a bigger pressure on you right now, prioritize that 100%; I'll still be here when you're ready, and now that I know you're not gonna get in trouble for the extra time, I've got no reason to rush you. :P
Candy is always the best! And I usually watch Halloween movies with my family and it's scary and funny at the same time! We were actually watching Goosebumps last week and it had some horror but with some funny twists lol! So you're going as a plague doctor for Halloween this year? That's cool! Yeah, I like dressing up! I might be a pirate this year, but not sure! Oh haha, I guess maybe they sorta like Halloween? Not really sure! 
Oh boy -- I wish I could do scary movies, but I really struggle to enjoy anything that's too graphic, lol. Yes, plague doctor has been my Halloween costume for a few years running, now that I've perfected it! And pirate is a cool idea -- lots of customization you can do with it, too!
An ocarina is kinda like a big round clay whistle??? Most people know of it if they've played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or any of the other Zelda games that include it, but outside of that I think it's a pretty niche thing around here. I got into it because of the video game, of course, but I never found it as fun as the piano -- having one octave's worth of notes (and not that much lung power) really limited my creativity, haha. Hopefully I'll get some more practice in with the piano and guitar soon, at least, I've been meaning to catch up!!! And as for music genres... I'm not even sure I have a favourite, I like so many things??? And I'll whistle along to anything, really -- I don't even have to like the song itself to entertain myself following along with the radio, it's just something to do!
What do I like about winter? That's a tough one, because my experience of Winter(c) has changed a lot between BC and Saskatchewan... as a kid, I really enjoyed BC winters because 1) obviously they led to snow-days off from school, 2) my mum and I would take long walks around our rural area of Cassidy, where the snow made everything really pretty, and 3) I used to really like the idea of building snowpeople and forts and all that jazz. Plus, the feeling of coming in after a long day of playing outside and getting warm by the woodstove with a cup of hot chocolate and some cartoons -- that can't be beat! Now, winter HERE is a lot less ""let's go outside and enjoy playing in the snow for an hour or two until we get cold"" and more ""omg we need three layers of clothing to make it the twelve minute walk from the residence to the classroom or we'll all end up with actual frostbite"" and I think a lot of my pleasure comes from... well, not having much to go outside for, haha. Like I've said, I'm a home-body kind of person a lot of the time, so while it occasionally got isolating last year to spend so much time in my room, I'm also happy to just cozy up under my blanket with an electric heating pad and enjoy looking at the snow out the window knowing that it can't get me!!! Hbu?
Lemme know when you find the time to finish up the questionnaire/research stuff, and when you've got all your info together I'll make that document -- but no rush to get back, you do whatchu gotta do with your capstone and stuff!!! (And when you do return to this, if you have any specific questions about VIU life -- because that's where I took my BA, after all -- I'm happy to answer!)",mentor

I'm alive!!!!!!! Sorry I'm late, it's been really hectic on my end, too. QwQ But ahoy, I hope your studying for the literacy exams is going well and that everything has hopefully calmed down a wee bit (or will soon enough)!
I'll do my own Q&A first to catch me up:
My favourite way to jam out to songs is ABSOLUTELY while I'm driving! I no longer own a car (sold it to my step-dad when I moved to Saskatchewan, because BC gas prices were getting ridiculous for his own -- much larger! -- vehicle). There was always something for me about cranking the radio up, rolling down the windows to get some fresh air, and taking the scenic route home while singing myself hoarse... I really miss it, honestly!
I have two jobs with different duties -- one as a tutor at my school's Writing Centre and another as a Research Assistant for one of my profs! 
As a tutor, I sit down with all sorts of university folks (mostly undergraduate students, but sometimes grad students like myself and occasionally even faculty who want a second pair of eyes on their applications/papers/etc!) and just go through whatever project they're working on with them, offering feedback and what few corrections I'm allowed to give (because my boss doesn't want me doing people's work for them, haha) and mostly just talking. Honestly, I'd say that the most important part of my job isn't actually the grammar-checking, but the moments where I get to check in on how students' lives are going; I'm really open about my own experiences as a queer/enby/ADHD grad student, and I've actually had quite a few cases where I end up spending our whole session helping people figure out where to get their own accommodations/further info for non-paper-related supports! It's really cool that my experiences in life get to help other people reflect on theirs that way -- it's kind of like mentoring, but with pay and sometimes a weird amount of free time to sit around assembling Halloween decorations (a bizarre and very funny thing to be paid to do, but my prof also has ADHD and we get excited about all sorts of fun stuff!).
As a research assistant, I'm paid to help one of my profs with her own work -- which currently means I'm doing some research for her so that she can prep for a conference presentation she's giving in about a month! So lots of reading, but thankfully her research is on Indigenous methodologies and that's the area I'm looking at for my PhD thesis in the future, so it's kind of like getting paid to research on my own time -- can't complain!
In other news, your Q&A-style answers work perfectly, your grammar is just fine, and it's really cool that you're looking into graphic design in the future!!! I agree on the cost of schooling being steep at times, especially depending on your institution -- one of the reasons that I've been able to scoot by without debt so far is because I did my English BA at a smaller institution with low-ish tuition (and lived with my mum while I did it, and had high enough grades that I got some pretty good scholarships along the way... so your mileage may vary on how much you can save/spend!); unless you're going into a field where the prestige of your school matters to your potential employers, I would really really recommend not going to a place that's super high-priced (unless the benefits outweigh the costs for you, of course!).
One day left to go -- let's see what part two holds for us, and then we're free and clear!!! :D",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-22 10:23:00," 
Pillow spray is a cool strategy to help stay asleep! I struggle with scents and stuff (teenage asthma, not sure if it still counts but I don't like wheezing) but for me a lot of sleep quality actually comes from humidity levels in the air, so I run a humidifier all the time now that I'm out on the Prairies to keep things as level as they would be in BC! Also makes exercise more pleasant -- and cool to see that you're a yoga fan, too! I don't love vigorous exercise, and honestly, every little bit of movement helps, so it sounds like we're both doing pretty well with it!
Yes, I highly recommend the bulk cooking especially, no matter what you're doing in the future -- it saves a HECK of a lot of time and makes healthy choices infinitely easier, haha. As for what I cook, I like to do three big meals at once, each comprised of one protein (usually meat) to about two servings of veggies; for example, my last bulk-cooking-fest, I made 1) a family pack of 7-8 chicken breasts, with steamed broccoli/carrots, 2) a roast beef/tomato gravy, with mini yellow potatoes/beans, and 3) a pork stir-fry with broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower rice, and then I just took that massive amount of food and sorted it into, like, twenty Rubbermaid containers and froze them all. Then every day for the last 2-3 weeks I could just reach into my freezer, pull out a container that has exactly one dinner's worth of food in it, pop the frozen lump out onto a plate (never microwave in the plastic container, it gets chemicals into your food!!!) and then microwave it until it's hot again. Super easy way of feeding yourself consistently, and I have no idea why more people don't do it, but for me it has been a lifesaver (especially because then I only have the massive mess of dishes once!!!). Having a few dishes that are really different helps with variety (so you don't get bored with what you're eating) and once in a while I like to spice things up by stopping by the university cafeteria, where they give me seven free dinners per term, and/or occasionally going out to restaurants/events with friends where I'll have different food (and it makes the freezer dinners stretch even further!).
Peanut butter cookies are amazing!!! Usually I make chocolate chip, but I was 1) out of chips and 2) had two jars of peanut butter halfway empty that needed using. No regrets, as long as I'm responsible with my snacking! :'D
Favourite thing to do on vacations... for me, it's a balance between relaxing and exploring, usually! If it's a short vacation -- eg. sometimes my mum and I would just go to a hotel for a night or two -- then mostly relaxing (at which point I like to laze about and watch silly TV and do some drawing) but for big vacations, eg. to other countries, I really wanna get out and see where I've ended up (I can sit on the couch at home!!!). For me, our Europe trip was a real treat because we managed to balance those chill hotel-room-only resting days with getting out and seeing all sorts of cool stuff! My favourites were the Doctor Who Shop in East London -- I had a Doctor Who university class that term, everyone was very jealous haha -- and the Catacombs in Paris -- not a ""tourist spot"" so much as a very impactful experience for me that I'm grateful to have had. And of course, Iceland had hot springs everywhere, so ""going out and exploring"" and ""lying in a warm bath and relaxing"" were pretty much synonymous... no complaints there!
I'd love to keep chatting with you once your class time is up! I'll let one of the program people know so that they don't close us off automatically, and then once you've gotten your grade we don't have to rush anything, yay!!! For now, though, I'll open that Post-Secondary and Career Planning unit just because it'll fulfill your requirements and sounds like good life advice... and then we can go from there! :D",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-16 15:56:00," 
Oh no, that's very relatable to me!!! I just hope you can get as many accommodations as I have -- it really helps to have people understand that handing things in late doesn't mean you don't care, you know??
Very fair!!! It sounds like you've got a good grasp on this, then. :D Let's see what the second part of this unit holds for us, then!",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-15 12:00:00," 
Oh, good to know I'm not the only one! I usually have a hard time handing work on time lol. 
Not sure what you mean, but if you are asking about how I take care if myself, I usually try to drink as much water as I can and I try to eat healthier with some cheat days in between :')
Yeah I have, there's some countries I don't really remember much haha.
If I were to choose a superpower, it would be to either fly or super speed :D",mentee
,,55268,2022-10-14 22:22:00," 
This is really interesting!!! I had a lot of the opposite problem -- I was the weird kid because I talked infinitely too much for groups, haha. But I also preferred individual work a lot of the time on account of my style of thinking not jiving with group projects (and my style of doing everything last minute, to be fair...)
Great minds think (and stress) alike!!! What other signs tip you off to stress? How about physical self-care? I always struggle to make sure that my bodily needs are met (food, water, exercise) but is there anything specific to your routine that you reaaaally notice when it happens? Like ""if I wake up and I'm immediately in a bad mood even though nothing's happened yet, I know that's a sign I need a day off"" or some such? 
Oi, it sounds like you've done a great deal of travelling too -- that's really exciting (and often a heck of a privilege in terms of broadening the scope of your worldviews early on in life). I'm thinking about visiting Japan someday (just to get some use out of all the Duolingo hours I'm putting in -- albeit with little result, lol) but I've never thought of Spain or Australia (though my mum has always wanted to visit Spain and my step-dad is a huge history buff, so I'm sure he'd have plenty to do). I'm a moderate sushi fan, at least -- spent a few years as a sushi roller in a grocery store as well, which was a neat skill to pick up!
Any superpower at all? I would sayyyyyy probably metamorphosis. Not just for the obvious dysphoria reasons, but because honestly, being able to turn into any object/animal/etc gives you most other superpowers anyway (flight, invisibility if you pick something small, etc etc). And one superpower I wouldn't want is the ability to see or affect the future -- too much pressure! How about you?",mentor
,,55268,2022-10-12 19:11:00," 
I did not talk until I was around 8. And I didn't go into groups much when I was in elementary and middle school and mostly worked alone, or if my friends were in the same class as I was. Otherwise I was a weird person most of my life lol.
Yeah, it actually is! You read my mind :')
I've also travelled through London, Singapore (can't remember), and most of Canada (except New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.) I'll probably update if I can think of more lol)  I also wanted to go to Spain, Australia and Japan! 
And my favourite food is butter chicken, sushi, burgers and salad and rice.

Hello!!! I have FINALLY completed my scholarship application (submitted it two hours before the deadline, which doesn't sound like much but for me is probably a really good sign haha) and I am back and alive!!! I'll try to keep myself organized in responses here...
On the activity: I should have mentioned art!!! As both a warning sign (if I'm doing way too much of it suddenly) and a self-care activity (when I finally give myself permission to sit down and work on the things that matter to me). It's a tricky balance with that one sometimes, for me at least. I'm glad to say that I'm doing better with it atm, though! It sounds like you have a strong appreciation for those little moments of relaxation -- using art to wind down or just enjoying a good cup of coffee and chilling. Sometimes, savouring and celebrating can be that simple, honestly. What would you say are your indicators of when you need to take a break like that? Do you have any warning signs? (I'm sensing ""unable to mentally disengage from schoolwork"" as probably a strong stress indicator here... at least, it is for me!)
Favourite food? Teriyaki chicken wings!!! One of my favourite special dinners as a kid. Also pumpkin pie (seasonal, I know), mushroom caps, butter tarts, aaaaand weirdly enough, steamed broccoli and carrots (very plain, but a staple of a lot of my bulk cooking... and also I just really like broccoli idk--). Hbu???
Favourite travel destinations? I've travelled a fair bit for my age: been to the States, Mexico a couple times, Cuba once, and across the pond to Europe the other year (visited London, Paris, and Iceland)! I would saaaaay the States is my favourite right now, just because my partner lives there and I don't get to see him often, and obviously BC, because it's wonderful to get to see family, but that's not terribly vacation-y -- so in terms of going for places instead of people, probably Mexico? (Cuba was gorgeous but I didn't love the food, and a lot of the Europe stuff felt more like ""going places to Do Stuff rather than to Relax and Enjoy the Experience"" half the time, particularly in London, so I'm not sure it clocks in as a favourite place even though it was definitely one of the best trips I've had!) Have you been anywhere interesting?
What's it like having ADHD? (And don't worry, I won't disclose any of your info -- but thank you for sharing!!!) This is a Big Question(c) and probably more than I can capture in one answer (and I might not even realize how much of my experience is ADHD-related, it's hard to know what being neurotypical would be like???) but for me... it's a mix! I could talk a lot about symptom management, on one hand -- I definitely have some struggles with, for example, executive function (getting ""motivated"" to actually do things can be hard, even when they're things that, in my head, I really want to do, because I still can't make myself do, if that makes sense?), time management (I've handed in pretty much every assignment of my Master's degree late/under an extension, haha -- very grateful for accommodations!!!), and emotional dysregulation (which is something that you don't hear about as much as an ADHD symptom, but it's actually a big part of the experience -- feeling the same emotions as everyone else, but sometimes they just get clocked up to 11, so something that would make most people kinda happy makes you stoked and something that would make most people kinda sad can send my brain spinning for hours, y'know?). Things like that are definitely one end of the deal -- but on the other hand, there's also a lot of gifts with it, too: I'm definitely creatively inspired by my ADHD habits (being able to jump between a million thoughts at a time makes a lot of connections that most people might not puzzle together!), and knowing my potential pitfalls has made me a lot more understanding and resilient in general (like, knowing that I have symptoms that might need working on in some areas is what pushes me to self-improve, whereas people who don't have -- or don't know that they have! -- a form of neurodivergency might just go, ""why improve my experiences in life? this is Just the Way I Am(c)!""... and recognizing how much of my experience has changed just in a year or two of self-improvement really encourages me to encourage others to aim for their best possible lives, too, which leads to a lot of advocacy work!). At the end of the day, I know that I can range from being really frustrated one day -- completely scatterbrained, late on assignments, stuck in a rut, impulsively doing things I know I don't want to and recognizing that those are all symptoms and feeling bleh about it -- and then another day can seriously benefit from my brain chemistry -- getting hyperfocused on the right thing at the right time, pulling some stellar work at the last minute that amazes everyone around me and myself, and working with my ADHD rather than against it -- and for that reason, I think it's kind of a gift like just about any other experience of being. I wouldn't wish it away, even on the hard days!
What kind of ""tired""? This might be a symptom thing for me, actually, so maybe I don't have the right words to explain it, but like... not so much ""wanting to sleep"" as ""wanting to be mentally inactive for a while,"" which, because it's hard for me to achieve sometimes, tends to naturally lead to ""well I guess I should take a nap, because if I was unconscious I wouldn't have to think so much"" (whereas my body might not even be tired, so I might just lie there and not be able to sleep anyway, silly enough!). Nowadays, I try to err on the side of meditation and mindfulness to relax my brain a little more reliably than just lying down and hoping sleep will take me (which is hard to do with my meds anyway, because stimulants tend to keep you awake during the day regardless). ""Tired of thinking too much"" or ""tired of stressing out and having racing anxious thoughts"" might be a more accurate description?
I'm curious, if you wanna share (but no pressure if you don't!) -- do any of my ADHD experiences speak to any of yours with ASD? I know that ASD presentations vary wiiiiidely between people (just like ADHD ones!), but from what I gather they're pretty commonly comorbid experiences (meaning that they tend to either 1) have a lot of overlapping symptoms/experiences or 2) tend to be diagnosed in the same people because they affect similar parts of the brain). I didn't score high on my ASD testing when I got my ADHD diagnosis, but one of my best friends has ASD and we have a lot of the same behaviours, so I dunno, maybe we'll have some common ground!",mentor

Sorry I'm late -- but happy Sunday!!! :'D Surprisingly busy weekend over here with the scholarshippy stuff, but that's all Officially(c) due Tuesday so hopefully soon enough I will be free to be a person aaaaaaaa
Yes, I do use they/them pronouns!!! I was one of maybe two or three (max?) people I knew on Vancouver Island who did when I lived in BC, but surprisingly, a great deal of my graduate cohort in Saskatchewan is visibly trans and largely non-binary as well, which is really cool. If you have any questions on how they work grammatically, feel free to ask! :D And heck yeah, I love it!!! The tutoring is technically a side-gig for me to supplement my scholarship funds while also gaining relevant work hours on my resumé, but it also basically doubles as more mentoring in my experience (because honestly, half of the folks who come in asking for paper help also just need life advice and resources on keeping up with mental health and such... which I gotta admit was really validating for me in my first year, too, being both 1) in need of accessibility support on account of fighting for an ADHD diagnosis and 2) being able to then pass all of my experiences onto other students who didn't even realize they were Allowed(c) to get accommodations? it's really gratifying and important work sometimes QwQ). And finally: my favourite season is 100% autumn, and not just because of Halloween, but because I love scarves!!!

Jen it is, then! And I definitely feel you on the divide between Halloween and Christmas... for me Halloween has always had a certain Energy(c) to it that I don't see in other holidays, but Christmas is pretty high up there for me too, between the chances to see all the family gathered together and my step-dad's absolute s p r a w l of amazing Christmas dinner side dishes -- both are a treat!!! And I'm not super familiar with Diwali myself, but what I can see at a glance looks gorgeous -- maybe you'll have a chance to celebrate someday! And ""non-binary"" is a pretty blanket term for ""not one of the two binary genders"" that can end up meaning a lot of different things to a lot of different folks... like, for me, I think if I had to pick a more incisive label I'd go with agender, but I find non-binary useful enough that I haven't really gone with a more specific label! QwQ
Thank you for the well wishes!!! Fingers crossed on the scholarship stuff, I'm never 100% confident but I know I'll be OK!!! In the meantime, would you like me to open up our first unit?

And Halloween, 100% -- I've always loved the autumn and the general aesthetic and weather and fall vibes to begin with, and then you add a holiday about breaking social customs and wearing costumes and eating candy and relishing in spookiness???

Hello!!!
Welcome to the program! :D No worries about getting used to the site -- the platform changes a bit every time I use it, too, so I might be a bit rusty myself, haha! 
Anyhoo -- nice to meet you!!! My name is Challen, I'm an English MA student from BC (currently living in Saskatchewan while I do school things!) and I use they/them pronouns. I see that you've listed she/they on your profile (so excited to have more gender-diverse mentees, heck yeah) -- and is Jennifer your preferred name or do you have another that you'd rather I use? I've had a few genderqueer mentees get stuck with default adhering-to-legal-names-on-school-attendance situations in that regard now, so I always like to ask first!
Also... what is Life(c)? What are you interested in? Anything in particular you're hoping to get out of the program or are you more so going through the motions? (The email I got said that you need to complete two Conversations -- one on Wellbeing and Self-Care, which I expect we'll end up doing first, and one more of your choice, both by October 28th... but if there's anything in particular you want to learn about that isn't covered by those two units and you'd like to either open other ones afterward or just Ask About Adult Human Existence(c) while you've got me on the line, I am very much here for that!!!) Do you have any plans for after high school, career-related or otherwise? And most importantly... you're an artist too??? Tell me everything!!!!! I'm a varied hobbyist myself (digital art, graphic design, traditional sketchwork, acrylic painting, plush-making, cross-stitch, Sculpey clay... I've tried a bit of everything, honestly!) and I'm always super curious to see what other folks are working on! :D

Hey Nicole! I see online that it's around 65%, but I also think this might not be totally accurate. I think there's a chance that more people than this get accepted. I know when I was in grade 12, a bunch of people in my grade were applying, and I only knew one person that did not get accepted to UVic (and I think they missed a lot of school and had pretty low grades). Also keep in mind that this depends on the program you apply to, e.g., I think something like engineering or biochem would be a bit more difficult to get into, but there would be a very low chance you would get rejected from a program like psychology. I think the acceptance rates are an average of all programs, including ones that are harder to get into.
I hope you applied if you are considering UVic!",mentor
,,59057,2022-01-28 04:42:00," 
I am so sorry it's been so long!! I will resspond fully later I literally just woke up thinking about what is the acceptable rate for uvic?? i know the application deadline is the 31st and fast approaching and i'm trying to figure out if i even have a good chance of getting accepted or not ...",mentee

I loved reading about your career aspirations! It's so nice to hear that you seem to be passionate about so many different things. I think it's always good to keep different options open, especially when you're at the stage where you are now (but even at any point in life). I am in dental school now, and I have classmates that want to be dentists, but they also hope to try out other careers later in life when they can. 
It's great that you were able to see what the daily life was like for a graphic designer. I think that being able to shadow someone locally in a job (without any of the sugar coating that I sometimes notice on social media day-in-the-life videos) is one of the most helpful things you can do when trying to decide what type of job you might want to do after school. I think you should really be able to visualize yourself doing it everyday.
As for marine biology, I would try not to get too discouraged right now if it's something you think you might want to consider more. I know people that are now in dental school that had to overcome many set backs to get here. Some even failed science classes at their univeristy and had to redo them, and others had to apply multiple years in a row before getting in. Whatever job you decide to aim for, just remember that a lot of people who get the job they want got it because they never gave up. Even when they doubted themselves, they just kept pushing on and trying their best. Have you thought about taking a marine biology class as an elective to see if you like it? A counsellor would also be a good job where you can interact with others and have each day be a bit different!",mentor

Hello Nicole,
Thank you for all your questions! To make sure that I can respond to everything, I will paste your response and then put my answer below. 
I also took a look at other majors available but I still feel like I have the most interest and passion for psych!!
That's awesome! I personally had a great time taking psych, and I am really happy I ended up taking it over other majors, but I also know that everyone has different interests, so I think it's important that you also keep an open mind (once you have started taking different types of classes) incase there's anything else that you might want to transfer into. 
as far as the classs... like would I be able to take English as an elective right? becasue i see that it isn't ""required"" but I do actually enjoy english. 
Yes! So for english, there's actually a required academic writing and reading class that I believe almost every major requires in the first year (called ATWP 135 at UVic) which is pretty helpful for the rest of your degree when you have papers and assignments for different classes, but you can also take other english/writing/literature classes if you want. In the planning sheet for first year (BSc psyc), you will see at the bottom that there's a line that says ""electives any level -- 3.0"" This means that you can take two classes in any faculty at any level (i.e., 100 level/first year class, 200 level, 300 level, or 400 level), although beyond first year classes, many classes have prerequisites that you need to take first before you are allowed to enrole in them. I took a contemporary literature course where we were assigned things from different forms of media (movie, graphic novel, poems, etc.) which we wrote essays on. It was pretty interesting! 
50-120 min classes sound quite doable... I feel like I can stay seated and semi- focused for that amount of time most days. 2 hrs and 50 mins may be a bit of a stretch but maybe If the subject is extremely interesting it will be easy!! 
Yeah, 2 hrs and 50 min can be a lot, but then you also get the reward of only having that class once per week haha. So, it's a trade off, but my favourite style ended up being 50 min for most types of classes. I found it was easy to stay focused the whole time and digest all the info during that time frame.
from experience, would you say that a ""typical"" first/second year student's schedule is fairly manageable? it can be difficult to figure out what to expect because certainly on social media there are some people who say they barely have time to eat and sleep because the course load is so demanding, while others say wow, there is so much time!! I imagine it would also depend a lot on how savvy a person is with their time management skills... sadly an area I lack in a bit!! like would it be reasonable to maintain a balance of studying, social life and personal time? I dont see myself spending a lot of time going to parties lol since I am quite an anxious person but I absolutely love to hang out in smaller groups. would it be unrealistic to think about taking on a part time job while being at school? I mean I know people do but like for first year? I think it would also be nice to be able to study with friends and stuff because it can help me to focus (sometimes it makes it harder lol) and less lonely!! 
I would say that a typical schedule is pretty manageable, especially in a major like psyc where there's not a ton of labs/tutorial that are required in addition to regular classes. At the same time though, I think it's normally to feel a bit like there's no time for anything else at first. I think this is because when you're new to university/college, it's hard to know what to spend the most time on, and which types of classes/assignments you can do more quickly and still get a good mark. For example, you might have a class where there's a ton of required readings, but after the first midterm, you realize that almost all the exam questions are taken from the lecture slides. Sometimes the profs will be nice and tell you how many questions are from readings vs lecture, but sometimes they won't, so in this case, I found my self studying everything just incase, but then when the next midterm or final came, I was able to save a ton of time by only studying the things that I think will be on the exam, and then skimming the other stuff if I have extra time after. I think there is enough time for anything that you really want to do (e.g., if you really want to have a part time job or work out daily), but it might come with the consequence of less time for other stuff (e.g., feeling like you don't have enough time to hang with friends or get lots of sleep). You kind of need to pick your top few priorities and make a point of doing those things, regardless of if it feels like there's a lot of stuff to do for school. I had a part-time job when I first started university (twice a week for four hours), but I later quit after my first year because I realized I wanted more time to hang with friends, get good sleep, and have even more time to spend studying so I could get better grades. Saving 8 hours a week doesn't sound like much, but I find if I over-scheduled myself, then I would also just feel burnt out. So, when it came time in the day to study (e.g., after work and school), I sometimes found it quite difficult to motivate myself or to get through my work quickly and efficiently without just getting distracted and taking a bunch of breaks. Sorry this is a lot of info. . . in conclusion, I think my biggest piece of advice would be to start university/college with minimal other commitments, focus on getting good at the ""simple"" stuff in term 1 (e.g., sleeping enough, staying on top of your studies, eating healthy meals, doing a bit of exercise, and making time for friends and family), and then I would take on one commitment at a time once you feel like you have all those types of things under control. E.g., in term 2, or year 2, you could get a part-time job or sign up for a volunteer position.
how did you find making friends? was it really scary, or like were there a lot of people with shared interests who were looking to be friends as well?
I found that making friends was harder than in highschool because I lost the ability to have ""convenient"" friends -- those types of friends that you just end up always having around because you have similar classes or interests. If you go to a bigger univeristy, you might find that you have different people in every class you go to. I found that if I wanted to make friends, I needed to seek them out. E.g., sign up for an activity where I could meet people with similar interests, go to social events and add people on social media, strike up conversations with people in my classes and ask them to work on a class project or to study together. At times I found myself a bit lonely, but in my last year, I found that I had a really good social circle. It helped that I took honours, so I was able to get to know everyone in the honours cohort and see them multiple times a week for the whole 4th year. I think it can be different for everyone though. Some people make a group of friends right away that they stay super tight with the whole 4 years (e.g., met them in residence and then rented a place as roommates in year 2-4). I also had COVID online lectures for a lot of my classes, so it will probably be easier to make friends now that everything is pretty much normal again.",mentor

so I did the little warm up exercise for that section on career aspirations and dreams I have had in the past. it says to write for 2-3 mins lol and I ended up writing for 15 minutes and filling an entire page!! 
I will summarize—
I kind of always knew I wanted to do some work that would involve helping people in some meaningful way. starting from when I was quite little I wanted to care for babies, like an obstetrician or midwife. then I became interested in being a nurse or doctor, and then I became passionate about working in a field of emergency services, like law enforcement or paramedic. I discovered a passion for graphic design in grade 8, and considered pursuing that subject but after a work experience placement which was great, I realized it would be an ""8 hrs sitting at a desk behind a computer every day"" sort of job which is exactly what I want to avoid. so i figured I would stick to like freelancing for graphic design. I have been very excited about marine biology as well, but I am just unsure if that is just a passion but maybe not a career? I didn't do quite as well in sciences as I'd hoped which discouraged me a bit. so currently I am most interested in psychology with the goal of becoming a counselor!

you can probably tell from my tone of msg that I'm feeling a little more grounded at the moment!! my brain is organizing thoughts a little better than usual which is always nice :) 
how did you find making friends? was it really scary, or like were there a lot of people with shared interests who were looking to be friends as well? I am just worried that everyone will already have enough friends and not be interested in getting to know me at all. but I really like to be around people... usually. I would describe myself as quite a social person, I'm extroverted but definitely not the type of person that has 1000 friends lol.
I may have mentioned this before, but I would love to get into going to the gym. but i feel so insecure going alone, and it would be great to meet someone who knew a bit and also would be willing to go with me!!",mentee

Rachel thank you for being so sweet and understanding!!! I really appreciate that :)
yes, like I feel like the transition to living quite independently could be a bit rough at the beginning but once I settle in and start to feel more comfortable, I think it will actually be a really good change for me. 
thank you, I did check out the course planning sheets and even found the page to translate the subjects of the required classes!! I also took a look at other majors available but I still feel like I have the most interest and passion for psych!! 
as far as the classs... like would I be able to take English as an elective right? becasue i see that it isn't ""required"" but I do actually enjoy english. 50-120 min classes sound quite doable... I feel like I can stay seated and semi- focused for that amount of time most days. 2 hrs and 50 mins may be a bit of a stretch but maybe If the subject is extremely interesting it will be easy!! but i understand of course that there will be a lot of adapting and ""going outside my comfort zone"" happening at uni lol.

Hi Nicole,
You really do not need to apologize! :) I am here anytime you need to talk about something. There's no specific schedule you have to stick to for messaging me. Of course I want to keep chatting with you!
That totally makes sense about your concerns about UVic. It's difficult for me to give you advice about a smaller college because I personally have not been to one, but I did have friends who went to Camosun College in Victoria and really enjoyed their time there (some of them liked it even more than they liked UVic). I think staying closer to home could help if you're worried about being lonely, although I think if you do want to try a bigger city or bigger university, you will probably get used to it and not feel lonely after being there for a while. I would try talking to friends and family to see what they think as they probably know you well, and whichever you decide, you can always transfer after a year if you wish you make a different choice.
Yes! You can choose to take a bachelor of science or arts in psychology. The biggest difference is what type of degree you will get at the end (BSc vs BA), but the classes are pretty similar as they both require quite a lot of psychology classes. The required classes outside of psychology is where the degrees differ the most. For example at UVic to get a BSc in psyc, you have to take BIOL 184 and 186 (first year bio), but you don't have to for a BA in psyc. You can search ""UVic psychology program planning worksheet BA"" (or BSc) to see which classes are required for each degree. 
Yes you can transfer pretty easily between science and arts at UVic, you just have to meet their minimium requirements for the most part. Although, I have heard it can be more difficult to switch at other schools (such as UBC) as you would have to apply, and sometimes the applications are denied depending on how competitive the program is. 
Sorry, my previous message might have been a bit confusing. In total you need to take 10 classes each year to graduate in 4 years. I believe this usually adds up to about 3 hours of classes per day, although sometimes you need to register for tutorials or labs (if they are required to pass a certain class) which might be additional hours per week. Each class is usually 50 minutes (10 min transition time to get to your next class), but classes can also sometimes be 120 min or 2 hrs 50 min, although the latter two are not as common. Your schedule will look different depending on which classes you sign up for. For example, you can try to register for classes at times that are back to back, but sometimes it's hard to find one that fits, so you might have to have gaps in your schedule (e.g., one or two hour break between classes), or you might have to take a class even in the evenings during some semesters. One benefit of going to a bigger school is that there will likely be more different types of classes available and more sections for a class that you can register in (e.g., at UVic, psyc 100A might have 3 different sections going on during one semester, all scheduled at different times). This just allows you to build your schedule in a more customized way to your preferences.
During your first year, if you go to a bigger university, probably most of your classes will be in big lecture halls, but as you advance through the years, your classes will probably get smaller and smaller as calsses become more specialized. Although, there are some classes that always seem to be small. For example, language classes such as english and french always seem to have around 30-40 students at UVic, so they feel more like high school classes.",mentor

I am really torn right now if I should go like the UVic route or like maybe look into going to a smaller college. I am really worried about being lonely wherever i go, and also coming from a relatively ""small town"" I am also just not used to being around so so many people! 
so you can do a bachelors of psych in science or arts? what is the difference? at this point i can't get into sciences because I don't have the right classes but I have heard you can transfer later if you want, after being accepted into Arts? 
I was also wondering like with the classes, you say there is 8 classes to fill up your first year schedule... is it like going to school 9-3 every weekday or are they structured at different times? and like about how long is each class? They are like lecture format in a big hall with a ton of people right?",Mentee
,,59057,2022-09-16 10:14:00," 
If you're not sure whether you want to major in psychology (or another subject), I would recommend trying out one of the first year classes and see if it interests you enough to take more classes in it for the rest of your degree. I hope that helps :)",Mentor

I am glad to hear that you have a close friend you can live with! I think that should really help a lot :)
I really enjoyed majoring in psychology! In first year, we basically just learned a huge overview of all the different areas of psychology. So it was a little bit of everything (e.g., psychological disorders, major theories and who developed them, how research is conducted, some major resesearch studies that have changed the study of psychology, etc.).
For the actual psychology content, it is broken down into two first year classes at UVic. Then there are eight classes left to take to fill up your first year schedule. For the rest of the first-year classes, they will be in other subject areas (e.g., math, philosophy, biology, etc.). If you google ""UVic Program Planning Work Sheet Psychology BSc"" (or ""BA,"" depending on whether you want to graduate with a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts as the required classes will be a bit different) you can see the different types of classes that will be required.",Mentor

I think how hard you find being away from home for the first time will depend on how close you are to your family and how much you like your current living situation. I am pretty close to my family, so I found it hard at first to live without them, but I would personally recommend trying to find someone you can live with as a roomate if you are worried about feeling lonely. I think it is natural to feel homesick at first, but I adjusted to being without my family after a few months, and my new living situation started to feel like the ""new normal."" I also think you can avoid some homesickness by setting up regular facetime appointments with the people you miss most and thinking ahead to the next time you will be able to visit home.
I have talked to friends who were not as close to their family or were just ready to move on and start a new phase of life, and they didn't seem to find it hard or miss home much. So, I think it just depends on each individual and their situation.",Mentor

I am not totally sure about the approved grade 12 course. I think it sounds like it has changed a little bit since I applied. When I applied, they just asked for my grades in specific classes and I entered those into the application. Probably the best thing to do is email someone at the schools you are applying to, just to make sure you entered everything correctly.

I believe at UVic you are guarunteed a room the first year, but then when you're in the 2-4 year, you can apply but might not get a dorm. I think most students just end up living near by campus in their second year with some roommates in a rental apartment. 
 
okay that sounds great! You can just let me know which topic interests you most, and we can start with that one. If you need a recommendation, I like the self care module a lot.

I think the biggest difference between teachers in high school and university is just that there are a wide range of professors. Some can seem a lot like a high school teacher--very nice and wanting everyone to suceed, whereas other professors might seem more intimidating and might not seem to care as much about trying to help students or provide help/flexibility on assignments, attendance, or other things, but I think, in general, if you reach out to a prof, they are going to be pretty helpful, kind, and respectful (if you show respect to them). Office hours are usually set up weekly in each class which is a great time to get help with class content, and your profs should always be willing to provide more explanation/examples if you attend the office hours.
There is some mental health support, but they tends to be some issues with it. For example, there can be a waitlist of a few weeks to speak with a counsellor and the appointments can be short (e.g., I think they tend to be booked for 20 or 30 min), but I have noticed since COVID, my school has tried to set up more supports (e.g., connecting to a peer or online/phone services). UVic has a wellness centre where I think they would be pretty good at provide more information about the available programs/supports. They also have nurses there that can perscribe certain medications and possibly refer a student to a doctor for a more complex mental health difficulty.
The food is cafeteria style in the dorms, but there are also other food outlets that are more just like a deli/coffee shop/restaurant. For example, I think some serve pizza, others have tacos/burritos, there is a Starbucks, etc. I think it's pretty good, but I have heard that some people don't like it after a while when you have to eat it everyday. The price of the meal plan is included in living costs if you live in residence.",Mentor

It's good that you're starting to think about post-secondary education! There are definitely pros and cons to university vs college. I went straight to UVic rather than going to a 1- or 2-year college first, and I really had a good experience and enjoyed it, but I think college would also provide a great transitional step (for academics and social life) so starting university wouldn't feel as jarring as it can as well as a good way to save money on tuition (I think).
Applying to post secondary can seem very overwhelming at first, but once you get into it, a lot of schools don't actually require too much from you. For example, I think when I applied to UVic, the main part of the application was just entering in my grades and sending in my transcript. I think some schools might allow you to apply now and defer for one year. Every university/college would probably have a different policy about this and you could probably find out about it on their website or by talking to an advisor at that school.",Mentor

Hello Nicole!
I hope you had a good Spring Break and trip to Cali! At UVic, we don't really have a Spring Break, but we do have Reading Break which is a one-week break that is usually lumped in with Family Day, so it ends up being in February about half way through the second semester. The first semester runs from Sept - Dec, then the second semester runs Jan - April. Students only usually need to be in school for those two semester each year, but there are also a smaller selection of classes offered during the summer (May - Aug). There is usually a break of 2-3 weeks between semester one and two, Reading Break, and then another break after the second semester if you are taking summer classes.",Mentor

because I am thinking to take next year as a gap year, i was hoping that i could somehow like secure a spot or whatever get accepted into but like start the program in 2024. I think that is possible... one of my teachers said they do that but i really don't know... 
I am also trying to decide if i want to go to a smaller college first before going to uvic.. ahh I don't know!!",Mentee

I wanted to mention, you have thought of some really good questions, but also, there's no pressure to come up with a long list if you can't think of everything at once. You can always just ask me things anytime you think of them :)",Mentor

Awww maine coons are super cute! I'm jealous :p
As far as feeling out of your comfort zone in the gym, my best advice would probably be to find a friend to go with who already has a weightlifting routine. I would just ask them if you can come along and try out their workout. This way you can watch them do all the machines/exercises before you try them out. I also wouldn't be too worried about looking new. Although it might feel awkward at first, no one would really notice or think anything of it because everyone was a beginner too at some point.
I do think there is a lot of support at university, but I think you kind of have to seek it out more. For example, you might have to go out of your way to attend a professor's office hours or plan in advance to set up an academic advising appointment, but once you do connect with the right person, the staff is super helpful. I have found almost every professor I have talked to to be super nice and helpful. For the most part, they want to see you suceed, and (as long as you respect their time and look engaged/interested) they will try their best to answer all you questions and explain concepts well.
I would say the food is pretty good. Some of it might not be quite as good as a nice restaurant or like your family might make at home, but there a lot of good options. For example, there are different dining halls with different menus each day, and there are also a bunch of different food outlets throughout campus that have the same thing each day (for example, pizza, sandwhiches, wraps, tacos, breakfast food, sushi, etc.). There is also a Startbucks on campus if you're into that.",Mentor
,,59057,2022-02-28 12:32:00," 
I think there can definitely be an adjustment to the ""adulting,"" but I have noticed that, for most people I know, it really doesn't take that long. Once you figure out a routine and how to do everything, it starts to just feel normal. I think the adjustment also depends on how independent you are in highschool. For example, if you already take care of your own schedule, laundry, cleaning, exercising, etc., you probably won't find things to be too different. Also, everyone in first year will be in the same boat as you at first, so you can lean on others for help or advice, and no one will expect you to have everything figured out right away. 
As for time management, I found I got a lot better once I went to university since it gave me, like you said, frequent deadlines and pressure. I also found it was pretty easy to motivate myself to get work done once I had a goal in mind of what I wanted to do with my life. I finally felt like my grades really mattered and the stuff I was learning would help me get to where I want to be in life.
That's amazing that you're finishing up grade 12! Congrats! I found high school felt like a really long four years, but it's great that you can now look forward to some new and exciting changes in your life. Have you completed any post-secondary applications yet?",Mentor

it would be really cool to get into lifting, especially if there's a great facility to do so. i wouldn't know where to start tho lol which might be embarrassing!!
do you find there's a lot of support at university? like aside from your friends and family... from your professors and other school staff?
this might be a silly question but i love food and i was just wondering how good the food is...

I have the sense that university involves way more ""adulting"" but not fully on your own sort of thing. Truthfully I really struggle with time management, getting assignments finished in time and that sort of thing... but I do perform quite well under pressure so maybe having constant deadlines might help!

Maybe you can try out weight lifting if you come to UVic. There's a new athletics building here called CARSA that I think was built in 2015. It's super nice and has a huge weight centre.",Mentor

Oh, that's good that you live near by! I think it will be nice to be able to visit home on your long weekends, if you attend UVic.
I would say there are a lot of things that are different. Compared to where I went to highschool, it was a huge change. First of all, I really enjoyed being in University a lot more than high school. You get to feel like an adult where you take control of your own schedule and responsibilities. For example, no one is going to try to track you down if you skip a class or don't hand in an assignment. Although this is nice to feel in control, you also have to be a bit more diligent about making sure you know when all your due dates are as usually, you are not allowed to hand in assignments late or re-take exams/tests. But regardless, I found that this was a really positive change. I am a pretty independent person, so by the end of highschool, I started to feel really bored and tierd of the environment. 
Can I ask you what grade you're in right now?
Another thing that is different is that there are a lot more people. For example, in every class, there could be up to a few hundred people, and most of the people in each class will be new. This can make it a bit hard to make friends if you rely on talking to people in your classes to find people to socialize with. 
As far as the difficulty, there is a lot more information that you need to learn in each class, but there are fewer class hours per week, so there is more time to spend outside of class studying and completing assignments. Although it might feel like a big adjustment when you start, over time, you can figure out how you learn and study best, and things will start to feel pretty easy by the third and fourth year. I find it's also very important to get good at writing down all the assignments and tests and managing your time well so that you start well in advance for all the due dates.",Mentor

Hi Cohen,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I would like to apologise for the delayed response. Your message ended up in a different folder, and I didn’t notice until now. 
 
I’m thrilled to know that things are going well with you! Congratulations on getting the job! If you don’t mind sharing, could you tell me what kind of job did you get? Is it temporary or long-term? I’m curious to know what you’ve been working on these days. 
 
By the way, it’s interesting to know that I’m not the only one who associated your piece with Interstellar. Interstellar has very recognisable soundtrack. If you’re into sci-fi, it’s a cool film to watch. Although I wouldn’t say it’s my favourite. But hey, I watched it for Anne Hathaway. 😊
 
Yes, I believe your musical exposure could greatly contribute to your personal music style. Maybe one day your music will achieve the same recognition! Keep up the good work, and I have no doubt you’ll make a mark in the music world.  
 
I’m sure people were impressed by your presentation! You had the whole package, even for the cloth! I guess sometimes people don’t feel comfortable asking questions in public in general, as they fear to seem uninformed; or they assume certain questions are accepted as common knowledge in the musical field. What I would like to believe is that you explained everything perfectly well and eliminated their doubts.
 
Thanks for recommending Kraftwerk; I will definitely check them out. You have introduced many great jazz songs and I really appreciate you for that. I have always wanted to add more flavours to my playlist. 
 
Thank you for your kind words Cohen! I feel incredibly fortunate to have someone like you with whom I can share thoughts and ideas about music. Our discussions have been such a pleasure for me. Thanks for being a great mentee; it was such a pleasure. I have no doubt that a bright future awaits you! Make the most of this summer and have a blast! 
 
All the best,
Rosie

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s so great to hear about your trip and the success of your performances with the jazz band! I looked up Ashcroft on the map, it seems like a very small, quiet village with mountainous surroundings. 
 
Well, I guess not everyone appreciate sarcasm. At least he’s been more aspiring for the team during your big days, boosts the morale. 
 
I’m very impressed by your work! I believe this can be a great fit for a movie soundtrack! Such as a sci-fi film or an action movie. I hope you can somehow incorporate music production into your career plans, you would do great! 
 
I like how this piece is a rich combination of various colourful layers, and classical and modern musical elements. You have a very powerful intro as a starter; it helps to grab your audience’s attention. My favourite part starts from 0:48. The instruments and sound selections are very innovative, you choose well. I also wonder whether you get inspired from the movie Interstellar…? Haha! 
 
As for the project I designed for you, there’s no need to apologize. That was supposed to be a tiny “push” for you to pursue composing. I’m glad to see how well you did with your capstone, and the fact that you used your creativity to produce something with passion. 
 
Great work at your semester! I’m so proud that you’ve finished this project by yourself. I hope the presentation went well??? Did you get any good feedback from the others? 
 
Thanks for your kind words! I want to say congratulations one more time. Wish you have a restful and enjoyable summer! I appreciate you for allowing me to be a part of this joyful journey, and please write to me again if you ever want some advice or feedback, or even just wanna chat.

Hi Rosie,
 
I've come back from my trip from last weekend, where we performed in Ashcroft and stayed at Kumsheen Rafting Resort for a night. I should also mention that after that I performed my last ever show with the jazz band on Thursday. It was a good way to end the year, and I think the reason our shows went so well is because our teacher was noticeably nicer to us during setup and performance, which surprisingly enough has a positive effect. For every other performance he's been confusing or sarcastic and overall just demoralizing no matter how much he likes to praise us afterward, but at least now I don't have to deal with him as a teacher anymore. I had fun with the band but I think I'm just looking to relax now that summer's arriving, so I'm happy it's over.
Another, more important, thing to mention is that I finished my capstone. I'm sorry I didn't get to discuss more about it with you before I presented it, but on the plus side, I did upload my composition as a YouTube video. 
https://youtu.be/TBjMfCye2Dc
I'm happy with how it turned out. I've listened to it plenty of times, but I'm still pretty impressed by it, especially after recently showing it to people for the first time. I made it mostly just by experimenting and seeing what sounds good, so I'm happy that it turned out pretty good for something that I basically taught myself. 
 
Thank you for your help with this project of mine. I know the project itself was mostly just me alone, but having you to talk to about music and composition is something I haven't really had before, so it was very useful to have you as someone I could talk to about things I couldn't do with anyone else. Getting advice from someone who's graduated and pursued a post secondary-path in music is very handy as well.
I think I also also follow that up with an apology, however. Maybe you saw this coming, but I never managed to complete the project your organized for me. I have made other short compositions in my spare time, but none of them really match the theme that you gave me. I'm sorry that I didn't put my own effort despite the effort that you put into organizing this project for me.
My last day of school will be on Tuesday. I don't know when our contact gets cut off, but I imagine I'll be able to send one last message before I go. I look forward to hearing what you think about my composition. 
 
 
Talk to you later,

Hi Cohen,
 
Don’t worry about not getting back to me right away—I know how life can get a handful sometimes. Honestly, I am really pleased to hear about all the different things you’ve been up to lately! And it’s great to hear that you’re constantly making progress with your composition. Take as much time as you need to get it just right! 
 
I’m glad to hear that your capstone coworker also made a song for the graduation! They will be a great resource to talk about the process. Every capstone project is unique; I’m sure you’ll shine on the stage when the day comes! 
 
Hey congratulations on your upcoming show with the jazz band! Where are you heading to?? Did you have to postpone it because of the pandemic? I totally get the last-minute replace panic. I hope you get capable players as replacements. Plus, sounds like everyone in the band recognizes your solo skills! That’s so awesome! 
 
If you’re up for it, I’d love to hear more about what’s been going on with your teacher. Sounds like you guys had an unpleasant conversation. What makes you frustrated about your relationship? 
 
Anyway, take your time with everything! I don’t want you to feel stressed about the composition or anything like that. I’m really excited to hear it when you’re ready, and I know you’re doing an amazing job! 
 
Hope you enjoy your performance and ace it!

Hello
Sorry I took this long to get back to you, I was hoping to add a few touches to my composition to make it seem mostly complete (still missing a few parts of the melody). I think just need to wait a little longer until I get that burst of creative energy again. We've been doing non-capstone related activities in my careers class, so that probably why I haven't spent as much time engaging in composition lately, that and preparing for a trip I'm taking with the jazz band next weekend (so also keep in mind I'll be busy/exhausted with that).
I talked with a coworker who just happened to also make a song for his capstone and had the same teacher as mine, and his song was only a minute long (mine is nearly three). I still need to make a slide presentation to help my presentation, but other than I'm pretty confident my capstone will go well.
Also I thought I'd mention that today I did my first show with the jazz band since December. We had some issues with players leaving and being replaced last minute, so our song selection suffered a little, but aside from that it went alright and people said I soloed well. However my teacher was very frustrating to deal with and I almost considered walking out then and there. Just reminded me a bit of our conversation about our relationships between ourselves and our teachers/instructors.
Anyways, next time I message you I'll hopefully have something to show you (I think I said that last time too). Just know that because of my trip, it might come a little late again.
Have a good week

Hi Cohen,
 
Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! It’s so exciting to see you moving onto the next chapter in your life. Do you have any plans for after graduation? I remember when I graduated from high school, all I wanted to do was sleep for 3 days and have no one disturb me. 
 
I’m glad to hear that you have the Gender and Sexuality Alliance a try, even if it may not be your cup of tea. It’s great to be exposed to potential resources and new opportunities. 
 
You have come so far and achieved so much. I always enjoy talking to you about music and life in general. I see a lot of potential in you. Also, I know you’re very positive and passionate towards music history, composing, friendships, and critical thinking. I have no doubt that you will continue to excel in whatever you do. 
 
I’m sorry to hear that you might not have enough time for your presentation. I think presenting your composition is an important part, so I encourage you to showcase your hard work. Perhaps there is another way to arrange the structure? If you need help with trimming down your text or anything else, I’m more than happy to take a look at your presentation. Also, I think uploading your music to YouTube is a good idea—which is exactly what I did for my video audition for my university application. 

If you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss, just let me know!

Hello again,
Considering the fact that I'm graduating in less than a month, there's really no reason for me to try to start any clubs or anything like that, but even if I tried, I just don't think there would be enough people interested in any activities like that to keep the club running. I only remembered this now, but last year we had a Gender and Sexuality Alliance that would meet up every couple weeks in school that I visited a few times, and every time I went it just seemed like less and less were interested (I don't think they did it at all this year). There is also a community band outside of the school, but I don't think I'm as interested in playing concert band fanfare-type music and I'd rather have the free time to work or whatever else.
I think it would be a pretty popular opinion to say that the human voice is more expressive than any instrument. It's capable of singing any note, even ones outside of the western tuning system, and each voice is personalized to its owner. It can also be both melodic and percussive. Basically in my opinion it's more expressive in so many ways, but I'd still be interested to keep an open mind and hear any counterarguments on the topic.
I also thought about it more and I decided it's probably better to focus on just one composition for my capstone. My presentation has to be 10 minutes and the composition itself if just over 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and there are other things I talk about in it as well. Over all it just doesn't work. I also still need to share the (nearly finished) piece with you. I'm thinking of just uploading it to YouTube that way I can easily share it as a link. In the meantime I can share it with my friends at school to see how they see it from a casual perspective. In the end I'm sure my teacher will at least enjoy it.

Hi Cohen,
 
Thanks for sharing with me about what's going on in school. I totally get it - we're in a tough time economically and things are still recovering from the pandemic. I just want you to know that you're not alone in feeling disconnected from school.
 
But don't be too hard on yourself. Summer is coming, maybe you can take some time to reflect on your overall goals and aspirations. That’s what I am doing at the moment. I made a rough bucket list myself to help me figure out what I need to do to achieve my goals. For example, I want to be a volunteer teacher in Argentina in 3 years, so I'm working on my Spanish skills! It’s so difficult! I figure knowing the basics can be super helpful to communicate with the locals, even for bargaining purchases haha! So I am hoping to master basic grammar and high-frequency words (about shopping) in Spanish before next year. 
 
It kind of sucks that your school doesn’t have many clubs or extracurricular activities. Maybe talking to your counsellor or your teachers would help? They could help incorporate more hands-on learning or group projects for you. They might also know other cool activities or resources available that you are not aware of, such as art programs in the community. Additionally, have you thought about doing some volunteer work? I know some music organizations in Vancouver are always looking for volunteers. It's a great way to get involved. And it could be a great opportunity to share your perspectives with the public and get more jazz lovers involved.
 
Yes! I love that you are passionately exploring this genre and its cultural significance! Thanks for sharing your ideas about the expressiveness of jazz! If I may add to your points, I think improvisation also gives the artists plenty of space to create music authentically and freely. In this way, the audiences could find it easier to bond with the performer emotionally. 
 
While I agree that the control of the breath makes the instrumental sounds closer to the human voice, personally, I think piano and guitar can also imitate the act of “breathing.” Like my piano teacher often says, “Play it as if you’re singing out this piece.” 
 
From your idea, would you agree that the human voice is more expressive than musical instruments? And why? It’s always so nice talking to you! Now we have another interesting topic to discuss.   :)
 
Anyway, I like your thoughts on creating several small parts and integrating them into one! Don’t get restricted by the musical form. Let your creativity flow! 
 
Take care,

Hello
 
Right now, I only have two daily classes (not including jazz band) which means I'm only at school half the time now. The classes I do as well are also just not taught in an engaging way in my opinion, just lots of textbook reading or online modules. So basically, just only being there half the time and getting a lot of information from a book just make it harder for me to learn or feel connected. The reason I don't play my trombone at home is just because it's very loud in a non-soundproofed room and annoying to carry around, since I walk home a lot. Also, I'm in grade 12.
In my school, I don't believe there aren't many clubs that exist, let alone ones that I've been apart of. As well as jazz band, I also acted in musical theatre in grades 10-11, if that counts. I don't think I really like being a part of big group (my jazz band has maybe around 10 students present per rehearsal), nor do I like seeking out new people to talk to, so I don't really have an interest in joining a club. I don't have many interests outside of music and art either, so clubs just don't really work for me. I also wanted to point out that we don't actually have a choir anymore. It stopped when it was a concern for spreading covid and then I guess there wasn't enough interest to bring it back.

I'm pleased to see your interest in jazz music and history growing. Although, I don't know well I can explain it or how much if it I can explain to you. I would say jazz has a very interesting way of expressing emotion through instruments, though I wouldn't say it's better or worse than other genres (mostly because I don't understand the emotional sides of other genres yet). I think that, because they're played by breathing, an instrument like a saxophone or trumpet can feel more connected to the artist's voice and emotions than an instrument like guitar. There's a lot to go into about the history and development of the genre, and I'd probably just recommend watching videos online. I watched a PBS documentary spanning something like 8 dvds (which I never finished) that goes into a lot of detail, though probably isn't available to stream.
I was also wondering about the different conversion topics that this website has listed. My teacher said that we need to complete 3 of them, but they were not brought up in conversation and we've already talked about a lot that I didn't think there was a need to use them. I also just don't really know how they work. 
 
One more thing I'll mention is that I decided to expand my capstone idea a bit and try to create several, smaller compositions as opposed to one main one. I figured I don't know about composition enough yet to make a full piece, but I think I have enough creativity to try a few different things. It can also allow me to integrate our project into my capstone as well.
 
See you later

Hi Cohen,
 
I’m glad to hear that you’re doing well in school! When I was your age, math was definitely not my strong suit. I still sometimes have nightmares about taking math tests and waking up sweating! I’m sure your families and friends are very proud! By the way, could you remind me which grade you are at? 
 
Oh what makes you feel disconnected from class and trombone practicing? Do you feel more discouraged and unmotivated than before? If so, I'm here to listen if you want to share your thoughts.
 
Also, I am curious about whether you are part of any school clubs or groups at the moment. I think participating in school clubs or even establishing one are great ways to meet new people and potentially find a new passion in life! What interests you besides music and art? 
 
Thanks for your explanation! I am actually not aware of the fact that Jazz has contributed a great deal to the style of Rock, R&B, Pop and other genres. This is new to me! Do you think Jazz expresses emotions better than other forms of music? What gives it advantages? I'd love to hear more about the history and development of jazz from your perspective. 
 
I like the song Moanin you sent! It's a shame that you don't get to play it that often in the band. Maybe your teacher can consider adding the parts for the choir? 
 
It’s normal to feel uncertain about the future, but just remember that it's okay to take as much time as you need to figure things out. I’m glad that you’re able to stay calm. I see a lot of potential in you and I have faith that you will find your way. As for your composing block, don't be too hard on yourself. Sometimes creativity takes time and that's okay. Keep practising and experimenting, and know that progress doesn't have to come quickly. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
 
Best of luck in all your endeavours!

Hey Rosie
 
School is going fine. I'm doing well enough to get good grades but I still feel sort of disconnected from it at the same time. I often don't study outside of class or even practice the trombone outside of  band. It's also tough to say if I'm excited for summer, since I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. My two best friends are also staying in town for the foreseeable future so I think that will at least make staying in town more enjoyable. 
 
The question you pose is interesting, and probably more complex then I'm fit to give a highly thoughtful answer for. As a fan of music history, I think it's important to understand how significant jazz music is to pretty much any genre of music we listen to today. Jazz and the blues are what led us to rock and hip-hop, which is to pretty much anything you hear from the past century can be linked back to jazz or blues in some way. I also think it's just interesting to see how emotion can be expressed through an instrument without words. That's all I can think of right now, but let me know if you'd like me to elaborate more on anything.
 
We do still play a few instrumental tracks in jazz band that aren't pop hits or anything, though I can see why my teacher prefer to have more songs with vocals, just so that it's fair for the singers. I've requested one particular track all the way back in grade 10 that I really like, which my teacher bought, but since it's been sent in, we've played it exactly one time. It's another Charles Mingus song, I'll link it here if you're interested.

I really like how this song keeps building on itself overtime. It's something I realize now is a theme I like to hear in rock music, so it's cool that I had that interest before I even liked rock music. 
 
Thank you for your reassurance about the future. I'm definitely uncertain about what I'm going to do over the next few years, but I think I'll at least be able to stay calm about it. Even if I don't go to post-secondary at all, I can at least know that I didn't commit to something I wasn't ready for.
I've also had quite the block when it comes to composing lately. Just know that it may be a while before you hear of any progress from me. My final version of the project you gave me might not end up very long either. 
 
Take care

Dear Cohen,
I hope this email finds you well. There is no need to apologize for the delayed response. I understand how hectic school can be, especially as we approach the end of the term. Speaking of which, how is school going for you? Are you excited for the summer break?
 
I was delighted to hear that you're enjoying the rehearsals. Jazz music demands a great deal of skill and is undoubtedly more challenging than some of the pop songs we hear today. While not all songs can be defined as ""art,"" I do agree that pop songs have the advantage of being more catchy, straightforward and emotionally appealing. This brings me to a question for you to consider: suppose you want to introduce your friends or anyone to jazz music, what would your reasons be? How does jazz music challenge its audience, and how can one transcend the endless cycle of repetitive and brainwashing pop melodies? These are interesting topics to ponder, both casually and academically. Having noticed your remarkable observations about life and your eagerness for self-improvement, I believe you have the potential to become a future researcher or scholar. Why not discuss these ideas with your band teacher and see if he would consider adding one jazz piece to the repertoire?
 
I understand your predicament regarding the future. Rest assured that you're not alone in feeling uncertain or confused about your life's goals. As someone going through the same thing, I've come to realize that it's a long and challenging path to self-discovery. What I am trying to do is to take online courses, read more widely and stay open to my emotions to achieve a stronger sense of self-control and self-improvement. It's a process that takes time, but in due course, it will help reveal my true desires and aspirations. You might find these activities helpful too. In any case, I thought I'd share my experience to let you know that you're not alone in this journey.
 
I'm sorry to hear that the link didn't work. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to hearing your song!!! This is really exciting! 
 
Take good care of yourself. We will talk soon.
 
All the best,

Apologies for the slightly late response,
 
I've done a few rehearsals with the jazz band again. It's been slowly getting more fun overtime but I find we've only really been playing pop hits instead of more authentic jazz. It makes sense since we're focusing on getting ready to do shows again, but it makes me wonder how much people actually enjoy going to see a jazz band and they just play pop music. 
 
I've only really been interested in artistic things lately, but I haven't really been interested in an art-based career, so I don't know what I'll really do with my hobbies once I graduate. There's not really a lot to do with a trombone when you're not in a band. I honestly don't know what I'll do or learn in the future. It would be nice to learn an instrument, but it's a big financial commitment that I don't think I'll be able to handle.
Your advice helped me get a bit of an idea for my protect. I'm not really happy with what I've got going now, but I think I'll get there eventually.
 
Also a quick update. I tried to make a copy of that song I mentioned before so I could send it to you, but I don't think I can just send it to you as a link, so I'll have to find a different solution to show it to you.

I'll try to keep you updated

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s nice to hear from you. How are you feeling? Are you back to band practice? I’m sure your band teacher is very proud of you! You’re very committed and dedicated, and that’s a good thing!
 
I think working hard on your own doesn’t necessarily have a conflict with taking lessons. Yes I am aware that you probably gained more knowledge than other students in the class. When you know what you want to learn, you become very focused. But sometimes you are too focused on your own interests to see what else to explore out there. You may get interested in a concept they bring up in the class, or learn another perspective of thinking.
 
It’s amazing that you are into artistic things. I suck at drawing ever since I was a kid. Now that I am older, I still lose in Pictionary as people tend not to guess what I drew. I think I understand your concern. When I thought about playing the piano professionally as a career, I got overwhelmed as I worried that it could take the fun away. Have you thought about what you value in life? What do you want to become in the future? Is there anything that speaks to you or makes you eager to explore someday? What areas of your life do you want to grow in?
 
Have you read Shakespeare’s sonnet 18? There are a few lines I would like to quote from the poem:
“Shall I compare thee to a rainy day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
But thy eave's memory shall not fade”
 
It is not the rainy day he considered the most beautiful time, but the moment that they shared under the same eave, hearing the dropping of the rain.
 
If you are having problems with finding anything musically interesting about your hometown, perhaps you can start by making a list of descriptive small things that evoke your hometown. Like the road you walk home every day, the lights outside of your house, the stars in the sky, and the blossoms in the schoolyard. Then find out what you want to write about yourself, your valuable memories, your families and friends, or your personal growth, while making the connection between the land and your feelings. For example, in Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran, he didn’t spend too much time describing the “castle,” but the childhood memories he has filled with nostalgia for the old days. He’s included comfort, ease and warm surroundings that embraced his feelings of joy, perplexity, and disorientation. After that, I believe it would help to think about whether there is a style of music you associate with the place you have in mind in your hometown. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It's important to take the first step! 
 
I hope it helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss.

Hey again
 
I haven't really had the best experience with my band teacher, though it doesn't really have anything to do with my playing and more with organizing events that we play. I guess standards for a high school band are a lot lower, and he's actually pretty proud of me and the rest of the band. I'm wondering if I should bother taking lessons at some point if I'm already this committed to teaching myself. I think it would be harder just relearn everything I've been doing than to just stick with my own personal way and accept the fact that I'll probably never be able to read sheet music for piano. 
 
My hobbies are mostly just artistic things. I've done a lot of drawing, a few years of music and a couple years of theatre. I'd say I'm probably best at drawing since I've been doing it the longest, but I've never really done anything big like a painting or a sculpture and more just doodling on paper. Despite these being my main interests, I'm still very hesitant to make an actual career out of them, so I don't think I really have much more to say on this topic unfortunately.
As interesting as I found the concept to be, I've been having trouble with the project you've given me. I can't really find anything from my town interesting enough to me to make a song about, nor do I really know how to express feelings through music. I don't want to just ask you to give me a different project, but I think I just need a bit more to work with, like a specific musical element to include or something. 
Though I'm struggling with that, I started working a demo of mine that I'm thinking of turning into my capstone piece. It's not really like any of the music I've mentioned to be an influence. It sounds like a theme song to space or something. Again, I don't know how to share it through this messenger since I don't know if I can just send it through a link or if it's more complicated, but if I do figure it out, I'll show you. 
 
Talk to you later

Hi Cohen,
 
How nice to hear from you again! Yes, after you listen to a lot of music, naturally your brain develops your own distinctive musical sense and tastes, which sometimes allows you to predict the coming notes of a song. Also, music is a combination of sensibility and rationality. It contains expressive and emotional features, as well as internal structure and rules that you can follow. I think it’s very impressive that you have heard so many different kinds of music, started composing at such a young age, and continue enriching your hobbies.
 
You know surprisingly, I have read it somewhere that the dropout rate of piano students could be from more than 40% to sometimes 60%. Many piano learners refused to touch the instrument again once they had achieved a certificate or passed a certain level. Funny enough, most of my friends who learned piano all shared different yet similarly awful and pressured pasts. Some have given up for years once they have reached the highest level of the piano grading test because of their parent's expectations. I once wrote a story about my abusive piano teacher at the university for a course, and most of my classmates resonated with my experience. If you like I am happy to send you the short story as well. But yeah, piano learning could be painful. It’s not the most interesting instrument, I know. But it could be helpful for your composing!
 
Oh thanks for trusting me with your honest idea! You are right, a music degree costs a fortune. My parents absolutely agree with you, since they paid for my bachelor's. I understand that you prefer to develop your musicality first. Do you have other hobbies other than music? Would you like to turn one of your hobbies into a career? You don't have to figure out everything so soon. To tell you the truth, I don't even know what I want to do for a living. And I am 25! Everyone should be given time to do some inner search until they find their passion in life. However, speaking from my experience, college life forever changed me. This is a great opportunity to read widely and seek ideas from other fields of study. You have all the resources and a platform to express yourself and exchange ideas with other minds. For students like you, I'm sure that you would be a great candidate in many fields. 
 
I'm just thinking out loud. You don't have to agree with me. Let me know if you would like to continue on this topic or not. I don't want to put on too much pressure. This is, after all, a question for you and you only. 
 
Have you decided on the theme for our music program? Is there anything you would like to share that you have in progress? Message me if you need any help or have any questions!

Hello Rosie
I watched the video of Bobby McFerrin you sent. In fact, I actually watched it in my band class all the way back in grade 10. I find it interesting how something like scale patterns are something we subconsciously learn overtime as we casually listen to music. I also find that it's a skill I'm slowly developing as I learn piano and theory, where I can almost guess where the next note of a scale or chord will be before I actually learn it.
 
As I learn more about music history, I listen to more music from other parts of the world. I like how instruments from places like Turkey have unique notes that aren't commonly heard in western music, and I also like when instruments from other parts of the world are incorporated into western-style compositions (like the sitar being included in some of the more experimental Beatles songs). I usually get interested in experimental bands because they often do this, but it also works vice versa, where I can get into music from other parts of the world because of how they're incorporated into music I listen to. Basically what I'm getting at is that I'm personally more familiar with different styles of music than most, but I still understand that it's not like that for everyone, which is why I'm more hesitant to recommend experimental pieces to casual listeners. Calling music a language is also interesting just because it makes me realize that in a way, it's almost like I've learned another language on my own without even realizing it. 
 
As for my future in music, I don't really have anything planned. A career in music is very expensive, so it's not something I really want to jump into unless I know I'm both capable and passionate enough, and as much as I enjoy listening and learning about music, I'm not as passionate when it comes to playing an instrument. Composition is something I'm interested in because in the modern age, I can make an entire song with equipment that I already own like a computer or a keyboard, and I can make it independently. But I became a musician pretty late in my life compared to most. I took piano lessons at a young age, but it didn't really click with me and I gave up pretty quickly. I think I'd want to a lot more time to develop my musical abilities before I try to make a career out of it. For now, I just plan to stay here and work more until I find a post-secondary course I'm comfortable with. There's only one college in my town with a very limited course selection, so I'd also probably have to move somewhere else for anything post-secondary related, which I'm not eager to do. Right now, music is pretty much just a hobby to me.

Hi Cohen,
Thanks for your message. I’m glad to know that you’ve made a few demos on Garageband! That’s awesome! I think your idea about the capstone is achievable, as long as you decided what you would like to put into your work.
Horns! Cool! That’s a very innovative and unique choice for your music. I really look forward to it!
Plantasia gives me a very groovy but at the same time bizarre feeling... in a good way of course. Apparently,  the whole album of Mother Earth’s Plantasia was designed for plants! Suddenly it makes more sense to me haha. I don't know about plants' preferences. I wonder if anyone has experimented with their growth to see if they thrive better. 
Speaking of your post-secondary pursuit, I realized that we barely touched on that topic. Do you have anything in mind? If you have plans for university, what would you like to study? If you prefer to work first, what kind of career are you looking for? I remember how much you enjoy learning history, composition and music theory, could it be any one of them?
Have a nice weekend!

Hi
 
I wish I could say I did something interesting during my break, but nothing comes to mind. I started playing Animal Crossing again, went on a few walks and met up with a friend, but that's all I can remember doing. 
I probably should have mentioned this sooner, but I haven't really made a full composition yet. There a few things I've made on Garageband that I'm proud of enough to share, though I don't really know how to work with files and such so I don't know how to send them to you. For my capstone composition, I've discussed it a bit with my teacher, and my goal is just to create something around 2-3 minutes long with some sort of digital software. I don't have my own laptop currently, but I'm hoping to get my hands on one soon, and once I do, I'll worry about what software to use. 
Recently I've been listening to this one piece by Charles Mingus, my favourite jazz composer, which I'll put a link to here (and no, I don't know what the title means)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbdx-jR3a8U 
I think this song blends a more traditional style of composition with jazz in a way that I really enjoy. It's also a pretty long song, but I think just listening for a few minutes should be enough to get the idea of it if you're not interested in the whole thing.
This makes me want to try composing something that may sound sort of like this in the sense that it fuses music from older and newer eras. I think it mostly depends on what instrument selection is available on whatever software I end up using. Something like garageband has a good selection of instruments used in rock or electronic music, but if I wanted to write a part for horns, I'd probably have to use something with a better selection that what garageband has. Perhaps I could also create a classical-esque piece using electronic sounds (similiar to Mort Garson's Plantasia, if you've ever listened to that). Overall, I think the idea of making a song out of old and new styles of music is a good starting point for me to find more songs that use this idea (I can think of quite a few just off the top of my head).
I haven't watched the video you sent me yet. I think I'll just have to come back to that topic in my next message after I've watched it and put some more thought into the topic. Right now I'm focusing on getting ready to start my capstone and other schoolwork that I need to catch up on, sorry. Though I do agree on the idea that music is a ""universal language"" in some ways, which I can talk about more in my next message as well (right now I'm just trying to finish this before class ends).
When the year ends, I think I will stop using the mentoring program. I'm mostly using this for my capstone, and I don't even really expect to continue in music studies in post-secondary, So I don't have much of a reason to keep using it.
Talk to you later,

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s so glad to hear from you! Since you have been home for two weeks, have you done anything interesting? Like read a nice book, watched a show or played some video games? Yeah the weather could have been better. Don’t worry, summer is on the way! It’s slowly approaching, but on its way.
 
Thanks for your recommendations again! Yeah this time I think I prefer A Walk To Remember. I can’t tell how much I love the sound of the saxophone coming out in the second half. May I ask what kind of music you usually compose? Do you usually come up with a theme first, then add choir progressions and extend your theme to a whole piece? Have you thought about writing a chorus or an ensemble that has multiple parts? I always admire people who put down the ideas they have in their minds in the search of inspiration.  
 
Interestingly enough I also wonder how come people develop different musical tastes and sometimes prevent them from taking in new music. I think there are roughly three points—I don’t want to turn this letter into academic research haha.
 
First, the melodic expectation of course. I have read a study about how people from different countries react differently to a same piece of melody and have various predictions regarding how the rest of the music goes. The truth is, immersed in the Western music structure, you might find yourself lost when you hear, for example, traditional Indian music. You might not “understand” or get enjoyment out of their music, not because of the language barrier, but because of lack of cultural knowledge and more immortally, the fact that your brain does not respond to certain kinds of music if it’s not familiar with it, which could increase the difficulty for you to appreciate it. Hey speaking of which, there is a video of Bobby McFerrin, a great musician and his interaction with the audience I would like you to watch. Are you familiar with the pentatonic scale? How do you respond to something musically new? Wait till you watch the video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk
 
The second reason could be the “language issue.” What’s your stand on the saying “music is a universal language”? You know I wrote a paper in regard to this arguable statement? Undeniably, music and language do share interlocking elements, such as they could both be exclusive, they can both be used for communication, and they both, in a way, have syntax, grammatical structure, and sentences. So if you take a look at music from a linguistic perspective, it gets more interesting. Think of us as two people who cannot communicate through the language of jazz, I think it helps to acknowledge that not everyone understands jazz/classical music/Western music.
 
These are my theories. You raised a fascinating question. I encourage you to dig deeper! 
 
One thing I would like to discuss with you is that, accordingly, our last interaction will arrive soon. If you wish, we may continue working through the program, or chat about music, life, post-secondary, even movies… anything, when the class is over. I’m happy to keep our mentoring relationships active. If not, that’s fine as well. Let me know!
 
No rush to your project! The deadline is not a problem. My intention was to give you a little push onto the track of composing, which is something you always wanted to do but I don’t know if you have started yet. So I think this could be a great opportunity for you to take the (first?) step. If you don’t have anything in mind, you can always get inspiration from your favourite songs or bands, and see how their songs are structured and what you like about them.
 
Enjoy your week! Hope the weather gets better.

Hello again,
Spring break was alright. I didn't work a lot, but the weather wasn't as good as I was hoping, so I mostly just stayed at home. I have thought about starting a band, but my lack of variety when it comes to playing instruments makes me think it's unlikely. 

I'm glad you liked most of my music recommendations. Vulfpeck in particular is a band that I'd recommend to pretty much any musician (that seems to be their biggest audience). I think they strike a good balance between being accessible and very skilled and creative. A couple other songs I'd recommend are ""Tee Time"" and ""A Walk To Remember"".

I'm also kind interested in hearing about how you didn't understand one of the songs. It makes me realize how the way I see music is different based off what I'm used to listening, and I'd probably have the same reaction if you showed me some classical piece I've never heard of.
For your warm-up project, I'm having a bit of trouble finding motivation to actually make music, but that's probably because I've been bored at home alone for two weeks and I haven't played in jazz band for a month. I should be playing again on Tuesday so I'll see how I'm feeling after that. I think I'll just prioritize making something simple to present to you, and if I like it enough, I can work on it more as my capstone project.
My approach to learning piano is a little unusual. I haven't learned anything from anyone else in terms of how to actually play the piano, and I've really only been learning music theory more than anything else. Since I'm mainly focusing on composition, I haven't learned how to play songs as much as I've learned about different chords or scales, which I've learned either through random YouTube videos or just from personal discoveries. I guess that's how I'm trying to challenge myself with it.
 
Have a nice week

Hi Cohen,
 
How’s your spring break? Did you do anything fun? My friend and her band invited me to see their show next week and I really look forward to it! They have started this band 10 years ago. I have always wanted one myself!!! Are you thinking about starting a band with your friends perhaps?
 
Thank you for your awesome tips! You know what? You’re absolutely correct, Blue Rondo à la Turk is my favourite piece out of the three songs you recommended. One thing I found about the form of this rondo interesting is how playful the song is structured, with a repeatedly appearing theme and continuedly changing chorus. I love the series of variations it presents. It’s going in my playlist!!!
 
Oh and I love the second one as well. It’s so chill and funky. The middle part of the song is absolutely dazzling in terms of a funny baroque and fantastical merge. It reminds me of Bach’s fugue I used to play, but with way less austere counterpoint and an emphasis on the colour of the layers. I wonder if that part was an original work or if they had it re-adjusted to fit in the song. Plus I just love the arrangement of the instruments. Wait I think this one is also my favourite. Now I have three favourite jazz songs including Angela! Thanks to you!
 
By the way, I am listening to their Simple Step when I am writing. I followed Vulfpeck on Spotify haha!
 
It might sound weird but when I listen to God Bless The Child, I was more, nervous than relaxed. As the following lines are always supremely unpredictable for me. I wasn’t sure what to “grab on” as the lack of a stand-out theme for me, and I don’t know how to “understand” the piece as I don’t get what the song is about… if that makes sense. This song is a very unique combination since seemingly they put all the individually structured sections together. I failed to find the correlation. I think I need to clear my mind and abandon my established mindset before entering the world of jazz.
 
I do appreciate your recommendations and your suggestions for a jazz newbie like me. I’ve learned a lot from you. It’s a whole new world to see out there. Thank you Cohen!
 
As for the activity, if you want to turn it into a capstone project, no problem! You don’t have to decide now, as long as you pick something that brings you passion and motivation. Honestly, I am very happy that you found it interesting, proving that it was well worth the effort!!!
 
Oh I also wonder how you continue learning the piano. Are you taking courses online? I did piano performance at university. I can’t make any promises, but if you have any questions or encounter any difficulty in regard to piano practice, I’ll try my best to help.
 
Let me know if you have any ideas about our next activity and the topics for discussion. It doesn’t always have to be music related. Feel free to shoot me a message. 
 
Enjoy your weekend!

Hello,
Don't worry about the late response. I actually started spring break the day after I sent my last message so I wasn't really expecting to do anything school related anyway. During all the spare time I've been having fun just learning more about playing chords and scales on piano. The jazz band went on hiatus a while ago so the band teacher could focus on the musical theatre production he was also directing, so I haven't actually played the trombone for at least a month now. 
 
My tip for getting into beginner's jazz is to probably just check out an artist on a streaming platform and listen to their most streamed songs. I think the ones that most people will check out are their more simple or relaxing ones, even if they still have some more complex/experimental pieces (though this isn't always the case). I'll provide links to some of my recommendations:
https://youtu.be/mZNEEKtA8hU (Not sure if the link works by default or if it needs to be copied and pasted sorry)
This is a song that has been covered quite a lot, but I think this is one of the more popular instrumental covers. It's pretty mellow and minimalist, so it's easy to listen to, but it still sounds incredible to me and I even considered it to be my favourite song for a while. 
 
https://youtu.be/3RGoXZvuUBw
 
This one's more on the funkier side. Though they're very modern, they were the first band that I became passionately interested in, so I thought they were worth sharing. I thought you'd like this song in particular because of its classical influences. 
 
https://youtu.be/vKNZqM0d-xo
 
Admittedly, this one's not very simple. It starts off in an odd time signature and a bit of a complicated rhythm and later begins experimenting with meter changes. However, despite this I think it can still be enjoyed from a casual perspective. Though it's complicated, it's not too chaotic and is only played by four instruments. I also thought you'd like to hear something piano-based and this was the only artist I could think of. 

That's all I'll give you for now. Let me know what you think of them.
Also, related to your warm-up activity, I know it's only supposed to be a warm-up, but the concept of it seems interesting enough that I'm considering making it my capstone project, since I didn't have a specific plan other than to make some sort of composition. I'll think about it more though.

Hi Cohen,
 
Thank you for your response! I apologize for the late reply. I lost track of time while trying to design a musical activity that could be fun for us.
 
Your story is very interesting to read. Unfortunately, after almost twenty years of classical music training, I have always found jazz hard to understand because I have a very different mindset and musical expectations while listening to jazz songs. I think my favourite song is Angela (Theme From Taxi), and I like it because it’s not a typical jazz song. Would you mind recommending several jazz pieces you like, you know, beginner-friendly? I'd love to hear about your list :)
 
It's amazing that you’re learning piano by yourself. I tried learning the violin on YouTube and it wasn’t easy. I don’t know how long my roommate can stand me making the sound like constantly stepping a cat on its tail. From what I see, you are very self-regulated and courageous!
 
I’ve noticed that you’re trying to make music on GarageBand, and your ultimate goal is to continue playing the piano and composing. Therefore, I came up with an activity that encourages you to continue composing. I hope you’d enjoy it! 
 
Warm-up Activity 
Introduce your city/hometown/community/school to your friends! 
Purpose: 
Explore the city landmarks (it can be your hometown, a local store you like, your school, etc.) through soundscape composition. Think about how you would like your audience to know about a place you love or have a lot of memories at. 
Method: 
You may use the attached websites or music apps to record “the sound of your city.” Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the listed apps, you can also keep track of your work by making the vocal and/or instrumental part(s) and recording it with your phone. 
Your work can be a combination of the sound your gather in the city and a simple melody you compose. Or you can find a beat and a musical style you like, and then create a demo. Or, go bold! The world is your oyster. 
Length:
It doesn’t have to be long. Even 8 bars would be fine. 
 
Anchor Texts
Since you have an interest in music-making and composition, I would like to recommend several websites/apps that allow you to record your own musical ideas. Feel free to explore these websites/apps!
 
GarageBand (Recommend)
You can make your own collaboration of audio. It’s beginner friendly. Try mixing the soundtracks of different instruments! (Requires Mac to download.)
 
MuseScore 3 (Recommend)
You can write down your music score here. Try to create your first music sheet! 
 
Soundtrap (Recommend)
You can create your own musical projects and podcasts.
https://www.soundtrap.com/home/creator/projects
 
Bandlab 
It’s a music platform for you to record songs, remix, and collaborate music with others.
https://www.bandlab.com/
 
Music Tech Teacher (Recommend)
It’s a website about notes, rhythms, musical theory, etc.
https://www.musictechteacher.com/music_learning_theory/music_learning_theory.htm
 
Discussion Questions (Remember to tell me!)
How would you like your music to be structured? 
What do you want your audiences to learn from your musical work? 
What is the most challenging part of this project?
 
Completing Conversations (track the progress)
Don’t worry about the deadline! You may take 4-6 weeks to finish this program. If you need more time, let me know! 
In the meantime, I would like you to:
1. Keep me updated so I can track your progress weekly. You don’t have to share your work with me if you’re not ready yet. But please let me know what you are working on and the progress you make every week. 
2. Please let me know if you need any support or have any questions. I hope you can have fun through music making! 
3. Don't forget to answer the discussion questions! 
4. Let me know which topic you would like to have a further discussion with me! If you have any ideas about the musical program you would like to work on, send them my way!
 
Cheers,

Hi Rosie,
I'm doing well. Playing the trombone is fun, especially in jazz, though honestly, I only became a musician due to coincidence. My middle school was very crowded, and so there wasn't much flexibility when it came to picking an elective, so when I randomly got placed into band, there wasn't a good chance of getting out. Fortunately, around the time I started, I was also begining to get into jazz and funk music of the 60's-70's, which got me interested in signing up for jazz band for my high school years.
I wouldn't say my experience playing as a musician has directly influenced the music I listen to, though I find myself enjoying jazz compositions in particular after learning jazz trombone and learning about soloing and such. I like discovering new music constantly, mostly by experimental artists. It's also really fun to find very obscure artists. Currently I'm going back to my roots and listening to more jazz and funk that I didn't get into right away, or listening to my old favourites again now that I have the musical knowledge to better understand the compositions. My favourites from these genres are John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Sly Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic, though my absolute favourite is probably Stevie Wonder, and that's just for a select few genres from a certain era.
Aside from music itself, I also like learning about music history, such as the evolution of a genre, or just the story of a particular band, even if it's not one I really listen to. My wide knowledge of different bands despite my young-ish age seems to impress my music teacher. That being said, I can still only play the trombone well, and I'm only in the beginning stages of learning piano and composition. I've been teaching myself piano just by playing around in my spare time with the knowledge of basic music theory I've learned from band class and on my own. I've also used Garageband on my phone just to make short compositions and learn about melody and chord progressions.
My plan for my capstone is to keep learning piano and composition enough for me to make a complete song for my presentation, which is why it's the only information I could really think of to put on my profile. So whatever you have to say about that I'd love to hear. Since you like both classical and modern music, I'm wondering if you've learned about any similarities they might have with each other from a composition perspective (if that makes sense). I'd also be happy to answer more questions you have about my interests in music, since it's not something I really talk about in-depth with my friends who aren't as interested in the composition/history side of music as I am.
Talk to you later.",Mentee

Hello Cohen,
 
It’s so great to hear from you! How are you doing? What is it like to be a trombonist in a jazz band? This is so cool! I’ve only played the piano, ukelele, a little bit of flute and French horn I’ve learned from YouTube (definitely not my thing), but never the trombone. I would like to hear more about your musical story! 
 
I’m into many music genres. It’s probably related to my musical background. I started to play the piano when I was very little. I played the piano and the French horn in the orchestra. I was also part of the choir at the university. So it’s not surprising that I like classical music and symphonies right? Maybe people might consider it boring but I think for people who understand musical form structure, it’s really fun to analyze!! If you are interested in pursuing a higher degree related to music, I encourage you to try exploring basic chord progression and music form structure. It could be a bit boring at first, but it’s a great stepping stone for you to be able to compose one day, as well as to gain a better understanding of music. One of my favourite artists of all time is Brahms. If you look into his works you can see how amazing he combines both rationality and emotions in a certain music frame. Let me know if you would like to have a further discussion in regard to this topic! 
 
Other than instrumental and choir music, I like pop songs as well, except for rap songs I guess (sorry…). For example, I like Coldplay. I’m going to their concert in September! I also like Green Day, Pink, Linkin Park, and Maroon 5; I also like a lot of Disney songs, the old Taylor Swift, Lauv, and Adele. And this is only the short version of my answer. 
 
I found it amazing that you’re trying to pursue a musical degree or something related to music in the future. It’s a wild field; anything is possible for a talented young man like you. I would like to know more about your interest and what you would like to talk about in the future! 
 
I would love to learn more about the musicians who inspire you musically and in life! And I would like to know more about your pursuit after high school. I think perhaps we can start with something small. Perhaps you could pick out the questions you like and tell me about them?
 
Discussion Questions (all optional)
Tell me about your favourite musicians!
Who are the musicians who inspire you musically and in life?
Tell me about your experience in the jazz band! 
Do you have a favourite song? If you could, what kind of music you would like to recommend to your friends?
How did the musicians inspire you? In what way did they encourage you to pursue your musical dream?
Have you worked on any musical projects in school? Did you enjoy it?
What makes you want to learn about educating adults with mental disabilities?
Have you thought about getting into the educational field?
Are you still practising piano and guitar? Do you have a favourite piece?
 
Feel free to write to me anytime when you have a question or a topic you would like to talk about! Looking forward to talking to you again!
 
Best Wishes,

Hello, and thank you for being my mentor. I'm not entirely sure what we'll end up talking about, since I don't have any current plans for post-secondary, but I am interested in communicating with someone who has studied music. Since we're matched because of our interests in music I'm wondering what music you are into, and more specifically, what your composition influences are?",Mentee

Hi Jen! How are you so far? Can’t believe it’s already April. Did anyone you know play April Fools pranks?
A: No haha. It was just a regular day. A good day to recharge my battery from the Easter weekend. Did you do anything or are you not a Easter fan?
Q1: I think I know what you’re talking about. My friend went to Japan and I saw that her hair stylist recommended like a balayage but at the bottom. It looks really cool. Did the hair stylist not bleach your hair? I can see how the colour would be different if they didn’t bleach it or if they didn’t want to bleach it too much. When I went to a silver grey colour, my hair was fried. After a few days, it became super frizzy because I had to bleach it a ton. I used to keep it long until a few years ago when I accidentally cut it shorter than I usually do. I realized I liked it better because my hair dried so much quicker + it was a little wavy when it was shorter + and it had more volume. My hair is super thin and it gets oily quickly soooo having shorter (a little longer than shoulder length) hair helps me with those issues. I never style because I don’t know how. I like being low maintenance. My friends usually style their hair to have some waves. I’m lucky cause after I entered university, my hair went from super straight to naturally slightly wavy. Idk what happened.
A: I think she mentioned it, but I wasn't paying attention because I wasn't really ""braining"" at the time lol. She did use a tool to put stuff in my hair however. Oh nice :D It can due to hormones and I think the environment you live as far as I know?
Q2: What would you say represents your generation? I’m at that weird spot where I could watch movies on cassette tapes, but I also used a lot of CDs.
A: Good question, I guess maybe the XBOX 360 and old video games :p
Q3: I already want to go back to Japan. I want to check out Korea and Taiwan first. After that, back to Japan. The good thing I realized is that, compared to traveling to other places, Japan is relatively cheap. The conversion rate right now is great for us.  The hotels aren’t as expensive compared to Canada. The cost of one meal here lasted me an entire day (3 meals) in Japan.
A: Yooooo, awesome!
Q4: I don’t remember. I think Shrek had really good songs that fit their scenes.
A: Lol, my bad. I was gonna mention the cover of ""Hit Me Baby, One More Time"".
Q5: Ahah so have I. I’m prob gonna pass on watching it, but the memes are really funny. Recently, I keep seeing memes about a game called “You’re not my neighbour”.
A: Lol.
Q6: Yesterday was my last day with the kitties : ( very sad. Their names are Bonnie and Clyde. Bonnie is the black cat and Clyde is the grey one. Bonnie likes to run out and roll around in the hallway when I open the door lol. I get a workout whenever I have to drag her back in. She also bites and scratches. Very moody cat. Clyde is super sweet. He was shy at the beginning. By the end, he was following me around and meowing at me. I’d sit there and read a bit before I left. He’d always sit beside me and chill.
A: Awh :( That sucks. Love the names though!
QOTD: Do you have pets? If not, then would you ever get one?

Hi Jen! Hope you’re doing well. How did your mani-pedi and hair appointment go? Did you get a balayage? I cut my hair a few days ago myself : ) it’s pretty short now about an inch below my shoulders. I love how quickly it dries after a shower lol
A: Hi! My mani-pedi went well :) My hair appointment went good as well lol. It's kindaaa like a balayage? (it was done at the bottom of my hair if you were confused haha) It's like a orangey-brown color (I think it was supposed to be honey-blonde but the hair dresser said my natural hair was too dark to do so, lol. It was orange when I came out of the salon but it started to change so it's now like a caramel brown? Not complaining though, haha!) but cool about your hair! Do you always cut your hair short and do you style it at all?
Q1: Yeah, I think that’s what makes it a popular merch item tho cause not many people use CDs or vinyls. That way, it’s supposed to be “special”
A: Hmm yeah, good point! I like to think that each generation has something special that represent different things that happened in their life.
Q2: Weirdly enough, I was more worried about my law exam than my cost accounting exam. I did horribly in cost accounting but way above the average for law. So weird. It’s really making me wish I went into Law than accounting ahaha.
A: Ahhh, exams. That sucks, though. I wish you success :)
Q3: I got a monitor arm too and installed it over the weekend. Now I can fit two monitors on one desk. It’s super handy and makes it convenient to look stuff up while I’m doing schoolwork or gaming. Or even when I’m watching youtube, I can google other stuff.
A: Yo, that sounds cool!
Q4: It reminds me of when I was in Japan. They had a miniature world. I didn’t go cause the area was inconvenient but the pics online are cool.
A: That's awesome! Would you ever go back to Japan? I've heard lots of good things about Japan and I'm thinking to go see for myself someday, but it must be really expensive!
Q5: I think 4/10 is an appropriate rating. Definitely wouldn’t watch it again. It’s kinda sad how the series went from being so good to what it is now. I’m open to hearing it if you want to explain it!
A: I forgot about most of the movie except the song at the end ROFL (if you know, you know)
Q6: Did you watch the remake of Avatar the last Airbender? I didn’t watch it myself but I watched a review of it on Youtube. It’s honestly so disappointing. I watched the movie years ago and that was absolutely terrible. I know some people said it’s at least better than the movie but that’s not hard to do considering how bad it was.
A: Ah, I don't think I've watched the remake yet but I've seen memes of it going around XD
Q7: I’m babysitting my neighbour’s cat for the next week so I might send you a pic or two when I go see them : )
A: For sure! Please do :)

Intro: Hi Jen, I’m doing well. Thanks for asking! Got any plans for this week? I got a few assignments due on Wednesday but I’m meeting a friend on Friday for some udon. He also came back from Japan about a month ago, so this is our chance to catch up. Last year, I got a CD + Vinyl set from a game I played. My friend got me a vinyl player for my birthday so I could use it (I think I previously mentioned it). But the set still isn’t here. I’m pretty sure I ordered it almost an entire 12 months ago ahhhhh
A: Hey! I got a mani-pedi today, and I'm gonna get together with my friends tomorrow and then I'm gonna get my hair done!!! Oh that's cool! Hope you had a good time :D Niceeee, I don't see a lot of people using CDs or vinyls anymore, lol.
Q1: Thank you! Still no information on my results. I’m hoping it’ll be good (or passable at least loool).
A: Keeping my fingers crossed for you!
Q2: I GOT THE OFFER WEEEEEE. So excited. I’m doing the onboarding right now. I won’t start until May so I got plenty of time to prepare. Only downside is that their office is like an hour away. Yeah, it’s an accounting thing. Even though I found an internship for this summer, I guess I still gotta do the applications for a job starting next year lol.
A: Congratulations!! Sorry to hear about the distance, though.
Q3: I never watched Ninjago. My friend got me the lego Harry Potter game. I haven’t played it yet. I think it was Lego day (???) if that’s a thing a few days ago? Maybe last week? The lego store near me was handing out pins and there was a huge line.
A: Fair enough XD. That's neat! I don't think I've been to events like that lol.
Q4: I 100% agree. I haven’t watched the third movie, but the first and second one was so well done. I felt like it had a good blend of humour and plot. The villains were impressive, and their motivations made sense. Someone told me they heard good things about Kung Fu Panda 4 before I went to go watch it. Girl lied. I’ve only seen criticisms about the same thing you noticed. I feel like the villain in the fourth movie barely used her powers. Her motivations didn’t make much sense. Her plan was really weak. 
In the later half of the movie, every villain from the previous movies shows up but they didn’t even do anything. Sooo disappointing. Even after so many movies, Po didn’t change. I think a good animated movie that shows the main character growing up would be How to Train Your Dragon. I haven’t watched the last movie from that series tho I have heard what happens.
A: Yeeeah, I went with my younger sister a couple days ago and we though it was meh. I give it like a 4/10.
Q5: Oh, wow but is the story complete? Season 3 is short. I guess the long episodes kinda make up for it. Some shows I’ve watched, there are 12 episodes in one season, but they make each episode around 10 minutes.
A: It is, but fans seem to speculate that there's more to the story than what's been shown. (kinda difficult to explain lol)

A: I'm alright, you?
Q1: After I finished my midterm, I went out to do some errands, so I ended up passing out as soon as I got home. All I can say is wow that test was something all right. On the bright side, I’m finished my exams! On the downside, the assignments are never ending.
A: Oh yeah, congrats on your exams and sorry to hear about your assignments. It can be difficult.
Q2: Also, I’m hopefully getting good news today. I did my interview on Tuesday then on Wednesday morning, I got a background check request. I was a little surprised because I’ve never gotten that request before getting an offer. Usually, it’s only after that they check from my experience. I got a call from the company around 2 but I was doing my midterm. They should be getting back to me today. Fingers crossed that it’s an offer.
A: I hope you get it!
Q3: I'm also looking at the BIG4. Idk if you've heard of them but they're top accounting companies. They're hiring right now but positions for next year. Like some don't even start until next year September which is crazy to me lol. That's so far in advance. Who knows what I'll be doing around that time.
A: Nope, I don't think I've heard of that haha.
Q4: Ohh yeah I think I heard about New Jeans doing a collab with them. I’m not 100% sure because I’m not a big fan of their music. What other shows did you use to watch when you were younger? I read the Owl house for my children’s lit class. I didn’t know there was a show for it.
A: Yeah, like I mentioned before, I have not heard much about them. I think I've watched Ninjago, LEGO Friends and I think that's all I can remember for now. I will update if I can think of anymore lol. I actually didn't think they had a book until now haha! But yes, there's a show but only has 3 seasons :( 3rd season only has 3 episodes and they are around 40 mins.
Q5: I know! No regard for the cats at all. It reminded me of my old place. I used to live near an old man with a blind dog. The dog ended up that way because he fed them chocolate : ( which I heard you’re absolutely not supposed to do.
A: That sucks, I'm sorry :(
Q6: What did you think of it? My friends and I were kinda disappointed in Kung Fu Panda 4. I won’t spoil anything in case you want to watch it in the future, but basically we thought it had a lot of untapped potential. Compared to the previous films (idk if you’ve watched them), the fourth movie was disappointing.
A: It was pretty good. I don't really mind if you give spoilers or not, don't think I'm gonna watch it due to a lot of videos I've been seeing on people giving reviews and it's not exactly good reviews either. But it could be because I feel that the 4th one didn't necessarily live up to their legacy as much as the other 3 did.
Q7: Do you have a favourite youtube channel or any channels that you recommend?
A: I don't currently, sorry :( I will update if I can

I remember my sister had a persistent cough for nearly half a year. Luckily, it’s healed now but my mom and I were wondering wtf was going on.

A: I think I distinctively watched Powerpuff Girls, but like in clips and short videos and also through a k-pop band named ""NewJeans"". I've heard of Danny Phantom, but never watched it. iCarly, watched it briefly but not a lot. But I mostly watched what was on cable at the time as a kid. And also recently I've been watching videos and clips about the Owl House and it's pretty cool.
Q2: Yeah, I think milk products are bad for cats (despite shows always showing them drinking milk). It wasn’t like a little bit or anything but the lady kept going back with spoonfuls of cake. Plus, their cake box was covered in cream and the cats were eating out of that. It was kinda awkward cause, in my friend’s review, the owner replied and kinda blamed us? Saying we should’ve protected the cats. We did try to stop them and we told an employee after but they kept doing it.
A: Goodness, people these days.
Q3: Did you watch Dune yet? I’ve been seeing the popcorn bucket everywhere lol. Are you planning on getting it? I’m going to the theatre on Sat to watch Kung Fu Panda 4.
A: Yes! Me and my best friend went on Thursday :D No, we didn't get the Dune bucket lol. Cool, hope you have fun!
Q4: What have you been up to recently? For me, I decided I wanted to get back into writing. I’ve been working on a short story and, if it turns out well, I might try to get it published!
A: Not a lot currently, haha. Good luck with your book!

Hey Jen! Finally replying on time loool
Wow, that must be some cold. It’s been here for so long. Hopefully, it’ll be gone sooner than later. I remember my sister had a persistent cough for nearly half a year. Luckily, it’s healed now but my mom and I were wondering wtf was going on. 
She said it was cause people at school were constantly sick so she kept catching the same cold over and over again.

Hey Jen! Thanks for your patience again lol. I had an exam this week, one next week, and another one after that : ( I swear, I was gonna reply on Thursday. I looked at the calendar and it was somehow Friday already then, I accidentally fell asleep and here I am ahhaha. My mom went back to her hometown to visit her grandparents so I’ve been doing all the cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. That might be why I’m so tired. I love grocery shopping but it can be so hectic.
A: It's okay I understand, same to you.
Q1: How’s your cold now?
A: Still here to stay for a while lol.
Q2: OMGGG everyone I mentioned Miffy to never watched it other than my one friend lol. I mean I also really liked watching Pengu.
A: ROFL, you just unlocked another childhood memory of mine :D Thank you!
Q3: How was the dinner? I went for dinner at the Japanese place and wow it was expensive. Since it was a tapas, you were supposed to order a lot of smaller dishes and share them. We did but the portions were so small while they were also expensive. I was still hungry when I got home. Also, I got a drink and it ended up being like $18 for one.
A: It was good. Sounds expensive!
Q4: When I went to the cat café, I saw some people feeding the cats their cake. After our hour was over, I told the employee and I saw her telling the owner when I left. Later, someone I know who works there reached out to me because they saw it was me in the security videos. I asked why he knew and he said he watched them because someone left a really bad review. I checked google reviews and omg the girl I went with wrote a very long review with lies about how the cats were matted, the employees could see the person feeding the cats cake (they couldn’t), and how when we told them about it, they didn’t care. I had no idea she was going to write this. I’m not close with her either so I didn’t know how to bring up the review. Kinda awkward.
A: WAIT WHAT? Isn't cake bad for cats if my memory is correct? Eghhh, that doesn't sound good.
Q5: Yeah! A balayage is always classy. Everyone I know that dyes their hair for the first time end up making it a habit lol
A: Haha lol
Q6: Uhh there’s also urban outfitters but I feel like the clothes don’t fit my style well. They’re a little too grunge? There’s oak and fort but tbh I feel like the quality isn’t good and the style is too oversized for me. H&M can be ok but I tend to avoid it cause I used to work there ahah. Flashback to my retail days. It takes me like 40 min to get downtown, so I don’t go often. I guess there are more stores in that mall but it’s all super expensive stuff. Brands like Maje, Canada Goose, Kate Spade, etc. Luxury stores. I’m not too into luxury clothing.
A: Lol, I get it. Everyone tends to have different styles that appeal to them.

Intro: Hey Jen! Hope you’re still doing well in regards to your cold. Luckily, the weather is warming up. Thanks for your understanding. Life can be so hectic, sometimes it’s hard to find a time to sit down and focus. Thanks for the pic of the painting! Super sweet of your friend to make that for you. One of my friends was super into clay for a bit so she made us all little animal figurines. It’s not painting but I thought it was nice of her.
A: Still coughing but I'm going to get it checked out pretty soon. (not sure how long it's been since it started). Lol, nice
Q1: Thank you! I got them from a seller from China. They handmake everything according to your nail size. I tried the cheaper ones from the store but they’re always too big for my fingers. Would you get your nails done again? I think, for now, I’ll stick with nail polish. I really like the polish from a brand called Romand.
A: Lol :)
Q2: Ooo I recommend a balayage. It’s easy to take care of cause it looks more natural when it grows out.
A: Lol, balayage it is! (family and friends also suggested it haha)
Q3: We had American Eagle in the mall near me but that also closed down! Ahah I’ll check out Bluenotes. Thanks!  My local mall used to have a bunch of different clothing stores, but they always quickly closed down. Now, in one mall, half of it are jewelry stores. Now I usually check out Aritzia or Zara. I used to go to Topshop before they also closed down.
A: Whoop- that's not good. Is Aritzia and Zara the only good clothing stores nearby? Have you went to any malls downtown if there's any to speak of?
Q4: Are you a fan of Miffy? My friend’s birthday is coming up. She’s a huge fan of Miffy so I got her a bunch of Miffy stuff. Like a phone lanyard, a humidifier, a card, a postcard, a speaker, and a wall charger all Miffy themed : ) Really hoping she likes it.
A: OMGGGG YESSSSSSS! I watched it a lot on Netflix as a kid. It's not there anymore but ahhh the memories.
Q5: Later today, I’ll be going back to the cat café with some other friends. I’m excited to see the kitties again. For dinner, we’re going to a newly opened Japanese Tapas place. I felt bad cause I had to make this reservation and cancel like 3 times cause my friends were busy ahah.
A: Lol, hope you have fun! Me and my family are going out for dinner as well haha

Intro: Hey Jen! How’s your cold? Hopefully gone. My friend got covid again recently. I was surprised to hear that people are still catching it nowadays. Aww that’s so sweet of your friend. Do you also like painting? Sorry for my late response. I was pretty busy this week. I did two interviews and I went out with a friend to celebrate our grades after our first round of midterms. Since it’s been a while, I decided to put on some fake nails (pic added). Ignore the background lol.
A: Still have a little bit of a cough but otherwise not bad! Yeah, it's MJ (Michelle-Jones so you don't get confused rofl) from the Spiderman triology (and I was pretty much a fan at the time haha) I'll see if I can send the photo, I don't think I should have any problems as long if it's platform-appropriate lol. And as for painting, sometimes (if it's a good day!). No worries at all! I don't message a lot frequently due to life haha.
Since it’s been a while, I decided to put on some fake nails (pic added). Ignore the background lol. The nails were super cute but I found it super annoying to do stuff with. Washing the dishes was a little difficult. So was chopping stuff. Then when I was out, I couldn’t grab my card from my wallet lol. I was worried about them popping off as well even though I used glue. Two did end up popping off before my day was over. After the day was over, I ripped the rest off.
Q1: The nails look gorgeous! And yes, I understand how you felt, I had them done one and while they look spectacular, there was stuff I wasn't able to do (like you said, getting your card out of your wallet) and also they came off within a few weeks.
 Q2: What kind of highlights do you plan on doing? My friend is dyeing her hair soon as well. She’s going for a purpleish colour with a tinge of red and a brown undertone. I want to dye my hair too but with me out of a job right now, I think I might just let my bleached out grow out entirely so I go back to black hair. My friend said I should try bleaching it myself but I’m a little scared. I think I’ll leave it to the professionals.  
A: My best friend recommended me to get warm honey blonde or a balayage :) And yeah, probably better to leave it to professional hairstylers lol.
Q3: I haven’t checked Ardene’s in a while, but I’ll take a look! I remember there used to be a location near me but they closed down : (
A: That sucks :( Maybe try looking downtown or in a local mall? If not Ardene, maybe American Eagle is a good alternative? (my best friend told me about it)

A: You too! I just have a stuffy nose but I'm gonna steam. Congratulations on your midterm! And I'm gonna hang the painting my best friend made for me during Christmas since I didn't get the chance to lol :)
Q1: Yeah, I think it’s to encourage companies to accept students. Hiring a student means having to invest a lot of time and money on them which I guess most companies find annoying. There aren’t that many internships here in the first place compared to a place like Hong Kong. I was talking to my cousin recently and he said he’s done like 4 internships so far which is typical there yet he’s still struggling to get an interview.
A: I'm sorry to hear about your cousin. I wish him good luck
Q2: Yeah exactlyyy. It’s comfortable to be at home with your own bathroom and your home clothes ahha. I know offices talk about having a fun office with maybe a personal gym and in office food but, I mean, I got food at home. Most internships I found are in person sooo I guess I have to go in either way.
A: Fair enough XD
Q3: Hmm yeah, I suppose so. I like to buy almost fully wool sweaters so those tend to be on the costlier side. I find that they’re a lot better with smells + temperature regulation.
A: Have you looked in Ardene? Their prices isn't too bad, I think
Q4: Is there anything you don’t like eating?
A: Good question, I'm not really picky but I tend to stay away fromv cheese 90% of the time lol
Q5: Let me know what you think of it if you ever get to try it : )
A: For sure!
Q6: Ooo happy early birthday! Looks like March is a really popular month for birthdays. I know at least 3 people with birthdays that month.

Intro: Hi Jen! How’s it going : ) Thanks for your patience during these last few weeks. It’s been super hectic for me.
A: I'm alright so far. Happy February! :D
Q1: Yeah, everyone told me if they need to ask me to continue working part-time, it’s kinda weird. I didn’t really get it but sometimes it’s better to see what your friends say to gain another perspective. I sent them an email, not going too much into why, but declining their offer. Nowadays, I’ve been scouring the internet to find some internships in the summer (which is why I’m a little late responding). It’s been kinda difficult because a lot of places require you to be part of the official school co-op program. Since mine is a diploma you take after undergrad, there is no co-op program option for us. I heard it’s because the government subsidizes part of the cost if the hire is doing co-op.
A: Oh?
Q2: I’m also kinda lazy and I really want a work from home position. In the past, around covid. I feel like there were way more options. Now, a lot of companies are trying to go back to entirely in office or partial in office. Since I don’t drive, what could be easily a 7 min drive ends up requiring me to leave 45 min earlier.
A: Oh yeah. I'm guessing you also want to be closer to amenities as well, yes?
Q3: Right?? It’s so annoying to dress for that weather ahah. Either you’re always sweating or you’re freezing. I’m excited for the weather to become warmer so I can finally dress up. I don’t have a lot of winter clothes (cause sweaters are expensive) so I end up always wearing the same thing.
A: Yes XD And also, I don't think sweaters are too expensive (depending on where you look.)
Q4: Hmm, then are you a fan of tofu? I love it but my sister hates it. I cooked it earlier but she refused to eat any of it.
A: I think I had tofu when I was a kid but then stopped eating it as I got older lol.
Q5: Hopefully! If you like mango, I recommend the mango Korean shaved ice. That’s the classic flavour but they also have strawberry, green tea, chocolate, etc.
A: Great!
Q6: Did you hear about the new Kung Fu Panda movie? Are you planning on watching it?
A: I heard about it, but I don't think I'll watch it because me and my friends are planning to save some money to go see Dune in the next month and then my birthday in the same month haha (won't give full details due to platform rules.)
Q7: It’s been flooding where I am. I went out last weekend to celebrate my friend’s birthday. We went to one café but they ended up being closed. So, we went to fried chicken place but they also ended up being closed. By the time we got to the third restaurant, we were absolutely soaked.

Intro: Hi Jen! Hope you’ve been well. What adventure did you go on? Yep! The snow turned to slush. Other than being splashed by two cars, it’s been all good. I’ve been spending the past few days catching up on school.
A: Hey, lol. How's it going? I went on a plentiful (not travelling though lol). Oh yeah, hope it's going well.
Q1: Thank you so much! That’s how I see it as well. The business wasn’t for me which is 100% fine. I applied to a few internships for the summer and I reapplied to my old job. However, out of nowhere, the place I had just quit called me again cause they want me to work at least part time. Now I’m also confused on what to do. You know what, after thinking about it (mid writing this) I got flashbacks so yeah, I think I’m ok where I’m at right now. Ahah. It was really nice of them to offer though. Gotta enjoy my youth rn.
A:  Yeah, understandable. If they are trying to get you to work there again (that is part-time), then that's probably not a good idea. No former workplace would do that. I would say just say... enjoy what life has to offer, even though life will throw stuff at you sometimes. <----(this will be my quote of the day!)
Q2: Hmm, I think Spring ends up being around 5-14 degrees? So some days, it’s cold and other days it’s hot. Usually, it’s hot and cold throughout the day. In the mornings, it’s chilly then you sweat after 12.
A: Oooh, interesting. I think I get the part where it's chilly in the morning but slowly getting hot in the afternoon hours haha
Q3: I heard Uncharted is really good. It’s also based on a game.
A: Yeah it is lol. And yeah, I heard it is based on a game
Q4: That’s true. I did get the blazer at a good price. Can’t wait until it stops snowing and raining then I can dress up again. I don’t vibe with winter fashion. Which season do you think is best for fashion?
A: Yeah, and if it stops snowing where you are, dress it up with sneakers maybe :p And I honestly don't know. I think any of the seasons are good so I can't really decide for myself lol.
Q5: Only one meal for your last meal?
A: Lol, I guess so at the moment. It usually comes up to hard decision-making but if somebody asks me to choose something I like versus something I don't like, then that's easy enough XD
Q6: Can I choose neither? I feel like snow cones have no flavour while cotton candy is too sweet. Instead, I like Korean shaved ice which is similar to snow cones but they add condensed milk to the ice.
A: That's okay! I haven't had snow cones in years to be honest with you lol. I have cotton candy once in a while XD. Korean shaved ice sounds interesting haha, I'll have to give it a try someday :D
Q7: Ohh I think the androgynous look is amazing on others. I can’t make it work for myself.
A: I mean, you never know! But fair enough.

Hi Jen! Hope you’ve been well. 
What adventure did you go on?
Yep! The snow turned to slush. Other than being splashed by two cars, it’s been all good. I’ve been spending the past few days catching up on school. 
Thank you so much! That’s how I see it as well. The business wasn’t for me which is 100% fine. I applied to a few internships for the summer and I reapplied to my old job. However, out of nowhere, the place I had just quit called me again cause they want me to work at least part time. Now I’m also confused on what to do. 
I know the company doesn’t feel like a good fit for me, but I also feel like having some income come in would really help. 
You know what, after thinking about it (mid writing this) I got flashbacks so yeah, I think I’m ok where I’m at right now. Ahah. It was really nice of them to offer though. 
Gotta enjoy my youth rn. 
Hmm, I think Spring ends up being around 5-14 degrees? So some days, it’s cold and other days it’s hot. Usually, it’s hot and cold throughout the day. In the mornings, it’s chilly then you sweat after 12. 
I heard Uncharted is really good. It’s also based on a game. 
That’s true. I did get the blazer at a good price. Can’t wait until it stops snowing and raining then I can dress up again. I don’t vibe with winter fashion. Which season do you think is best for fashion. 
Ohh I think the androgynous look is amazing on others. I can’t make it work for myself. 
Only one meal for your last meal? 
Can I choose neither? I feel like snow cones have no flavour while cotton candy is too sweet. Instead, I like Korean shaved ice which is similar to snow cones but they add condensed milk to the ice.

Intro: Hi Jen. Thanks again for the long wait XD oh boy have I been busy. The snow here is horrendous. It’s thicccc. I had my power go out for a bit. I saw a lot of posts about people getting stuck in elevators.
So, I’ve been pondering my current work status. Going back and forth with a lot of my friends. At work, I found that the work culture wasn’t the best for me. I was also initially told about being able to work from home then I was hit with the no new hires need to work in office for 3 months.
I also applied to change my loans to part time in November. Found out a few days ago that it was rejected and I either have to pay back thousands of dollars in loans or go back to full time. My deadline is tmr so quick decisions.
I don’t want to get too much into it, but I made the decision to quit this morning. Then they came back, and we had a discussion. They said they wanted to give me a promotion eventually cause someone is retiring in the team. I didn’t see myself staying long term though because I found that the company had a lot of communication issues. Since, after graduation, I was thinking about moving on to a larger company, my grades needs to be top notch. Right now, I’m still with them until Friday. Think I’m going to quit and focus on my grades right now. Because I have to add more courses to my schedule and make some adjustments, I’m two weeks behind in two courses now. Gonna hustle and try to catch up.
 
A: Nah I get where you're coming from, I had a little adventure of mine lol. Yeah, I've been hearing about the snow. Hope you're okay though. As for the job, I'm sorry to hear what happened. But at the same time, if it's something that doesn't quite coordinate with you, then I'm happy for you. I wish you nothing but the best of luck for finding your path. (not in a mean way, but I think you know what I mean by that, lol.)
Q1: That is really cold. Even though it’s snowing hard here, the temperature ranges from around -6 to 6 or so.
A: Yeah lol. What's it like during the spring?
Q2: What are you watching on Netflix lately?
A: Haven't watched Netflix a lot lately, but my friend told me that No Way Home and Uncharted was on Netflix now :D
Q3: Backing up on the blazer lol. Well now that I don’t have my office job, should’ve probably held off on the blazer.
A: I mean, if there's an event or party coming up, you could pair it up with jeans or some fancy pants haha
Q4: That’s a beautiful quote : ) Mine shall be: Enjoy the little moments in life OR Tackle life as it comes. Don't stress about the rest! I feel like these two are apt for the current situation.
A: 👍🏽
Q5: I do like the combo of preppy yet grungy look. I think I mentioned it before that I kinda hop between the two. Not too familiar with the tomboy look.
A: Lol, the tomboy look is usually constistent with a baggy hoodie, jeans, loose cargo pants, and mostly just baggy clothes (basically just the androgynous look)
Q6: Bonus question: Not to be morbid, but what would your last meal be? I’m watching this series called Last Meals by Mythical Kitchen. The chef goes through different dishes that the guest said they would eat as their last meal, and they have a long conversation about life. 
I think it’s a three-course meal + dessert. My first meal would be a really good Italian pasta with a mixed drink. I love red sauce pasta. Hold the meatballs, instead I want the meat mixed in with the sauce. It has to come with soft garlic bread. 
My second would be a poke bowl with heaps and HEAPS of salmon and tuna. You have the taste of sushi, but a way larger portion. I also have to eat rice for at least one meal in the day. As for the drink, I think I’ll stick with water.
My last meal would be something with a chicken salad (because I love chicken). Not sure what the main dish would be. What about you?
 
A: Ummm, probably butter chicken? Not sure, honestly. I will come back to it if I can think of anything else lol.
Q7: I like mermaid stories better. If we’re talking about real life situations, I think being a mermaid would be awful because I’m scared of the ocean lol. There’s a lot of trash and I’m scared of big ocean creatures. In conclusion, if life was a story then mermaid. If not then princess. Both seem like a lot of work.
A: Yeah, true lol

Hi Jen. Thanks for waiting! Sorry about the late response. I’ve been coming home completely exhausted after work. Plus, I also have class sooooo I’ve been all over the place recently. I got a nice break today tho lol for some reason my prof didn't show up for class. 
A: No, that's okay, I understand :)
Q1: Is it snowing where you are? We got hit with a sudden onslaught of snow today, so I get to work from home tomorrow! Yayyyy
A: Nah, not really lol. It's pretty cold though. The lowest we got was -15 or 16
Q2: How have things been for you? Anything fun happening?
A: No, not really.
Q3: What’s your fav thing to do when it gets late? Mine is to go get dessert with a friend and chat there. I find that it’s relaxing and a good end to the day.
A: Watch YouTube and Netflix or spend some time with family
Q4: What’s the last purchase you made that you were kinda iffy about but you’re glad that you bought it? Mine is probably a blazer from Aritzia. The quality is way better than I thought.
A: Not sure, I'll try and update next time if I think of anything lol
Q5: What do you think about silk products? Like silk shirts. I heard they stain easily but they're a great elevated fashion piece.
A: They're not bad
Q6: I think my biggest accomplishment would be finally travelling. Is that considered an accomplishment though? I don’t think I accomplished anything important by going. If not that then maybeee finally quitting my previous job to find something that’s related to my degree? I had been pushing it off for so long but I finally made the step to pursue it.
A: Cool!! I mean, it could! It doesn't matter how small or big the accomplishment is, only if you enjoy it. <---- (this will be my quote of the day)
Q7: Honestly, a big reason I didn’t want to find a new job was because my old job was so convenient. But, I mean, it had to end eventually.
A: Yeah, that's true
Q8: Bonus Questions: What are your fashion predictions for 2024? I’m seeing blazers with a more fitted silhouette and more sheer clothing. Maybe more work-chic? Chunky boots are always gonna be popular but maybe more delicate shoes might come back into fashion. What do you think?
A: Not sure, maybe more preppy or tomboy-ish looks? I think that's what's been trending since post-2020 rofl

Intro: Hey Jen! Happy 2024.
A: Hi Lisa, you too. (✿^‿^)
Q1: Do you like staying out late? Personally, I love it but now with my new job, I have a bed time :( Haven’t been able to stick with it but here’s hoping I do by this weekend ahah.
A: Kinda, it depends. Good luck w/ your new job :D
Q2: I healed really quickly from my sickness but I have soreness in my throat still. I still went out and saw some of my friends in the past couple of days.
A: That's good 👍🏽
Q3: Lol today, I walked to the local shopping mall to pick up a book order at the bookstore. 3 hours later, they sent me another email to pick up a different book. Speaking of books, indigo has a good deal going on right now. Buy 2 novels and get a 3rd one free. It combines with my 10% plum plus membership so it ends up being a little under 40% off (since it’s the lowest priced that’s free). I got 18 books with half of them being pre-orders. I got my eye on a few more but I’m not sure if I should go for it. 
Since collecting books are so expensive, I typically limit myself to buying only the first book of a series or maybe the first few (if it’s a manga series and there’s like 20 books). With this deal, somehow my brain is going I’m basically losing money if I don’t buy ALL the books I want right now ahah.
Honestly, I should finish reading the books I already have. That way, I can donate more books and empty out my shelves.
A: I mean, it's up to you and how much you're willin' to spend XD.
Q4: Let me know how Dune 2 is!
A: Sure! There's still a few months until it hits theatres (which is around March lol.)
Q5: No worries! I meant my skin. It hasn’t been too dry yet.
A: Good to know
Q6: I shouldn’t have talked about the weather lol Now it’s going to be raining all week.

A: I don't really do New Year resolutions because I know that I can't really do them all in one year, so I just put them off :)

Intro: Thanks for waiting! How was the party?
A: That's okay. The party was fun but ended up coming home later than ever lol. How was your holiday and sickness?
Q1: Yeah, I wish I had watched Ponyo or something I know is really good since my friend isn’t typically interested in animated works or Studio Ghibli. I think she’s really into action films. What genre do you typically go for? I like action as well but not if action is the driving factor of the movie. I feel like the plot needs to be really good. I think I like drama, comedy, and fantasy. Maybe tragedies too. Weirdly enough, I read a decent amount of romance but I don’t like movies in that genre.
A: Lol cool. I don't really know about what genre, just whatever piques my interest :D But I am planning on seeing Dune 2 with my friends :)
Q2: Thank you! Maybe it’s due to the weather but it’s been cooperating somewhat this winter.
A: Oh for what? (I might've forgot maybe lol sorry and also my brain is still on holiday mode)
Q3: Did it snow heavily or was it a light sprinkle? It hasn’t rained a lot here but when it does, it absolutely pours.
A: I think it was a light sprinkle. And yeah I feel you, it rains a ton where I live currently.
Q4: Since I’ve been mostly homebound the past few days, I’ve been catching up on my reading. I read Tender is the Flesh, some Junji Ito stories, and Erha He Ta De Bai Mao Shizun(2-4). I tend to buy books at a faster rate than I read them. I’m glad I was able to check these off the list. Now I’m trying to decide if I should now read the books I got recently or the novels I got years ago. My issue is that I have a sizeable number of novels I got when I was in my teens that I haven’t touched. My tastes have changed since then. I feel bad if I donate those books without even giving them a chance, but I also don’t want to try to read a ton of books only to drop all of them in succession. Or what if I donate all of them and end up missing a gem that I would’ve loved.
A: Lol, sounds nice. I mostly read graphic novels when I was in middle school. (e.g, Amulet, the Smile book series)
Q5: What sweets does your mom make? Not sweets but I’ve been wanting to make some homemade dumplings.
A: I think I’m looking forward to the new year. Other than being nervous about my new job, I think a new year means new opportunities. Also, it’s another year of birthdays. I loveeeeee buying birthday gifts. I think it’s fun trying to think of something that your friend would love. I want to go on more vacations in the future too. What I don’t like is thinking about how I’m slowly getting older. What about you? Do you ever feel like time is moving too fast or too slow?
A: Awesome! You do you :D And yeah time is going pretty fast, but when summer comes around, it gets a bit slower
Q6: You’re right. Faux leather does tear easily. That’s why I’m eyeing some real leather pieces. Pricey but I’ll probably get them after I get my big boy adult job paycheck ahaha.
A: I mean if it's not really expensive as YSL or Gucci, I guess they are a bit expensive but I don't really know. But good luck!
Q7: I do like the style of cargo pants. I was looking at a few from Aritzia. I haven’t seen any with elastic cuffs though. Belts are a good idea. I was looking at one from yes-style that looked cool. It had a metal buckle.
A: That's great :D
Last but not least, Q8: Happy new year! Hope you had a fantastic 2023 and cheers to another amazing year :) It has been absolutely wonderful getting to know you. Hearing your opinions and thoughts no matter how big or small they are has been invaluable to me. I hope, throughout this journey, I've been a helpful companion as well.

Thanks! You too :D
Q1: Are you doing anything for the New Years?
A: Yep, my family-friends are throwing a party lol
Q2: Ooo how was the movie? I kinda wanted to see it as well but my friends didn’t. We watched the New Studio Ghibli movie instead, but they didn’t like it. I think compared to the previous movies by the same studio, the new one wasn’t as good.
A: Surprisingly, it was pretty good! I thought it wouldn't be good, but oh boy it was super well done :D Haha, fair enough. It probably wasn't their cup of tea. Most new movies nowadays don't really live up to the hype anymore so I get where your friends are coming from.
Q3: Yeah! For some odd reason, the right side of my face has a tendency to get drier than the left side. Sometimes when I wear makeup, it peels a little. It’s there and the area between my eyebrows that tend to be dry.
a: Augh.. that doesn't sound good. I hope it gets better
Q4: Thank you! Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your outlook), there’s no available work at the moment. That means I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with friends and playing games. Fantastic way to spend the holidays. I’m surprised that it hasn’t snowed here yet. It also didn’t rain much either. It’s been an odd year when it comes to the weather.
A: I mean.. at least you can take a break to catch up with friends, hangout, etc. It actually snowed a while ago where I currently live, but it didn't stick around long lol.
Q5: I don’t think I do. I am craving cream puffs right now for some odd reason. Maybe because I saw a bunch out for the holidays? Candy canes are a good treat every now and then too. Do you have any? Maybe hot chocolate?
A: Hot chocolate is good! My mom also makes sweets during the holidays as well :D
Q6: I used to shop at Guess a lot when I was younger. My mom loved Guess too. I had this beautiful biker jacket for many years. Sadly, it ripped (because it was faux leather) a few months ago : (. RIP my beautiful jacket. I’ll remember you as my first leather jacket forever.
A: Awh, that's sad :( I'm sorry. That's why I don't really like to buy faux leather products (including clothing) because I keep hearing that it tears apart a lot.
Q7: I tried. I only found two that were alright (the two that I currently own). One is still a little long and I have to wear platforms for it to work and the other one is fine but a little big on the waist. I found that it’s difficult to find pants with a shorter inseam. Aritzia has that option which is why I tend to go there for pants. I used to go to Topshop too until they closed down in Canada a few years ago. Brands like H&M, Zara, Oak and Fort, etc don’t usually have petite options.  
A: Have you tried cargo pants? Not sure if they're your cup of tea, but most of them have elastic cuffs on the bottom so I think it should be okay for petite frames :) And as for waist part, have you tried wearing a belt? I found it helps half the time. You don't have to set it to the tightest belt hole.
Q8: That’s alright. I’m slowly branching out from jeans by going for trousers. I like how versatile they are because you can dress them down or up. With jeans, it’s not usually allowed in a professional setting.
A: Lol, fair enough

Merry Christmas, Jen! I’m a little late but there’s still the New Years. Happy New Years in advance! I hope this year was good to you and that it gets even better next year : )
Are you doing anything for the New Years?
Ooo how was the movie? I kinda wanted to see it as well but my friends didn’t. We watched the New Studio Ghibli movie instead, but they didn’t like it. I think compared to the previous movies by the same studio, the new one wasn’t as good. 
Yeah! For some odd reason, the right side of my face has a tendency to get drier than the left side. Sometimes when I wear makeup, it peels a little. It’s there and the area between my eyebrows that tend to be dry.
Thank you! Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your outlook), there’s no available work at the moment. That means I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with friends and playing games. Fantastic way to spend the holidays. I’m surprised that it hasn’t snowed here yet. It also didn’t rain much either. It’s been an odd year when it comes to the weather.

Intro: Hi Jen! Thanks for waiting. I see that you’ll be busy this week with some events so no rush in responding : ) What volunteer work are you doing?
Hey Lisa, merry Christmas!!! (at the time I'm writing this haha) and the volunteer work me and my friend did was greet people in Walmart and collect money on behalf of Salvation Army. And also me and my friends went to go see the Wonka movie :D
Q1: Thank you for the positive reminder! Was a boost to my mood while I was desperately cramming for my exams haha
A: Woohoo!! Glad it helped :D
Q2: I heard Garnier is good. I used to have a hyaluronic acid serum. I switched to Beta Glucan cause my toner already had some hyaluronic acid. What do you usually look for in skincare? I try to find products that are very hydrating since my skin easily gets dry.
A: Lol. Same like you, I try not to look for products that make my skin dry. Even though I have oily/combination skin, I still want to keep it hydrated and healthy anyways.
Q3: The cat is super cute! Now that my exams are over, I’m meeting all my friends. Until school starts back up, that’s 3 times a week that I have something planned with friends. (If I reply a little slow, I probably went out with my friends and passed out as soon as I got home lol I get tired some social events really easily). Since I have so many different groups, I’m trying to get all of them to go to the cat café so I have an excuse to go back.
A: Sounds fun, lol!
Q4: Studying was ehhh. I’m still feeling exhausted from the exams since they were basically back to back AND they were 3 hours long. AAAAAND I had to travel 1.5 hours there and 2 hours back. My finance exam, I studied for about 14-16 hours, 10-12 for my tax exam, and 5 ish hours for my data viz exam. Going out 7 days in a row is sucking my energy away. Unfortunately, now I have to catch up on work.
A: Oh woah, that sucks. I'm sorry. I hope your sleep schedule gets better. I wish you luck on your work :)
Q5: The party was fantastic. Buying ingredients and cooking our own food was a lot cheaper than ordering take out. Had a present exchange : ) I got a cool ditto plushie.
A: Haha, that's awesome! Glad you had fun :D
Q6: Are you lactose? I have difficulties with cheese too.
A: Yes, I think so. 
Q7: 0 or -5 is FREEZING. I’m busting out my winter jackets when it hits below 10 degrees. At -5, I’m staying home or I’m completely bundled up.
A: Haha, lol.
Q8: Hmm I think I like winter? Spring is still kinda cold here since it’s always raining. Then I’m constantly sneezing because of the pollen. The weather is too unpredictable with cold mornings and hot afternoons.  Winter is consistent. It shall be cold and remain cold.
A: Fair enough haha, I guess it all depends on where you are and the environment around you. Some places can be hot during the winter season, whereas it can be cold.
Q9: I know some people tend to look for graphic tees with minimal design, others love flashy designs, some only go for no image + writing, while others do only images, etc etc. I know of mom jeans… never heard of dad jeans. That’s interesting. I usually wear skinnies but I some two straight leg/wide leg jeans. They’re cool. I do have some troubles styling it. I’m short so it feels like the pants are eating up my entire frame.
A: Lol, I looooove graphic prints. I get most of them from Ardene, H&M, Forever 21 and some from Guess :) Dad jeans are kind of a thing from Levi's haha. And also have you tried looking for shorter ones? I think some jeans have different inseam lengths for different heights (not 100% sure)
QOTD: Do you have any favourite food/treats during the holidays?

Hi, best of luck with your finals :D Doesn't matter when you respond but however next week will be mixed w/ some events for me as well because one of the days I will be joining my friend (since we're volunteering) and will be getting together for gift exchanges at some point lol. So my response time will be not-so-active either since my mind is currently on lazy mode rofl. But yeh, take your time. I'm still around but don't rush yourself :) Don't forget to stay hydrated and don't forget to eat!!!

Hi Lisa, apologies for delaying my reply lol. I promise I'm still around! Was a bit busy, and yes we finished the tree :D
Q1: Hmm, what kind of face wash is it? Vitamin C serum absolutely counts. I heard it’s really good for reducing acne scars.
A: I use Garnier (the hyaluronic acid collection)
Q2: Group projects for you too? Thank you! I’m all done with my group projects including my in-class presentation. As of now, I’m officially done with all my classes. I got my finals in a week then 2.5 weeks of sweet, sweet vacation.
A: Not sure what you are talking about lol. And cool :)
Q3: Good news! You are now talking to someone who has a full-time accounting clerk position starting in January. I got a few offers, so I emailed around and asked if my first choice would take me : D. Surprisingly, today I got another request for an interview for a game studio (still an accounting position). I thought I might as well do the interview and see how I do though I’m most likely going to stick with what I got now.
A: Congratulations :D
Q4: Yesterday my friend bought me dinner as congrats for the job so I took her to the cat café. (Pic included). My fav cat is getting adopted. I’m happy for her but also a little sad that I won’t see her anymore : (
A: That sucks, I'm sorry :( It must've been fun while it lasted. I'm glad you got to bond with her before. But she looks so cute!!!
Q5: Today, I’m going out to study with a friend. Tomorrow, we’re having a Birthday/Christmas/Hot pot party at my friend’s place again. I’m excited to give out my gifts. Usually, I don’t send out Christmas cards. I got a few requests this year, so I bought a box. I struggled to fill them out since I see my friends so often, I had no idea what to say. For one of them, I added, “You usually have cool pants.” Ahahah. Do you usually give your friend Christmas cards?
A: Cool :D How did it go? (the party and the studying)
Q6: I also heard about Disney cruises being well-known for their quality. Don’t know if I would want to be on a Disney themed cruise though.
A: Ye, but I've never been in one though lol.
Q7: Do you prefer a specific type of graphic tee or jeans? I used to only wear skinnies. Now I’m branching out to other styles like flared and wide leg. Right now, flared pants are my fav style. How do you feel about clothing patterns such as gingham, cow print, etc?
A: For patterns, I don't mind it I guess, lol. Not sure what you mean about specific graphic tee though XD. As for jeans, I wear mom jeans, loose/baggy jeans and I've been looking to try dad jeans (yes, that's kind of a thing from Levi's lol) and I've seen most people wear jeans with Converse or Nikes haha
Last but not least, Q8: At what temperature do you pull out the winter jackets? What is the best type of cheese?
A: Typically below 0 or -5 lol. How about you? Uhh as for cheese, I tend to avoid it whenever because I can't really eat it, sorry :(
QOTD: Do you like snow or do you prefer spring weather?
Take care!
You too, have a good one :D",Mentee

A: Hey, happy December Lisa! I'm well -- gonna put up my tree today lol :D
Q1: I found a new leather jacket from AllSaints : ) It hasn’t been delivered yet but I’m excited. I finally got a delivery for my skincare that I ordered MONTHS ago too. Do you use any skincare products?
A; Cool! Lol, does face wash + vitamin c serum count?
Q2: I wanted to reply yesterday. Sadly, I’ve been incredibly busy with school. For my first group project, we had one member who did it last minute and, unfortunately, couldn’t figure out the calculations. I had to work on their portion the entire day and overnight. We did eventually finish. Then on Monday, we had a new group project. My classmates have difficulties with the program, so I ended up having to do that myself yesterday.
A: Lol, no worries. I did just about the same thing XD. My week was pretty hectic too. Good luck with your projects!
Q3: On the bright side, I got another call for an interview. I have it tomorrow. I’m pretty excited. I feel like I might actually find a full time job at this rate haha. I actually went back on Indeed to check a position I applied for weeks ago. There were 2000 people that applied for it. Isn’t that crazy?
A: Congrats! Good luck :)
Q4: I also went to my friend’s house for a dinner party (though I ended up having to do my project after going home). It was super fun. We were going crazy on the switch. I’ve also never been to his house before so it was interesting seeing the inside. I called an uber to drive me home. The driver was super sweet, and we chatted throughout the long ride.
A: Haha, cool!
Q5: Yeah, maybe because I’m such a night owl. I usually like doing assignments near the end of the day. It feels peaceful when it’s super quiet, it’s dark out, and you’re tapping away on your keyboard. Do you ever get this feeling?
A: Lol, nice! Nah, I guess not.
Q6: Ooo do you have a specific cruise in mind? I think I wouldn’t mind it, but my friend says cruises are for seniors.
A: Not sure lol. I heard Disney cruises are pretty dope. I've had a few cruises come to my city over the summer haha
Q7: If you could get a pet, what would you choose?
A: Probably a puppy for now haha
Q8: No worries. I’ll give a quote this time. “Okay,” – Lisa, 2023
A: Lol.
Q9: I like to read! Though I’ve had to put that to a stop cause of school and the whole applying to jobs situation. I like to research places before I apply to them, so it takes a chunk of my day.
A: Cool!
Q10: I like the men’s t-shirts and sweatshirts from H&M. I got one where, on the back, it says in teeny tiny print, “why are you standing so close to me” or something along those lines.
A: Haha nice
Q11: Uhhh Idk how to explain it. I think someone said my style was similar to Korean Preppy Grunge? Or a little similar to Dark Academia fashion but all black and a little more grunge? I like to wear casual blazers and leather jackets. A lot of my clothes are cropped polos or plain t-shirts. Pants are usually slacks or skinny jeans. What’s your wardrobe like?
A: Haha, good question! My wardrobe is pretty mixed ranging from Hawaiian shirts, graphics, jeans and cargo pants :)
Q12: Bonus Questions: What is something you’re looking forward to that’s coming up? Do you keep a stash of emergency gifts?
A: Not really lol.

A: Awh, sorry it didn't work out.
Q1: Omg since I last talked to you, I actually got a call from a company for an accounting position. I did an interview with their HR on Thursday and with two managers on Friday. The decision comes out in about a week and a half. It’s all going real fast.
A: Wishing you the best of luck!
Q2: How do you like H&M? I was going to drop off some clothes cause I added a blazer to my donate pile. Then suddenly, I got a msg today from the Facebook marketplace from someone who wanted to buy it the same day. This whole week is full of surprises.
A: It's pretty good! I got a sweatshirt from there that says ""Paris, Place Vendôme""
Q3: I’m pretty tired though. I’ve been working on my group presentation for hours. We have to make a bunch of statements. We divided the work but I have my group members asking me for help. So, I ended up having to do that on top of my own work.
A: Augh, what a pain. I hope you get through your stuff :)
Q4: Now I still have to finish a tax assignment before I could go sleep : ((. I’m going to a friend’s house today so I’m worried I won’t finish it in time if I leave it till after.
A: My solutions don't normally work but I'd say do it before you go (maybe like 2 hours before? Depends when)
Q5: Have you ever gone on a cruise before? I think I’d like to go one day.
A: Hmmmm, I don't think so lol. I might go next year or the year after. How 'bout you?
Q6: I wish I could get a pet. My mom isn’t the biggest fan of animals. I know that, once I get my own place, I’m definitely getting a cat or two and one dog. I want the dog to be a golden retriever or some kind of bigger dog breed. As for the cats, I want an orange cat and the other one can be whatever as long as it’s not hairless. I thought about getting a hamster, but I want a pet to cuddle with. What about you?
A: Hmmm, I don't know honestly. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Who knows, lol.
Q7: I used to wear denim jackets. I still have a few but I don’t think I look good in them. They’re very casual. I think I prefer more structured outfits. They’re kinda a category above sweatpants, sweatshirts, and yoga pants which I would never wear.
A: Haha, that's fair. Structured outfits as in what? Kinda curious as to what it is lol.
Q8: If you ever feel like you’re in need of some vampire, definitely check out vampire diaries. I never finished it tho cause uh 8 seasons is a lot. I don’t have the attention span. I also really liked The Office. Never finished all the seasons for that either.
A: I'm probably gonna have to politely decline since I'll get bored eventually. But thanks for the offer! The Office is comedy gold XD

Intro: Hey Jen! How was your weekend? I had my interview with the second company today. I think it went well since the role is similar to my current job. I learned that their headquarters is in New Jersey, USA, but when I googled reviews of the company, most of the employees were located in Asia. So, maybe some of their higher level employees are in the US and the rest are in Asia? Then, before, they didn’t hire people from Canada but now they are. They recently signed a deal with a few companies to help them develop a Language Model for generative AI, so they’re looking for Canada + US based writers.
A: Cool, congrats! It was good I guess. Hmmm, interesting.
Q1: I saw some people making bets on whether it’ll snow this year or not. I read somewhere that this year has been the driest it’s been in a while. Now that I think about it, it barely rained this year and, when it did, it was only drizzling.
A: ROFL
Q2: Oh, I don’t know any thrift stores that pay you for products. All the places I’ve seen only take donations. That’s interesting. I know H&M has a recycling program where if you donate a bag of old clothes, they give you a $5 coupon.
A: Lol, I don't really think they pay you if you donate? At least, not where I'm living right now XD. Haha, interesting! I didn't know that about them. I've only been to H&M a few times on holidays rofl.
Q3: The ocean is beautiful in the sun. I really want to learn how to fish and to get on a boat with my friends. Maybe it’s less glamorous in person, but I really want to sit in a boat with my friends and just chill.
A: YES SIREE! (just maybe don't get a speed boat if you're planning to chill in the lake ROFL)
Q4: Do you have plans to visit one of them? Or are you not a fan of amusement parks?
A: I have been to a few -- not exactly a fan of rollercoasters though!
Q5: THEY ARE SUPER CUTE. Unfortunately, the day I went, there were two younger kids there who were kinda harassing the poor cats : ( so the cats were avoiding most people. I dropped by again over the weekend (looked at them from the outside) and they were a lot happier.
A: Awh, I'm sorry about that. I guess they're just kids, so maybe they'll learn not to do that next time lol. Do you have plans to get a pet or no?
Q6: Over the weekend, my friend msged me cause he was at a nearby mall. They were having a special promotion where you could get $50 for every $500 you get in mall gift cards. However, he was there alone and there was a limit of $1000 per person. My friend needed $2000 because he was going to buy an iPhone with it. My gosh, the wait was soo long. My friend waited for a total of 3 hours and I was there for 2 hours.
A: YIKEEEEES.
Q7: Black Friday deals began. I ended up spending $1500-1600 over the weekend. I’m completely broke now. My leather jacket recently ripped. That was the second leather jacket in the past year that ripped on me, so I decided to get a real leather jacket as an investment. Then the rest were some clothes from Aritzia, Nintendo games for an incoming party, some Christmas gifts, and some stuff from Amazon. I wanted to buy the Sony WH-CH520 headphones in blue but they’re sold out : (
A: Ooof, sorry about your jacket. Just curious though, have you worn denim jackets at all?
Q8: Did you buy anything? Did you start buying Christmas gifts yet?
A: Haha, I don't think so lol.
Q9: Is it Twilight??? No way. I admit it’s uhhh something but it’s so iconic. Every time I think of sparkly skin, I think of Edward. Did you ever watch Vampire Diaries? I was obsessed with that show when I was younger.
A: Yes, it is lol. Apparently, most people think it's cringe now than what's been said before. I think I've heard of Vampire Diaries but didn't watch it because I was too young at the time it released XD.
Q10: My fav colour is black!
A: Cool!

Intro: Hey Jen! I’m doing alright! I’ve finished with my interview so I’m waiting for a response now. The person said it would take 1-2 weeks for the SECOND interview. I also did a writing test for another company after passing their first stage. They look like they’re expanding to Canada from Asia, but I think I might tell them I’m no longer interested in the position. I want to find a position with a direct supervisor so I’m able to use them as a reference later on.
A: Hey! Glad the interview went well. Kinda curious though, have they always wanted to expand further or were they not able to?
Q1: Ew until the end of March? That’s too much snow. I got Timberland boots a few years ago but I’ve only worn them maybe 3 times. They’re so stiff and hard to walk in. I thought about selling them, but it looks like there’s not a good market for them.
A: Yeah unfortunately. I think it was only that one year though. I don't know what's gonna happen this year but so far.. nothing really happened, lol. And I'll likely be moving next summer so I won't know after that anymore. And as for selling your Timberlands, have you tried going to a thrift store near you? I don't necessarily know if they'll take them in (probably depending on the condition that they're in) but I guess it's worth a try, but good luck! (Also i
Q2: I didn’t know there was a second “It” movie. I remember when the first came out and everyone was talking about it. I remember one horror movie that came out (I think) this year called The Terrifier 2. Apparently, it was so scary that some people fainted in the theatres. I usually don’t watch horror movies, but I do love psychological thrillers.
A: Oh.
Q3: Oh, the Seven Wonders of the World would be:
The Great Wall of China
Chichén Itzá
Petra
Machu Picchu
Christ the Redeemer
Colosseum
Taj Mahal
They’re all famous historical sites. Apparently, there was another list but this one is the updated 2007 list.
As for me, regarding the ocean or space, I think I’d like space better. The ocean kinda freaks me out since you can see the top layer but you can’t see anything below it.
A: Oh cool! I'd love to see the Taj Mahal with my friends and family someday :) I only like the ocean because I like how it's pure, blue and shimmery when the sun's out lol.
Q4: Definitely Universal Studios. When I went to Japan, we opted for Universal Studios instead of Tokyo’s Disneyland. I wouldn’t mind checking it out in the future, but I wasn’t a Disney kid when I was younger. I think Universal Studios has more exciting rides like the Spiderman one. Universal Studios also has Hogwarts.
A: Fair enough lol. I haven't been to either, so I'd sorta see why haha.
Q5: I like Dua Lipa’s songs. They’re always catchy. The one you recommended is from the Barbie movie, I think.
A: Lol.
Q6: It’s getting cold now. I went out on Monday to see cats with my friend (I’ll add a pic of my fav cat). By the time we were done and I had to walk home, I was freezing cause I brought a light jacket. I need more Autumn-Winter transition jackets. Like the ones that aren’t super thick but they’re not thin either.
A: AWWWWH THEY'RE SO CUTE :D
Q7: Bonus Questions: Do you think Centaurs or Mermaids are cooler? What about Vampires vs Werewolves?
A: Centaurs, definitely. As for vampires or werewolves, unfortunately I'm gonna have to say neither. (mainly because of a certain film-series ruined it for me and mostly everybody -- cough cough. Can you guess what it is?)

Intro: Hey, Jen! Hahah certainly was a surprise when I got like 10 emails about your reply. I thought my outlook was glitching out. Anyway, I hope you’re doing well! It’s been incredibly windy here too. Power has been knocked out in some areas. It happens every now and then but the sound of the wind outside was real loud. It makes me worry about my window net. When I moved here, there was a sizable hole in the corner, so I patched it up by taking paper in the shape of the hole, covering it with tape to make it sturdier, then taping it to the edges of the hole (both sides). I was worried it would fly off in the wind every time this happens, but it’s been sturdy so far.
A: Hi! Yeah sorry, haha. I had internet troubles the other day XD. I guess I'm doing fine, how about yourself? Did you use duct tape or clear tape? Cause I don't think clear tape would be sturdy enough lol.
Q1: I hope it properly snows here this year. Every time it snows, it rains a bit after or it’s like rain snow. It turns all the snow on the ground into slush then into ice. It’s so inconvenient to walk through. Plus, the bridge near me starts dropping ice on the cars. It’s a total mess. When I was younger, I moved to a nearby city but I wanted to continue attending the same high school. Every day I’d bus there and back. This one winter, the snow was so bad and the bridge was closed. I had to go around, and everything was jampacked. It took me 6 hours to get home.
A: Yah, same here (except where I am living right now, it usually snows around late-December, early January? Well around 2021, the snowfest started around after Christmas and didn't end 'til the end of March but it changes every year rofl
Q2: I saw so much Christmas décor, but not a lot of leftover Halloween candy on sale : (. The best time to get candy is always after Halloween.
A: That sucks. Sorry.
Q3: I might go next year! It all depends. I’m hoping to have a full time job by next year to beef up my resume though. I have an interview on Monday for a writing position. Wish me luckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I also did the first test for a government position. Really exciting. Hoping I pass 😊 I prob won’t get the results soon though since it’s a long weekend.
A: Hey well, good luck :D
Q4: Have you seen any movies based on Stephen King’s novels? I brought three of his books, but I’m too scared to watch any of the movies.
A: Yes I have! I don't know if you've seen or heard of ""It"". I've watched the movies, but never read the books. I think I still own the 2nd ""It"" movie on DVD, but don't know where it is in my house, alas.
Q5: Is that a typical answer?? I think I’d go for a lower paying job in a field I’m really interested in. Maybe if I’m ok with the higher paying job, I’d go for it. If I dislike it, I’d never even if it paid me a lot. I think I’d end up quitting before a year there. I’d also heavily consider whether it’s work from home too. If it was, I’d accept lower pay. Not having to spend around 3 hours a day and $120 a month on transportation adds up.
A: I guess so from different people, but I'm assuming they'll choose the same answer as you.
Q6: I’d bring another person. If I’m gonna be stuck on an island, someone else must suffer with me.
A: ROFL
Q7: I really wanna see Stray Kids. I know they went to Seattle last year. Who do you want to go see?
A: Not sure, honestly.
Last but not least, Q8: Bonus questions: Which of the Seven Wonders of the World do you want to visit the most? Do you prefer the ocean or space?

Intro: Hi, Jen! How was your weekend? Do anything fun now that Halloween is over? I went out recently and all I see are Christmas décor. I know the next big holiday is Christmas but, jeez, I think it’s a little early.
A: Nah, not really. Just some brutal windstorms once in a while lol. It gonna get chilly and also probably expecting snow soon lol. As for the stores, yeah, they always get festive with getting out the Christmas stuff (usually during or after Halloween has passed which is typically when the clock strikes on the 1st of November at this point ROFL)
Q1: Ooo I love fireworks. There was a big fireworks show a few months ago. My friend invited me but I did have exams around that time and it was downtown. It gets so crowded and everyone takes transit home so that gets backed up.
A: Oh, that sucks. Hopefully you can go next time if it ever happens again!
Q2: Hope you’re feeling better now!
A: Honestly, I'm not doing bad :)
Q3: I highly recommend it. I personally thought the book was better, but the movie wasn’t bad by any means. The party scenes were really flashy and fun.
A: Thanks for the recommendation :) I will have to look into it eventually!
Q4: If their healthcare is so expensive, I’m surprised people go for regular checkups even if nothing is wrong.
A: Lol, maybe incase if the individual gets diagnosed with a medical condition or otherwise. They would also learn some ways on how to take care of themselves with said condition. (Note: I do not work in healthcare, so this may not be 100% accurate. All depends where you are and how they handle healthcare. Thanks!)
Q5: No, it’s ok! I think her fanbase can be crazy at times. I’m basically the same where I have some songs saved on Spotify, but I don’t usually listen to them. I’m not up to date with celebrity news. I would assume that mega celebrities tend to have the worst fanbase tho.
A: Lol, true
Q6: A giraffe would be cool as a ride. Makes me wonder how fast they go. I think riding a tiger would be much cooler and a lot faster. Maybe warmer too.
A: ROFL
Q7: I LOVE the Game of Life. Omg. I don’t know anyone else that likes it cause all my friends hate it. Monopoly is fun too, but I like the one where they use a credit card instead of cash.
A: Lol
Q8: All the songs by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepson are fantastic. I remember being obsessed with Fireflies when I was younger. Did you know Jepson’s father was a public school principal? My friend claimed he went to the same school that he taught at.
A: Lol, fun! I actually didn't know that ROFL
Q9: (人•ᴗ•)｡*ﾟ+✧･ﾟ✧<- this is adorable
A: Thank you! Lol
Q10: Sadly, I don’t think I’m going to Korea anymore cause of my friend’s new job, so I’ve been browsing the internet a lot looking for opportunities. Recently, I’ve been interested in random online certifications you can do online. Did you know the Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons has an online maritime radio certification? You can also get a boating license online for $50 or a drone pilot license for $10. I think I might collect a bunch of lifelong certifications for no reason.
A: Oh, that's too bad. Hopefully someday you will!
Last but not least, Q11: Bonus Questions: Do you think it’s better go for a job that you don’t as much with higher pay and more opportunities or a lower paying job in a field you’re really interested in? What three items would you bring with you on a deserted island? (and it can’t be a boat)
A: Probably a job I don't like with higher pay ROFL (typical answer lol) and as for the second question: 1) food, 2) water 3) something to do (it could be anything at this point, I ain't complaining lol)

Hi, Jen! How was your weekend? Do anything fun now that Halloween is over? I went out recently and all I see are Christmas décor. I know the next big holiday is Christmas but, jeez, I think it’s a little early. 
Ooo I love fireworks. There was a big fireworks show a few months ago. My friend invited me but I did have exams around that time and it was downtown. It gets so crowded and everyone takes transit home so that gets backed up. 
Hope you’re feeling better now!
I highly recommend it. I personally thought the book was better, but the movie wasn’t bad by any means. The party scenes were really flashy and fun. 
If their healthcare is so expensive, I’m surprised people go for regular checkups even if nothing is wrong. 
No, it’s ok! I think her fanbase can be crazy at times. I’m basically the same where I have some songs saved on Spotify, but I don’t usually listen to them. I’m not up to date with celebrity news. I would assume that mega celebrities tend to have the worst fanbase tho. 
A giraffe would be cool as a ride. Makes me wonder how fast they go. I think riding a tiger would be much cooler and a lot faster. Maybe warmer too. 
I LOVE the Game of Life. Omg. I don’t know anyone else that likes it cause all my friends hate it. Monopoly is fun too, but I like the one where they use a credit card instead of cash. 
All the songs by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepson are fantastic. I remember being obsessed with Fireflies when I was younger. Did you know Jepson’s father was a public school principal? My friend claimed he went to the same school that he taught at. 
 (人•ᴗ•)｡*ﾟ+✧･ﾟ✧ <- this is adorable 
Sadly, I don’t think I’m going to Korea anymore cause of my friend’s new job, so I’ve been browsing the internet a lot looking for opportunities. Recently, I’ve been interested in random online certifications you can do online. Did you know the Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons has an online maritime radio certification? You can also get a boating license online for $50 or a drone pilot license for $10. I think I might collect a bunch of lifelong certifications for no reason.

Word of the day!: Widdershins – in a direction contrary to the sun’s course; counterclockwise. 
Bonus Questions: Do you think it’s better go for a job that you don’t as much with higher pay and more opportunities or a lower paying job in a field you’re really interested in?
What three items would you bring with you on a deserted island? (and it can’t be a boat)
Have a fantastic rest of your week!

Intro: Thank you for your patience! I had a pretty eventful last few days. Today, I was out for the majority of the time playing badminton, playing the Switch with my friends, grabbing dinner, going shopping, then grabbing dessert. I just got home but I’m exhausted. I’ve also been applying to more businesses. Technically, I’m doing accounting, but I really want to find a role related to English. Fingers crossed!
Happy Halloween to you too! Did you do anything fun? I saw on my Instagram that most people were partying. I was so jealous since I was stuck at home taking my business finance course.
As for the car requirement… well I think it’s just the location I’m in. A lot of people don’t drive so some jobs require a driver's license because they don’t want an employee who relies on public transportation. I do get it but it makes finding positions a lil difficult.
A: Eh, it's okay. I don't mind it, hope you had a good time lol. Yeesh, I'm sorry.
Q1: Happy Halloween to you too! Did you do anything fun? I saw on my Instagram that most people were partying. I was so jealous since I was stuck at home taking my business finance course.
A: Meh, I treated it as a normal day. But I did go out with my parents to watch fireworks though!
Q2: Oh no : ( Did you get meds for that? My sister has had a cough for a month now. I think she should see a doctor, but uhh that responsibility falls on my mom haha
A: Nah.
Q3:  What did you think of it? The tickets are pricey but I like it.
A: It was fun lol.
Q4: Word of the day!: Erinaceous – like or relating to the hedgehog. Crazy how there’s a whole word dedicated to things similar to one specific creature.
A: LOL
Q5: I don’t have a machine : (. I bought a small hand kit from H&M a couple years back and I’ve been using that. Though I’m not good at it, having the sewing set has been incredibly helpful.
A: Oh, well that's something I guess
Q6: See, I like the IDEA of a fancy banquet with the glitter and the glam; HOWEVER, the thought of attending them fills me with dread. It always seems better from afar. I think that’s a lesson from The Great Gatsby if you’ve seen the movie or read the book.
A: ROFL, fair enough. I don't think I've seen the movie or the book
Q7: Oh, I mean in the States. In all the media I’ve seen, they go for regular check ups but I found it interesting that Canada doesn’t do that.
A: Naw, I don't live in the States and I don't think I have but I guess their healthcare is more on the ""expensive"" line than Canada is. The problem is mostly the government and their lack of esteem. (I'm gonna try not to get too political here rofl but otherwise, yeah.)
Q8: Song of the day: Gorgeous by Taylor Swift.
Speaking of Taylor Swift, are you a fan? I heard she’s coming to Vancouver for her tour. I do listen to her music but I don’t keep up with her personal life. My friend wants to go to the concert so we’re going to try to snag some tickets when they release next week. Imagine my surprise when she told me the tickets are on sale soon but the concert itself isn’t until the END of next year. Gosh.
A: Meh, not anymore. I listened to some of her songs in middle school, but outgrew that phase in highschool (Long story short, I listen to her songs once in a while, but I'm not a hardcore fan and I can't necessarily stand her fanbase either. I'm not really sorry for that part though.)
Q9: Nu pratar jag på svenska! Kommer du att ta reda på vilket språk jag talar på? Ce n'est pas grave si vous ne savez pas puisqu'il y a toujours du français 😊
A: ROFL, okay
Q10: Bonus questions – What’s the best board game? If you were gifted a giraffe, what would you do with it if you couldn’t sell or give it away.
A: I'd probably use it as free transportation ROFL. And the best board game would either go to Game of Life or Monopoly to be honest.

Intro: Hi, Jen! I’m baaaack. Thanks for your patience : )) I got all my grades back. Honestly, I think I did as expected on one, better than expected on another, and worse than expected on the last one. So, to average out, I did ok. I’m 100% alright with that as ok is better than bad ahaha.
Now that I’m outta that slump, I’ve been loosely job hunting. It’s been hard because everyone only wants full timers, or you need a class 5 license. I don’t even have a regular license. Right now, I applied for two accounting positions which I think I won’t get cause they did ask for people with experience. I applied anyways cause why not. Then I just applied for a concierge position. The hours are awful (for me). They want 8am to 4pm and I go to bed at 8am sometimes.
My friend recently got hired for an accounting position which is fantastic. I’m super proud of her. But now I feel like I should be trying to gain more experience because I’ve been at my current job for almost two years now. I’m eyeing some receptionist roles, but my friend told me she had gone to a bunch of receptionist interviews and they’re super picky with hiring. 
One thing for sure – I will never go back to retail. No more Christmas songs for me, please.
A: Hey Lisa, happy Halloween (at the time I'm writing this lol). Congratulations on your tests! And Class 5 licenses usually depends on the field of work you want to go into. I 100% don't know much about it, but I wish you luck!
Q1: How’s your throat? Everyone around me has been sick for weeks. I think there’s a cold going around. I’ve definitely heard about lululemon people but usually they’re like lululemon teens rather than the moms. Is her dog super friendly? I remember loving going over to my friend’s house in hs because he had a dog. I wasn’t allowed a pet so I enjoyed the times with his dog. His name was pronounced as “Askim” so whenever people would ask my friend what his dog’s name is – he’d just say “Askim” as in Ask him.
A: Lol, I guess it's fine now. I think I have a chest cold/infection, idk honestly lol. Yes, her dog is usually friendly once you get to know her :D Lol
Q2: Ripley’s aquarium of Canada sounds cool. I love aquariums. Have you been to the Vancouver Aquarium? They have animals and insects along with the aquatic animals. I didn’t realize that wasn’t common until I went to one in Japan and they only had water creatures.
A: Lol, yes I have been to that aquarium twice XD.
Q3: Word of the day!: Hullabaloo – a loud, continued noise or mixture of noises.
A: HAHAHA LOL
Q4: Are you good at sewing? I got a new tank top, but the strap ripped as soon as I tried it on. I sewed it back, but I don’t know if I did it correctly.
A: When it comes to the epitome of sewing, I'd say I'm average at it even though I don't sew much anymore. As for the broken strap, I would try double-stitching with the machine (if you own one), as it usually does work on some occasions.
Q5: Movies set in the past always have the best costumes. Sometimes I wish balls were still a thing so I could wear a fancy gown.
A: Lol. Imagine this if you will, but I don't know if fancy banquets count, but that's probably the closest we'll probably get in today's world haha.
Q6: Glad to hear everything went well in your appointment! One thing I always found interesting about the doctor is that, in Canada, we only go when there’s already an issue but in the States, they have regular checkups? Like do you just go there, have them ask a bunch of questions, then leave? What if you’re doing fine? Do they charge you if nothing is wrong but you went for a checkup anyways?
A: Apologies, I'm not sure what you are trying to imply. Are you talking about what healthcare is like in the States or in Canada? If it's the States, I have never went to the States for a medical appointment. But in Canada, I don't think so. Most of the time, Canada's healthcare is ""free"" I guess. (except meds though.)
Q7: I did not know that the unicorn was Scotland’s official animal loool. That’s super interesting. I didn’t know you could have a mythical creature as your official animal.
A: Well, I guess you learn something new everyday haha

Intro: Hey, Jen!
Thanks for your patience : ) I was able to catch up on work and finish my FIRST exam. I still have two more coming up so thanks in advance again for your continued consideration : D
I think I did fine? I’m a little nervous cause the prof gave us 3 hours to do it. I finished in 1.5 hours but I saw that everyone else was still writing (we were on zoom), so I sat there for 40 min. I was worried that if I left so early the prof might suspect me of cheating or something. So, 40 min passes, and everyone is still writing it. At that point, I was thinking to myself “I think this is enough time to clear me of suspicions” and then I left.
Yesterday, I couldn’t sleep so I was browsing YouTube. I saw a song called the Pi song. I managed to memorize 56 digits of pi. I will never need this skill ever, but I did it.
A: That's okay loll, I was hanging out with my best friend who came back to town from college this weekend (sorry for the small delay XD, I also have a sore throat as I am writing this at the moment haha.) and we just took her dog for a walk and joked about ""lululemon moms"" (if you don't know what they are, I think they're basically moms who have a coffee in one hand and walking their dog with the other, rofl. But idk if there are any in this case, lol) Oh in that case, congratulations (if you passed, idk if you did)
Q1: Thanksgiving lunch sounds delicious. I love cranberry sauce.
A: Lol.
Q2: I did wear a red dress. Now that I’m looking at it, the dress design is so outdated. For my year, like a third of my grade had a similar design. It’s like long, sleeveless dress, with flowers on the bodice going down onto the skirt but not covering all of the skirt, and a cinched waist. Now, I feel like a lot of the prom dresses are silky, sophisticated, and chic.
A: Nice, I think you might be right but I think it changes every year depending how long that trend will tend to stay lol.
Q3: Thanks for the heads up! I was looking up flights to Toronto recently. I didn’t realize they were at a relatively affordable price. For some reason, I thought it would be much higher. I also learned that there’s this train from VIA rail that goes all the way across Canada. I thought it would be a cool experience but wow it’s around 6k-10k. That’s more than my trip to Japan!
A: Rofl, I think it depends on what class you are registering into. (e.g, business class, economy). But yeah, if this is your first time going, I recommend checking out the CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium of Canada and the Toronto Islands :D
Q4: A flying bird would be an ornithopter. Good example : )
A: Thanks XD
Q5: Word of the day!: Jabberwock – gibberish or nonsense.
You might have heard of “The Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll who featured it in his second Alice in Wonderland novel. 
A: Yes, I have! I beileve it might've been seen or mentioned in the Disney version of the movie.
Q6: I don’t mind carrots, but I think they taste better when they’re raw.  
A: Oh! Well, you do you :) No judgement here!
Q7: Yum. Looks like noodles are both our choices of a quick meal. I always make sure to add some eggs in.
A: Rofl!
Q8: Yes, ahah The Spanish Golden Age!
A: Lol! It did take place in Spain.
Q9: I think I said it was a bowl as well because mine had a ton of spaghetti in it. Most of us agreed it was a bowl except for one person who claimed it was a plate.
A: Oh haha, hilarious! It does give that illusion, and I almost thought it was a plate myself rofl
Q10: Winter is coming BUT WHERE IS MY AUTUMN. Every year, the autumn season seems to be non-existent. Summer doesn’t end until the end September and we get some hot days in October. November comes around and, at that point, it’s basically winter. My fav season : ( gone.
A: Fall does still exist, but yeah, the clock seems to be ticking faster than ever now.
Q11: Did you ever have to take home economics? We had to sew in that class. That year, we were making boxer shorts and mine came out absolutely awful. That day, I learned how terrible at sewing I was.
A: I did take sewing up until Grade 12 because I didn't like the teacher very much so I stopped in my senior year. I did take Foods class though and it was really fun!
Q12: Never seen the movie - Little Women. I want to read the book though.
A: It was pretty good to watch, suffice to say. They did a good job with the costumes and the settings. It made it seem like it really did take place in the Victorian Era if I do say so myself.
Q13: I don’t have a favourite flower. If I had to choose, I think tiny cacti are cute.
A: Lol, okay!
Last but not least, Q14: How did your appointment go?
A: Ah, it went well. Just talked about some health issues goin' on recently, nothing new lol.

Intro: Hey Jen!
Happy Belated BELATED Thanksgiving haha. Did you celebrate? I was pretty happy not having to attend class on Monday but my teacher still made us watch videos to make up for the missed class.
A: Lol! We didn't celebrate much, but we had a Thanksgiving lunch :D 
Q1: Red suit with pearls sounds real sophisticated. I wore red to my prom too : )
A: Nice! A red dress I'm assuming? Correct me if I'm wrong XD
Q2: Is Toronto dangerous? Or, at least, dangerous enough to not want to walk alone? When I went to Japan, there were so many alleyways, but they never felt dangerous. Honestly, there were so many alleyways, I was surprised. I was always taught to avoid them, but everyone was fine walking through them there.
A: I don't think so. I can't really say as I haven't been there since 2013, but I might be going again next year? But I heard that crime has increased a bit prior to the past couple years. But yes, I think you should be okay during the day, but if you do plan to roam around at night, it's probably wise to bring a buddy with ya in any case! (bonus if you know any friends or family who live in the area!)
Q2: Word of the day!: Ornithopter – a device that flies by flapping wings.
A: So like a flying robot bird?
Q3: Do you usually put anything in the sauce? I just cook some chicken and add it in. I’m not sure if it’s good with any vegetables or not.
A: It depends. Sometimes if we have guests, we usually make it not-so-spicy. But if it's us and some family-friends, then we go all crazy I think lol. And yes, you can try it with vegetables! Carrots can be a good starter.
Q4: What’s your to-go food for when you don’t feel like cooking but you want to make something quick and easy? For me, I always go with noodle soup. Just throw some vegetables in a pot, add some noodles, and you got a full meal.
A: Ooooh, good question. Usually if I'm chillin' at home, I will make some instant noodles. Kinda like yours but I start off with a kettle of water then once it's boiled, I just put the stock and stuff in, and then I pour the water and let it sit for 10 minutes. But if I'm heading out, then I would just put leftovers in a container, toss it into the microwave, then whammo! Ya got yourself a on-the-go type of thing. (unless I'm going out to eat with family or friends in this case, XD)
Q5: I think I’d like the Victorian Era or whatever the golden age of Spain was called. I like their fancy dresses. Or the golden age of Greece since I heard it was incredibly advanced despite the time period. Like, they even made a working aqueduct. They also had the Library of Alexandria. Philosophy was flourishing and they were making great strides in mathematics.
A: Oooh haha! For Spain, I believe it's called The Spanish Golden Age :) The Victorian Age is most likely what it's used for the UK lol.
Q6: Lool what about the image I added? Is that a plate or a bowl? It’s such a silly question but everyone is so divided about it. Every time my friends and I go out, we (jokingly) argue when we see something in between. Once we went to a fancy Italian place and asked a waitress the question. She got everyone working to come by and give their vote.
A: XD. It looked like a bowl to me if I'm being honest lol. But it looks like one of those saucers (the ones you use for teacups).
Q7: Song of the day: Moonlight by Kali Uchis
A: I've heard this artist before!
Q8: Hmm. I don’t usually play any sports but I don’t mind badminton. I feel like it’s easy enough and not toooo tiring. I love hibernating in the winter. You know that feeling when you get outta bed to go to the bathroom before rushing back into bed, under the covers, and it feels like warm hug? That’s the best part of winter. Winter where I am is barely winter. When it snows (which it usually doesn’t), it’s all slush. Nasty, nasty slush that turns into grey soup after a few hours of people walking in it. Then it freezes overnight and it becomes ice. Oh god and the Christmas music. THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC. Working in retail, you’re going to hear the exact same song 100000x times. I suppose it’s fun struggling to walk on the ice when you’re with a friend ahha. What’s your favourite thing about winter?
A: Lol, well never fear, winter is on the way! And yeah, I only did sports in gym classes lol. But I do try and go out for walks once in a while if it's nice but when winter arrives, I'll probably be stuck at home 24/7 rofl. I KNOW THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING ON REPEAT IS SO ANNOYING, it makes me want to drop the groceries and just go home D:
Q9: Bonus questions : ) What was your favourite and least favourite subject in school? If you had to choose a duotang colour for science, math, literature, French, and history – what colour would be associated with them? For me, history is always green because I think of land. Math is red. Science is blue. I think English would be yellow or black. French would be brown.
A: Good question, my favourite subject would be cooking and guitar and my least would have to be photography and gym. And I don't think I've used duotangs very much back in highschool since we pretty much used binders, sorry!

Hey Jen!
Happy Belated BELATED Thanksgiving haha. Did you celebrate? I was pretty happy not having to attend class on Monday but my teacher still made us watch videos to make up for the missed class. 
Red suit with pearls sounds real sophisticated. I wore red to my prom too : ) 
Is Toronto dangerous? Or, at least, dangerous enough to not want to walk alone? When I went to Japan, there were so many alleyways, but they never felt dangerous. Honestly, there were so many alleyways, I was surprised. I was always taught to avoid them, but everyone was fine walking through them there. 
Word of the day!: Ornithopter – a device that flies by flapping wings. 
Do you usually put anything in the sauce? I just cook some chicken and add it in. I’m not sure if it’s good with any vegetables or not. 
Modeling would be cool too. My friend from high school started modeling about a year ago and it looks like she’s loving it. One thing I love is how it she’s exploring different styles and getting to visit a bunch of different areas. One of my coworkers in the past is a fashion content creator too and I always see her going to like fashion shows and fashion week events. I’m not 100% sure how it works, but I think you have to be invited to go? 
What’s your to-go food for when you don’t feel like cooking but you want to make something quick and easy? For me, I always go with noodle soup. Just throw some vegetables in a pot, add some noodles, and you got a full meal. 
I think I’d like the Victorian Era or whatever the golden age of Spain was called. I like their fancy dresses. Or the golden age of Greece since I heard it was incredibly advanced despite the time period. Like, they even made a working aqueduct. They also had the Library of Alexandria. Philosophy was flourishing and they were making great strides in mathematics. 
Lool what about the image I added? Is that a plate or a bowl? It’s such a silly question but everyone is so divided about it. Every time my friends and I go out, we (jokingly) argue when we see something in between. Once we went to a fancy Italian place and asked a waitress the question. She got everyone working to come by and give their vote. 
Song of the day: Moonlight by Kali Uchis
Hmm. I don’t usually play any sports but I don’t mind badminton. I feel like it’s easy enough and not toooo tiring. I love hibernating in the winter. You know that feeling when you get outta bed to go to the bathroom before rushing back into bed, under the covers, and it feels like warm hug? That’s the best part of winter. Winter where I am is barely winter. When it snows (which it usually doesn’t), it’s all slush. Nasty, nasty slush that turns into grey soup after a few hours of people walking in it. Then it freezes overnight and it becomes ice.

Oh and it seems that I missed a question rofl :'D
Q: What did you wear to prom? Did you do anything fun after the event? When I graduated, after prom, the school got together with other local schools and rented a rec centre. The were a bunch of stuff you could do (like carnival games or they converted the top floor to a casino with fake money) and prizes to win. I won driving lessons that I never used haha. We stayed until 7am. It was so fun.
A: I wore a red suit with pearls on it :D After the event, I don't think so because it was on the day before Father's Day so I spent it with my family :) And that sounds cool, we did something similar with the ""casino"" games but there was a lot of food!",Mentee

Intro: Hey, Jen! How was your weekend? Over the weekend, I hung out with my best friends. We went to a popular brunch place. The wait was an hour but it was 100% worth it since there were a lot of stores around for us to pass time. I’ll add a pic of the food. I went about 4 years ago and I’ve been wanting to go back since. I’m happy I got a chance : )
A: Ay, what's good? I guess it was pretty neat looooong weekend. By the way, Happy belated Thanksgiving!
Q1: We were also talking about maybe going to Korea next year. I do want to travel more since I’m still young but I’m honestly still kinda broke since Japan was only half a year ago lol. I’m probably going to have to pick up some extra shifts if I do decide to go. I’m not excited about the long plane ride. I have a friend in Korea so I msged him to be kinda like “Hey, surprise. Cya next year”. I haven’t seen him in almost 2 years. BUT THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE’S COMING BACK TO CANADA maybe around the time I’m going to Korea. There goes my surprise lol
A: Niceeeeee! Sorry about the suprise though XD.
Q2: I’ve never checked it out (since I’ve never gone to Toronto), but I think I’d be worried about looking like a tourist. At my school, we always see a ton of international visitors posing in front of the buildings even if they’re (honestly) kinda ugly.
A: It's pretty cool overall! Definitely check out the CN Tower :D Just do be careful when strutting down the streets alone though, and always carry a map on you! Oh, oof to that.
Q3: Word of the day!: specious – superficially plausible, but actually wrong.
A: Almost sounds like ""spacious""
Q4: If you make butter chicken from scratch, that’s already impressive. I use pre-made butter chicken sauce from a jar.
A: I actually don't think I make it from scratch, I think we make it from out of a bag (since making it from scratch can be VERY difficult to do so and requires a LOT of ingredients and patience!)
Q5: Ooh being a graphic designer sounds cool. My friend actually does graphic design. She told me that her friend in the same program recently got hired by, I think, Unity technologies? She also worked on magazine covers for her professors. Maybe you could pursue graphic design in the future.
A: Not sure, it'll probably change again by next year (as it usually does rofl; when I was in early high school, I wanted to be a model, but I don't know just yet, but life is life!)
Q6: That’s alright! I’ve only made resolutions when they forced us to in elementary school.
A: Rofl, I don't think I've had that happen in elementary school.
Q7: Other than working on my hobbies, I like looking at the sky. I think my fav memory of the sky would be during the winter in the morning. It was super clear and blue with a hint of purple and pink. I recently learned that I like completing those wood DIY kits. Eating good food makes me happy too. Especially food that you’ve been craving for a while. You take the first bite, and all your cravings are satisfied.
A: Cool :D
Q8: Bonus Questions: What’s one of your recent food cravings? Do you have a favourite time period? What’s the defining difference between a bowl and a plate?
A: Idrk, I usually eat whatever's at home (unless we got some occasions goin' on) rofl! Time period, you say? I'd give in to either the Medieval Ages or the Iron Ages. Wait what? Yah wanna know what the difference is between a plate and a bowl are? Uhhh, that be kinda tricky. Bowls would be for like soup, cereal, etc; while plates would be for spaghetti, salads, and stuff.

Intro: Hiiiii Jen. No worries! You’re not late at all. You actually reply really quickly ahha.
A: Lol thanks
Q1: Oooooh, that does sound fun. What design did you get for your nails? I don’t go to salons but I love collecting nail polish. My fav brand is Romand.  What did you think of the campus? I’ve been to a few campuses and I’m always amazed at the difference. For example, UBC is basically a huge town on its own. SFU is basically in a mountain. Looking down and seeing how deep the floors get is insane. BCIT looks kinda like a fancy high school. KPU is a little basic and reminds me of a like nice government building.
A: Good question, I don't think I know but I have some photos I think lol. Yeh, it's pretty insane when you think about it that way XD. Wait until you go to UOT lol
Q2: Still feeling a little sleepy, but I’ve had a good few days : ) It was my younger sister’s birthday. I got her two makeup sets from Sephora.
A: Nice, hope she had a good one :D
Q3: My books came today which I was excited about. I had to reorganize my shelves. My newest bookshelf is deep and wide (basically each section is a big cube). The only issue is that if I put books behind the front books, they get blocked. I thought about putting some sideways on the inside and then putting books on top so they peek out from behind the front books. I’m kinda scared it’ll make the section too heavy and break the shelf though. What I ended up doing was leaving the first book of a series in the front and moving the rest behind it. That way, I can at least see what series I own even if I can’t see the entire set.
A: Oh cool
Q4: Word of the day!: Kip - unit of weight equivalent to 1000 pounds
A: Yo, that's cool
Q5: Could be! I didn’t really gain access to technology until high school, but I think the plastic shoes came around a few years ago.
A: Lol
Q6: Have you thought about getting a second-hand Macbook? That might be more affordable so you don’t have to save up for multiple years. One thing I miss about my previous laptop was that it could transform into a tablet. That made it sooo much easier to read my notes cause it felt like I was reading a book.
A: Lol, maybe not now. Maybe [potientially] in the future, but who knows until then? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q7: Yeah, I have heard it! I think I had it on repeat when it first came out but I don’t listen to it anymore. I really like how Western artists are doing music collabs with Korean artists. One I love and have still saved is Bad Decisions by Denny Blanco and BTS. That’ll be my song of the day : )
A: Lol okay, you do you :)
Q8: I suck at cooking too but I’m worse at baking. I loveeee butter chicken. Do you usually make it from scratch?
A: Lol, looks like I'm not the only one! As for the butter chicken, I think so
Q9: The most memorable thing I did is going to Japan. Maybe cause of the length, the fact that I hadn’t traveled much before, and being there with my closest friends. If I had to choose a non-travel related answer (cause all travel tends to be memorable), I think it would be the Christmas party at my friend’s house. It was potluck style. I brought my Instax camera so we were having fun taking silly photos. Additionally, I brought my switch to play games. Everyone had a blast. We played games all night and left at 6 a.m. when the buses started running again. As soon as I got home, I passed out. What about you? This is a good question.
A: I think the most memorable thing would have to be Prom. It was pretty fun <3
Q10: Bonus questions: If you could live a single day working any job you want, what would it be? Do you usually make New Year’s resolution lists?
A: Ooooh, as long if it's not an office job or a job where you don't sit or stand all day long lol. So it'll probably have to come to either a graphic designer or music producer I think! For New Years' resolutions, I don't necessarily like doing them in general because I know I won't do them all in one year depending what life decides to throw at me, so I can't really say much about that, sorry!

Intro: Hey Jen! Hope you had a good weekend.
A: Hey, sorry for the late reply, I've been in and out of town for the past two days (2nd and 3rd). I went to see my friend in college and we had a lot of fun! She did my hair, nails and makeup and we walked around the campus and she gave me a tour! So it was fun times all around :D
Q1: Here are my weekend updates. Not an exciting weekend for me, unfortunately. I spent most of it doing schoolwork. I completed everything in time and got my group project submitted. Though, now I’m feeling burnt out. I was really nervous about my tax quiz since I wasn’t confident with my answers. Luckily, I got my grades back today, and I got everything right. 
I’ve been really sleepy recently too. Not sure why. Maybe used up too much brain juice? Haha.
A: Oh snap. Sorry to hear the weekend was dreadful. Congrats on your quiz though :)
Q2: Which Mario games do you like? Rn, I play Mario games like Mario kart with my friends, but my fav is Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. It’s such an old game, you might not know if it. It was released in 2003. Compared to the other games, it had a lot of good locations to explore and good narratives. It was also really funny. Lastly, I like how there was an emphasis on being both Mario and Luigi.
A: I think the only one I've played was Unfair Mario, it's an online game lol.
Q3: Word of the day!: potvaliancy – a surge of bravery accompanied by drunkenness
A: Oh, interesting word and meaning :o
Q4: Yea I remember seeing mixed reactions from the Batman casting. I heard that the overall census after the movie was that it wasn’t a bad casting. Though, I wouldn’t know since I haven’t watched it yet lol.
A: Yeah I guess. Idk
Q5: Bottoms in general. High waisted jeans, high waisted trousers, etc. Low waisted skirts look cool, but I could never pull them off. I’m not surprised that you haven’t heard of plastic shoes. I think the only people I’ve seen wear them are influencers lol.
A: Oh ok lol. And yeah probably because I [mostly] spent my childhood without technology until I was in middle school so that's maybe why.
Q6: Is it like beat saber? I’ve seen that game a lot. I remember playing piano tiles when I was in high school. That was a fun music game. Same with Deemo.
A: Yep! You're right :D
Q7: Ooo I like Asus products too. Aw man : ( That really sucks. MacBooks are popular too. My friend told me to get one for school but I ended up choosing the Microsoft laptop because it was on sale. Plus, I’m in accounting and Excel doesn’t work well on Apple products.
A: That's okay lol. And yep, MacBooks are popular, and yes expensive too, normally depends on the model and price. If it's the [slightly] older MacBooks, then they'll probably be a little cheaper (I could possibly be wrong)
Q8: Were there mermaids in Percy Jackson? I read that so many years ago, I don’t remember anything.
A: Kinda hard to say right now lol so I guess probably not?
Q9: ""Left and Right"" by Charlie Puth (feat. Jungkook) I love this song : )
A: Lol! Have you heard it before?
Q10: Is Pixar the same as Disney? I like Tangled, The Incredibles, Wall-E, and Ratatouille. Out of the four, I think Wall-E has the #1 space in my heart – not sure why since I don’t really like sci-fi.
A: I think so since Disney pretty much owns it. And cool lol
Q11: Bonus Questions: What’s a dish you love cooking? What’s your favourite time of the day and why?
A: I [kinda] still suck at cooking, but I do have a few favourite dishes: Butter chicken, chilli chicken, salmon with eggplant and mushroom sautéd (idk what it's called lol). And my favourite time of the day is the afternoon because I guess it's pretty chill :)

Intro: Hey Jen! Hope you had a good week so far.
A: Yes, I guess so!
Q1: Here are some updates from me! I think I went a little crazy and went overboard buying new books lol. I ended up getting 16 but I got them from a site that sells them at a discount.
A: Wow :0
Q2: I was browsing switch games for a bit. I got Overcooked to play with my friends in the future. I’m going to wait for a sale but I really want this semi-new game called “Warioware”. I’m up to 113 hours in Baldur’s Gate 3 now. I’m in the last act (the game is split into three), but it feels like I’m nowhere close to the end. 113 hours is already insane. I kinda want to switch over to Stardew but I'm really stubborn and I hate leaving things unfinished. 
A: Nice. I like games like Mario lol
Q4: Lastly, I got an email from my tax professor congratulating me on my good work thus far despite the difficult material 😊That really made me feel better about school.
A: That's good
Q5: Oh, I meant my spiel about how hard my classes are ahah. I know that some people who aren’t in college or uni yet get a little intimidated.
A: Lol
Q6: Whatever you end up choosing, I think you’ll make a good choice. School is whatever you make of it anyway.
A: Ye, I guess so XD
Q7: Word of the day!: mizzle - to rain in small drops
A: Nice one
Q8: I’m not able to whistle half of the time. Sometimes I can. The whistle comes out crisp if you know what I mean. The other half of the time, I somehow can’t make any noise.
A: Oof, I guess sometimes not many people can do the skills they were able to do anymore.
Q9: Is that bad? I wanted to see the new Batman because he played Edward. I found it so funny that he played as a vampire and now he’s a “bat man”.
A: Ahh, no. I think it's just my opinion. Not so sure about everyone else, but it's just mixed feeling from audiences (if you know what I mean.)
Q10: Song of the day: Dead! By My Chemical Romance. (Thanks for the updated song recommendation. I didn’t realize JVKE recently came out with another banger!)
A: Ye!
Q11: You must be happy with the 90s and 2000s fashion making a comeback. I really like the high waisted bottoms trend. I loveeee chunky shoes too. As for least fav, I saw a lot of fringe jackets at Zara. They’re not my favourite. Same with see-through, plastic shoes.
A: I guess so, yeah. Wdym? Are you talking about jeans or just random? I didn't know plastic shoes existed lol
Q12: I’ve often seen subway surfers, but I’ve never heard of beat blade.
A: Lol, Beat Blade is a game where you basically [slash] music tiles (and trying not to lose for the most part) with music playing in the background (and you can choose what song you want, but most of the songs are probably locked and will have to unlock to play more songs. And also you can choose your own avatar!) (Disclaimer: I am not trying to promote the game at all, just explaining the details!)
Q13: That’s cool! I’ve never seen a laptop with emoticons built in. Granted, I don’t have much experience with laptops lol What laptop do you have? I got the Microsoft Laptop 4 almost a year ago to replace my original Surface go. I only use it for when I go to campus. As you can tell, I really like Microsoft products.
A: I believe mine is the ASUS Chromebook CX1. I used to have a MacBook but I accidentally spilt my iced coffee on it :( But there's not much I can do about it unless I save up to buy another one (which could take a year or two, depending)
Q14: I like fairies more than mermaids but only if the fairies are like the folklore fairies – similar to the fairies in Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night's Dream”. One author I really like in the genre is Holly Black. She writes a lot of fairy stories where the characters are enchanting yet dangerous, compelling, and dramatic. Mermaids are cool too. I can’t help but think about the other creatures that would exist in the deep sea though. Have you seen the pictures? They’re kinda scary looking.
A: Nice. The closest thing I've seen to mermaid lore is ""The Little Mermaid"" (I guess you might've heard about it already) Well now (I guess) I read a bit of the Percy Jackson series lol
Q11: Bonus questions - Would you say you’re more of an organized person or a messy person? What’s your Myer Briggs type (if you’ve done it)?
Last but not least, Q12: Whoops. Forgot to answer what my favourite holiday is. Even though I haven't celebrated it in years, it has to be Halloween. I love seeing people getting all creative and who doesn't like free candy? What about you?
A: I dunno.. probably either Halloween because we get a looooot of junk, or Christmas :)
A: I don't really know right now -- I will update you if I end up doing it!

Hey Jen! Hope you had a good week so far. 
Here are some updates from me! I think I went a little crazy and went overboard buying new books lol. I ended up getting 16 but I got them from a site that sells them at a discount. 
I was browsing switch games for a bit. I got Overcooked to play with my friends in the future. I’m going to wait for a sale but I really want this semi-new game called “Warioware”. 
I’m up to 113 hours in Baldur’s Gate 3 now. I’m in the last act (the game is split into three), but it feels like I’m nowhere close to the end. 113 hours is already insane. I kinda want to switch over to Stardew but I'm really stubborn and I hate leaving things unfinished. 
Lastly, I got an email from my tax professor congratulating me on my good work thus far despite the difficult material 😊 That really made me feel better about school. 
Oh, I meant my spiel about how hard my classes are ahah. I know that some people who aren’t in college or uni yet get a little intimidated. 
Whatever you end up choosing, I think you’ll make a good choice. School is whatever you make of it anyway. 
Word of the day!: mizzle - to rain in small drops
I’m not able to whistle half of the time. Sometimes I can. The whistle comes out crisp if you know what I mean. The other half of the time, I somehow can’t make any noise. 
Is that bad? I wanted to see the new Batman because he played Edward. I found it so funny that he played as a vampire and now he’s a “bat man”. 
Song of the day: Dead! By My Chemical Romance. 
(Thanks for the updated song recommendation. I didn’t realize JVKE recently came out with another banger!)
You must be happy with the 90s and 2000s fashion making a comeback. I really like the high waisted bottoms trend. I loveeee chunky shoes too. As for least fav, I saw a lot of fringe jackets at Zara. They’re not my favourite. Same with see-through, plastic shoes. 
I’ve often seen subway surfers, but I’ve never heard of beat blade.

Intro: Hey Jen!
Sorry I’m a little late. I was going to reply yesterday but my day ended up not going how I thought it would lol.
Basically, all my assignments are due Saturday or Sunday night. My previous assignments thus far have been smooth sailing. This time, my tax assignment ended up taking me 3 hours to finish. Then my Mortgage and Interest quiz (somehow a quiz) ended up taking me almost 4 hours. I was so confused. Then my old penpal from Sweden msged me and we talked for a few hours to catch up. At this point, it was like 11 am. I passed out so hard, I ended up missing an early dinner with a friend.
I felt so bad. I called him in a hurry to apologize but I had to quickly go back on my computer to finish my mortgage and interest quiz again cause I got a third of them wrong. Fixing my formulas ended up taking me 2 hours. Now I’m taking a break but I have one more assignment due in a few hours and a group project to work on : (
Right after I finished, I msged my friend again and we made plans to meet next week. As an apology, I offered to pay for dinner for the three of us. It was supposed to be our first meeting in-person and he brought his gf. Really didn’t make a good impression there.
I was honestly so shocked because I’ve never slept through a meetup before.
A: It's okay.
Q1: I really hope my previous paragraphs didn’t deter you from thinking about heading to college lol. I swear, it’s usually not that bad but I’m just dispositioned to be bad at mortgage calculations, I suppose. I find tax a lot easier but I think it’s usually the way around.
A: Hold on, what?
Q2: When I was in English Literature and Language, I loved the majority of my classes. I’ve always loved writing. Accounting, on the other hand, doesn’t come naturally to me.
A: Nice, good for you for choosing what fits better for you. :)
Q3: Do you have an idea of what you might want to pursue? And which school?
A: I guess so, but I'll have to use the year off wisely.
Q4: Word of the day!: clishmaclaver – gossip.
A: Lol.
Q5: That’s cool! Half the time, I can’t even do regular whistling haha
A: Like not anymore or just don't really do it?
Q6: I think I’d choose to stop time too. If I could do that, I’d have so many more hours in a day. I’d be reading for hours every day. What would you be doing when you stop time?
A: Lol. As for me, I don't really know XD.
Q7: AirPods definitely count. I have a friend who never leaves his house without one in his ear. For me, lip balm (same as you). A few months ago, my skin got really irritated. It started peeling and stuff. Before that, I’ve never had any issues with my skin. Thankfully, my skin is fine now, but the skin on my lips continue to dry out and peel really easily. Hopefully, it’s not TMI. Other than that, I always have some emergency cash and mints on me. I also carry a little baggy of emergency medicine.
A: Lol, I don't blame him! Nah, not a lot of info. (only on somedays when my brain gets stuck in airplane mode)
Q8: I like Spiderman more. I’ve never watched anything with Iron man. Now: Spiderman or Batman?
A: I would have to say Spiderman too. I like Batman sometimes, but the new Batman movie sort of ruined it for me :/ (because it's the same actor from Twilight that kinda threw me off my seat, not literally lol)
Q9: Song of the day: Late Night Talking by Harry Styles.
A: 👍🏽
Q10: Hope you have an excellent Monday!
A: Same to you!
Q11: Bonus question - What’s your favorite and least favorite trend?
A: My favourite trend? Good question. Most of them would most likely be like 1990s to 2000s fashion lol. And as for least.. I don't know unfortunately. I usually try to stay away from bad trends whenever possible.
Q12: Second bonus question – What’s your favorite app?
A: Subway Surfers or Beat Blade (✿^‿^)
Last but not least: PS. The bear was super cute.
A: Thanks! It's ""built"" (don't know how to put it into detail) into my laptop (so there's the typical emojis and then the emoticons)

Pretty nice if you get a year off : ) It’s like some prolonged vacation.
Update on that actually; I don't know if I will or if I'm going off to college, it's just until I move next year.
Q1: Word of the day!: quincunx – an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners of a square or rectangle and the fifth at its center, used for the five on dice or playing cards
A: Makes sense!
Q2: Haha thank you! I don’t usually watch a lot of shows and I don’t usually talk to my friends about them; however, I’m always up-to-date on new shows if they’re related to like book adaptations. These days, most of the popular shows are. So I always end up surprising other people cause they didn’t expect me to know what they’re talking about lol. Wouldn’t call myself an expert tho. I know the most shallow amount of a bunch of random things.
A: 👍🏽
Q3: Song of the day: All my friends are turning blue - Loren
A: 👌🏽
Q4: I don’t think I have a cool talent. I used to be able to roll my eyes back to only show the whites? I’d do that to freak other people out but that’s not very cool – or good for your eyes. Do you have any cool talents?
A: I guess I can [somewhat] finger whistle if that counts in this case XD
Q5: Would you rather have the power to turn invisible, the ability to fly, or the ability to stop time?
A: Oh man, that's a tough one. I'd say stop time, I think. What about you?
Q6: What’s something you can’t leave the house without? (Not including your phone since that’s everyone’s answer)
A: Lol, good question. Probably my AirPods (don't know if that counts), lip balm, my fanny pack and some snacks (in case I get hungry and need a energy booster lol) What about you?

Intro: Hey Jen!
Is it also back-to-school season for you? If so, how are you holding up so far? My younger sister is trying to swap some of her courses around ahha.
A:  Not as of right now, don't know what's gonna happen yet. I may or may not get the year off until I move next year. It's pretty inevitable.
Q1: Zendaya’s outfits are really cool! I remember when she was on Shake it up. Did you ever watch that show? I recall seeing a few of her outfits on social media. My favs has to be the green dress she wore to the 71st Emmy Awards, the suit she wore for Vanity Fair, and the spiderweb dress for the No way Home premiere. She can pull off so many different styles.
A: I've seen snippets of ""Shake It Up"" but my sisters have watched when we used to have Disney+. I know right? She can ✨ get ittttt ✨
Q2: I think I had sake KitKat once and they tasted really odd lol.
A: Huh. Interesting.
Q3: Yep!! Everything is great. I find those hours work well for me since I’m a natural night owl. It basically allows me to enjoy the night time while still making sure I have an opportunity to get things done during the day. The only issue now is that I accidentally took a nap a few days ago. Naps mess me up. I can never fall asleep after them so now my schedule is kinda messed up again.
A: Nice 👍🏽 Sorry about your sleep schedule. Hopefully it'll be back in place again.
Q4: Word of the day!: Metanoia – the journey of changing your mind, heart, self, and way of life.
A: Cool!
Q5: Do you guys often talk through social media? I’m absolutely horrible at keeping in touch with people, since I’m not typically a huge fan of long conversations over text. I have quite a few friends that moved to another city. Or I guess I do this with friends in the same city as well ahah but basically, we rarely msg each other but once we meet in person, it’s like we’ve been seeing each other every day.
A: Ehhh, not as much. I usually try and give them some space whenever possible.
Q6: Oh no. I’m not offended at all. Don’t worry. That was just my two cents on celebrity culture. Sorry about that. Hope I didn’t stress you out.
A: Nah, no problem.
Q7: Uhhh I like the cartoons I’ve watched in the past. Stuff like Phineas and Ferb. Otherwise, I don’t watch much shows. Are there any you would recommend? I tend to gravitate towards angsty or comedy shows. 
A: Uhhh, good question. I don't think there's anything good on Netflix nowadays, but I've found some K-Dramas (I haven'r watched yet) and that's pretty much it I think lol. (the one I watched and mentioned before was ""A Love So Beautiful or Once Upon A Small Town, have not watched it, I think you might be the expert on K-Dramas lol)
Q8: Thanks for sharing your song of the day. I’d never say no to more Barbie songs lol
A: Okay XD
Q9: Song of the day: Free Animal by Foreign Air.
Q10: I got around to building the little bakery that my friend got me for my birthday : ). I’ll add a photo because I’m really proud of it.
A: Looks nice! :D Well done, I'll give it to ya there 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Bonus question: Thank you!! I actually saw a post of someone who had like mint tip dyed hair. That looked really cool. I’ll add a photo. What do you think? Red or this mint colour?
A: I don't see the red one, so I'll have to say the mint :)

Q1: Oh gosh, I did in the past. I thought it was mostly fine. They didn’t really interact, but everyone was chill. A little awkward (as you mentioned). I wanted to do a bigger birthday party and I invited some friends outside of my main group and they declined the invite cause they said it would be too awkward. I completely get it though. Thanks for the Birthday wishes : )
A: Oh lol. Ay, no prob.
Q2: Anything that stood out from Fashion Week? I don’t usually watch Fashion related stuff but I do sometimes watch youtubers that I like talking about fashion. One example is ModernGurlz on youtube. She does fashion analysis from movies and events and stuff like that. What do you usually watch on youtube?
A: Not much, I don't think. I sometimes pay attention, then otherwise I'm on a different tab internet surfing lol. But weeeeeird designs, y'know? But Zendaya's outfits are pretty cool imo. :-)
Q3: Do you like KitKats? I think out of all the chocolate types, they’re one of my favorites. Only the classic one tho.
A: Yeah, I don't like the Matcha ones tho lol.
Q4: Why do you guys take different routes?
A: I think that's usually the route we take for vacations, etc. We might switch the route up per se but not so sure right now as we are not traveling for a while XD.
Q5: Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being in airplane mode is pretty nice too. I should be in school mode by now but I’m still in relaxation mode haha. One thing I really like about my problem is that the classes are pretty late (most of them are 6:30-9:30pm). I’m trying to follow a schedule where I go to bed around 4-5am, wake up at around 11am, and I either do schoolwork or I work a bit until class.
A: Yikes.. Yikes. Hope everything's good.
Q6: Word of the day!: paterfamilias – the male head of a family or household.
A: Nice
Q6: Good to hear nothing is wrong! Friend problems can be common, so I just wanted to double check.
A: Haha, nice of you to check in otherwise. We don't hang out as much due to college and pretty much life itself (my friend is attending college out of town until next summer I think lol) but we still keep in touch though :)
Q7: Lol when I saw “Here I am”, the song from Camp Rock immediately popped into mind.
A: Nice XD.
Q8: I don’t think I have a favorite celebrity? I guess there are people that I am more biased towards such as Emma Watson due to her humanitarian work, or uhh not sure. At the moment, no one else popped into mind. I kinda live by the philosophy that you shouldn’t favour celebrities or, if you do, you should be able to separate their work and them as a person. As much as we’re exposed to a particular celebrity, they have no idea who we are, and we don’t know them on a personal level.
A: Uhhh okay, good to know I guess. I was gonna say my favorite celebrity was Zendaya but sure, I can respect your choice lol. It was just a fun and harmless question. I hope I didn't offend you in anyway. If I did, I'm sorry. You do you :)
Q9: No favorite sports since I’m very unathletic. If I had to choose one, I’d choose badminton since it’s easy to play. I don’t watch sports either.
A: Alright, that's cool. I respect that.
Q10: I’d dye my hair pink since I haven’t done that yet. I’ve done purple already and I really liked it. Once I go through a few other new colours, I might go back to purple.
A: That's pretty cool, I gotta admit XD
Q11: I think “weird” food is subjective. I’ve eaten like organ meat like chicken hearts, or pig blood, crab innards, or like raw beef which is called Yukhoe in Korean. But, you know, it does sound kinda weird but it’s normal in some cultures. I’m pretty adventurous. As long as it doesn’t contain the eyes or face or whatever (since eyes freak me out), I’m willing to try it. I guess if I had to single one out, it would be Shirako. I had that when I went to Japan. I’d explain what it is but I think my message wouldn’t send loool.
A: Uhhh nice?

Intro: Hi Jen! Thanks for your patience. How were you this past week? Do anything fun?
As for me, I spent most of my Thursday and Friday doing my schoolwork in advance and working. On Saturday, I had a nice dinner with a group of my friends for my birthday. We went to a big mall since they recently opened a photostrip place with a bunch of funny hats. I wore a banana hat ahaha. Then we had dinner at a Korean place and got thickkkk icecream (that reminded me of Turkish icecream) for dessert.
My friends got me a vinyl player, a DIY mini bakery house thing, and a face cleanser. I was so surprised by the vinyl lol since I only mentioned it a few days before Saturday and my best friend got one for me.
On Sunday, I went to see a movie called No More Bets with my mom then had another birthday dinner with another friend. He got me some chocolates. I ALSO have another birthday dinner with ANOTHER friend but I haven’t scheduled that yet. Honestly, I’ve been pretty busy. I find it kinda hard to manage my time because I have like a main friend group but a bunch of friends that aren’t in a group and don’t know each other. So I end up going out a lot to make sure I interact with everyone on a regular basis. I don’t know if I explained that well but do you get what I mean?
Plus I really love staying at home so I get tired so easily.
A: Lol, you should introduce them to each other someday (your choice lol), I did when I was w/ my friend group at Tim Hortons one time. It was awkward but it was fun in the end and that's what matters :) Oh and happy belated birthday 🥳 I've just been watching fashion content (eg: Fashion Week)
Q1: Your sister has good taste. I’ve been giving them out to my friends and trying to convert them all into Werther lovers. Speaking of cookies, I tried Gluten Free chocolate chip cookies a few days ago. They were very dry and a little hard; however, I loved them. My sister hated how dry they were but I think it’s delicious.
A: They're not too bad I guess. I like chocolate in either bars or those mini-bags. 
Q2: Have you been to Whistler at all? If not, do you want to? I thought about going with a group of friends last summer but wow the prices there are crazy. Pretty sure one night there for one hotel room was about $500.
A: Good question! I don't think I have lol. It seems fun so yeah! If I ever come to the Lower Mainland again, most likely! (my family and I usually take a different route to get to Vancouver haha)
Q3: Oh no. How are you feeling now? I’m sorry. This is probably really delayed but I hope you’re doing better. Was it just one of those days?
A: Not to worry, I'm okay now lol. Yeah it was. And also my head's still in airplane mode since I came home 2 weeks ago XD.
Q4: I walked around Ikea, sat on some chairs, had a small photoshoot for my friend’s new brand, and ate lunch there. If you ever get the chance, I recommend checking it out. I basically go there at least once every two months with my best friend. I know it’s a furniture store, but their Swedish meatballs are so good and it’s fun just walking around, checking out furniture, and being silly with another person. Maybe it’s the vibe.
A: That sounded like fun! Neato :D
Q5: Word of the day!: Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia – the FEAR of LONG words (Ironic, I know)

Q6: Reply to “Quote of the day: -""Friendships aren't worth the price."" Oh no : ( Did something happen for that quote of the day? No need to share if it’s personal.
A: Oh! Nothing happened, don't worry -- My brain has been fried recently so that's probably why lol. But thank you for the concern :)

Hi Jen! Thanks for your patience. 
How were you this past week? Do anything fun?
As for me, I spent most of my Thursday and Friday doing my schoolwork in advance and working. On Saturday, I had a nice dinner with a group of my friends for my birthday. We went to a big mall since they recently opened a photostrip place with a bunch of funny hats. I wore a banana hat ahaha. Then we had dinner at a Korean place and got thickkkk icecream (that reminded me of Turkish icecream) for dessert. 
My friends got me a vinyl player, a DIY mini bakery house thing, and a face cleanser. I was so surprised by the vinyl lol since I only mentioned it a few days before Saturday and my best friend got one for me. 
On Sunday, I went to see a movie called No More Bets with my mom then had another birthday dinner with another friend. He got me some chocolates. I ALSO have another birthday dinner with ANOTHER friend but I haven’t scheduled that yet. Honestly, I’ve been pretty busy. I find it kinda hard to manage my time because I have like a main friend group but a bunch of friends that aren’t in a group and don’t know each other. So I end up going out a lot to make sure I interact with everyone on a regular basis. I don’t know if I explained that well but do you get what I mean?
Plus I really love staying at home so I get tired so easily. 
Your sister has good taste. I’ve been giving them out to my friends and trying to convert them all into Werther lovers. Speaking of cookies, I tried Gluten Free chocolate chip cookies a few days ago. They were very dry and a little hard; however, I loved them. My sister hated how dry they were but I think it’s delicious. 
Have you been to Whistler at all? If not, do you want to? I thought about going with a group of friends last summer but wow the prices there are crazy. Pretty sure one night there for one hotel room was about $500.

Intro: Happy Wednesday and Happy September!
A: Thanks, you too!
Q1: Hotpot as innnnn like a giant pot of boiling soup and you throw ingredients in to cook it. It’s kinda like a communal event cause everyone shares the pot and we scoop food out of the pot for each other. If I’m being honest, I don’t really like the food but I love the atmosphere. Everyone is focused on one pot, we’re sitting in a circle and engaging with each other, and (since we’re usually in a private room) we’re not worried about disturbing the other guests.
A: Oh?
Q2: Update on the keyboard. It’s pretty nice so far and the keys feel smooth. However, they do feel a little cheap (which makes sense cause I got a budget keyboard). I guess I’m too used to my old one haha
A: 👍🏽
Q3: I never had a “prestige” barbie doll but I do remember one of my old classmates who was obsessed with Barbie. She had a bunch behind glass displays. It all looked very luxurious.
A: Oh wow, I've seen doll collector YouTubers over the years, but that is pretty top-notch!
Q4: Do you prefer the soft cookies or do you like it when it’s crisp and crumbly? I don’t like the original chocolate chip cookies anymore but I love celebration biscuits. Recently, I’ve been craving Werther’s hard candy which took me by surprise because I feel like nobody likes it. My friends call it “old man candy” hahaha
A: AYOOOOO I like those too, I have 'em once in a while lol. And it depends where. If it's Tim Hortons, I guess it would have to be crisp and crumbly. But I don't mind either XD. And I dunno, I've tried those candies a couple times and it wasn't too bad. My younger sister likes them too rofl.
Q5: Now that you’re back home, how’s the air quality? Is it better than before? It’s cooled down a lot which I’m overjoyed about since it feels like the start of autumn. Last year, the summer basically lasted until October and then it immediately become winter. Autumn is (debatably) the BEST season.
A: Good as always lol. Oooooooh, sounds like Mother Nature's not having it haha.
Q6: Have you been to the whistler gondola? I assume it would be similar.
A: Nope! I haven't been lol.
Q7: A meter? Isn’t that basically beside the motorhome? Did it freak you out being that close?
A: Sorry I meant more than a meter lol. And not really, everybody was basically running to the window and watching it walk off.
Q8: Ooooo a fancy mall. Did you buy anything good?
A: Yes I did!
Q9: I was going to reply yesterday, but my day ended being a little annoying, so I waited until today. I was meeting a friend to eat at Ikea and to check out the brown bear cause I was also thinking of getting one. My friend recently got her license, and this was supposed to be her first time driving me. She drove to the mall completely fine, met up with me, we went to her car, and there was an issue with the handbrake. It refused to budge. We couldn’t figure it out, so we had to bus to Ikea.
A: Nah, I get it. I wasn't in a good mood yesterday (the 5th by the time you read this lol) and I didn't want to take it out on anybody. I luckily reached out a bit to Juliet (the one in charge of the whole platform.) Did you just walk around IKEA? I've heard of IKEA, but never went in one rofl.
Q10: We arrive and the brown bear was SOLD OUT. Legit, there were 50 last week. We hung out until 6. I had to go home for my first class of the semester. My friend left to meet with her aunt who was going to either tow or fix the car. I get home and realized that my professor actually changed the class time to later. THEN my friend msgs me to tell me that the car was completely fine when her aunt arrived. What is this luck – I swear.
A: Ah, man. Sorry about that, dude.

Intro: Hi Jen! Looks like you did eventually get my messages ahah. And the failed-to-send messages got removed soo maybe they finally took a look after I accidentally spammed them.
A: Hey Lisa, okay lol. Good you got that out of the way XD
Q1: Yeah! For my birthday, I wanted to go to hotpot at this popular location called Haidilao. In the previous years, I’d have a big group so we could have a private room. This time, most of my friends will be in Japan : ( so we don’t have enough for the room. Got me scrambling to find a replacement since whenever we go out and eat, we try to find a new restaurant and avoid repeats.
A: Hotpot? As in ""hotspot""? Awh man, that sucks :( Sorry.
Q2: That’s smart. I do try to split my paycheck in half with half going into my spending money and half going into my savings. However, I also use my spending money for groceries and bills and such ahah. Maybe because the other half has the title of “saving”, I really don’t want to touch it. I do occasionally dip into it if my bills are too high for that month.
A: Lol, I mean most people use either just simple methods or difficult ones that are hard to follow (and just for the ""fun of it"").
Q3: Nice! Is it one of those keyboards that lights up, or is it one of those retro colorful aesthetic ones? 
I was eyeing those aesthetic retro ones for a while. It was tempting but I went with the light up ones cause I think they’re better for gaming. The one I got was also on sale. Since the retro ones have circular keycaps, I think there would be a higher chance of me not hitting the keys correctly? (based on a completely unscientific belief lol I could be 100% wrong).
A: True. I'm guessing. I don't think scientists have researched that yet (what you heard might be misinformation on social media most likely.)
Q4: I used to have a bunch of Bratz and Polly pocket dolls. I don’t know if you ever had them but Polly pocket dolls have like stretchy plastic clothes which I found much more entertaining than regular ol' fabric. I recently looked up Tamagotchi’s cause I had a bunch when I was younger. They are so expensive now! Do I still want one? Yes : (
A: I think so? I don't remember now, but I probably did at some point lol. I guess, but if it were like prestige Barbies or Disney dolls, then I think the fabric is nice, it's funny that it tries to look like the replica dress seen in movies haha. Oh, I think my friend had a Tamagotchi for Christmas one year, it looked cute! Yeah, I'm guessing now that we're more further into later years, it seems that trends are either starting to go up, come down or making comebacks.
Q5: Whoops. I meant the shipping price is insane. A while back, I went crazy for zines which are fanmade collections of art and writings for popular media. Mine was for the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint fandom. Most of the time, the shipping was pricier than the book itself. Usually, I’d pay like $30 for the book and $40 in shipping. I was also looking into buying official merch from China from someone who can order them for you. Not only does it take nearly 8 months to arrive, the shipping ends up being around $40-50 USD. Basically, shipping to Canada is $$$$.
A: Ohhh, you meant that the shipping was expensive! I get it now XD.
Q6: I’ve never had the Mini Dream donut from Tim Hortons. I do like Tim Horton’s donuts though. I used to prefer timbits over actual donuts. Now that I’m older, I appreciate the classic donut.
A: Lol, nice. You do you :) I started to like cookies more so I don't know XD
Q7: I’m glad you’re safe! The wildfire smoke is really scary. Weirdly enough, it seems like the fires are worse this year but I haven’t seen any smoke here. Last year, the air quality was so bad.
A: Yeah, even the smell of wildfire smoke was seeping through even with the motorhome windows closed :/ Yeah, I think it had since the start of pandemic I think. I dunno.
Q8: I had to Google what a SkyTram was. It looks super exciting.
A: It was! But it was kind of a long wait for the way down though lol. And we saw some chipmunks too :D
Q9: Was the lightning a few days ago? It was raining super hard here with lightning too. No hail though.
A: Nope, it was on August 17, so it was on the same night I arrived in Edmonton. And according to some videos, it was noted as a severe thunderstorm.
Q10: I’ve read about the giant dinosaur – never seen it in person. I’ve also never seen a bison in person but I’d want to. They look pretty cool. I bet kinda stinky too. ALSO, read about how fantastic the Banff hot springs are.
A: Nice. Lol, we saw the bison from inside, but it was a meter close to the motorhome I think. I guess, yeah.
Q11: I’ve never been tubing before. In fact, I had to Google it because I thought tubing was only a thing you did on mountains. I didn’t realize there was water tubing too.
A: Lol, I guess you learned something new.
Q12: I think I read somewhere that the West Edmonton Mall is the biggest mall in Canada. Do you think it lives up to the hype?
A: IT TOTALLY WAS. There was SO much stores from Guess to Gucci to Louis Vuitton. (and they had fast food places and mostly clothing stores like Ardene)
Q13: I like nectarines. I like most fruits but I like how nectarines are firm and taste kinda like a peach. Other than that, I like bananas because of how they’re basically prepackaged for you.
A: Cool!
Bonus question 1: Cool fun fact! I’ll take a look : )
Bonus question 2: Word of the day: Copacetic – in excellent order.
A: Lol

Intro: Hi Jen! So I didn't get any messages about the original but it was also sitting unapproved for so long. I went ahead and rewrote it. Then that also required admin approval although I'm not sure what for? So I rewrote it for a second time and it's still not being sent. Honestly, I'm pretty confused. Let me just send maybe what I've been up to these past two weeks and you can let me know how your trip is going. Thank you so much for your patience : )
A: I'm not sure either, but it's probably just an upgrade to the platform, so that's maybe why. It's okay I guess, I get it lol.
Q1: I celebrated my friend’s birthday yesterday which was pretty fun. Sadly, the restaurant we went to was pretty mediocre so that was disappointing. But, I also got to try like a cooked banana? Lol. It was just a banana that had been grilled or something.
A: Oof, sounds kinda like a mid and weird resturant at the same time XD.
Q2: Another thing that’s exciting is that Ikea Canada finally has a brown bear plushie in stock. My friend and I saw it when we went to Japan. She loved it and had plans to purchase it when we got back BUT it was only available in Asia at that time.
A: Awh, cute!
Q3: Lastly, my friend has a little stall at this store for small business owners to market and sell their handmade products. It opened last weekend. Super exciting news for her and I'm really proud : ) My dream now is for her store to blow up in popularity so she can hire me ahahha
A: Nice, congratulations to her!
Q3: That’s true. Now that I’m older, whenever I make a hobby purchase, I can’t help but think about what else I might need the money for in the future like school or groceries or any other life purchases (like dentist fees and stuff like that).
A: I'd say split the money and make one pile with whatever you're willing to spend, and then create another pile for the important stuff. It may not be much, but I hope it helps a bit :)
Q4: Lastly, I finally got a new keyboard : ) I’ve been meaning to replace my old one for a while since I’d be using it for 8 years. At that point, the keycaps were popping off when I typed.
A: Nice! Is it one of those keyboards that lights up, or is it one of those retro colorful aesthetic ones?
Q5: I remember seeing the toys for A Fairy Secret, but I don’t think I watched it. I did watch the other fairy one called Fairytopia. I remember liking that one quite a bit along with Barbie of Swan Lake and the one with the Pegasus. I haven’t watched any of the new ones.
A: Lol. I used to have a lot of Barbie dolls (I still have figurines from me and my sisters' birthdays)
Q6: I remember seeing the toys for A Fairy Secret, but I don’t think I watched it. I did watch the other fairy one called Fairytopia. I remember liking that one quite a bit along with Barbie of Swan Lake and the one with the Pegasus. I haven’t watched any of the new ones.
A: Huh, maybe...
Q7: I got my grades back! I admit, it’s not amazing (60%) but that’s a pass ahah. Now I can live worry free until September. It’s uh probably a lesson for the future accounting courses too. I can’t be slacking off as much.
A: Congratulations.
Q8: Is there a reason you’d choose rainforest?
A: Probably because of how much nature has to offer and the views aren't too bad lol.
Q9: Yeah, I might try Etsy or I think I’ll stick with the official merch. They’re only available in China so I have to pay someone else to buy it and mail it over so it usually doubles the price ahah. But at least I know I’ll get something that’s better quality and made by the people who created the game. Plus, every time I check out Etsy, the shipping is INSANE.
A: Lol, you do you. What do you mean the shipping is insane? Do you mean that the shipping is too slow or too fast?
Q10: Hmm. I guess I like the plain ol’ donut with the chocolate dip top. I don’t remember the name. I don’t eat donuts all that often though. What about you?
A: I like donuts sometimes, but it'll have to be the ones in Tim Hortons like the Honey Dip and the Eclair lol. But my favourite cookie so far is the Reeses' mini Dream cookie from Tim Hortons :D
Also it seems like you wanted to know about my trip. But beware that it's gonna be a pretty loooooooong paragraph lol so please read at your own pace thanks!
So on the way when we were driving to Edmonton, there was a lot of wildfire smoke (and it was still there when we were driving back as well) and it had some dramatic effect but at the same time it was pretty scary if you ask me. But anyhow, we got to Jasper first and we walked around town and then went on the SkyTram and it was super cool :D Then when we got to Edmonton, we went to the waterpark and it was pretty cool! Then the next day, we went shopping in the West Edmonton Mall for most of the day (and for most of the trip, it was pretty much shopping, cause who doesn't like shopping? Lol) Then a few days later, after we ate dinner, me, my sisters and a few family friends were walking out of an Indian resturant and we saw what looked like a mini dust-storm just gathering dust. Then a couple seconds after, we saw lightning and we ran across the street as fast as we could back to the motorhome. And by the time we got inside the motorhome, it was hailing so much that we thought the motorhome was gonna fall apart. But luckily, it wasn't too bad the next day lol. Then we saw some bison when we were driving around. Then from there, we drove to Sylvan Lake and went tubing (it was so much fun! have you been tubing before?) Then the next day, we drove to Drumheller and we went inside the ""World's Largest Dinosaur"" which was a tourist attraction, and then we went to the Royal Tyrell Museum! Then we went to the Drumheller DooHoos trails and we walked up them, it was super epic! Then we drove to Calgary and we droved around and did some more shopping haha. We also did an escape room which was a wild experience! We also went to Canmore. On the drive back, we stopped by Banff and we went to the hot springs (which wasn't too bad!) We stayed for the last few days then we drove back home. (We came back by the night of the 28th). Overall, it was a pretty fun experience and would definitely go again if I do get the chance :D

That’s true. Now that I’m older, whenever I make a hobby purchase, I can’t help but think about what else I might need the money for in the future like school or groceries or any other life purchases (like dentist fees and stuff like that).
Lastly, I finally got a new keyboard : ) I’ve been meaning to replace my old one for a while since I’d be using it for 8 years. At that point, the keycaps were popping off when I typed.
I remember seeing the toys for A Fairy Secret, but I don’t think I watched it. I did watch the other fairy one called Fairytopia. I remember liking that one quite a bit along with Barbie of Swan Lake and the one with the Pegasus. I haven’t watched any of the new ones.
I’m not sure if they actually do. I think people around me just assumed Alberta in general has lower rent since some places in BC are sooo expensive. 
I got my grades back! I admit, it’s not amazing (60%) but that’s a pass ahah. Now I can live worry free until September. It’s uh probably a lesson for the future accounting courses too. I can’t be slacking off as much.
Is there a reason you’d choose rainforest?
Yeah, I might try Etsy or I think I’ll stick with the official merch. They’re only available in China so I have to pay someone else to buy it and mail it over so it usually doubles the price ahah. But at least I know I’ll get something that’s better quality and made by the people who created the game. Plus, every time I check out etsy, the shipping is INSANE.
Hmm. I guess I like the plain ol’ donut with the chocolate dip top. I don’t remember the name. I don’t eat donuts all that often though. What about you?
Thank you so much for your patience ahah. I didn’t get any messages about the original, but it was also left unapproved for so long. I just went ahead and rewrote some portions.",Mentor

Hi Lisa, I got home around 10 PM, so no problem. I'm gonna try and get some sleep tonight because tomorrow my family and I are going to pitch in and help our family-friends clean their motorhome. Thanks and goodnight :)

Intro: Hi Jen! I am having an excellent summer without any (almost any) school-related worries :) I’ve been reading and playing games my days away. How’s your trip so far?
A: Hey Lisa! It's going good so far! Good to hear you've been having a good summer as well! :D
Q1: I remember that ahah. I was working at TD when that happened, and their system is based on Roger’s service so nothing worked. I got a ton of calls from people complaining and I completely agree with their concerns; however, some customers started making demands like “you owe us money for this” and “can’t you just call up another company and switch it over”. I don’t work there anymore, but I wonder if they created a backup plan for something like that especially since (at least from what I’ve seen), nobody uses cash anymore. If bank services went down, a lot of people are in trouble.
A: Yeah, I guess it's times like these where things get chaotic and out of hand to the point where situations get spiked for the worst.
Q2: Yeah, the money issue is why I stopped collecting some things. Now I have the mentality of “if it brings me joy and I can comfortably afford it then I think it’s a decent purchase”. Everything in moderation!
A: Yeah and also good to save up for important things or leisure-based stuff you want to do in the future since I guess it's quite expensive nowadays lol.
Q3: I loved Barbie movies when I was younger. Which one was your favourite? I think I liked Princess and the Pauper the best but that’s the one everyone likes.
A: I think it was Barbie: A Fairy Secret, Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale and basically all the classics I watched haha. Barbie: Starlight Adventure was okay I guess, I didn't like it (it was meh) much including the new animated Barbie movies (including Spy Squad)
Q4: I do know what you’re referring to. I think I’ve seen two different views on it – one that only reviews the game and one that looks at the controversy surrounding the game. The controversy, of course, is terrible. The game itself is pretty good.
A: I guess so.
Q5: Fun! My friend just came back from Mexico. I’ve heard nothing but praises from him. How far out do you usually plan your vacations? When I went to Japan, I think we got everything purchased about 4-5 months before we left. That’s on me tho. I had to get a new passport. At the time, due covid and all, the wait time was intense.
A: I feel you on the wait time. Nice! I don't know, I don't think I'll be travelling much after the summer but my family and I might plan to go to Mexico next year haha :p
Q6: Anything outstanding in Calgary? I haven’t been but a lot of people at my Uni came from Calgary. Lotta people talk about moving there for lower rent too.
A: I guess it's good. I don't think I've heard about Calgary having lower rent? Might just be me then lol. I'll check it out I think!
Q7: I got one of my grades back. Sadly, it was for the course that I wasn’t worried about. I’m still dreading to see my grade for my intermediate accounting course since the final was worth 65%.
A: Oh -- well you tried your best! I'm rooting for ya! 🥳
Q8: Hmmm. I think mountains? Are we talking like BC mountains? And rainforests like The Amazon? I think I’d quickly die a horrid death in The Amazons and there’s going to be a ton of insects which uh would scare me to death before the animals even get to me lol. Plus, I think it would be incredibly humid hot which I already experienced in Hong Kong. Maybe it would be good if you’re good with plants but I know nothing about them. What would you choose?
A: Probably rainforest lol.
Q9: On other news, I got my mail from Aliexpress yesterday. I. got. Scammed. Omg. I got two keychain knockoffs from a game I liked but they came completely different from the listing. Luckily, I got my money back but I was so sad. The image was different and blurry, it was scratched, the shape was different, etc. No wonder the listing quickly was deleted after I ordered it and they took forever to ship it out. I’m guessing they did actually have the product but ran out. So, they got someone to make a really bad imitation of it :((
A: Awh that sucks. I'm sorry to hear about the keychains :( You can try Etsy if it helps?
Bonus: Word of the day – querent – The person asking a question
A: Lol

Intro: Hope you’re having a blast on your vacation! Don’t worry about replying on time :)) I remember when I went to Japan, I basically ghosted everyone for three weeks ahah. Let me know all the fun details when you feel like it. 
 
A: Hi Lisa, hope you're having a good summer :) Thanks, so far I am! Haha lol, I will!
Q1: Are car scams common? I rented a car to go to Seattle but there was no issue. The only downside I can think of is at my old job, I’d get a lot of calls from people stranded on vacation because their cards don’t work. It was almost never an issue on the bank’s end, but the car rental companies could never process the transaction even if the customer paid the car deposit. I guess that might be a scam?
A: Oh, that. Yes, they might be common in North America but I doubt it's common in other continents. I could be wrong though. As for the tail-light on banks, one example could've be from ""Roger's Big Outage"" last summer in 2022 where Roger customers had data troubles and the credit/debit machines didn't work.
Q2: I do prefer physical books over ebooks though. When you have an ebook, it doesn’t feel like you own the book. However, I gotta admit, the convenience of having a book on your phone easily beats having to carry one around. There’s also the issue of running out of space for physical books. I donated around 25 a few months ago, but I ended up just getting more. Do you have anything that you like to collect? I try not to hoard but I really like collecting stuff - coins with special designs, my books, tea, wax stamps, etc. I used to collect candles and postcards too. I stopped cause, despite my hoarding tendencies, I also hate clutter. It’s a dilemma.
A: Oof, I guess that's the thing with ""You give, then receive."" I dunno though. Ummm good question. I don't really remember, but I think I used to do collecting, but then I stopped because I ended up wasting money.
Q3: Oh right lol. That gives you a chance to find a new “go-to” restaurant. I don’t think I’ve ever had clam chowder. I’ve always wanted to try it cause I keep hearing people mention it.
A: I guess it does. And yeah, clam chowder is pretty good.
Q4: I haven’t watched Nemo. It’s something that always shocks people. I’ve also never watched any of the classic Disney movies like Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White. Most of what I watched were foreign animated videos. For example, I did watch a version of Cinderella and The Little Mermaid but it was made by (I think) a Russian company in the 70s. The ending of The Little Mermaid was closer to the original too where she dies in the end. Some other stories I really enjoyed were King Thrushbeard and Thumbelina. 
A: Its a pretty good movie and it's kinda sad too (it's proably because of the music lol.) XD, I watched some ripoffs as well as a kid but I don't remember unfortunately. But mostly I had Barbie movies haha
Q5: Do you know what Hogwarts house you’re in? I’m not a diehard fan of Harry Potter but I like the thought of a universe with magic. Do you know about Hogwarts Legacy? I prepurchased the game cause I was so excited to play it. Honestly, as a rpg game, it’s not the best; however, the experience of exploring the Harry Potter universe was unlike anything else I’ve played.
A: I do not know unfortunately, sorry. I have heard interesting things about the game, but not really positive ones I don't think due to the controversy but I'm not going to say due to safety reasons. I've only seen a few positive outlights but otherwise it's all just some confusion :/
Q6: Ahah quality meme. I’ve seen it too and it’s one of my favorites especially since in the majority of the Zelda games (the recent ones), he’s a silent protagonist. He doesn’t talk at all. I’m pretty sure some npcs even commented on how he just stands there and stares in the Nintendo switch game.
A: Yeah I guess so lol.
Q7: Are you someone who hates spoilers? Personally, I don’t mind them since spoilers usually make me more excited. There’s only a select number of stories that I try to avoid hearing spoilers for.
A: It depends. If it's going to be a good movie, then yes. If it's not going to be a good movie, then no, not really. I won't really mind as I probably wont watch it anyways or if I watch it with my family or friends, we just comment on it and laugh hysterically.
Q8: Yeah, I used to love the PNE. I think I’ve gone maybe 6 or 7 times? I hear they’re expanding soon. I’ll probably go check it out once that happens. It’s been long overdue. I’ve gone so many times, but the rides were essentially the same all these years. The only difference is that, as the years go by, the lines get longer and longer. Maybe having more rides reduces the wait times.
A: Nice, I don't know if I'm going back there anytime soon, we were thinking to go to Mexico next year :) And yeah, no wait, no waste.
Q9: THEY DOOOO. DON’T APOLOGIZE FOR BEING EXCITED. Being there in person was SUPER exciting. It felt like I was transported somewhere else. Heading into Nintendo world, my friends and I audibly gasped. I added a photo, but I can promise you that it looked way more impressive in person. There was also a parade with people dressed up as different characters. It was so fun. 
Update: Whoops sorry I wasn't able to share the photo since uh the site thought I was sharing personal information ahah but if you google universal studios Nintendo land, you can see what I mean!
A: LOL NICEEEE and it's fine, I'll search it up when I get to Calgary lol. I'm staying in Calgary for a few days haha.
Q10: Bonus: Word of the day – morphogenesis – origin or development of a body part or organ
A: Interesting word I guess lol
Q11: I’ve been craving green tea ice cream for months. I also like cookie dough in the ice cream or chunky chocolate bits. I don’t usually eat it though. I’m pretty lactose intolerant, so I try to avoid stuff with a high milk content. I also hate the taste of cheap icecream but the expensive stuff is … well you know… expensive lol
A: Lol, I like the expression ice cream for some odd reason, I guess it's just craving XD
Q12: In other news, I got one final done and my last one is coming up. If you do reply soon, I might not be able to respond until Sunday or so. My final is so fricken late; it doesn’t end until 10 pm. I end up getting home so late. 
Take care and stay safe : D
A: Thanks, you too! Good luck on your finals 🥳✨✨

Intro: Happy Weekend : )
Hump days just means Wednesday. It’s a little bit of an old term so not many people still use it haha. If you think of a camel’s hump, it’s like in the middle ish so Wednesday is Hump day for being in the middle of the week.
A: Oh I see. I don't know much about old sayings back in the day lol.
Q1: That sounds fun! You can spend several days relaxing with friends throughout the journey. Kinda like a road trip. I’ve never been on a road trip but some of my friends have. Hopefully it doesn’t happen to you but one of my friends went on a road trip earlier this year. The car they rented kept acting up and they almost got in two accidents.
A: Oh, I'm sorry to hear about their rent car running into issues. Sometimes I feel like the company scam people from time to time but I don't know honestly. 
Q2: Yeah, it feels like everything is gradually increasing. I mean, I guess minimum wage has increased too but not as much as it should have. I remember working for like $10 an hour which sounds insane to me now cause $10 is basically nothing. Every time I think of inflation, I think of book prices. Paperbacks used to be $10-15. Now they’re around $25. Hardcovers used to be around $20. $25 if it was a fancy book. Now they’re around $40. Feels like I’m breaking the bank just to buy a single book.
A: I guess yeah. Doesn't make much sense to buy books physically anymore. 
Q3: What kind of cuisine does the hotel serve? If you really like it, I’d say it being your birthday is a good excuse to go back despite the prices. If you don’t really care for it, you can always fine a new place. After all, I think the location isn’t as important as making sure you can have a good time with friends.
A: They serve stuff from clam chowder to burgers to butter chicken :D It's unknown if I'll be living in my current hometown next year because plans keep going back and forth so I think we might move next summer lol.
Q4: Oh wow. I don’t think I’ve ever heard Euphoria by BTS before. Whistle is really old too. Is “Wow” an instrumental? That’s the only one I found. Speaking of instrumentals, I usually listen to the OST for this Otome game I play called Tears of Themis. Their entire soundtrack is a banger but my favs have to be “Summers Past” and “Marvelous Moments”. The game genre is romance and I feel like those two songs successfully convey the romance vibe. Another “song” I’ve been obsessed with is the song in the Star Rail Kafka trailer. Not only is her intro so cool but the background song is this EDM classical (Vivaldi) mix that sounds super cool.
A: Nice, cool lol. And yes, ""Wow"" is an instrumental soundtrack from ""Finding Nemo"" (dunno if you've watched it or not, but it's pretty much a classic in my book haha.)
Q5: Bonus: Word of the day – Apricity – the warmth of the sun in the winter : )
A: Huh, weird, usually it's pretty cold and snowy in the winter XD. (and just by looking at the word itself, it sounds like apricot and city lol)
Q6: I’m assuming you mean Draco Malfoy. Are you a fan of him?
A: Yes, him. He's okay I guess. But however, I'm not really interested in the Harry Potter multiverse most of the time anymore (but my friend is a fan of Draco!) but the movies are okay (I'll give 'em a good pass.)
Q7: Maybe it’s because I’m old and not up to date with social media and such, but I remember when everyone idolized the guy? Then he did some stuff and now everyone hates him, I think? I always found it weird how people strongly idolize strangers to a fault. I understand being a fan of a person, but some people go really far to the point of almost being a stalker. I think some people forget that these celebrities, even if you religiously follow them online, have no idea who you are. This problem is way more prevalent in Asia with crazy fans. I suppose that’s why agencies forbid their artists from dating because some fans feel like they own the artist. Personally, I think that’s a bit much. We don’t own anyone ahha. Instead, shouldn’t we be happy that someone we look up to found happiness maybe in the form of a partner?
A: Oh.. I'm sorry but I don't really have any comments. (Don't really know what to say for this.)
Q8: Are the people in Zelda considered elves? I never thought about that before.
A: It depends on who. Maybe not every one of the characters. (I'm not really an expert when it comes to Zelda and other characters mind you lol, but apparently what I looked up, Link has an appearance as an elf and the line in the animated TV show I hear him say is ""Well, excuuuuse me, Princess."" The line is pretty hilarious.) I have heard of Stardew Valley, but never played it however XD.
Q9: Yes! Have you watched Willy Wonka? I’ve seen the original and the remake with Johnny Depp. Such a fun movie.
A: I've seen the original, but I have yet to see the remake. (so please don't give me spoilers thank you!)
Q10: I love amusement parks, but not the haunted houses and I don’t usually like rides that mess around with g-force. I didn’t mind it when I was younger, but I went on the hellevator at Playland last year (have you been?) and my crusty, old body felt the force very strongly compared to my youth. I also do not like the wait time. At Playland, the wait for each ride were 1-1.5 hours.
A: Oh yeah. And nope, I don't think so, but I have been to PNE Playland either in 2013 or 2019 (not sure, I probably forgot, did you go to PNE?)
Q11: I checked out Universal Studios in Japan. It was fantastic – loved every second I was there. I didn’t check out Disneyland or Disney SEA cause I’m not a big Disney fan, but I was satisfied with Universal. Sadly, we only hit around half the rides cause of how busy it was. We even went on what was considered not as busy day. Like the mario kart ride wait time was 2 hours but it’s usually 4 hours. I think next time, I’m going to buy the fast pass.
A: THEY HAVE ONE IN JAPAN??? I didn't know that lol. Oh that sucks. I guess it's pretty popular nowadays XD. YES PLEASE BUY A PASTPASS IT WILL SAVE YOU SO MUCH TIME :D (sorry about that lol)
Q12: Hmm. I don’t think I have a FAV brand. I suppose I do like Toblerone. I like a brand called Milka too. It’s from Switzerland. It’s a little hard to find places that have it. Otherwise, I tend to enjoy chocolate with rice bits inside or chocolate with nuts and fruit. I used to love Hershey’s chocolate, but now I find it too sweet. Kit kats are delicious. I love Ferrero Rocher. Lindt is good too but expensive. To conclude, I enjoy a lot of brands ahaha
A: Lol, you do you! :)

If you don’t really care for it, you can always fine a new place. After all, I think the location isn’t as important as making sure you can have a good time with friends. 
Oh wow. I don’t think I’ve ever heard Euphoria by BTS before. Whistle is really old too. Is “Wow” an instrumental? That’s the only one I found. Speaking of instrumentals, I usually listen to the OST for this Otome game I play called Tears of Themis. Their entire soundtrack is a banger but my favs have to be “Summers Past” and “Marvelous Moments”. The game genre is romance and I feel like those two songs successfully convey the romance vibe. Another “song” I’ve been obsessed with is the song in the Star Rail Kafka trailer. Not only is her intro so cool but the background song is this EDM classical (Vivaldi) mix that sounds super cool.
Bonus: Word of the day – Apricity – the warmth of the sun in the winter : )
I’m assuming you mean Draco Malfoy. Are you a fan of him?
Thanks! I bought purple shampoo. I’ve used it every now and then. Honestly, I don’t really care of my hair looks bronze-ish, so I don’t use it often. Maybe once a month when I remember it exists. 
Maybe it’s because I’m old and not up to date with social media and such, but I remember when everyone idolized the guy? Then he did some stuff and now everyone hates him, I think? I always found it weird how people strongly idolize strangers to a fault. I understand being a fan of a person, but some people go really far to the point of almost being a stalker. I think some people forget that these celebrities, even if you religiously follow them online, have no idea who you are. This problem is way more prevalent in Asia with crazy fans. I suppose that’s why agencies forbid their artists from dating because some fans feel like they own the artist. Personally, I think that’s a bit much. We don’t own anyone ahha. Instead, shouldn’t we be happy that someone we look up to found happiness maybe in the form of a partner?
Are the people in Zelda considered elves? I never thought about that before.
Yes! Have you watched Willy Wonka? I’ve seen the original and the remake with Johnny Depp. Such a fun movie. 
I love amusement parks, but not the haunted houses and I don’t usually like rides that mess around with g-force. I didn’t mind it when I was younger, but I went on the hellevator at Playland last year (have you been?) and my crusty, old body felt the force very strongly compared to my youth. I also do not like the wait time. At Playland, the wait for each ride were 1-1.5 hours. 
I checked out Universal Studios in Japan. It was fantastic – loved every second I was there. I didn’t check out Disneyland or Disney sea cause I’m not a big Disney fan, but I was satisfied with Universal. Sadly, we only hit around half the rides cause of how busy it was. We even went on what was considered not as busy day. Like the mario kart ride wait time was 2 hours but it’s usually 4 hours. I think next time, I’m going to buy the fast pass. 
Hmm. I don’t think I have a FAV brand. I suppose I do like Toblerone. I like a brand called Milka too. It’s from Switzerland. It’s a little hard to find places that have it. Otherwise, I tend to enjoy chocolate with rice bits inside or chocolate with nuts and fruit. I used to love Hershey’s chocolate, but now I find it too sweet. Kit kats are delicious. I love Ferrero Rocher. Lindt is good too but expensive. To conclude, I enjoy a lot of brands ahaha",Mentor

Intro: Happy Hump dayyyyyyyyyyyyy.
A: Hey and apologies, but what is that? And Happy [slightly] belated August :D
Q1: The food prices in Japan were crazy. I spent maybe $30-40 CAD per day on food there – that’s breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Here, I can easily spend $100 on one meal at Cactus Club. Not saying I should or usually do spend $100 on one meal, but it has happened before. Plus, they don’t tip in Japan so eating at a restaurant didn’t break my wallet. I think my most expensive meal there was at a Butler café with a $40 ish pasta. However, that did include the experience of being in a themed restaurant. It was definitely an interesting experience, but I don’t think I would go again.
A: That's pretty insane I think. Or is it the $100? 🤔 Either way, I guess that sounds pretty expensive lol. Oh, sounds interesting! Never been there myself XD.
Q2: Are you driving or taking a flight to Edmonton?
A: Since we are going with family-friends (and they're the ones hosting the holiday), we are going in their motorhome :D Even if it'll take days to get there, it's worth it, I think!
Q3: Thank you for the birthday wishes! It’s mid-September but I usually do a dinner a week or two before the actual date. When I go eat out with friends, it can be a little hard to find a restaurant since we’re a bigger group. We usually need to book a table beforehand. Do you do anything special for your birthday?
A: Nice! No problem :D Oh, the reservations are definitely difficult, I can tell you that lol. Me and my friends usually eat at a resturant too haha. There's a hotel that has a resturant so we eat there but not so much anymore since it's getting a bit expensive and already being there one too many times but I may or may not go there again later this year XD.
Q4: I haven’t watched ""The Greatest Showman"", but I have heard about it. I think DPR Ian isn’t as well known compared to some Korean musicians like BTS. Maybe you’ve heard of BTS? Blackpink is another popular group. I loved “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic. Haven’t heard “If I Lose Myself"" yet. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll give it a listen. One song I found recently and really enjoyed (thanks to Spotify) is TWIN XL – Lemonade.
A: Then I won't spoil it for you lol. Yes, I have heard of BTS and Blackpink but I only listen to them once in a while. But the recent music I've listened to by BTS was called ""Euphoria"" (not the show lol), and as for Blackpink, it would have to be ""Whistle"". Ah yes, ""Counting Stars"". Nostalgia at its finest <3 Oh cool! Never heard that before. The song (also courtesy of Spotify) there was one I've been listening to. It's called ""Wow"" by Thomas Newman (it's in the movie ""Finding Nemo"") and it's pretty good :D
Q5: Bonus: Word of the day – Draconian -> excessively harsh and severe (though it sounds like it means being related to a dragon lol)
A: Haha, it does! It also sounds like Draco (if you know who I'm talking about!)
Q6: My hair is bleached right now. That’s similar to blonde hair. I haven’t dyed it or bleached it to become blonde though. I think I’d look terrible ahaha. Usually, I get a balayage because I’m worried about my roots growing out and looking awful. I really want to entirely dye my hair a fun colour. Sadly, I also am not willing to go to the salon every few weeks for the upkeep.
A: Oh? I bet it looks nice! My friend got a balayage for Prom haha. Have you ever used purple shampoo at all? I don't necessarily know 100% if it works as I am no professional hair stylist (unless I do some research, haha.)
Q7: That’s cool! Did you get a chance to use the microphone yet?
A: Yep, me and my family had a karaoke (sort of) night at home XD.
Q8: I have 200 hours in the Sims 3 lol. It’s one of my most played games. In theory, just watching fake humans live their lives shouldn’t be that interesting. In reality, I can’t believe I played 200 hours of the Sims mostly watching my character write books on their computer.
A: Oh, impressive! I guess it's not that interesting imo, lol.
Q9: Thanks! One of my good friends from Sweden has ASD as well. I remember bombarding him with questions when we first met haha. I don’t have any questions right now, but I’ll let you know if any come up.
A: Oof lol. No problem :P
Q10: Unrelated but did you see the new logo for Twitter? It’s not bad enough to make a huge fuss over, but I like the old logo better. The X, in my opinion, makes it seem generic. The bird was such an icon and people immediately knew that it was related to Twitter. X, on the other hand, could be anything.
A: Yeah I did, didn't like it much lol. I believe that Elon Musk made the switch. It was, wasn't it? You're right, people knew right off the bat that it was Twitter. Not sure why the change was necessary :/ But unfortunately, not much we can do about it right now unless Musk steps down from the job or if he posts a new poll asking if he should continue to be CEO or whatever position he's currently in.
Q11: I finally got a chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3. Other than some lagging, I was wowed by the number of choices that the game lets you pursue. I spent 2 hours creating my character because I was wowed by all the different options. You’re speaking to a half-elf bard who used to be part of an artisan guild. I ended up playing 15 hours for my first session, so I passed out as soon as I finished. Now my sleep schedule went from messed up to super messed up. 100% worth it.
A: Ohhh, okay. Never heard of this game. It's somewhat reminding me of Zelda, with the elves and all lol.
Q12: I think my fav would be the animated spiderman movie. Though, I don’t have a lot of movies to choose from since I rarely go to the theater. I can probably count the number of times I went with my fingers. I saw that they were making a new Willy Wonka movie. Not sure if I’ll see it in theatres. It did look somewhat interesting.
A: Nice 😎 Oh yeah, it's the one with Timothée Chalamet and I believe it's coming on December 15 (15 days before Christmas!)
Quote of the day: -""Sometimes you might get a happy ending, sometimes you won't. It's all up to you on how it should be.""
Qs-OTD: Do you like amusement parks? If so, what's your favourite part of it? What's your favourite brand of chocolate?

Is there anything you believe had a huge impact on who you became? Other than K-pop, I think reading really shaped me into who I am today. Sometimes I like zoning out and it may look like I’m staring at a wall, but I’m recounting a really good story in my head.

Intro: Happy weekend!
A: Thanks, same to you!
Q1: Aha that’s a weird meme tbh. I feel like they’re such different movies with different audiences.
A: I guess you can say that lol.
Q2: Ahhh if you ever get the chance, I hope you take the opportunity to try it! I usually don’t like to eat spicy food unless it’s Korean spice. I think their spice is sweet spicy which I like.  Hope you had a good time in Vancouver nonetheless! When I went to Seattle, I basically did the same things I’d do in Vancouver. We got bubble tea, walked around, didn’t pay for the touristy places, got a bunch of food, and left. The part I remember the most vividly is that we drove 30 min from the Space needle to go to a revolving sushi restaurant that also had locations in Japan. It was so disappointing. After conversion and tip, each plate (with two nigiri that were half the size compared to Japan), ended up being around $6 per plate when it was $1.50 in Japan :(((((((
A: Haha, thanks! That's nice! (at least I'll know what I'm expected to see + do) I guess Seattle is Vancouver but in the States lol. For real? 6 bucks in Seattle while it's a buck and fifty cents in Japan?! That's crazy. I actually thought it'd be the other way around :0
Q3: I went to the Parliament building too. I completely forgot about that. I went with my elementary school class so we got a tour. I suppose that would be similar to a castle. I think I remember being wow-ed by the inside. I saw a few coat of arms from different families and I was like wow I wish my family had something cool like that ahaha. I think it was 2011 when I went. I don’t remember much except the tour, there were horse carriages, and there were a lot of flowers. There was also a guy dressed like (I think) Abraham Lincoln standing outside. I talked to him, and he told me that I should go back to school since I had no idea who he was lol. In my defense, I was 10/11. I don’t think most kids knew who he was.
Speaking of the coat of arms, do you have any family heirlooms? Or maybe anything cool or fun that was passed down from your ancestors? It doesn’t have to be something physical. I know some families have traditions. I saw a video of this one family who would flip their cake in the air.
A: Haha, that's cool! I mean, I don't blame you. I didn't know who he was until maybe high school? I dunno. Hilarious story though. Thanks for sharing! And on that part, not 100% sure. I think whatever we had either went missing or something might've happened. But I'll try my best to update you if I find out.
Q5: Two weeks will come sooner than later. In two weeks, I’ll be done my finals and we’ll both be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. It’s still early but I’m somewhat planning my birthday dinner so everyone can make it.
A: Oof, or should we say one week? Lol. I leave for Edmonton next week haha! Even though it's a tackle, I hope you have fun planning your birthday dinner! I'm sure it'll be a blast :D And happy early birthday too! (whenever that may be!)
Q6: Guitar is cool. Did you play acoustic or electric? A lot of people that I talked to said their biggest regret choosing a large instrument was the fact that they had to carry it to school multiple times a week. It might be because I went to a small elementary school so there was no music room, but we weren’t allowed to keep any of our instruments there. Our music classes were held in the library.
A: Acoustic lol. Electric would've been cool but probably would've been too much money and electricity bills on their hands with equipments and all XD.
Q7: I don’t think I’ve ever watched the music video for “Rewrite the stars” but I have heard it somewhere before. I like it. I had no idea Anne-Marie sang it because I used to listen to her other songs. DPR Ian released a new song a few days ago, so I’ve been listening to his other songs. One I recommend is “Ballroom Extravaganza”.
A: Nice, I don't think I've heard of him before so this will be a new experience XD. Yeah lol. If you've watched ""The Greatest Showman"", it's Zac Efron and Zendaya who sing it in the movie haha. One song I listened to recently was ""If I Lose Myself"" by OneRepublic. (from my POV: I guess it's looking back on memories and realizing that sense of belonging somewhere, whether you're with friends or family.)
Q8: Bonus: Word of the day – Lollygagging-> Spending time aimlessly or simply fooling around
A: I've heard this word before lol! Sounds funny when you think about it though XD.
Q9: Ooo I suggest pink. I wanted pink after I dyed my hair red.
A: Lol okay :D Have you dyed your hair blonde before?
Q10: I think I’ve seen it before? Does the microphone have a big square section right under the mic – maybe with some buttons?
A: Yes, actually -- you're close! instead of pressing them though, you can slide the knobs down to adjust the sound, reverb, etc.
Q11: Cities Skylines is a management game where you can create a city from scratch. You can create roads, bus lines, city zones (like a residential zone, commercial, office, etc), water and waste disposal pipes, tourist attractions, etc. There are several DLCS that add to the base game like one adds natural disasters and such. I bet it sounds so boring if you’re not into this sort of game, but I love zooming into the sidewalk and stalking my little residents. If you click on a person, you can see where they live, where they work, and where they’re heading towards. It’s a little similar to The Sims if you’ve heard of that game.
One thing I learned from Cities Skylines is that it’s a good thing I did not go into urban planning because I can never figure out the roads. There are always traffic jams, or some roads never get used. I try to add bus lines but those also get too congested. I try to add a roundabout thinking it might help (idk why) and I don’t think it does.
A: Oh nice I think? XD. Yes, I've heard of the Sims! My friend plays it a lot, lol.
Q12: I hope I don’t seem like a crazy fan. I did realize I mentioned Korean culture multiple times. Since I was young, I was really into East Asian culture. I listened to K-pop (before It blew up in popularity), watched Korean dramas, and watched a ton of anime. I’m not salty about it but people used to tease me for listening to K-pop. Can you imagine? My best friend is crazy about it now, but 10 years ago, she thought it was dumb.
Basically, I grew up being influenced by a lot of Korean culture. Over the years, its popularity kept getting bigger and bigger. Since I’m living in a big city, I encounter a lot of pop culture. There are a ton of Korean restaurants and Korean stores near me. My friends are all into Korean culture now, so it’s a common interest.
A: No, no! It's totally fine, I was curious, that's all. You do you :) I don't watch a lot of K-dramas, but the one I watched on Netflix was pretty good. I have ASD, so I'm pretty curious about people I meet once I get to know them, haha. (so just keep that in mind!) If you want to ask me about it, fire away! (just please keep it appropriate so no trouble swings by!)

That’s really good advice. Maybe it’s because I’m in a big city, but there’s always this “go go go go” mentality that I tend to see. I try to be more chill about it, but it can definitely make you feel like you’re kinda falling behind. I try hard not to be a control freak, but I do like planning things. My way to get around that is to make “loose plans” while being open minded. I like tackling obstacles as they occur without thinking too hard about what COULD happen.

Hey! How has your week been? I finally finished my last midterm a few hours ago. I'm FREEEE until my finals ...
A: Hi! It was okay, nothing special for about a week or so lol. Congratulations! :D
Q1: Yeah, Oppenheimer. I didn’t watch it, but I saw a lot of people talking about it.
A: Lol, I would get why. To catch you up to speed: There were memes going around of Barbie and Oppenheimer releasing on the same day and people choosing whether they wanted to go see Barbie or go watch Oppenheimer. Hope this helped a bit lol.
Q2: We go to Downtown Vancouver pretty often since we’re around the area! I only go for the Korean food, otherwise I feel like it’s kinda bland? Maybe I’m too used to it. I thought my dislike of it might be because of the crowd since I’m also not a fan of Seattle, but I loved Tokyo. Your mentor might be right and I only liked Tokyo cause it was a novelty to me ahah. I think Seattle and Vancouver are really similar.
A: Oh lol! I've never tried actual Korean food XD. I mean, I think you can get used to too many things to the point where you don't get that 'flavour taste' anymore. Especially with me, I eat a lot of spicy food to the point where I don't think it's really all that spicy haha. Funny enough, me and my family were supposed to go to Seattle a couple years back but we unfortunately couldn't go due to personal reasons. But I was at Vancouver around the same time, so that was good enough anyways lol.
Q3: I really like the architecture of Japan. In Tokyo, they build up and there’s malls and skyscrapers everywhere. The area around Vancouver is so flat. Japan had so much personality too because not every store was part of a chain.  It made window shopping a unique experience since you never know what each store would offer.
A: That's pretty neat!!! I have never went but it's becoming popular! 👏🏽
Q4: Oh, that’s super cool! I wouldn’t mind checking out Germany. I think I’m open to exploring most places in Europe except for Paris because of all the uhh unfortunate travel experiences I’ve heard about. When I was in high school, I was close friends with a German exchange student. She said that she lived near a castle. I really want to explore the inside of a European castle.
A: Lol. I didn't explore a castle myself I think (my memory is pretty blank at this point), but the closest we've been was either Buckingham Palace in London (I am not 100% sure if I went or not, I'll probably have to double check and I'll update you!) or the Parlament in Victoria around 2013 (it was okay I guess lol).
Q5: Luckyy. I wish my brain was on vacation mode. I haven’t had like a responsibility free summer since I graduated from high school, since I took summer school every summer. It lightened my academic burdens during the school year, but wow I really want a few months to just sit around and pretend to be a mushroom.
A: Haha, it may be now, but in 2 weeks, ima be travellin' with family and family-friends doing silly things lol. OOF. I feel ya on the mushroom thing XD
Q6: Maybe. I’ve always been really bad at languages. I think my reading and writing is alright, but I always suffer when it comes to listening and speaking. In high school, I was so bad at the speaking and listening portion of French class that it caused my grade to drop by 10%. It sounds like you’re pretty gifted when it comes to learning languages.
A: Ah well, I guess it takes practice and motivation to get a sense of them lol. Just don't put too much pressure on yourself to do it all. Once you feel unmotivated to do something, you might not feel a spark to do it anymore. So that's why I wanted to do stuff at my own pace and my own time. It's just food for thought. And thanks :)
Q7: If you were winded by the flute, I’m surprised you always did the trumpet! I’d imagine that requires more air. Was the flute popular in your class? I was one of the only three flute players ahah. Half the class chose the clarinet then the rest were a combination of other brass instruments.
A: It did, lol. I only did trumpet for one year before middle school. Also I have taken a Guitar class XD (and also because the case was pretty heavy to carry around) I don't blame them with that! I think I should've done drums instead haha!
Q8: Ooo I’ve never heard of that song by K/DA. I do like it! Thank you for the recommendation. I really like their other song – “Villain”. Some English songs I’ve been playing on repeat are PALAYE ROYALE – Lonely, X Lovers - Dreams Where Ur Murdered, and eaJ - Car Crash. I’m going to be honest; I think some of them have some depressing lyrics, but I never pay attention to what’s being said. I like the vibes of the songs.
A: Oh lol, I've listened to most of their songs and they're pretty good if I'm being honest here! Gosh, I don't think I've heard these songs before. ""Rewrite the Stars"" is good as well! The message behind it mostly is that one person shows love to the other while the other one doesn't accept them. But deep down, they do but they don't want to reveal that because of the difficulties they might face. (That's what I think it is, but feel free to visualize a meaning of your own!) 
Q9: Bonus: Word of the day – Fudgel -> Pretending to work when you're really just goofing off.
A: Haha, most relatable word I've ever heard!
Q10: What colour are you thinking of dying it? I’ve done blue, purple, and grey/silver, so I’m thinking of doing red next. It’s just so darn expensive so I usually get it done once a year. My hair feels like straw now. 
A: I was thinking blonde or a light shade of pink, not sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q11: I don’t think I could ever sing in public. That’s so nerve wracking. That’s a cool gift. Is it one of those big microphones that you see in concerts or one of those mini ones. I could never whistle tunes – tbh I don’t think I ever tried? Definitely can’t do it now. Are you able to do it?
A: It kinda is, to be honest. Ummm, it's a Bluetooth microphone from Amazon and it's rose gold XD. Haha lol, all good. I can't either, but I can do it [somewhat] inwards if that counts XD.
Q12: Hmmm. I’m not sure if I have a talent. I guess I like (and I think I’m good at) planning stuff. Idk if that’s a talent though. I usually plan the get togethers for my group of friends. I like managing stuff haha. That’s why I have an excel sheet for my clothes and I play management games like cities skylines. What’s your talent?
A: Lol. What's 'Cities Skylines?' (unless you're talking about skyline schedules XD.)
Q13: I don’t think I have a fav emoji? I like making these faces though.

Hey! How has your week been? I finally finished my last midterm a few hours ago. I'm FREEEE until my finals ...
Yeah, Oppenheimer. I didn’t watch it, but I saw a lot of people talking about it. 
We go to Downtown Vancouver pretty often since we’re around the area! I only go for the Korean food, otherwise I feel like it’s kinda bland? Maybe I’m too used to it. I thought my dislike of it might be because of the crowd since I’m also not a fan of seattle, but I loved Tokyo. Your mentor might be right and I only liked Tokyo cause it was a novelty to me ahah. I think Seattle and Vancouver are really similar. 
I really like the architecture of Japan. In Tokyo, they build up and there’s malls and skyscrapers everywhere. The area around Vancouver is so flat. Japan had so much personality too because not every store was part of a chain.  It made window shopping a unique experience since you never know what each store would offer. 
Oh, that’s super cool! I wouldn’t mind checking out Germany. I think I’m open to exploring most places in Europe except for Paris because of all the uhh unfortunate travel experiences I’ve heard about. When I was in high school, I was close friends with a German exchange student. She said that she lived near a castle. I really want to explore the inside of a European castle. 
Luckyy. I wish my brain was on vacation mode. I haven’t had like a responsibility free summer since I graduated from high school, since I took summer school every summer. It lightened my academic burdens during the school year, but wow I really want a few months to just sit around and pretend to be a mushroom. 
Maybe. I’ve always been really bad at languages. I think my reading and writing is alright, but I always suffer when it comes to listening and speaking. In high school, I was so bad at the speaking and listening portion of French class that it caused my grade to drop by 10%. It sounds like you’re pretty gifted when it comes to learning languages. 
If you were winded by the flute, I’m surprised you always did the trumpet! I’d imagine that requires more air. Was the flute popular in your class? I was one of the only three flute players ahah. Half the class chose the clarinet then the rest were a combination of other brass instruments.

My fav hobby is reading. I spend most of my spare time reading. Though, when I was younger, I had more hobbies. Like I said before, I used to write, I also used to have a few penpals, and I used to draw. Did you have any hobbies that you eventually dropped? Anything you want to pick up?
Hmmm. I’m not sure if I have a talent. I guess I like (and I think I’m good at) planning stuff. Idk if that’s a talent though. I usually plan the get togethers for my group of friends.

Intro: Happy Monday!
A: Thanks, same to you!
Q1: Did you like the movie? I’d rate it a solid 7/10. The movie theater was absolutely packed with half the people watching Barbie and the other half watching the nuclear movie that also came out on the same day.
A: It was interesting, I give it a 6.5/10. Talking about Oppenheimer I'm assuming?
Q2: Vancouver Island is a good destination. I’ve been wanting to visit Victoria but none of my friends want to go with me. They said it’s too boring.
A: I guess it depends how you felt when you went the first time. Maybe they don't like the city culture there or maybe they didn't have such a swell time when they went there. But my old mentor said that once you had the experience, it wouldn't be the same if you go all the time because you already had the experience. Have they been to Vancouver? Vancouver is pretty neato! :D
Q3: Aha. I know some of my relatives live in Paris but most of them are in China. It’s pretty cool that you have relatives everywhere. It’s basically like you have friends all around the world. When I visited Hong Kong a few months ago, I met my friend’s aunt, and she (on the spot) invited me to her daughter’s wedding in Singapore. I’m super flattered but I wouldn’t want to crash the wedding since her daughter doesn’t even know me.
A: Ye, I guess so lol. Forgot to mention I have some in Germany as well from my dad's side XD. Oh, that sounds nice, If I were invited by a friend's aunt, I would've done the same, but I would've went anyways just to be nice lol!
Q4: It’s through this site called Goodreads. Do you use it? Basically, it’s a site to track and find books. You can set a reading goal for the year. I’m at 61 books so far with a goal of 75. It says I’m 18 books ahead of the schedule, so I might have to increase it. You can also message some authors which is what I did. It’s kinda embarrassing, but I messaged a few of my favorite authors back in the day and she was the only one that responded.
A: Oh nice! And no, I've heard of it but never used it lol. Sounds interesting!
Q5: I am the older sister to one younger sister. We’re pretty close. I usually cook for her and she buys me food on the way home from work/school.
A: Haha, cool! Sounds like you guys have a good bonding relationship :)
Q6: Not a trick question! Sorry, should’ve worded it better. I feel like you have to be good at lying to your friends to win in Among us.
A: No problem, I just didn't understand lol. My brain has been on vacation mode for a while XD. Nope, I wasn't, it would tie up to either my friends or my siblings lol.
Q7: Oui oui. I did see what you did there. How good is your French? Since I went into the arts at Uni and I didn’t take French 12, I had to take it in university. It ended up being one of my worst grades.
A: I took French from elementary school until Grade 9 lol. But then, I would re-learn just for the fun of it haha. Oof, I guess French isn't easy, hey?
Q8: Did you like playing the flute? I also learned it around the same grade as you. I thought about joining band after that but decided against it.
A: Yes and no. The yes part -- it was good, the no part -- is how much air you had to use and I would probably be winded by the end of the day lol. But the flute wasn't the only instrument, I also did trumpet for a while in Grade 5 haha.
Q9: Hibiscus is beautiful. Have you had hibiscus tea? I love the vibrant colour and the taste. It’s a little tart.
A: Oooh, I've heard of it but never tried it before haha.
Q10: I’ll make sure to double-check the links 😊 I used to listen to Try by P!nk nonstop when I was younger – it’s a good song. I like Golden Hour too. Never heard of Weightless before but I’ll give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendations!
A: No worries, also it just popped into my mind -- there's a song I've been listening to a lot lol. It's called I'll Show You by K/DA. The meaning behind it is for me (from my point of view) is that you feel as if you're not good enough. Then at the end, you decide to move on and leave it in the past and focus more on self-love and what it means to not judge yourself or others because you never know what they might be going through. But otherwise, it's pretty good, and I think you might like it! It has some Korean lyrics in it too :D
Q11: Bonus: Word of the day – Betwixt means “in between”
A: Makes sense -- it sounds like ""between"" itself lol!
Q12: Quote of the day: -""I’m Kenough."" – Ken from the Barbie movie.
A: Haha lol!
Q13: I guess wavy hair? My hair right now is a combo between straight and wavy – mostly wavy. I like having a lot of layers since my hair is thin. With it being wavy and layered, it’s like halfway to being a wolf cut but less extreme. Curly hair is really cute though. Have you ever dyed your hair?
A: That's cool! And nope, I have never dyed my hair. I may or may not next year lol! I have got it permed though haha! I got it cut though, but my hair is regrowing anyways lol.
Q14: I think I would rather do poetry. Years ago, I used to write poetry. I haven’t had the motivation nowadays, so that’s all in the past. The most important thing to consider is that I’m 100% tone deaf. Nobody needs to or wants to hear me sing. Have you been to karaoke before? I used to be able to whistle. I can’t do it anymore.
A: Cool that you used to do poetry! Awh, that sucks, I'm sorry. I'm 100% sure you sing super well! Even I can't as well lol. My voice is a bit deep (with some voice cracks once in a while) so I don't sing like 90% of the time unless my friends encourage me to haha. I have, but with my friends and family -- never in public! I also got a microphone from a family-friend :D I'll see if I can send a pic! Oh that's cool, when you were younger? Were you able to whistle tunes? If so, like easy songs or hard ones?

Wow it's been such a crazy week for you! I really can tell that you have a genuine passion for helping others and I'm sure no matter what you do in the future you'll be able to make a big impact on society. Congratulations on getting into UBCO!!! It's okay if you don't have any entrance scholarships for UBC - it's actually pretty difficult to get one. The only person I know from my school that got a scholarship for UBC ended up going to Harvard, so you can tell how competitive those are. However, Carleton's $16,000 scholarship would be insane and would definitely help you pay for a huge chunk of your tuition when you're there. It's probably also slightly cheaper to rent over there? I can't say for sure because I haven't lived there obviously. I will say that UBCO has an amazing campus. It's absolutely gorgeous and I know the people there have a pretty close-knit community because it's such a small campus. I don't know much about Carleton, but the scholarship is honestly something that's really hard to give up and I think the only reason you should probably choose UBCO is if you have a huge preference, otherwise the scholarship makes me think Carleton is really worth it. I really hope you get the BC Excellence scholarship as I really do think you just deserve it. It's super cool that your best friend is also getting it, and it must be a little difficult to compete against each other but it's nice that you guys are still working on it together. I'm not surprised at all that you love your job - it seems like such an amazing opportunity, and the fact that everyone loves you as a tutor is really rewarding. I totally get having issues between something you are actually interested ub versus something you could actually see a career in; for example, my friend was also really interested in music but obviously he didn't see much of a future career in it so he ended up still doing a little bit of concert band in university, but then pursued a more practical major.
 Yes, the new gension patch is definitely insane. The new Liyue area has me so excited because my favorite part of any game is always the exploration, and just seeing all the new landscapes and mechanisms is so exciting for me. I'm glad that your finals ended up going super well, especially your 100% on the chem final (congrats again!)! It's also insane that they made you guys dissect a pig fetus. I think in high school the most they made us dissect was a cow heart, which was not as bad in my opinion.
Don't worry too much about being rejected from your dream program, you'll get used to being rejected from a lot of things in the future. Especially in university, I've been rejected from numerous programs and even clubs, so you get used to it after a while. When I was applying to university, I actually applied to a bunch of the Ivy Leagues and ended up getting rejected from practically all of them, but in the end I really enjoy being here at UBC as well!
I heard about the CN Genshin stuff going on and was not surprised at all that Genshin is once again not really doing anything for the anniversary. I think they know that regardless of what happens, no one is really going to quit the game, so they don't really care anymore. However, it's awesome that you started playing Honkai! I've been playing it for a while now and unfortunately I think it is a very fun game but the amount of content in it is relatively short, so finish it pretty quickly.
I hope you get better soon. It's really such a difficult time to be sick! I would hate to be sick right now as I'm so busy I haven’t had the time to take a break at all. Last week was just super chaotic for me as I finally got my acceptance into the UBC physics graduate program, Alberta physics program, and an invite to Calgary medical school so I've been panicking trying to figure out everything and start practicing for the interviews for Calgary. I'm still waiting on Alberta med as well so fingers crossed that I also get the interview there! I decided to not tell my parents for now and surprise them by just flying back and knocking on their door. I think that would be hilarious and I can't wait to see this surprise on their faces. In addition, I just have so many assignments and marking to do as a TA. My Honours thesis is also heading towards its end and I really need to start getting things done so I'm definitely panicking about that too. The final thesis is supposed to be around 50 pages long, so I have no idea where I'm even going to begin. Graduation is just such a hectic time and there are so many things I have to consider and work out so I will try my best to reply to you as soon as possible, but I may be a little slow in the next few months.

HI MENTOR! 
It is finally time...althought I am actually in bed sick with a fever right now...I did promise. So much has happened holy. I am not gonna remember everything. 
K first off let's rewind, I don't even know what the last thing I told you about was. Let's start off in the first week of January. I presented my capstone! That was super fun. I also watched a bunch of my friends capstones which for some reason made me unexpectedly emotional?? It was weird. Anyway, then the end of the semester came around, and I got a bunch of thank you texts and cards and hugs from the students I tutor and it was super wholesome. It made me feel like I actually did something to help the world for once...I am not completely useless. Tbh that's kinda my goal in life...to help the world. Which is what i've been writing on most of my college and scholarship prompts. Like for example one of the most cliché prompts has been, ""what is most important to you in life and why?"" If I truly answer that with upmost honestly, I genuinely want to help the world. That is most important to me. Now whether that's a good answer or not idk. What I do know is that I am happy with what i've been submitting. It makes me sound determined and confident. Driven like a leader. 
Im ranting...typical 
Speaking of scholarships and universities...first of all...I got into ubcO! So that's pretty exciting. I think housing applications are open so i need to apply asap. Remember when I had a big rant about how I don't wanna apply to ubc and then you told me to and I didn't listen. Well now here I am, with no entrance scholarships cause I applied late but that's okay. I'm not sure if I wanna go there yet. It's in my top 2. Carleton and ubcO. I've got to decide between those 2 soon. I've been doing more in depth research into housing and tuition fees and stuff. Not to mention that I do have a minimum of 16,000 dollars scholarship from carleton which is crazy...it's like they are desperate to have new students. Like that's a lot of money. 
Lemme know what you think about that. 
Ok ok and then there's scholarships. So there's the BC Excellence Scholarship which the way it works is there's one nominee from each highschool nominated by the school district admin after reviewing your application and they get to actually apply for the award. I applied and I just got called to the office this week, and then they took me into the back rooms of the school which was kinda scary. I have been in this building for so many years but never knew there was a whole maze of rooms behind the office lol. But anyways the principal was like hey ur in the top 3 but we can't choose between you guys so we are making you submit the second part of the application which is like a sort of kind of resume experience type thing. So i recently submitted that. I also found out that my best friend is one of the other 3. We can't figure out who the third person is tho. So we actually worked together on our applications for the second part lol. Now we are both patiently waiting. Wish me luck lol. 5 grand would be insane. 
Ooook what else....uhhh my capstone is not done yet! Just because I presented it doesn't mean it's over. This is just the beginning. I actually got a text today that I got referred to from one of the parents whose daughter I tutored last semester! So the business is growing! It's amazing to see my dream slowly come true. The kids words that i've received are honestly just speechless. Idk how I could ever repay these people. I do absolutely love my job i've gotta admit. 
Yk what else I love...Music! Which is why I actually have 2 music classes in my schedule this semester. It's a crazy story. Okay so I have physics 12 first block. Then an independent directed study in music theory. Then music composition and production 12. And then calculus 12. Okay but the interesting part is the story behind my independent study. So basically after I presented my capstone, during my careers block I basically had an open block to work on assignments and stuff. I had no work to do lol and i was bored until one morning after my band class ended (we have band 7:30-8:30) my music teacher who is also the best person to ever exist and also my best friend and also one of my biggest role models slash inspirations gave me the idea of coming to the band room during my open block to do some theory! Cause i've always wanted to learn more theory. It is actually my dream to pursue music post secondary but i didn't apply for it because i don't see career in it. It truly is my dream tho. Anyways yeah so during my open block I had 1 on 1 theory lessons with my band teacher....and then...the semester came to an end. And on the last day he gave me this idea...he told me there's a thing called an independent directed study, where u do like your own study in something your interested in but someone in the community kind of is your mentor and stuff. It's super cool. And he was like Yeah i'll totally do a one on one theory block with you...So i asked my counsellor who didn't take much convincing and here I am! I now am living my dream life. I go to band in the morning. Then physics. Then theory. Then after lunch music composition and production which is one of the coolest classes ever once again with my band teacher the absolute goat. And then calculus. It's like my dream schedule. It's everything I could ever want. And it works out great because I don't have any academic classes left to take besides physics and calc. I took grade 11 and 12 courses in grade 10 and 11 so I got a little bit ahead. Which ended up being super worth it cause now this last semester of my life is amazing. I'm learning like first year university theory so I am getting to study music without having to go to university. It's a dream come true. 
Ok what other stories are there...My fever is killing me rn. 🤦‍♀️
OH THERES XIANYUN AND GAMING AND CHIORI. HOOOOLLLYYYY HOYOVERSE IS COOKINGGGGG. Lantern rite is gonna be a blast. I just hope I don't miss the event. I've been taking a bit of a break. I haven't logged on in a few weeks. I was super busy. All my finals went super well though! 
OH! I DISSECTED A FETAL PIG. IT WAS CRAZY BUT ALSO RLLY DISGUSTING AND IT MADE ME QUEASY. 
 
Uhhh I aced my chem final which was epic. 100 PERCENT LES GO. and um yea! 
There's gotta be so many scholarships to apply to. Please let me know if you know any! 
OH ANOTHER THING. My dream program...remember it. Yeaaaa they rejected me. I tried my best but i guess it just wasn't meant to be. I am not really too disheartened about it. To be completely honest I never fully believed in myself anyway which I know is bad but oh well. I'm excited for the future regardless. 
Besdies a longer rant about genshin i've probably covered everything. Have you heard about the CN Genshin stuff going on and how everyone's unfollowing genshin on twitter. I found that pretty funny. 3 intertwined fates for what like 4 years of genshin is actually pathetic lol. I don't rlly care but I wouldn't mind some better rewards. SPEAKING OF. I STARTED PLAYING HONKAI. Not much but a few hours. I'd say I have like 15 ish hours in the game? I got welt as my standard 5 star. He's pretty cool. I haven't had time to play in weeks tho.
I think I pretty much covered everything i've been wanting to tell your for weeks. I'm gonna go to bed because my forehead is dying lol. If i forgot anything i'll probably spam you some other day lol. 
YOUVE GOTTA TELL ME ABOUT UR LIFE TOO. It's gonna be interesting. 
Anyway okok bye bye

Hi Mentee!
I completely sympathize with you, finals are genuinely such a pain. I actually don’t think I ever had to do multi part finals other than for my IB exams in high school, so it sounds like you’re going through a much tougher time than me! Don’t worry about finishing the Paying for School unit if you’ve already gotten all the marks, especially if you don’t feel that interested. I’m completely fine with you just writing a long rant about what’s going on haha! Honestly, I’m just stressing over my Honours thesis at this point since it’s only 4 months until I have to hand in like a 50 page document and do a presentation on it, but I feel like I’ve barely accomplished any research 😭. There’s just so much chaos going on right now that I wish I could just skip 4 months into the future, so I don’t have to suffer through an entire semester. Anyways, good luck on your finals and don’t give up, you’re so close to finishing!",Mentor

MENTOR...
Im not gonna lie it's not looking too good rn. These finals are brutal...I have never had to like study or like worry about tests in my life...but like why do they have to make everything all at once. I have like 4 finals that are multiple days long all consecutively in the same week every single day.
This is probably normal for you but it's a first for me. I'm trying to fight through lol. My english exam is literally all week. I dunno what my grade is gonna be on that but I just finished up part A and B. Part C is an in class essay and idk how i'm gonna do on that...
I finished my chem exam...that one was pretty easy. The bio one is wednesday and friday. 
I an actually so sick of this. 
I am sorry for complaining to you lol, if I do the paying for school unit it's gonna be this weekend... The term ends on monday technically. Although on my assignment sheet I have a 40/40 for e mentoring, so I don't even think we have to do another unit. Ngl I don't wanna do it BUT I SO BADLY WANNA WRITE A HUGE MESSAGE ABOUT STUFF! I swear I will at some point...I SWEAR.
Anyways, yea...trust me, you'll know when I am done everything. I will definitely let you know. FEEL FREE TO SEND ME ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME! I'm sure there's cool stuff happening in ur life!",Mentee

No worries at all! Good luck on your scholarship applications, assignments and finals! Omg haha don't worry, I do not have high standards at all - I literally cannot do any type of creative activity (singing, drawing, dancing, etc.) for the life of me. Seriously, I don't have a single creative bone in my body, so I'm always super impressed with what you're doing! We still have until the 26 so you have time to finish things up later if need be, for now definitely focus on your schoolwork",Mentor

I'm really honoured that you think so highly of me and you're really just such a great person to talk to. I would love to stay in contact even after the program is over!

MERRY CHRISTMAS MENTOR! 
I hope you have an amazing christmas and a happy new year too! Hopefully you have the opportunity to see your family! My brother is home for the holidays and it's the best when he's here. 
During Chrisrmastime I often find myself thinking of gratitude. Gratitude in the people around me, and the people who have been positively influential on me. People who have had an impact on me. People I look up to.
I don't know you very well, because i'm not allowed to lol, but you are still one of the coolest people I know. It probably doesn't seem like it but I look up to you in many ways. You are a very amazing person. Keep being you!
Thats all I wanted to say lol. Have an absolutely amazing Christmas! :)
PS: I'm absolutely 100000% down to stay in touch after my semester ends. I find it absolutely bizzare for someone to talk to someone regularly and then just completely cut off ties with them and never ever talk again??? That's insane. I don't know how anyone could do that and it wouldn't hurt, like jeez. I'm sure i'll spontaneously text you if something interesting happens. PLUS I need to know where you end up in 4 months lmao. AND I need to tell you about my first year of university! I'll probably ask you for advice on random things too. You gotta tell me about stuff too! 
Anyways...for like the 100th time Merry Christmas, ur the best.",Mentee

Sounds good, I've opened up the Paying for School Unit! Unfortunately once the semester ends (I believe at the end of January), you won't have any more E-mentoring assignments to do. However, we can still remain in contact on here if you'd like! There's no problem in continuing to talk about school, advice, etc. even after the program is over :)",Mentor

LMAO NO WORRIES, I completely forgot to mention that I ended up deciding to just pull for Baizhu as well since Furina really needs a healer and I got him in another 20 pulls ahah.

Hi Mentee!
No worries, I am literally in the exact same boat as you except I'm applying to post-undergrad programs. I finally managed to submit all of my med apps this week but that just means I need to get started on my grad apps soon 😭.  I honestly did not apply to many scholarships so I have no idea but I applied to a bunch of universities across Canada and even the US so I could definitely give you advice if you need it! It really depends on what you're looking to do in and after uni, because that can heavily affect which programs at what universities you want to apply to. I can kinda speak on some of the engineering and science programs out there. Have you identified some possible subjects you might want to study? Also, I would love to hear about your capstone project when you have time.
Honestly, I have seen so many memes about Neuvillette and am so tempted to pull but I just have to get Furina so I have been saving like crazy. I think I have about 150 pulls saved for her and her weapon so I'm really hoping to get both. I totally agree about the Archon quest, it was absolutely phenomenal and so fun - it's insane to see how far Gneshin has come. I really wish I could play more because I love exploring Fontaine but I have to play on my gaming laptop and I get lazy because I have to sit up and play as opposed to lying on my bed and playing on my switch. What's really funny is somehow I have two Staff of Homas without Hutao and I just use them on my Xiao and Xiangling. I hope you can get it soon too because it is definitely such as broken weapon.
Yes, I will unlock the From Rural to Urban unit and we can get started on that. When it opens up, you'll see a new chat area appear, kinda like the one we're currently using. Try working through the first few tasks and let me know if you have questions regarding anything!",Mentor

AHHH HI MENTOR,
I have been incredibly busy and definitely stressed too. Everywhere I go and everyone I talk to, all they talk about is university applications and scholarships and bursaries and different programs and AHHH. Then I am doing work on my capstone as well (i kinda wanna tell you about that at some point) but yeah. It's been a week but i'm alive. I'm sure you are wayyy more busy than me especially with applications and stuff. 
I think I wanna start with the rural urban unit. So do I just wait for you to unlock it? Im gonna assume so...
I have been like really overwhelmed about all that responsible stuff and everything I should be doing. If there's any scholarships and stuff that you think I should apply for please let me know. Or if you have any advice or stuff you wish you did or something. I'm also trying to figure out how to write application essays and stuff and I am kinda struggling but I believe. 
Anyways let's talk about less important stuff for a second to be happy. I GOT NEUVILLETTE!!!! AND HES ABSOLUTELY INSANE. I am also 50 pity on the weapon banner and I have like 2 weeks still so that's exciting. Even if I lose 50/50 I should hopefully get staff of homa and I am literally a Hu Tao main so that's a win win for me. I played the 4.1 archon quest and I won't say any spoilers but...HOLYY IT WAS GOOD. Anyways yeah...let's start with the rural to urban unit.",Mentee

Hi Mentee!
No problem at all! Don't worry about replying to me immediately, obviously other things can get in the way and you gotta prioritize those first. Also, happy belated birthday! Your friends sound awesome: a hand-crocheted Totoro is so impressive and adorable haha. On the note about graduating: if you make the effort to stay connected, it won't be an issue at all. I have known two of my best friends since kindergarten and we separated back in high school, but I still keep in touch and visit them whenever I can to this day! 
And honestly, with how many similar interests we have, I wouldn't be surprised if you knew about most of my interests at this point hahaha. I am also so excited for this version for Genshin since the new area looks so fun and the Archon quest looks so interesting. I'm so glad you have guaranteed for Neuvillette; I'm saving for Furina and unforunately I do not have guaranteed so I have over 120 pulls saved for her to make sure she comes home ! Hopefully you can get him early and pull for his weapon too because from what I've seen so far he looks absolutely broken. 
And yes, I was referring to Star Rail! It's honestly super fun too but I can see doing dailies for both be slightly annoying haha. It's a slightly less time consuming game in my opinion so that's why I play it on the side. Lastly, another cool thing I did (related to last pic) was go do research at the world's largest particle accelerator over the summer! It's called CERN and it's located in Geneva. Here's a picture of an actual accelerator known as LEIR. 
Also, if you want to get started on one of the modules, you can choose between the following: From Rural to Urban, Career Exploration, and Adulting or 2 other ones of your own choice!",Mentor

Hi Hi Mentor! 
Sorry I read your message on sunday but I haven't been able to respond. Today is my birthday! So, for my final picture originally I couldn't decide what to do, but then after my birthday I thought i'd share what my 2 of my amazing friends gave me. Both of them really like to crochet so one of them made me a totoro to hang up on my wall (which I absolutely love so much and also she got me totoro chopsticks which was epic) and my other friend crocheted me a little no-face plushie from spirited away (which I also ABSOLUTELY love and it lives on my bed now). Anyways yeah, I just chose these pictures because i'm happy and really grateful for my friends. I don't have many friends but the ones I got are real ones and I love them lots. They are amazing people and I am kinda scared to graduate cause what if I don't keep in touch with them. I will definitely miss them all. 
Ok let's stop being emotional...How about we talk about the fact that YOU PLAY GENSHIN! Right when I thought we couldn't have more things in common. I also play genshin! I wouldn't say I mean anyone in particular but I have a great hu tao build, ayaka build, and raiden build too. Neuvillette came out today (ON MY BDAY) and right after I write this message i'm gonna go wish for him. He's guaranteed for me because I lost 50/50 on lyneys banner ( I GOT DEYHA :( I want to cry) So I really hope I have enough primos to get neuvillette hopefully I get him early. Anyways fontaine is absolutely amazing. Have you had time to play the archon quest because so far it's absolutely insane.
On the other hand, when you say honkai you mean star rail right? I downloaded it when it came out and I know that it's quite popular now but I just haven't gotten around to playing it at all yet which is kinda sad but having to do daily commissions for 2 games at the same time everyday is kinda annoying and I kinda wanna just play one game at a time. But, I heard the game is absolutely awesome! 
Now, let's talk about the picture you sent...THAT IS THE COOLEST THING EVER. Like, I understood absolutely nothing in the picture but working at a project for Canadas particle accelerator is like the most inspiring thing ever. You are actually so cool. That is definitely something that I would wanna learn more about in the future.",Mentee

Hi Mentee!
I also tend to sleep super late haha even on weeknights. Honestly it is so impressive that you're part of a local band, I couldn't even imagine doing that because I have absolutely no affinity for music haha! I totally get your mom's frustrations but I bet she's super proud of you too. It's super cool that you're so passionate about music as your hobby, sometimes I feel like I seriously have no hobbies outside of gaming.
I am definitely planning on getting back to Tears of the Kingdom eventually, but currently I am very preoccupied with a different game (Genshin/Honkai) and a lot of applications as I am graduating university this year. Super excited to head to Gerudo town after!
Also, you are definitely allowed to talk really informally! I'm not your teacher or anything ahha, just a fellow student who happens to be a couple years ahead in life. I'll let you know if there's anything that is off-limits but trust me hobbies and interests are definitely not part of that!
For my next photo, I chose a photo of the current research project I'm working on, which is called DarkLight. It's basically a machine that is trying to find evidence for dark matter! The project is based at TRIUMF, which is Canada's particle accelerator, right beside UBC. If you ever decide to visit, you could totally go on a tour there!",Mentor

Hi Hi Hi,
 
As I am writing this it's 1:41 am but it's friday night so it's acceptable...Okok here's the next picture I chose. It's a picture of my new drum kit I got this summer. This corner is very special to me. I call it my drumming corner. It's like my happy place, I just hop into this corner and vent all my frustrations on my drums. I like to say it's a healthy way of dealing with stress...but my mum would say otherwise because I often give her headaches from drumming so loud. 
 
Anyways...I chose this image because once again it expresses how important music is in my life. When i'm not playing music, i'm listening to it. My life revolves around music. I am the drummer for my highschool concert and jazz band, I am part of a local band in my town called The Ring System, and also our highschool does an annual musical for the community and we are very well known for it...Last year on opening night we had a full house! I am also the drummer for the pit band for our annual musicals. 
 
Now let's talk about the epic stuff. You need to find the time to play more tears of the kingdom...it's literally the best game ever! Also, I absolutely love your ghibli soundtrack choices. I approve. Castle in the sky is absolutely godly. And, yes I also get distracted by lyrics so instrumental is always so nice to listen to (especially when you are emotionally attached to some of the songs and they really make you get in your feels). 
 
Oh and also I had a slight concern. I was gonna ask if it's okay for me to be talking like this. Am I allowed to talk to you so informally like this and ask about silly things that I find interesting? I don't wanna get in trouble for accidentally doing something i'm not supposed to. I watched the video and did the quiz and I know the important dos and don'ts but if I ever do something i'm not supposed to please let me know because it's not intentional. I'm just really excited and have so many questions because you are genuinely so cool and I can't wait to get to know you so we can be epic friends!",Mentee

Hi Mentee!
This is actually so cool, we share so many interests! I also started playing Tears of the Kingdom over the summer but unfortunately got a little too busy so I only got through 2 of the bosses so far (currently trying to finish the Goron boss).
It's also so cool that you love Studio Ghibli music because I really like it too! I think my favourite are probably Merry Go Round of Life from Howl's Moving Castle, A Town with an Ocean View from Kiki's (but honestly the entire soundtrack from Nausicaa and Sky Castle are phenomenal). I usually can't listen to music when I'm studying because I get so easily distracted by the lyrics, but Studio Ghibli music and classical stuff works since they're instrumental!
The photo I chose is this new habit I recently started where I am trying to record my mood everyday just to see how my life changes day by day. It also encourages me to reflect on what happened everyday which is really nice. I tend to write down some notes as well so I can summarize quickly the important things that happened that day so hopefilly I can be reminded of it in the future when I look back at the entry!",Mentor

For this first image, I chose a picture from my Apple Music replay. It is a screenshot of the original soundtrack from the Studio Ghibli movie: Princess Mononoke. The reason I chose this image is because it symbolizes the impact that music has on my day-to-day life. Music means a lot to me. As you can see, I have listened to this ost many many times. When I am doing homework, or want to relax, my go-to thing is listening to classical music and soundtracks. That type of music really helps me focus and just makes me happy.",Mentee

Hi Mentor! Nice to meet you! My name is Mentee. I am super excited to be working with you for the following months. I read your profile and I was squealing with excitement. You are so incredibly talented! There are so many things I need to know right now. The Chinese instrument you play (I forgot the name but I have seen it in videos before) is so cool. Also, you have a Nintendo Switch! I have one too! The most recent game I played was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Anyways moving on....I am going to start the first assignment assigned by my teacher. She has asked me to choose between the photo swap and the poem assignment. I have chosen the photo swap option.
