Hi Cohen,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I would like to apologise for the delayed response. Your message ended up in a different folder, and I didn’t notice until now. 
 
I’m thrilled to know that things are going well with you! Congratulations on getting the job! If you don’t mind sharing, could you tell me what kind of job did you get? Is it temporary or long-term? I’m curious to know what you’ve been working on these days. 
 
By the way, it’s interesting to know that I’m not the only one who associated your piece with Interstellar. Interstellar has very recognisable soundtrack. If you’re into sci-fi, it’s a cool film to watch. Although I wouldn’t say it’s my favourite. But hey, I watched it for Anne Hathaway. 😊
 
Yes, I believe your musical exposure could greatly contribute to your personal music style. Maybe one day your music will achieve the same recognition! Keep up the good work, and I have no doubt you’ll make a mark in the music world.  
 
I’m sure people were impressed by your presentation! You had the whole package, even for the cloth! I guess sometimes people don’t feel comfortable asking questions in public in general, as they fear to seem uninformed; or they assume certain questions are accepted as common knowledge in the musical field. What I would like to believe is that you explained everything perfectly well and eliminated their doubts.
 
Thanks for recommending Kraftwerk; I will definitely check them out. You have introduced many great jazz songs and I really appreciate you for that. I have always wanted to add more flavours to my playlist. 
 
Thank you for your kind words Cohen! I feel incredibly fortunate to have someone like you with whom I can share thoughts and ideas about music. Our discussions have been such a pleasure for me. Thanks for being a great mentee; it was such a pleasure. I have no doubt that a bright future awaits you! Make the most of this summer and have a blast! 
 
All the best,
Rosie

Hi Cohen and Rosie,
I see that you were still writing to each other a few days ago, so I've decided to keep your accounts active. Feel free to keep chatting.

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s so great to hear about your trip and the success of your performances with the jazz band! I looked up Ashcroft on the map, it seems like a very small, quiet village with mountainous surroundings. 
 
Well, I guess not everyone appreciate sarcasm. At least he’s been more aspiring for the team during your big days, boosts the morale. 
 
I’m very impressed by your work! I believe this can be a great fit for a movie soundtrack! Such as a sci-fi film or an action movie. I hope you can somehow incorporate music production into your career plans, you would do great! 
 
I like how this piece is a rich combination of various colourful layers, and classical and modern musical elements. You have a very powerful intro as a starter; it helps to grab your audience’s attention. My favourite part starts from 0:48. The instruments and sound selections are very innovative, you choose well. I also wonder whether you get inspired from the movie Interstellar…? Haha! 
 
As for the project I designed for you, there’s no need to apologize. That was supposed to be a tiny “push” for you to pursue composing. I’m glad to see how well you did with your capstone, and the fact that you used your creativity to produce something with passion. 
 
Great work at your semester! I’m so proud that you’ve finished this project by yourself. I hope the presentation went well??? Did you get any good feedback from the others? 
 
Thanks for your kind words! I want to say congratulations one more time. Wish you have a restful and enjoyable summer! I appreciate you for allowing me to be a part of this joyful journey, and please write to me again if you ever want some advice or feedback, or even just wanna chat. 
 
All the best,

Hi Rosie,
 
I've come back from my trip from last weekend, where we performed in Ashcroft and stayed at Kumsheen Rafting Resort for a night. I should also mention that after that I performed my last ever show with the jazz band on Thursday. It was a good way to end the year, and I think the reason our shows went so well is because our teacher was noticeably nicer to us during setup and performance, which surprisingly enough has a positive effect. For every other performance he's been confusing or sarcastic and overall just demoralizing no matter how much he likes to praise us afterward, but at least now I don't have to deal with him as a teacher anymore. I had fun with the band but I think I'm just looking to relax now that summer's arriving, so I'm happy it's over.
Another, more important, thing to mention is that I finished my capstone. I'm sorry I didn't get to discuss more about it with you before I presented it, but on the plus side, I did upload my composition as a YouTube video. 
https://youtu.be/TBjMfCye2Dc
I'm happy with how it turned out. I've listened to it plenty of times, but I'm still pretty impressed by it, especially after recently showing it to people for the first time. I made it mostly just by experimenting and seeing what sounds good, so I'm happy that it turned out pretty good for something that I basically taught myself. 
 
Thank you for your help with this project of mine. I know the project itself was mostly just me alone, but having you to talk to about music and composition is something I haven't really had before, so it was very useful to have you as someone I could talk to about things I couldn't do with anyone else. Getting advice from someone who's graduated and pursued a post secondary-path in music is very handy as well.
I think I also also follow that up with an apology, however. Maybe you saw this coming, but I never managed to complete the project your organized for me. I have made other short compositions in my spare time, but none of them really match the theme that you gave me. I'm sorry that I didn't put my own effort despite the effort that you put into organizing this project for me.
My last day of school will be on Tuesday. I don't know when our contact gets cut off, but I imagine I'll be able to send one last message before I go. I look forward to hearing what you think about my composition. 
 
 
Talk to you later,

Hi Cohen,
 
Don’t worry about not getting back to me right away—I know how life can get a handful sometimes. Honestly, I am really pleased to hear about all the different things you’ve been up to lately! And it’s great to hear that you’re constantly making progress with your composition. Take as much time as you need to get it just right! 
 
I’m glad to hear that your capstone coworker also made a song for the graduation! They will be a great resource to talk about the process. Every capstone project is unique; I’m sure you’ll shine on the stage when the day comes! 
 
Hey congratulations on your upcoming show with the jazz band! Where are you heading to?? Did you have to postpone it because of the pandemic? I totally get the last-minute replace panic. I hope you get capable players as replacements. Plus, sounds like everyone in the band recognizes your solo skills! That’s so awesome! 
 
If you’re up for it, I’d love to hear more about what’s been going on with your teacher. Sounds like you guys had an unpleasant conversation. What makes you frustrated about your relationship? 
 
Anyway, take your time with everything! I don’t want you to feel stressed about the composition or anything like that. I’m really excited to hear it when you’re ready, and I know you’re doing an amazing job! 
 
Hope you enjoy your performance and ace it! 
 
All the best,

Hello
Sorry I took this long to get back to you, I was hoping to add a few touches to my composition to make it seem mostly complete (still missing a few parts of the melody). I think just need to wait a little longer until I get that burst of creative energy again. We've been doing non-capstone related activities in my careers class, so that probably why I haven't spent as much time engaging in composition lately, that and preparing for a trip I'm taking with the jazz band next weekend (so also keep in mind I'll be busy/exhausted with that).
I talked with a coworker who just happened to also make a song for his capstone and had the same teacher as mine, and his song was only a minute long (mine is nearly three). I still need to make a slide presentation to help my presentation, but other than I'm pretty confident my capstone will go well.
Also I thought I'd mention that today I did my first show with the jazz band since December. We had some issues with players leaving and being replaced last minute, so our song selection suffered a little, but aside from that it went alright and people said I soloed well. However my teacher was very frustrating to deal with and I almost considered walking out then and there. Just reminded me a bit of our conversation about our relationships between ourselves and our teachers/instructors.
Anyways, next time I message you I'll hopefully have something to show you (I think I said that last time too). Just know that because of my trip, it might come a little late again.
Have a good week

Hi Cohen,
 
Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! It’s so exciting to see you moving onto the next chapter in your life. Do you have any plans for after graduation? I remember when I graduated from high school, all I wanted to do was sleep for 3 days and have no one disturb me. 
 
I’m glad to hear that you have the Gender and Sexuality Alliance a try, even if it may not be your cup of tea. It’s great to be exposed to potential resources and new opportunities. 
 
You have come so far and achieved so much. I always enjoy talking to you about music and life in general. I see a lot of potential in you. Also, I know you’re very positive and passionate towards music history, composing, friendships, and critical thinking. I have no doubt that you will continue to excel in whatever you do. 
 
I’m sorry to hear that you might not have enough time for your presentation. I think presenting your composition is an important part, so I encourage you to showcase your hard work. Perhaps there is another way to arrange the structure? If you need help with trimming down your text or anything else, I’m more than happy to take a look at your presentation. Also, I think uploading your music to YouTube is a good idea—which is exactly what I did for my video audition for my university application. 

If you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss, just let me know! 
 
Best,

Hello again,
Considering the fact that I'm graduating in less than a month, there's really no reason for me to try to start any clubs or anything like that, but even if I tried, I just don't think there would be enough people interested in any activities like that to keep the club running. I only remembered this now, but last year we had a Gender and Sexuality Alliance that would meet up every couple weeks in school that I visited a few times, and every time I went it just seemed like less and less were interested (I don't think they did it at all this year). There is also a community band outside of the school, but I don't think I'm as interested in playing concert band fanfare-type music and I'd rather have the free time to work or whatever else.
I think it would be a pretty popular opinion to say that the human voice is more expressive than any instrument. It's capable of singing any note, even ones outside of the western tuning system, and each voice is personalized to its owner. It can also be both melodic and percussive. Basically in my opinion it's more expressive in so many ways, but I'd still be interested to keep an open mind and hear any counterarguments on the topic.
I also thought about it more and I decided it's probably better to focus on just one composition for my capstone. My presentation has to be 10 minutes and the composition itself if just over 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and there are other things I talk about in it as well. Over all it just doesn't work. I also still need to share the (nearly finished) piece with you. I'm thinking of just uploading it to YouTube that way I can easily share it as a link. In the meantime I can share it with my friends at school to see how they see it from a casual perspective. In the end I'm sure my teacher will at least enjoy it.
 
 Take care,

Hi Cohen,
 
Thanks for sharing with me about what's going on in school. I totally get it - we're in a tough time economically and things are still recovering from the pandemic. I just want you to know that you're not alone in feeling disconnected from school.
 
But don't be too hard on yourself. Summer is coming, maybe you can take some time to reflect on your overall goals and aspirations. That’s what I am doing at the moment. I made a rough bucket list myself to help me figure out what I need to do to achieve my goals. For example, I want to be a volunteer teacher in Argentina in 3 years, so I'm working on my Spanish skills! It’s so difficult! I figure knowing the basics can be super helpful to communicate with the locals, even for bargaining purchases haha! So I am hoping to master basic grammar and high-frequency words (about shopping) in Spanish before next year. 
 
It kind of sucks that your school doesn’t have many clubs or extracurricular activities. Maybe talking to your counsellor or your teachers would help? They could help incorporate more hands-on learning or group projects for you. They might also know other cool activities or resources available that you are not aware of, such as art programs in the community. Additionally, have you thought about doing some volunteer work? I know some music organizations in Vancouver are always looking for volunteers. It's a great way to get involved. And it could be a great opportunity to share your perspectives with the public and get more jazz lovers involved.
 
Yes! I love that you are passionately exploring this genre and its cultural significance! Thanks for sharing your ideas about the expressiveness of jazz! If I may add to your points, I think improvisation also gives the artists plenty of space to create music authentically and freely. In this way, the audiences could find it easier to bond with the performer emotionally. 
 
While I agree that the control of the breath makes the instrumental sounds closer to the human voice, personally, I think piano and guitar can also imitate the act of “breathing.” Like my piano teacher often says, “Play it as if you’re singing out this piece.” 
 
From your idea, would you agree that the human voice is more expressive than musical instruments? And why? It’s always so nice talking to you! Now we have another interesting topic to discuss.   :)
 
Anyway, I like your thoughts on creating several small parts and integrating them into one! Don’t get restricted by the musical form. Let your creativity flow! 
 
Take care,
Rosie",4:10PM May 16

Hello
 
Right now, I only have two daily classes (not including jazz band) which means I'm only at school half the time now. The classes I do as well are also just not taught in an engaging way in my opinion, just lots of textbook reading or online modules. So basically, just only being there half the time and getting a lot of information from a book just make it harder for me to learn or feel connected. The reason I don't play my trombone at home is just because it's very loud in a non-soundproofed room and annoying to carry around, since I walk home a lot. Also, I'm in grade 12.
In my school, I don't believe there aren't many clubs that exist, let alone ones that I've been apart of. As well as jazz band, I also acted in musical theatre in grades 10-11, if that counts. I don't think I really like being a part of big group (my jazz band has maybe around 10 students present per rehearsal), nor do I like seeking out new people to talk to, so I don't really have an interest in joining a club. I don't have many interests outside of music and art either, so clubs just don't really work for me. I also wanted to point out that we don't actually have a choir anymore. It stopped when it was a concern for spreading covid and then I guess there wasn't enough interest to bring it back.

I'm pleased to see your interest in jazz music and history growing. Although, I don't know well I can explain it or how much if it I can explain to you. I would say jazz has a very interesting way of expressing emotion through instruments, though I wouldn't say it's better or worse than other genres (mostly because I don't understand the emotional sides of other genres yet). I think that, because they're played by breathing, an instrument like a saxophone or trumpet can feel more connected to the artist's voice and emotions than an instrument like guitar. There's a lot to go into about the history and development of the genre, and I'd probably just recommend watching videos online. I watched a PBS documentary spanning something like 8 dvds (which I never finished) that goes into a lot of detail, though probably isn't available to stream.
I was also wondering about the different conversion topics that this website has listed. My teacher said that we need to complete 3 of them, but they were not brought up in conversation and we've already talked about a lot that I didn't think there was a need to use them. I also just don't really know how they work. 
 
One more thing I'll mention is that I decided to expand my capstone idea a bit and try to create several, smaller compositions as opposed to one main one. I figured I don't know about composition enough yet to make a full piece, but I think I have enough creativity to try a few different things. It can also allow me to integrate our project into my capstone as well.
 
See you later

Hi Cohen,
 
I’m glad to hear that you’re doing well in school! When I was your age, math was definitely not my strong suit. I still sometimes have nightmares about taking math tests and waking up sweating! I’m sure your families and friends are very proud! By the way, could you remind me which grade you are at? 
 
Oh what makes you feel disconnected from class and trombone practicing? Do you feel more discouraged and unmotivated than before? If so, I'm here to listen if you want to share your thoughts.
 
Also, I am curious about whether you are part of any school clubs or groups at the moment. I think participating in school clubs or even establishing one are great ways to meet new people and potentially find a new passion in life! What interests you besides music and art? 
 
Thanks for your explanation! I am actually not aware of the fact that Jazz has contributed a great deal to the style of Rock, R&B, Pop and other genres. This is new to me! Do you think Jazz expresses emotions better than other forms of music? What gives it advantages? I'd love to hear more about the history and development of jazz from your perspective. 
 
I like the song Moanin you sent! It's a shame that you don't get to play it that often in the band. Maybe your teacher can consider adding the parts for the choir? 
 
It’s normal to feel uncertain about the future, but just remember that it's okay to take as much time as you need to figure things out. I’m glad that you’re able to stay calm. I see a lot of potential in you and I have faith that you will find your way. As for your composing block, don't be too hard on yourself. Sometimes creativity takes time and that's okay. Keep practising and experimenting, and know that progress doesn't have to come quickly. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
 
Best of luck in all your endeavours!

Hey Rosie
 
School is going fine. I'm doing well enough to get good grades but I still feel sort of disconnected from it at the same time. I often don't study outside of class or even practice the trombone outside of  band. It's also tough to say if I'm excited for summer, since I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. My two best friends are also staying in town for the foreseeable future so I think that will at least make staying in town more enjoyable. 
 
The question you pose is interesting, and probably more complex then I'm fit to give a highly thoughtful answer for. As a fan of music history, I think it's important to understand how significant jazz music is to pretty much any genre of music we listen to today. Jazz and the blues are what led us to rock and hip-hop, which is to pretty much anything you hear from the past century can be linked back to jazz or blues in some way. I also think it's just interesting to see how emotion can be expressed through an instrument without words. That's all I can think of right now, but let me know if you'd like me to elaborate more on anything.
 
We do still play a few instrumental tracks in jazz band that aren't pop hits or anything, though I can see why my teacher prefer to have more songs with vocals, just so that it's fair for the singers. I've requested one particular track all the way back in grade 10 that I really like, which my teacher bought, but since it's been sent in, we've played it exactly one time. It's another Charles Mingus song, I'll link it here if you're interested.
https://youtu.be/KD5RDzVfNNo
 
I really like how this song keeps building on itself overtime. It's something I realize now is a theme I like to hear in rock music, so it's cool that I had that interest before I even liked rock music. 
 
Thank you for your reassurance about the future. I'm definitely uncertain about what I'm going to do over the next few years, but I think I'll at least be able to stay calm about it. Even if I don't go to post-secondary at all, I can at least know that I didn't commit to something I wasn't ready for.
I've also had quite the block when it comes to composing lately. Just know that it may be a while before you hear of any progress from me. My final version of the project you gave me might not end up very long either. 
 
Take care

Dear Cohen,
I hope this email finds you well. There is no need to apologize for the delayed response. I understand how hectic school can be, especially as we approach the end of the term. Speaking of which, how is school going for you? Are you excited for the summer break?
 
I was delighted to hear that you're enjoying the rehearsals. Jazz music demands a great deal of skill and is undoubtedly more challenging than some of the pop songs we hear today. While not all songs can be defined as ""art,"" I do agree that pop songs have the advantage of being more catchy, straightforward and emotionally appealing. This brings me to a question for you to consider: suppose you want to introduce your friends or anyone to jazz music, what would your reasons be? How does jazz music challenge its audience, and how can one transcend the endless cycle of repetitive and brainwashing pop melodies? These are interesting topics to ponder, both casually and academically. Having noticed your remarkable observations about life and your eagerness for self-improvement, I believe you have the potential to become a future researcher or scholar. Why not discuss these ideas with your band teacher and see if he would consider adding one jazz piece to the repertoire?
 
I understand your predicament regarding the future. Rest assured that you're not alone in feeling uncertain or confused about your life's goals. As someone going through the same thing, I've come to realize that it's a long and challenging path to self-discovery. What I am trying to do is to take online courses, read more widely and stay open to my emotions to achieve a stronger sense of self-control and self-improvement. It's a process that takes time, but in due course, it will help reveal my true desires and aspirations. You might find these activities helpful too. In any case, I thought I'd share my experience to let you know that you're not alone in this journey.
 
I'm sorry to hear that the link didn't work. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to hearing your song!!! This is really exciting! 
 
Take good care of yourself. We will talk soon.
 
All the best,

Apologies for the slightly late response,
 
I've done a few rehearsals with the jazz band again. It's been slowly getting more fun overtime but I find we've only really been playing pop hits instead of more authentic jazz. It makes sense since we're focusing on getting ready to do shows again, but it makes me wonder how much people actually enjoy going to see a jazz band and they just play pop music. 
 
I've only really been interested in artistic things lately, but I haven't really been interested in an art-based career, so I don't know what I'll really do with my hobbies once I graduate. There's not really a lot to do with a trombone when you're not in a band. I honestly don't know what I'll do or learn in the future. It would be nice to learn an instrument, but it's a big financial commitment that I don't think I'll be able to handle.
Your advice helped me get a bit of an idea for my protect. I'm not really happy with what I've got going now, but I think I'll get there eventually.
 
Also a quick update. I tried to make a copy of that song I mentioned before so I could send it to you, but I don't think I can just send it to you as a link, so I'll have to find a different solution to show it to you.

I'll try to keep you updated

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s nice to hear from you. How are you feeling? Are you back to band practice? I’m sure your band teacher is very proud of you! You’re very committed and dedicated, and that’s a good thing!
 
I think working hard on your own doesn’t necessarily have a conflict with taking lessons. Yes I am aware that you probably gained more knowledge than other students in the class. When you know what you want to learn, you become very focused. But sometimes you are too focused on your own interests to see what else to explore out there. You may get interested in a concept they bring up in the class, or learn another perspective of thinking.
 
It’s amazing that you are into artistic things. I suck at drawing ever since I was a kid. Now that I am older, I still lose in Pictionary as people tend not to guess what I drew. I think I understand your concern. When I thought about playing the piano professionally as a career, I got overwhelmed as I worried that it could take the fun away. Have you thought about what you value in life? What do you want to become in the future? Is there anything that speaks to you or makes you eager to explore someday? What areas of your life do you want to grow in?
 
Have you read Shakespeare’s sonnet 18? There are a few lines I would like to quote from the poem:
“Shall I compare thee to a rainy day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
But thy eave's memory shall not fade”
 
It is not the rainy day he considered the most beautiful time, but the moment that they shared under the same eave, hearing the dropping of the rain.
 
If you are having problems with finding anything musically interesting about your hometown, perhaps you can start by making a list of descriptive small things that evoke your hometown. Like the road you walk home every day, the lights outside of your house, the stars in the sky, and the blossoms in the schoolyard. Then find out what you want to write about yourself, your valuable memories, your families and friends, or your personal growth, while making the connection between the land and your feelings. For example, in Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran, he didn’t spend too much time describing the “castle,” but the childhood memories he has filled with nostalgia for the old days. He’s included comfort, ease and warm surroundings that embraced his feelings of joy, perplexity, and disorientation. After that, I believe it would help to think about whether there is a style of music you associate with the place you have in mind in your hometown. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It's important to take the first step! 
 
I hope it helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss. 
 
Cheers,
Rosie",3:23PM April 19

Hey again
 
I haven't really had the best experience with my band teacher, though it doesn't really have anything to do with my playing and more with organizing events that we play. I guess standards for a high school band are a lot lower, and he's actually pretty proud of me and the rest of the band. I'm wondering if I should bother taking lessons at some point if I'm already this committed to teaching myself. I think it would be harder just relearn everything I've been doing than to just stick with my own personal way and accept the fact that I'll probably never be able to read sheet music for piano. 
 
My hobbies are mostly just artistic things. I've done a lot of drawing, a few years of music and a couple years of theatre. I'd say I'm probably best at drawing since I've been doing it the longest, but I've never really done anything big like a painting or a sculpture and more just doodling on paper. Despite these being my main interests, I'm still very hesitant to make an actual career out of them, so I don't think I really have much more to say on this topic unfortunately.
As interesting as I found the concept to be, I've been having trouble with the project you've given me. I can't really find anything from my town interesting enough to me to make a song about, nor do I really know how to express feelings through music. I don't want to just ask you to give me a different project, but I think I just need a bit more to work with, like a specific musical element to include or something. 
Though I'm struggling with that, I started working a demo of mine that I'm thinking of turning into my capstone piece. It's not really like any of the music I've mentioned to be an influence. It sounds like a theme song to space or something. Again, I don't know how to share it through this messenger since I don't know if I can just send it through a link or if it's more complicated, but if I do figure it out, I'll show you. 
 
Talk to you later

Hi Cohen,
 
How nice to hear from you again! Yes, after you listen to a lot of music, naturally your brain develops your own distinctive musical sense and tastes, which sometimes allows you to predict the coming notes of a song. Also, music is a combination of sensibility and rationality. It contains expressive and emotional features, as well as internal structure and rules that you can follow. I think it’s very impressive that you have heard so many different kinds of music, started composing at such a young age, and continue enriching your hobbies.
 
You know surprisingly, I have read it somewhere that the dropout rate of piano students could be from more than 40% to sometimes 60%. Many piano learners refused to touch the instrument again once they had achieved a certificate or passed a certain level. Funny enough, most of my friends who learned piano all shared different yet similarly awful and pressured pasts. Some have given up for years once they have reached the highest level of the piano grading test because of their parent's expectations. I once wrote a story about my abusive piano teacher at the university for a course, and most of my classmates resonated with my experience. If you like I am happy to send you the short story as well. But yeah, piano learning could be painful. It’s not the most interesting instrument, I know. But it could be helpful for your composing!
 
Oh thanks for trusting me with your honest idea! You are right, a music degree costs a fortune. My parents absolutely agree with you, since they paid for my bachelor's. I understand that you prefer to develop your musicality first. Do you have other hobbies other than music? Would you like to turn one of your hobbies into a career? You don't have to figure out everything so soon. To tell you the truth, I don't even know what I want to do for a living. And I am 25! Everyone should be given time to do some inner search until they find their passion in life. However, speaking from my experience, college life forever changed me. This is a great opportunity to read widely and seek ideas from other fields of study. You have all the resources and a platform to express yourself and exchange ideas with other minds. For students like you, I'm sure that you would be a great candidate in many fields. 
 
I'm just thinking out loud. You don't have to agree with me. Let me know if you would like to continue on this topic or not. I don't want to put on too much pressure. This is, after all, a question for you and you only. 
 
Have you decided on the theme for our music program? Is there anything you would like to share that you have in progress? Message me if you need any help or have any questions! 
 
Take care,

Hello Rosie
I watched the video of Bobby McFerrin you sent. In fact, I actually watched it in my band class all the way back in grade 10. I find it interesting how something like scale patterns are something we subconsciously learn overtime as we casually listen to music. I also find that it's a skill I'm slowly developing as I learn piano and theory, where I can almost guess where the next note of a scale or chord will be before I actually learn it.
 
As I learn more about music history, I listen to more music from other parts of the world. I like how instruments from places like Turkey have unique notes that aren't commonly heard in western music, and I also like when instruments from other parts of the world are incorporated into western-style compositions (like the sitar being included in some of the more experimental Beatles songs). I usually get interested in experimental bands because they often do this, but it also works vice versa, where I can get into music from other parts of the world because of how they're incorporated into music I listen to. Basically what I'm getting at is that I'm personally more familiar with different styles of music than most, but I still understand that it's not like that for everyone, which is why I'm more hesitant to recommend experimental pieces to casual listeners. Calling music a language is also interesting just because it makes me realize that in a way, it's almost like I've learned another language on my own without even realizing it. 
 
As for my future in music, I don't really have anything planned. A career in music is very expensive, so it's not something I really want to jump into unless I know I'm both capable and passionate enough, and as much as I enjoy listening and learning about music, I'm not as passionate when it comes to playing an instrument. Composition is something I'm interested in because in the modern age, I can make an entire song with equipment that I already own like a computer or a keyboard, and I can make it independently. But I became a musician pretty late in my life compared to most. I took piano lessons at a young age, but it didn't really click with me and I gave up pretty quickly. I think I'd want to a lot more time to develop my musical abilities before I try to make a career out of it. For now, I just plan to stay here and work more until I find a post-secondary course I'm comfortable with. There's only one college in my town with a very limited course selection, so I'd also probably have to move somewhere else for anything post-secondary related, which I'm not eager to do. Right now, music is pretty much just a hobby to me.

Hi Cohen,
Thanks for your message. I’m glad to know that you’ve made a few demos on Garageband! That’s awesome! I think your idea about the capstone is achievable, as long as you decided what you would like to put into your work.
Horns! Cool! That’s a very innovative and unique choice for your music. I really look forward to it!
Plantasia gives me a very groovy but at the same time bizarre feeling... in a good way of course. Apparently,  the whole album of Mother Earth’s Plantasia was designed for plants! Suddenly it makes more sense to me haha. I don't know about plants' preferences. I wonder if anyone has experimented with their growth to see if they thrive better. 
Speaking of your post-secondary pursuit, I realized that we barely touched on that topic. Do you have anything in mind? If you have plans for university, what would you like to study? If you prefer to work first, what kind of career are you looking for? I remember how much you enjoy learning history, composition and music theory, could it be any one of them?
Have a nice weekend!

Hi
 
I wish I could say I did something interesting during my break, but nothing comes to mind. I started playing Animal Crossing again, went on a few walks and met up with a friend, but that's all I can remember doing. 
I probably should have mentioned this sooner, but I haven't really made a full composition yet. There a few things I've made on Garageband that I'm proud of enough to share, though I don't really know how to work with files and such so I don't know how to send them to you. For my capstone composition, I've discussed it a bit with my teacher, and my goal is just to create something around 2-3 minutes long with some sort of digital software. I don't have my own laptop currently, but I'm hoping to get my hands on one soon, and once I do, I'll worry about what software to use. 
Recently I've been listening to this one piece by Charles Mingus, my favourite jazz composer, which I'll put a link to here (and no, I don't know what the title means)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbdx-jR3a8U 
I think this song blends a more traditional style of composition with jazz in a way that I really enjoy. It's also a pretty long song, but I think just listening for a few minutes should be enough to get the idea of it if you're not interested in the whole thing.
This makes me want to try composing something that may sound sort of like this in the sense that it fuses music from older and newer eras. I think it mostly depends on what instrument selection is available on whatever software I end up using. Something like garageband has a good selection of instruments used in rock or electronic music, but if I wanted to write a part for horns, I'd probably have to use something with a better selection that what garageband has. Perhaps I could also create a classical-esque piece using electronic sounds (similiar to Mort Garson's Plantasia, if you've ever listened to that). Overall, I think the idea of making a song out of old and new styles of music is a good starting point for me to find more songs that use this idea (I can think of quite a few just off the top of my head).
I haven't watched the video you sent me yet. I think I'll just have to come back to that topic in my next message after I've watched it and put some more thought into the topic. Right now I'm focusing on getting ready to start my capstone and other schoolwork that I need to catch up on, sorry. Though I do agree on the idea that music is a ""universal language"" in some ways, which I can talk about more in my next message as well (right now I'm just trying to finish this before class ends).
When the year ends, I think I will stop using the mentoring program. I'm mostly using this for my capstone, and I don't even really expect to continue in music studies in post-secondary, So I don't have much of a reason to keep using it.
Talk to you later,

Hi Cohen,
 
It’s so glad to hear from you! Since you have been home for two weeks, have you done anything interesting? Like read a nice book, watched a show or played some video games? Yeah the weather could have been better. Don’t worry, summer is on the way! It’s slowly approaching, but on its way.
 
Thanks for your recommendations again! Yeah this time I think I prefer A Walk To Remember. I can’t tell how much I love the sound of the saxophone coming out in the second half. May I ask what kind of music you usually compose? Do you usually come up with a theme first, then add choir progressions and extend your theme to a whole piece? Have you thought about writing a chorus or an ensemble that has multiple parts? I always admire people who put down the ideas they have in their minds in the search of inspiration.  
 
Interestingly enough I also wonder how come people develop different musical tastes and sometimes prevent them from taking in new music. I think there are roughly three points—I don’t want to turn this letter into academic research haha.
 
First, the melodic expectation of course. I have read a study about how people from different countries react differently to a same piece of melody and have various predictions regarding how the rest of the music goes. The truth is, immersed in the Western music structure, you might find yourself lost when you hear, for example, traditional Indian music. You might not “understand” or get enjoyment out of their music, not because of the language barrier, but because of lack of cultural knowledge and more immortally, the fact that your brain does not respond to certain kinds of music if it’s not familiar with it, which could increase the difficulty for you to appreciate it. Hey speaking of which, there is a video of Bobby McFerrin, a great musician and his interaction with the audience I would like you to watch. Are you familiar with the pentatonic scale? How do you respond to something musically new? Wait till you watch the video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk
 
The second reason could be the “language issue.” What’s your stand on the saying “music is a universal language”? You know I wrote a paper in regard to this arguable statement? Undeniably, music and language do share interlocking elements, such as they could both be exclusive, they can both be used for communication, and they both, in a way, have syntax, grammatical structure, and sentences. So if you take a look at music from a linguistic perspective, it gets more interesting. Think of us as two people who cannot communicate through the language of jazz, I think it helps to acknowledge that not everyone understands jazz/classical music/Western music.
 
These are my theories. You raised a fascinating question. I encourage you to dig deeper! 
 
One thing I would like to discuss with you is that, accordingly, our last interaction will arrive soon. If you wish, we may continue working through the program, or chat about music, life, post-secondary, even movies… anything, when the class is over. I’m happy to keep our mentoring relationships active. If not, that’s fine as well. Let me know!
 
No rush to your project! The deadline is not a problem. My intention was to give you a little push onto the track of composing, which is something you always wanted to do but I don’t know if you have started yet. So I think this could be a great opportunity for you to take the (first?) step. If you don’t have anything in mind, you can always get inspiration from your favourite songs or bands, and see how their songs are structured and what you like about them.
 
Enjoy your week! Hope the weather gets better.
 
Cheers,
Rosie",4:10AM April 4

Hello again,
Spring break was alright. I didn't work a lot, but the weather wasn't as good as I was hoping, so I mostly just stayed at home. I have thought about starting a band, but my lack of variety when it comes to playing instruments makes me think it's unlikely. 

I'm glad you liked most of my music recommendations. Vulfpeck in particular is a band that I'd recommend to pretty much any musician (that seems to be their biggest audience). I think they strike a good balance between being accessible and very skilled and creative. A couple other songs I'd recommend are ""Tee Time"" and ""A Walk To Remember"".

I'm also kind interested in hearing about how you didn't understand one of the songs. It makes me realize how the way I see music is different based off what I'm used to listening, and I'd probably have the same reaction if you showed me some classical piece I've never heard of.
For your warm-up project, I'm having a bit of trouble finding motivation to actually make music, but that's probably because I've been bored at home alone for two weeks and I haven't played in jazz band for a month. I should be playing again on Tuesday so I'll see how I'm feeling after that. I think I'll just prioritize making something simple to present to you, and if I like it enough, I can work on it more as my capstone project.
My approach to learning piano is a little unusual. I haven't learned anything from anyone else in terms of how to actually play the piano, and I've really only been learning music theory more than anything else. Since I'm mainly focusing on composition, I haven't learned how to play songs as much as I've learned about different chords or scales, which I've learned either through random YouTube videos or just from personal discoveries. I guess that's how I'm trying to challenge myself with it.
 
Have a nice week

Hi Cohen,
 
How’s your spring break? Did you do anything fun? My friend and her band invited me to see their show next week and I really look forward to it! They have started this band 10 years ago. I have always wanted one myself!!! Are you thinking about starting a band with your friends perhaps?
 
Thank you for your awesome tips! You know what? You’re absolutely correct, Blue Rondo à la Turk is my favourite piece out of the three songs you recommended. One thing I found about the form of this rondo interesting is how playful the song is structured, with a repeatedly appearing theme and continuedly changing chorus. I love the series of variations it presents. It’s going in my playlist!!!
 
Oh and I love the second one as well. It’s so chill and funky. The middle part of the song is absolutely dazzling in terms of a funny baroque and fantastical merge. It reminds me of Bach’s fugue I used to play, but with way less austere counterpoint and an emphasis on the colour of the layers. I wonder if that part was an original work or if they had it re-adjusted to fit in the song. Plus I just love the arrangement of the instruments. Wait I think this one is also my favourite. Now I have three favourite jazz songs including Angela! Thanks to you!
 
By the way, I am listening to their Simple Step when I am writing. I followed Vulfpeck on Spotify haha!
 
It might sound weird but when I listen to God Bless The Child, I was more, nervous than relaxed. As the following lines are always supremely unpredictable for me. I wasn’t sure what to “grab on” as the lack of a stand-out theme for me, and I don’t know how to “understand” the piece as I don’t get what the song is about… if that makes sense. This song is a very unique combination since seemingly they put all the individually structured sections together. I failed to find the correlation. I think I need to clear my mind and abandon my established mindset before entering the world of jazz.
 
I do appreciate your recommendations and your suggestions for a jazz newbie like me. I’ve learned a lot from you. It’s a whole new world to see out there. Thank you Cohen!
 
As for the activity, if you want to turn it into a capstone project, no problem! You don’t have to decide now, as long as you pick something that brings you passion and motivation. Honestly, I am very happy that you found it interesting, proving that it was well worth the effort!!!
 
Oh I also wonder how you continue learning the piano. Are you taking courses online? I did piano performance at university. I can’t make any promises, but if you have any questions or encounter any difficulty in regard to piano practice, I’ll try my best to help.
 
Let me know if you have any ideas about our next activity and the topics for discussion. It doesn’t always have to be music related. Feel free to shoot me a message. 
 
Enjoy your weekend!

Hello,
Don't worry about the late response. I actually started spring break the day after I sent my last message so I wasn't really expecting to do anything school related anyway. During all the spare time I've been having fun just learning more about playing chords and scales on piano. The jazz band went on hiatus a while ago so the band teacher could focus on the musical theatre production he was also directing, so I haven't actually played the trombone for at least a month now. 
 
My tip for getting into beginner's jazz is to probably just check out an artist on a streaming platform and listen to their most streamed songs. I think the ones that most people will check out are their more simple or relaxing ones, even if they still have some more complex/experimental pieces (though this isn't always the case). I'll provide links to some of my recommendations:
https://youtu.be/mZNEEKtA8hU (Not sure if the link works by default or if it needs to be copied and pasted sorry)
This is a song that has been covered quite a lot, but I think this is one of the more popular instrumental covers. It's pretty mellow and minimalist, so it's easy to listen to, but it still sounds incredible to me and I even considered it to be my favourite song for a while. 
 
https://youtu.be/3RGoXZvuUBw
 
This one's more on the funkier side. Though they're very modern, they were the first band that I became passionately interested in, so I thought they were worth sharing. I thought you'd like this song in particular because of its classical influences. 
 
https://youtu.be/vKNZqM0d-xo
 
Admittedly, this one's not very simple. It starts off in an odd time signature and a bit of a complicated rhythm and later begins experimenting with meter changes. However, despite this I think it can still be enjoyed from a casual perspective. Though it's complicated, it's not too chaotic and is only played by four instruments. I also thought you'd like to hear something piano-based and this was the only artist I could think of. 

That's all I'll give you for now. Let me know what you think of them.
Also, related to your warm-up activity, I know it's only supposed to be a warm-up, but the concept of it seems interesting enough that I'm considering making it my capstone project, since I didn't have a specific plan other than to make some sort of composition. I'll think about it more though.
talk to you later

Hi Cohen,
 
Thank you for your response! I apologize for the late reply. I lost track of time while trying to design a musical activity that could be fun for us.
 
Your story is very interesting to read. Unfortunately, after almost twenty years of classical music training, I have always found jazz hard to understand because I have a very different mindset and musical expectations while listening to jazz songs. I think my favourite song is Angela (Theme From Taxi), and I like it because it’s not a typical jazz song. Would you mind recommending several jazz pieces you like, you know, beginner-friendly? I'd love to hear about your list :)
 
It's amazing that you’re learning piano by yourself. I tried learning the violin on YouTube and it wasn’t easy. I don’t know how long my roommate can stand me making the sound like constantly stepping a cat on its tail. From what I see, you are very self-regulated and courageous!
 
I’ve noticed that you’re trying to make music on GarageBand, and your ultimate goal is to continue playing the piano and composing. Therefore, I came up with an activity that encourages you to continue composing. I hope you’d enjoy it! 
 
Warm-up Activity 
Introduce your city/hometown/community/school to your friends! 
Purpose: 
Explore the city landmarks (it can be your hometown, a local store you like, your school, etc.) through soundscape composition. Think about how you would like your audience to know about a place you love or have a lot of memories at. 
Method: 
You may use the attached websites or music apps to record “the sound of your city.” Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the listed apps, you can also keep track of your work by making the vocal and/or instrumental part(s) and recording it with your phone. 
Your work can be a combination of the sound your gather in the city and a simple melody you compose. Or you can find a beat and a musical style you like, and then create a demo. Or, go bold! The world is your oyster. 
Length:
It doesn’t have to be long. Even 8 bars would be fine. 
 
Anchor Texts
Since you have an interest in music-making and composition, I would like to recommend several websites/apps that allow you to record your own musical ideas. Feel free to explore these websites/apps!
 
GarageBand (Recommend)
You can make your own collaboration of audio. It’s beginner friendly. Try mixing the soundtracks of different instruments! (Requires Mac to download.)
 
MuseScore 3 (Recommend)
You can write down your music score here. Try to create your first music sheet! 
 
Soundtrap (Recommend)
You can create your own musical projects and podcasts.
https://www.soundtrap.com/home/creator/projects
 
Bandlab 
It’s a music platform for you to record songs, remix, and collaborate music with others.
https://www.bandlab.com/
 
Music Tech Teacher (Recommend)
It’s a website about notes, rhythms, musical theory, etc.
https://www.musictechteacher.com/music_learning_theory/music_learning_theory.htm
 
Discussion Questions (Remember to tell me!)
How would you like your music to be structured? 
What do you want your audiences to learn from your musical work? 
What is the most challenging part of this project?
 
Completing Conversations (track the progress)
Don’t worry about the deadline! You may take 4-6 weeks to finish this program. If you need more time, let me know! 
In the meantime, I would like you to:
1. Keep me updated so I can track your progress weekly. You don’t have to share your work with me if you’re not ready yet. But please let me know what you are working on and the progress you make every week. 
2. Please let me know if you need any support or have any questions. I hope you can have fun through music making! 
3. Don't forget to answer the discussion questions! 
4. Let me know which topic you would like to have a further discussion with me! If you have any ideas about the musical program you would like to work on, send them my way!

Hi Rosie,
I'm doing well. Playing the trombone is fun, especially in jazz, though honestly, I only became a musician due to coincidence. My middle school was very crowded, and so there wasn't much flexibility when it came to picking an elective, so when I randomly got placed into band, there wasn't a good chance of getting out. Fortunately, around the time I started, I was also begining to get into jazz and funk music of the 60's-70's, which got me interested in signing up for jazz band for my high school years.
I wouldn't say my experience playing as a musician has directly influenced the music I listen to, though I find myself enjoying jazz compositions in particular after learning jazz trombone and learning about soloing and such. I like discovering new music constantly, mostly by experimental artists. It's also really fun to find very obscure artists. Currently I'm going back to my roots and listening to more jazz and funk that I didn't get into right away, or listening to my old favourites again now that I have the musical knowledge to better understand the compositions. My favourites from these genres are John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Sly Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic, though my absolute favourite is probably Stevie Wonder, and that's just for a select few genres from a certain era.
Aside from music itself, I also like learning about music history, such as the evolution of a genre, or just the story of a particular band, even if it's not one I really listen to. My wide knowledge of different bands despite my young-ish age seems to impress my music teacher. That being said, I can still only play the trombone well, and I'm only in the beginning stages of learning piano and composition. I've been teaching myself piano just by playing around in my spare time with the knowledge of basic music theory I've learned from band class and on my own. I've also used Garageband on my phone just to make short compositions and learn about melody and chord progressions.
My plan for my capstone is to keep learning piano and composition enough for me to make a complete song for my presentation, which is why it's the only information I could really think of to put on my profile. So whatever you have to say about that I'd love to hear. Since you like both classical and modern music, I'm wondering if you've learned about any similarities they might have with each other from a composition perspective (if that makes sense). I'd also be happy to answer more questions you have about my interests in music, since it's not something I really talk about in-depth with my friends who aren't as interested in the composition/history side of music as I am.

Hello Cohen,
 
It’s so great to hear from you! How are you doing? What is it like to be a trombonist in a jazz band? This is so cool! I’ve only played the piano, ukelele, a little bit of flute and French horn I’ve learned from YouTube (definitely not my thing), but never the trombone. I would like to hear more about your musical story! 
 
I’m into many music genres. It’s probably related to my musical background. I started to play the piano when I was very little. I played the piano and the French horn in the orchestra. I was also part of the choir at the university. So it’s not surprising that I like classical music and symphonies right? Maybe people might consider it boring but I think for people who understand musical form structure, it’s really fun to analyze!! If you are interested in pursuing a higher degree related to music, I encourage you to try exploring basic chord progression and music form structure. It could be a bit boring at first, but it’s a great stepping stone for you to be able to compose one day, as well as to gain a better understanding of music. One of my favourite artists of all time is Brahms. If you look into his works you can see how amazing he combines both rationality and emotions in a certain music frame. Let me know if you would like to have a further discussion in regard to this topic! 
 
Other than instrumental and choir music, I like pop songs as well, except for rap songs I guess (sorry…). For example, I like Coldplay. I’m going to their concert in September! I also like Green Day, Pink, Linkin Park, and Maroon 5; I also like a lot of Disney songs, the old Taylor Swift, Lauv, and Adele. And this is only the short version of my answer. 
 
I found it amazing that you’re trying to pursue a musical degree or something related to music in the future. It’s a wild field; anything is possible for a talented young man like you. I would like to know more about your interest and what you would like to talk about in the future! 
 
I would love to learn more about the musicians who inspire you musically and in life! And I would like to know more about your pursuit after high school. I think perhaps we can start with something small. Perhaps you could pick out the questions you like and tell me about them?
 
Discussion Questions (all optional)
Tell me about your favourite musicians!
Who are the musicians who inspire you musically and in life?
Tell me about your experience in the jazz band! 
Do you have a favourite song? If you could, what kind of music you would like to recommend to your friends?
How did the musicians inspire you? In what way did they encourage you to pursue your musical dream?
Have you worked on any musical projects in school? Did you enjoy it?
What makes you want to learn about educating adults with mental disabilities?
Have you thought about getting into the educational field?
Are you still practising piano and guitar? Do you have a favourite piece?
 
Feel free to write to me anytime when you have a question or a topic you would like to talk about! Looking forward to talking to you again!

Hello, and thank you for being my mentor. I'm not entirely sure what we'll end up talking about, since I don't have any current plans for post-secondary, but I am interested in communicating with someone who has studied music. Since we're matched because of our interests in music I'm wondering what music you are into, and more specifically, what your composition influences are?",9:26AM March 14
