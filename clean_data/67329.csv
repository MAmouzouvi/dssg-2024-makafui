Wow it's been such a crazy week for you! I really can tell that you have a genuine passion for helping others and I'm sure no matter what you do in the future you'll be able to make a big impact on society. Congratulations on getting into UBCO!!! It's okay if you don't have any entrance scholarships for UBC - it's actually pretty difficult to get one. The only person I know from my school that got a scholarship for UBC ended up going to Harvard, so you can tell how competitive those are. However, Carleton's $16,000 scholarship would be insane and would definitely help you pay for a huge chunk of your tuition when you're there. It's probably also slightly cheaper to rent over there? I can't say for sure because I haven't lived there obviously. I will say that UBCO has an amazing campus. It's absolutely gorgeous and I know the people there have a pretty close-knit community because it's such a small campus. I don't know much about Carleton, but the scholarship is honestly something that's really hard to give up and I think the only reason you should probably choose UBCO is if you have a huge preference, otherwise the scholarship makes me think Carleton is really worth it. I really hope you get the BC Excellence scholarship as I really do think you just deserve it. It's super cool that your best friend is also getting it, and it must be a little difficult to compete against each other but it's nice that you guys are still working on it together. I'm not surprised at all that you love your job - it seems like such an amazing opportunity, and the fact that everyone loves you as a tutor is really rewarding. I totally get having issues between something you are actually interested ub versus something you could actually see a career in; for example, my friend was also really interested in music but obviously he didn't see much of a future career in it so he ended up still doing a little bit of concert band in university, but then pursued a more practical major.
 Yes, the new gension patch is definitely insane. The new Liyue area has me so excited because my favorite part of any game is always the exploration, and just seeing all the new landscapes and mechanisms is so exciting for me. I'm glad that your finals ended up going super well, especially your 100% on the chem final (congrats again!)! It's also insane that they made you guys dissect a pig fetus. I think in high school the most they made us dissect was a cow heart, which was not as bad in my opinion.
Don't worry too much about being rejected from your dream program, you'll get used to being rejected from a lot of things in the future. Especially in university, I've been rejected from numerous programs and even clubs, so you get used to it after a while. When I was applying to university, I actually applied to a bunch of the Ivy Leagues and ended up getting rejected from practically all of them, but in the end I really enjoy being here at UBC as well!
I heard about the CN Genshin stuff going on and was not surprised at all that Genshin is once again not really doing anything for the anniversary. I think they know that regardless of what happens, no one is really going to quit the game, so they don't really care anymore. However, it's awesome that you started playing Honkai! I've been playing it for a while now and unfortunately I think it is a very fun game but the amount of content in it is relatively short, so finish it pretty quickly.
I hope you get better soon. It's really such a difficult time to be sick! I would hate to be sick right now as I'm so busy I haven’t had the time to take a break at all. Last week was just super chaotic for me as I finally got my acceptance into the UBC physics graduate program, Alberta physics program, and an invite to Calgary medical school so I've been panicking trying to figure out everything and start practicing for the interviews for Calgary. I'm still waiting on Alberta med as well so fingers crossed that I also get the interview there! I decided to not tell my parents for now and surprise them by just flying back and knocking on their door. I think that would be hilarious and I can't wait to see this surprise on their faces. In addition, I just have so many assignments and marking to do as a TA. My Honours thesis is also heading towards its end and I really need to start getting things done so I'm definitely panicking about that too. The final thesis is supposed to be around 50 pages long, so I have no idea where I'm even going to begin. Graduation is just such a hectic time and there are so many things I have to consider and work out so I will try my best to reply to you as soon as possible, but I may be a little slow in the next few months. Good luck on everything!",6:20PM February 5

ITS OKAY LOL
I guess this is how it's gonna be now...life is crazy hectic lately...I can't even imagine how it is for you. 
A big step forward in your life is coming and I bet it's stressful...BUT I wanna hear all about it! 
Take ur time to get back to me...don't think of it as a chore, but rather do it when u want to do it. Yk?",7:57PM February 3

Hi Mentee!
Now it's my turn to say I'm busy haha... I promise I'll reply by the end of this weekend. It has really been quite the hectic week",3:11PM February 3
Mentee commented at,"10:39PM February 1 
HI MENTOR! 
It is finally time...althought I am actually in bed sick with a fever right now...I did promise. So much has happened holy. I am not gonna remember everything. 
K first off let's rewind, I don't even know what the last thing I told you about was. Let's start off in the first week of January. I presented my capstone! That was super fun. I also watched a bunch of my friends capstones which for some reason made me unexpectedly emotional?? It was weird. Anyway, then the end of the semester came around, and I got a bunch of thank you texts and cards and hugs from the students I tutor and it was super wholesome. It made me feel like I actually did something to help the world for once...I am not completely useless. Tbh that's kinda my goal in life...to help the world. Which is what i've been writing on most of my college and scholarship prompts. Like for example one of the most cliché prompts has been, ""what is most important to you in life and why?"" If I truly answer that with upmost honestly, I genuinely want to help the world. That is most important to me. Now whether that's a good answer or not idk. What I do know is that I am happy with what i've been submitting. It makes me sound determined and confident. Driven like a leader. 
Im ranting...typical 
Speaking of scholarships and universities...first of all...I got into ubcO! So that's pretty exciting. I think housing applications are open so i need to apply asap. Remember when I had a big rant about how I don't wanna apply to ubc and then you told me to and I didn't listen. Well now here I am, with no entrance scholarships cause I applied late but that's okay. I'm not sure if I wanna go there yet. It's in my top 2. Carleton and ubcO. I've got to decide between those 2 soon. I've been doing more in depth research into housing and tuition fees and stuff. Not to mention that I do have a minimum of 16,000 dollars scholarship from carleton which is crazy...it's like they are desperate to have new students. Like that's a lot of money. 
Lemme know what you think about that. 
Ok ok and then there's scholarships. So there's the BC Excellence Scholarship which the way it works is there's one nominee from each highschool nominated by the school district admin after reviewing your application and they get to actually apply for the award. I applied and I just got called to the office this week, and then they took me into the back rooms of the school which was kinda scary. I have been in this building for so many years but never knew there was a whole maze of rooms behind the office lol. But anyways the principal was like hey ur in the top 3 but we can't choose between you guys so we are making you submit the second part of the application which is like a sort of kind of resume experience type thing. So i recently submitted that. I also found out that my best friend is one of the other 3. We can't figure out who the third person is tho. So we actually worked together on our applications for the second part lol. Now we are both patiently waiting. Wish me luck lol. 5 grand would be insane. 
Ooook what else....uhhh my capstone is not done yet! Just because I presented it doesn't mean it's over. This is just the beginning. I actually got a text today that I got referred to from one of the parents whose daughter I tutored last semester! So the business is growing! It's amazing to see my dream slowly come true. The kids words that i've received are honestly just speechless. Idk how I could ever repay these people. I do absolutely love my job i've gotta admit. 
Yk what else I love...Music! Which is why I actually have 2 music classes in my schedule this semester. It's a crazy story. Okay so I have physics 12 first block. Then an independent directed study in music theory. Then music composition and production 12. And then calculus 12. Okay but the interesting part is the story behind my independent study. So basically after I presented my capstone, during my careers block I basically had an open block to work on assignments and stuff. I had no work to do lol and i was bored until one morning after my band class ended (we have band 7:30-8:30) my music teacher who is also the best person to ever exist and also my best friend and also one of my biggest role models slash inspirations gave me the idea of coming to the band room during my open block to do some theory! Cause i've always wanted to learn more theory. It is actually my dream to pursue music post secondary but i didn't apply for it because i don't see career in it. It truly is my dream tho. Anyways yeah so during my open block I had 1 on 1 theory lessons with my band teacher....and then...the semester came to an end. And on the last day he gave me this idea...he told me there's a thing called an independent directed study, where u do like your own study in something your interested in but someone in the community kind of is your mentor and stuff. It's super cool. And he was like Yeah i'll totally do a one on one theory block with you...So i asked my counsellor who didn't take much convincing and here I am! I now am living my dream life. I go to band in the morning. Then physics. Then theory. Then after lunch music composition and production which is one of the coolest classes ever once again with my band teacher the absolute goat. And then calculus. It's like my dream schedule. It's everything I could ever want. And it works out great because I don't have any academic classes left to take besides physics and calc. I took grade 11 and 12 courses in grade 10 and 11 so I got a little bit ahead. Which ended up being super worth it cause now this last semester of my life is amazing. I'm learning like first year university theory so I am getting to study music without having to go to university. It's a dream come true. 
Ok what other stories are there...My fever is killing me rn. 🤦‍♀️
OH THERES XIANYUN AND GAMING AND CHIORI. HOOOOLLLYYYY HOYOVERSE IS COOKINGGGGG. Lantern rite is gonna be a blast. I just hope I don't miss the event. I've been taking a bit of a break. I haven't logged on in a few weeks. I was super busy. All my finals went super well though! 
OH! I DISSECTED A FETAL PIG. IT WAS CRAZY BUT ALSO RLLY DISGUSTING AND IT MADE ME QUEASY. 
 
Uhhh I aced my chem final which was epic. 100 PERCENT LES GO. and um yea! 
There's gotta be so many scholarships to apply to. Please let me know if you know any! 
OH ANOTHER THING. My dream program...remember it. Yeaaaa they rejected me. I tried my best but i guess it just wasn't meant to be. I am not really too disheartened about it. To be completely honest I never fully believed in myself anyway which I know is bad but oh well. I'm excited for the future regardless. 
Besdies a longer rant about genshin i've probably covered everything. Have you heard about the CN Genshin stuff going on and how everyone's unfollowing genshin on twitter. I found that pretty funny. 3 intertwined fates for what like 4 years of genshin is actually pathetic lol. I don't rlly care but I wouldn't mind some better rewards. SPEAKING OF. I STARTED PLAYING HONKAI. Not much but a few hours. I'd say I have like 15 ish hours in the game? I got welt as my standard 5 star. He's pretty cool. I haven't had time to play in weeks tho.
I think I pretty much covered everything i've been wanting to tell your for weeks. I'm gonna go to bed because my forehead is dying lol. If i forgot anything i'll probably spam you some other day lol. 
YOUVE GOTTA TELL ME ABOUT UR LIFE TOO. It's gonna be interesting. 
Anyway okok bye bye

Hi Mentee!
I completely sympathize with you, finals are genuinely such a pain. I actually don’t think I ever had to do multi part finals other than for my IB exams in high school, so it sounds like you’re going through a much tougher time than me! Don’t worry about finishing the Paying for School unit if you’ve already gotten all the marks, especially if you don’t feel that interested. I’m completely fine with you just writing a long rant about what’s going on haha! Honestly, I’m just stressing over my Honours thesis at this point since it’s only 4 months until I have to hand in like a 50 page document and do a presentation on it, but I feel like I’ve barely accomplished any research 😭. There’s just so much chaos going on right now that I wish I could just skip 4 months into the future, so I don’t have to suffer through an entire semester. Anyways, good luck on your finals and don’t give up, you’re so close to finishing!",3:03PM January 24
Mentee commented at,"11:42AM January 23 
MENTOR...
Im not gonna lie it's not looking too good rn. These finals are brutal...I have never had to like study or like worry about tests in my life...but like why do they have to make everything all at once. I have like 4 finals that are multiple days long all consecutively in the same week every single day.
This is probably normal for you but it's a first for me. I'm trying to fight through lol. My english exam is literally all week. I dunno what my grade is gonna be on that but I just finished up part A and B. Part C is an in class essay and idk how i'm gonna do on that...
I finished my chem exam...that one was pretty easy. The bio one is wednesday and friday. 
I an actually so sick of this. 
I am sorry for complaining to you lol, if I do the paying for school unit it's gonna be this weekend... The term ends on monday technically. Although on my assignment sheet I have a 40/40 for e mentoring, so I don't even think we have to do another unit. Ngl I don't wanna do it BUT I SO BADLY WANNA WRITE A HUGE MESSAGE ABOUT STUFF! I swear I will at some point...I SWEAR.
Anyways, yea...trust me, you'll know when I am done everything. I will definitely let you know. FEEL FREE TO SEND ME ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME! I'm sure there's cool stuff happening in ur life!",11:42AM January 23

Hi Mentee!
No worries at all! Good luck on your scholarship applications, assignments and finals! Omg haha don't worry, I do not have high standards at all - I literally cannot do any type of creative activity (singing, drawing, dancing, etc.) for the life of me. Seriously, I don't have a single creative bone in my body, so I'm always super impressed with what you're doing! We still have until the 26 so you have time to finish things up later if need be, for now definitely focus on your schoolwork",12:48PM January 17

Merry Christmas Mentee! I hope you had some great celebrations with your family today! I went home for the holidays as well with my younger sister. I'm really honoured that you think so highly of me and you're really just such a great person to talk to. I would love to stay in contact even after the program is over! I believe we're allowed to just keep talking on here aha. Definitely keep me updated on what's going on and I'll let you know where I end up too! Once again, I hope you have an amazing Christmas break :)",11:00PM December 25

MERRY CHRISTMAS MENTOR! 
I hope you have an amazing christmas and a happy new year too! Hopefully you have the opportunity to see your family! My brother is home for the holidays and it's the best when he's here. 
During Chrisrmastime I often find myself thinking of gratitude. Gratitude in the people around me, and the people who have been positively influential on me. People who have had an impact on me. People I look up to.
I don't know you very well, because i'm not allowed to lol, but you are still one of the coolest people I know. It probably doesn't seem like it but I look up to you in many ways. You are a very amazing person. Keep being you!
Thats all I wanted to say lol. Have an absolutely amazing Christmas! :)
PS: I'm absolutely 100000% down to stay in touch after my semester ends. I find it absolutely bizzare for someone to talk to someone regularly and then just completely cut off ties with them and never ever talk again??? That's insane. I don't know how anyone could do that and it wouldn't hurt, like jeez. I'm sure i'll spontaneously text you if something interesting happens. PLUS I need to know where you end up in 4 months lmao. AND I need to tell you about my first year of university! I'll probably ask you for advice on random things too. You gotta tell me about stuff too! 
Anyways...for like the 100th time Merry Christmas, ur the best.",3:29AM December 25

Sounds good, I've opened up the Paying for School Unit! Unfortunately once the semester ends (I believe at the end of January), you won't have any more E-mentoring assignments to do. However, we can still remain in contact on here if you'd like! There's no problem in continuing to talk about school, advice, etc. even after the program is over :)",12:10AM December 23

Hi Mentor, 
As per my usual routine, I am supposed to write to you on Sundays, and although I had all the time in the world to write to you today, I admittedly forgot and spent the entire day procrastinating not just ementoring but also all my other assignments and my chemistry unit test which is tmrw.

It's funny actually and I kinda feel bad cause like majority of my class hates the E-Mentoring thing lol. I am so excited to read your messages all the time and then all I ever hear is my classmates just dreading and complaining about it.

LMAO NO WORRIES, I completely forgot to mention that I ended up deciding to just pull for Baizhu as well since Furina really needs a healer and I got him in another 20 pulls ahah.

Hi Mentee!
No worries, I am literally in the exact same boat as you except I'm applying to post-undergrad programs. I finally managed to submit all of my med apps this week but that just means I need to get started on my grad apps soon 😭.  I honestly did not apply to many scholarships so I have no idea but I applied to a bunch of universities across Canada and even the US so I could definitely give you advice if you need it! It really depends on what you're looking to do in and after uni, because that can heavily affect which programs at what universities you want to apply to. I can kinda speak on some of the engineering and science programs out there. Have you identified some possible subjects you might want to study? Also, I would love to hear about your capstone project when you have time.
Honestly, I have seen so many memes about Neuvillette and am so tempted to pull but I just have to get Furina so I have been saving like crazy. I think I have about 150 pulls saved for her and her weapon so I'm really hoping to get both. I totally agree about the Archon quest, it was absolutely phenomenal and so fun - it's insane to see how far Gneshin has come. I really wish I could play more because I love exploring Fontaine but I have to play on my gaming laptop and I get lazy because I have to sit up and play as opposed to lying on my bed and playing on my switch. What's really funny is somehow I have two Staff of Homas without Hutao and I just use them on my Xiao and Xiangling. I hope you can get it soon too because it is definitely such as broken weapon.
Yes, I will unlock the From Rural to Urban unit and we can get started on that. When it opens up, you'll see a new chat area appear, kinda like the one we're currently using. Try working through the first few tasks and let me know if you have questions regarding anything!",3:27PM October 5

AHHH HI MENTOR,
I have been incredibly busy and definitely stressed too. Everywhere I go and everyone I talk to, all they talk about is university applications and scholarships and bursaries and different programs and AHHH. Then I am doing work on my capstone as well (i kinda wanna tell you about that at some point) but yeah. It's been a week but i'm alive. I'm sure you are wayyy more busy than me especially with applications and stuff. 
I think I wanna start with the rural urban unit. So do I just wait for you to unlock it? Im gonna assume so...
I have been like really overwhelmed about all that responsible stuff and everything I should be doing. If there's any scholarships and stuff that you think I should apply for please let me know. Or if you have any advice or stuff you wish you did or something. I'm also trying to figure out how to write application essays and stuff and I am kinda struggling but I believe. 
Anyways let's talk about less important stuff for a second to be happy. I GOT NEUVILLETTE!!!! AND HES ABSOLUTELY INSANE. I am also 50 pity on the weapon banner and I have like 2 weeks still so that's exciting. Even if I lose 50/50 I should hopefully get staff of homa and I am literally a Hu Tao main so that's a win win for me. I played the 4.1 archon quest and I won't say any spoilers but...HOLYY IT WAS GOOD. Anyways yeah...let's start with the rural to urban unit.",3:50PM October 4
Mentor commented at,"10:02PM September 27 
Hi Mentee!
No problem at all! Don't worry about replying to me immediately, obviously other things can get in the way and you gotta prioritize those first. Also, happy belated birthday! Your friends sound awesome: a hand-crocheted Totoro is so impressive and adorable haha. On the note about graduating: if you make the effort to stay connected, it won't be an issue at all. I have known two of my best friends since kindergarten and we separated back in high school, but I still keep in touch and visit them whenever I can to this day! 
And honestly, with how many similar interests we have, I wouldn't be surprised if you knew about most of my interests at this point hahaha. I am also so excited for this version for Genshin since the new area looks so fun and the Archon quest looks so interesting. I'm so glad you have guaranteed for Neuvillette; I'm saving for Furina and unforunately I do not have guaranteed so I have over 120 pulls saved for her to make sure she comes home ! Hopefully you can get him early and pull for his weapon too because from what I've seen so far he looks absolutely broken. 
And yes, I was referring to Star Rail! It's honestly super fun too but I can see doing dailies for both be slightly annoying haha. It's a slightly less time consuming game in my opinion so that's why I play it on the side. Lastly, another cool thing I did (related to last pic) was go do research at the world's largest particle accelerator over the summer! It's called CERN and it's located in Geneva. Here's a picture of an actual accelerator known as LEIR. 
Also, if you want to get started on one of the modules, you can choose between the following: From Rural to Urban, Career Exploration, and Adulting or 2 other ones of your own choice!",10:02PM September 27

Hi Hi Mentor! 
Sorry I read your message on sunday but I haven't been able to respond. Today is my birthday! So, for my final picture originally I couldn't decide what to do, but then after my birthday I thought i'd share what my 2 of my amazing friends gave me. Both of them really like to crochet so one of them made me a totoro to hang up on my wall (which I absolutely love so much and also she got me totoro chopsticks which was epic) and my other friend crocheted me a little no-face plushie from spirited away (which I also ABSOLUTELY love and it lives on my bed now). Anyways yeah, I just chose these pictures because i'm happy and really grateful for my friends. I don't have many friends but the ones I got are real ones and I love them lots. They are amazing people and I am kinda scared to graduate cause what if I don't keep in touch with them. I will definitely miss them all. 
Ok let's stop being emotional...How about we talk about the fact that YOU PLAY GENSHIN! Right when I thought we couldn't have more things in common. I also play genshin! I wouldn't say I mean anyone in particular but I have a great hu tao build, ayaka build, and raiden build too. Neuvillette came out today (ON MY BDAY) and right after I write this message i'm gonna go wish for him. He's guaranteed for me because I lost 50/50 on lyneys banner ( I GOT DEYHA :( I want to cry) So I really hope I have enough primos to get neuvillette hopefully I get him early. Anyways fontaine is absolutely amazing. Have you had time to play the archon quest because so far it's absolutely insane.
On the other hand, when you say honkai you mean star rail right? I downloaded it when it came out and I know that it's quite popular now but I just haven't gotten around to playing it at all yet which is kinda sad but having to do daily commissions for 2 games at the same time everyday is kinda annoying and I kinda wanna just play one game at a time. But, I heard the game is absolutely awesome! 
Now, let's talk about the picture you sent...THAT IS THE COOLEST THING EVER. Like, I understood absolutely nothing in the picture but working at a project for Canadas particle accelerator is like the most inspiring thing ever. You are actually so cool. That is definitely something that I would wanna learn more about in the future.",9:13PM September 26

Hi Mentee!
I also tend to sleep super late haha even on weeknights. Honestly it is so impressive that you're part of a local band, I couldn't even imagine doing that because I have absolutely no affinity for music haha! I totally get your mom's frustrations but I bet she's super proud of you too. It's super cool that you're so passionate about music as your hobby, sometimes I feel like I seriously have no hobbies outside of gaming.
I am definitely planning on getting back to Tears of the Kingdom eventually, but currently I am very preoccupied with a different game (Genshin/Honkai) and a lot of applications as I am graduating university this year. Super excited to head to Gerudo town after!
Also, you are definitely allowed to talk really informally! I'm not your teacher or anything ahha, just a fellow student who happens to be a couple years ahead in life. I'll let you know if there's anything that is off-limits but trust me hobbies and interests are definitely not part of that!
For my next photo, I chose a photo of the current research project I'm working on, which is called DarkLight. It's basically a machine that is trying to find evidence for dark matter! The project is based at TRIUMF, which is Canada's particle accelerator, right beside UBC. If you ever decide to visit, you could totally go on a tour there!",11:39PM September 24

Hi Hi Hi,
 
As I am writing this it's 1:41 am but it's friday night so it's acceptable...Okok here's the next picture I chose. It's a picture of my new drum kit I got this summer. This corner is very special to me. I call it my drumming corner. It's like my happy place, I just hop into this corner and vent all my frustrations on my drums. I like to say it's a healthy way of dealing with stress...but my mum would say otherwise because I often give her headaches from drumming so loud. 
 
Anyways...I chose this image because once again it expresses how important music is in my life. When i'm not playing music, i'm listening to it. My life revolves around music. I am the drummer for my highschool concert and jazz band, I am part of a local band in my town called The Ring System, and also our highschool does an annual musical for the community and we are very well known for it...Last year on opening night we had a full house! I am also the drummer for the pit band for our annual musicals. 
 
Now let's talk about the epic stuff. You need to find the time to play more tears of the kingdom...it's literally the best game ever! Also, I absolutely love your ghibli soundtrack choices. I approve. Castle in the sky is absolutely godly. And, yes I also get distracted by lyrics so instrumental is always so nice to listen to (especially when you are emotionally attached to some of the songs and they really make you get in your feels). 
 
Oh and also I had a slight concern. I was gonna ask if it's okay for me to be talking like this. Am I allowed to talk to you so informally like this and ask about silly things that I find interesting? I don't wanna get in trouble for accidentally doing something i'm not supposed to. I watched the video and did the quiz and I know the important dos and don'ts but if I ever do something i'm not supposed to please let me know because it's not intentional. I'm just really excited and have so many questions because you are genuinely so cool and I can't wait to get to know you so we can be epic friends!",12:27PM September 23

Hi Mentee!
This is actually so cool, we share so many interests! I also started playing Tears of the Kingdom over the summer but unfortunately got a little too busy so I only got through 2 of the bosses so far (currently trying to finish the Goron boss).
It's also so cool that you love Studio Ghibli music because I really like it too! I think my favourite are probably Merry Go Round of Life from Howl's Moving Castle, A Town with an Ocean View from Kiki's (but honestly the entire soundtrack from Nausicaa and Sky Castle are phenomenal). I usually can't listen to music when I'm studying because I get so easily distracted by the lyrics, but Studio Ghibli music and classical stuff works since they're instrumental!
The photo I chose is this new habit I recently started where I am trying to record my mood everyday just to see how my life changes day by day. It also encourages me to reflect on what happened everyday which is really nice. I tend to write down some notes as well so I can summarize quickly the important things that happened that day so hopefilly I can be reminded of it in the future when I look back at the entry!",5:32PM September 22

For this first image, I chose a picture from my Apple Music replay. It is a screenshot of the original soundtrack from the Studio Ghibli movie: Princess Mononoke. The reason I chose this image is because it symbolizes the impact that music has on my day-to-day life. Music means a lot to me. As you can see, I have listened to this ost many many times. When I am doing homework, or want to relax, my go-to thing is listening to classical music and soundtracks. That type of music really helps me focus and just makes me happy.",2:54PM September 21

Hi Mentor! Nice to meet you! My name is Mentee. I am super excited to be working with you for the following months. I read your profile and I was squealing with excitement. You are so incredibly talented! There are so many things I need to know right now. The Chinese instrument you play (I forgot the name but I have seen it in videos before) is so cool. Also, you have a Nintendo Switch! I have one too! The most recent game I played was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Anyways moving on....I am going to start the first assignment assigned by my teacher. She has asked me to choose between the photo swap and the poem assignment. I have chosen the photo swap option. I am going to send each image separately and include a few-sentence explanation because I am MOSTLY sure that is what I am supposed to do.",2:31PM September 21

Hi Mentee!
I am your mentor Mentor! I am currently a 4th year student studying Physics at UBC. I noticed that you have an avid interest in math and science; I used to also study math and am still pretty knowledgeable about that major so let me know if you have any questions! It's also really cool that you're into teaching as I have also been teaching for many many years (in mostly math). 
Let me know which unit you would like to work on first and I'll open it up. I look forward to working with you over the next few months :)
Start here",9:16PM September 20
