Fingers crossed that all goes smoothly with your bloodwork results, too!
Update on my bloodwork; Most of the tests I searched up the other night, most of them were kidney/liver test I think, but everything was good and well. How was yours?",11:45AM January 14

Happy holidays and hello again!!! 🎉🎉🎉 I am back from Cancun and also experiencing hectic post-holiday re-adjustment-to-routine-ness, but all around it was very lovely and I'm glad to have been gone for a bit -- and also to be back to enjoy some peace and quiet on my own again, lol! How was your Christmas? Did you do anything special to ring in the New Year? Any resolutions for 2023? :D
Howdy, you too! Hope you had a good time, Cancun sounds pretty hype! I've never been there myself, but if my family and I are still planning on vacation, then we might either go to the Middle East to visit my mom's side of the family, or we might go to Europe :p My Christmas was okay, we mostly just stayed up and slept in late haha. I got an Asus Chromebook lol. Umm, that's a good question, I don't think I have any resolutions in stone for 2023 from what I know of lol. At least not now!
 
Q1: On health things: I'm only half-surprised that it was so backed up in the ER because of flu things... I'd never gotten a regular flu shot before this year (although obviously I've had, like, four COVID shots haha), but my strategist told me that it was a really bad strain going around -- I guess the natural consequence of that is that more people are ending up in the emergency room, but I was really hoping that our infrastructure would at least be more capable of handling that sort of influx by now, what with the years of pandemic-ing??? Seems not. And thank you for your concern, I promise I'm healthy!!! The bloodwork was a one-off order because I switched doctors and the new one was kind of suspicious of my (experimental) transgender hormone therapy, but it actually ended up being no big deal and I never technically showed up for the blood draw, lol. The only real concern I had was whether or not I was getting my vitamins, because I've never had those tested (and those of us with ADHD statistically tend to be deficient in certain ones??? not sure why that is) but I've been meddling with my diet on my own time anyway now that I'm trying the whole vegan thing, so I'm confident that the multivitamins I'm taking would cover my bases there anyway. All of that to say, a big hullabaloo about nothing, thankfully!
A: Yeah, influenza is been going around not only where I live currently, but all over I'm pretty sure last I checked. Good to know, glad you are! My mom talked to my doctor and he said everything was fine. I just do not like bloodwork in general, but it is probably for the better. Oh, I guess I've switched doctors around 3-5 times? I lost track at this point lol. What is transgender hormone therapy and what was it like? Hullabuloo? Haha.
Q2: On Sugar Shack: I've never heard of this, but it sounds really tasty!!! I feel like every town has one local holiday that makes it special. For me, back when I lived on the Island, my hometown did a big annual thing called Light Up around Christmas where a bunch of volunteers would get together and decorate the entire town -- every building, every tree, decked to the nines -- and then sometime around winter holidays we'd have a big day with a market and a parade where we'd all count down to someone plugging all the lights in at once... it was really cool, and if you end up being in the area for the next one, I highly recommend it! ;)
A: Oh that's cool, I think I've heard of something like that lol. It's similar to what my hometown does -- there is this event in December called Winterfest whereas some people do performances on a portable stage like singing Christmas carols (yesssss, I know!), and mostly bands and choirs perform as well! And there is snacks and hot chocolate!!!!
Q3: On flight delays and sickness: I'm glad to say that I somehow dodged ALL of the flight delays, but everyone around me was in absolute havoc for the whole trip because of the state of airports, ngl -- my partner booked his flight home to Florida on New Years Eve and he ended up waiting twelve hours in the airport, getting on and off planes, until he entirely ditched his airline and bought a whole new ticket to get back in time??? It was a whole thing. The most unpleasant thing I did was sleep overnight in the Toronto Airport, but I very much planned for it, so genuinely cannot complain. But I feel you on being sick -- my mum had a cold that she gave me the moment I arrived in Cancun, one of those deep hacking ones that make you test for COVID (negative, thankfully!) and it's been over a week and I'm still under the weather from it... being sick is no joke, you need your rest!!! I'm sure it was frustrating on your end to miss a bunch of school along the way on top of it, too -- but as long as your teachers are understanding and you prioritize your health over gunning all of the remaining homework at once, then I've got faith you'll be able to catch up! QwQ Fingers crossed that all goes smoothly with your bloodwork results, too!
A: Oh, that's good! I heard that flights were still delayed/cancelled and people were still stuck as I've been reading recently? I don't think I've slept in an airport, not really sure lol. Uh-oh, that's not good. Hope you're recuperating! Good that the COVID test came out negative! Yeah, that's true! They were pretty understanding about it, cooking was cooking and guitar was guitar haha. My mom talked to my doctor and he said everything was fine. I just do not like bloodwork in general, but it is probably for the better.
Q4: On the States: It was a cool experience!!! And I've never been to Seattle either, but I'm sorry to hear that life got in the way for you (it really do be like that sometimes) and I hope that you get the chance again someday -- if it's anything like Vancouver up above it, I'm sure it would have a lot of cool stores and stuff to see! Before visiting Dane, I'd only been out to California a couple times to hang out with a previous partner of mine and to check out Universal Studios and all that... and as far as trips go, I feel like the jump from Canada --> places almost the same as Canada in most respects isn't too much of a jolt (even if California was also uncomfortably hot, lol). It's architecturally kind of the same place, just with different accents and money and Cultural Vibes(c). Definitely worth getting out to as many different places as you can, though!
A: That's nice. Nah, it's fine, it is what it is lol. That's cool, Universal Studios is pretty popular! What'd ya see there? Yeah, I can say that California is hot year-round haha. That's true! 
Q5: On having your own place: I can say with absolute certainty that having my own space to exist in is one of the biggest steps I've taken in life to Be An Adult(c) and come into my own, so to speak, and personally I love it! It is nice to have the freedom to listen to what I like, to eat what I like, to make my own routine choices... you really can't imagine what it's like to have that much control over your existence until you move out, honestly, and I did it pretty late all things considered, since I didn't end up living on my own until the start of my Masters degree -- my parents lived close enough to my BA school and wanted me to stick around and save school money, so it made sense at the time, but I also didn't really know what I was missing until I got out here, you know??? With that said, it is hard being at such a distance from everyone; I'm hoping to end up closer to the family for my PhD, one way or another, just to feel like I have more people in my general vicinity. 
A: Yeah. But honestly? It depends on your parents too, because parents have their own way of parenting. One thing if parents are like, ""Okay so-and-so, since you're an adult now, you should already have money saved up to move out, for university classes and what-not."" Yeah true, it's nice to be closer to family so on holidays and stuff, they don't have to drive to you or you don't have to drive to them lol.
Q6: On Zoom meetings: Apparently there are Zoom meetings coming up!!! They're both admittedly at awful times for me -- one's in the middle of a day where I've got tons of stuff to do, and the other is in the dead of night for some reason haha -- but I'm gonna see if I can make it to the night-time on on the 16th and try to stay conscious through it! Maybe I'll see you there!!! :P
A: Oof, I feel ya. I'm not sure if I will be in class at the time or not, but I guess let's see what happens lol. Can't wait to meet you virtually haha!!!

Hey, sorry for the late reply, it's mostly gonna be a hectic week and Christmas Eve and New Years' Eve are gonna be two of them lol!! I know that you're on holiday, but Merry Christmas!!! 🎄🎉
Q1: On health things: 5-6 hours??? I wish I could say I was surprised as much as horrified! Unfortunately, the public health system is so backed up rn that it's not necessarily a shock... but I'm really glad that you got in, in the end, and that you've gotten the antibiotics you need! That's gotta be worth the wait. QwQ As for needles, it was far from my first one, but I've had a life-long phobia of the things that's made me break down and have panic attacks every single time I get vaccines or bloodwork -- which, as I'm sure you can imagine, wasn't super convenient during peak COVID times! -- so I'm really glad to see that all of my practice with meditation/deep-breathing/etc is paying off in helping me to keep my cool with them these days. I still get really nervous for the few days leading up to shots, but hopefully that goes away in time, too!
A: I think so, I don't really remember much but it was somewhere around there. Yeah, it was really busy there because turned out most people who were in the waiting room had the flu and it has been going around but I'm starting to fully recover which is good! And thanks! Oh that's not good, hope everything is going well with you. I didn't know you did bloodwork too. I guess most people do it now. Deep breathing/meditation is good. Whatever helps you beat the fear of needles though!
Q2: On Carnival: Honestly, this sounds pretty awesome -- and now that you mention it, parts of this sound familiar from my French class in high school... we might have done a project on it too at some point! Although I didn't know they had dogsledding, that sounds like so much fun!
A: Oh that's cool! I did something like it back in middle school in Grade 8, but my family and I mostly did activities and stuff in an event called ""Sugar Shack."" It's an event that runs in my hometown every year around February. That's where I tried ""toffee on a stick"" for the first time haha! Yeah, from what I researched, dogsledding was mentioned! Yeah lol, Québec is pretty cool when you think about it in a glance haha. 
Q3: On being excited for Christmas: YES!!! I haven't been this stoked in a while, honestly!!! My last couple weeks have been an absolute mess of doing grad school applications, but I'm almost through them now and I'm ready to take an actual break! It's gonna be a wonderful time catching up with my partner and my family and getting some natural vitamin D for the first time in months. QwQ Which reminds me, I should let you know that I head out for that winter trip to Cancun on Thursday and I'm not sure if I'll have reliable Internet over the holidays, so I probably won't be online until I get back to Saskatchewan a few days after New Years (I think the 4th? but Air Canada has been shifting my flights around a lot so it could be a couple extra days in either direction, honestly???). So this'll probably be my last message for a couple weeks -- but I hope you have the loveliest of holidays and that you get all the family time in the world!!!!!!! Once I get back you'll have to let me know if you got any cool gifts... and also if you want to do any more of these program units next year? I see from your profile that you're interested in learning how to combat procrastination, so maybe you'd be interested in looking at the Strategic Studying unit? They're all open for you if you wanna snoop!
A: Thanks a lot! Good to know -- hope you have fun in Mexico!! Yeah, I have heard that flights have been delayed or cancelled due to winter weather -- hoping people get to places safely! Oh yeah, I have been having procrastination especially since I was home sick for a while and probably missed a lot of school (I am doing better now, all is well, I am currently just waiting for the bloodwork results to come in) 
Q4: On Florida: I have been, once -- I went earlier this year over my spring break to visit and got to stay with my partner and his parents for a week or so! (Which was physically bigger but socially more cramped, haha.) It's a lovely place, but a bit warm and muggy for my liking... though going there after living here with pretty much no humidity is a nice change of pace?
A: Sounds like a cool experience! I haven't been into the States yet, but I was supposed to go to Seattle for the summer around 2019, but unfortunately it never happened due to personal stuff. But it happens  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q5: On whistling during chores: Can confirm that this is a thing that I do -- although now that I live in my own place, I more often just get to crank the music and sing along without having to limit myself to only whistling (so long as I don't annoy my neighbours!).
A: Haha, beware of the neighbours! Oh congratulations on your own place! It probably feels nice, hey? Crankin' the music and just dancing around haha! Whistle to your heart's content haha!!! (even though the neighbours lol, I guess it feels like spinning and throwing a baton in the air repeatively!) Happy whistlin'! 
That's all from me for now, but happy holidays Segués, and I'll catch you again in 2023!!! Stay warm out there!!! :D 
Thanks you too!! Happy holidays!!! 🎉✨",1:12PM December 25

Q1: Catching up: Oh dear!!! I'm sorry you've been under the weather -- did the bloodwork give you any answers, at least??? I recently had my first needle EVER IN MY LIFE that I didn't cry about and that was very very exciting, but I'm still a bit iffy at the concept of drawing blood, I think. And hey, don't congratulate me yet, I'm still doing the paperwork and we'll see who accepts me (but thank you for the massive vote of confidence)!!! QwQ
A: Yeah. Actually, I was in the hospital for 5-6 hours yesterday. And apparently I have to take antibiotics. And my mom and I did not get the results back but it could take a while. So was it your first time having a needle? Oh yeah, paperwork is tiring lol. 
Q2: On belonging: I very much agree!!! I've definitely gained a lot by being willing to be myself despite the moulds that folks have tried to put me in, and it sounds like you've got a really good perspective on it too -- your self-confidence and determination to be authentic will take you far!!!
A: Yeah, I guess I learned a bit after living in Canada for 16-17 years lol. Thanks :) I appreciate it! 
Q3: On staying healthy: Honestly, a dietician is such a cool idea that I've never thought of??? Really, you'd think that idea would be way more common, considering how ubiquitous the act of eating is for literally everybody on Earth, but it's never occurred to me to just... ask a professional what's best to eat. Power to you my friend! I recently started getting interested in veganism, too, so that's a new idea that will need a bit more research before I can figure out how to incorporate it healthily... and hey, if mind-reading was my secret superpower, you'd think I'd know how to read my own, too -- so that's gotta be out! :P
A: Actually, I was recommended to see one (I forgot why.) Oh that's good! I guess it's good to take a break from meat once in a while.
Q4: On living in cozy spaces: Quite a hassle sometimes, but also well worth the fun!!! My apartment is, uhhhh... a bit larger than a living room, but I guess that's subjective? It's like, one large room that has my kitchen/bed/desk area, then a lil hallway off the back that leads to a small bathroom -- I wanna say it's just under 300sqft, if that means anything to you? A good amount of space for one person who knows how to keep their stuff organized, but when my partner visited from Florida last year it was pretty cramped!
A: Oh, that sounds a bit cozy! I hope you're doing okay with the small space! Have you been to Florida?
Q5: On flowers: Yes!!!!! Hibiscus are so pretty -- they make me think of vacations in Mexico! QwQ
A: That's so cool!! 🌺
Q6:  On Beaver Tails, etc: Yo!!! I actually think that's basically the same thing as where I used to buy them?? It wasn't really a whole restaurant, per se, more so an outside set-up at the bottom of a ski hill that felt kind of like a fairground booth but a little more permanent because they never packed up and moved it around? Picnic-table fare, essentially. And I've heard of Carnival, although I've never celebrated -- what do you do for it?
A: Oh, yeah. I actually thought it was a chain restaurant (kinda like Dairy Queen.) I don't think I remember much since we did it in middle school, we learned some history behind it, and I think we just did some activities in general. But for the actual Carnaval de Québec, there's dogsledding, ice canoes, skating, making snowmen, snow forts, and winter sports. (I did some research on it lol.)
Q7: On decorating your door like a present, which I did NOT know you could do but I suddenly absolutely love: That sounds like SUCH a great display ngl -- I might have to do that for my apartment door if I can find some wrapping paper!!! And oi, -10 can be pretty chilly depending on where you are! It's surprisingly pleasant out here because there's low humidity in the air, but I'd be shivering if I was back home in BC!
A: Yeah, my mom thought about it when we were decorating a while ago lol! My mom used  some kind of ribbon and decorated it as a wrapping paper bow!
Q8: Advice for cold winters: This might be a little extreme because I'm getting very used to the -30-and-lower temperatures of Saskatchewan haha, but if it's going to get REALLY cold and it's an experience you plan to have over and over again (because these can get expensive, you'll wanna make sure you'll get your use out of them!), I highly recommend a down jacket and good gloves (or many many layers of clothing if you don't have these)! I've also found thermal longjohns/undershirts really helpful (they're, like, sorta stretchy pajama-material pants/shirts that you wear under your regular clothes that keep the heat in? makes a great difference for me when I need to walk to work!) and to keep your face covered as best you can, especially if it can keep your breath up against your face (which works two-fold because your breath warms up your nose and cheeks AND you don't have to breathe in a bunch of cold air, which I can find unpleasant and really dry around here -- I just wear my COVID mask outdoors or wrap a scarf around my mouth and nose, whatever's more comfy that day!). For super freezy days out here, I have a full-length jacket that goes right down to my knees, good winter boots that go right UP to my knees to leave as little of a gap as possible, proper gloves, a fluffy wool scarf, a touque, and then I pull my scarf up over my face and my hood down over my touque and keep as much skin covered as possible when running around outdoors; it's a hassle to take it all off again as soon as I get inside, but well worth dodging the frostbite around here!
A: Whoa! -30 sounds extremely cold! That's really chilly for winters there! Thanks for the advice :D
Q9: On whistling in public: All the time! Just less so nowadays, because the mask always gets in the way, haha. And TRUUUUE -- you'd be surprised how often I can whistle for a while and then try to follow the tune and figure out what bloody song I'm copying until ten minutes later it's like ""OH that one on the radio that I heard once years ago that was never relevant again, so glad I figured that out!!!""
A: Oh haha, forgot about the mask lol! I feel you on that! I did research the other day, and I found out that some people whistle while doing chores and stuff around the house.",12:20PM December 12

On living in cozy spaces: Quite a hassle sometimes, but also well worth the fun!!! My apartment is, uhhhh... a bit larger than a living room, but I guess that's subjective? It's like, one large room that has my kitchen/bed/desk area, then a lil hallway off the back that leads to a small bathroom -- I wanna say it's just under 300sqft, if that means anything to you? A good amount of space for one person who knows how to keep their stuff organized, but when my partner visited from Florida last year it was pretty cramped!
On whistling in public: All the time! Just less so nowadays, because the mask always gets in the way, haha. And TRUUUUE -- you'd be surprised how often I can whistle for a while and then try to follow the tune and figure out what bloody song I'm copying until ten minutes later it's like ""OH that one on the radio that I heard once years ago that was never relevant again, so glad I figured that out!!!""
On Beaver Tails, etc: Yo!!! I actually think that's basically the same thing as where I used to buy them?? It wasn't really a whole restaurant, per se, more so an outside set-up at the bottom of a ski hill that felt kind of like a fairground booth but a little more permanent because they never packed up and moved it around? Picnic-table fare, essentially. And I've heard of Carnival, although I've never celebrated -- what do you do for it?
On flowers: Yes!!!!! Hibiscus are so pretty -- they make me think of vacations in Mexico! QwQ
On decorating your door like a present, which I did NOT know you could do but I suddenly absolutely love: That sounds like SUCH a great display ngl -- I might have to do that for my apartment door if I can find some wrapping paper!!! And oi, -10 can be pretty chilly depending on where you are! It's surprisingly pleasant out here because there's low humidity in the air, but I'd be shivering if I was back home in BC!
Advice for cold winters: This might be a little extreme because I'm getting very used to the -30-and-lower temperatures of Saskatchewan haha, but if it's going to get REALLY cold and it's an experience you plan to have over and over again (because these can get expensive, you'll wanna make sure you'll get your use out of them!), I highly recommend a down jacket and good gloves (or many many layers of clothing if you don't have these)! I've also found thermal longjohns/undershirts really helpful (they're, like, sorta stretchy pajama-material pants/shirts that you wear under your regular clothes that keep the heat in? makes a great difference for me when I need to walk to work!) and to keep your face covered as best you can, especially if it can keep your breath up against your face (which works two-fold because your breath warms up your nose and cheeks AND you don't have to breathe in a bunch of cold air, which I can find unpleasant and really dry around here -- I just wear my COVID mask outdoors or wrap a scarf around my mouth and nose, whatever's more comfy that day!). For super freezy days out here, I have a full-length jacket that goes right down to my knees, good winter boots that go right UP to my knees to leave as little of a gap as possible, proper gloves, a fluffy wool scarf, a touque, and then I pull my scarf up over my face and my hood down over my touque and keep as much skin covered as possible when running around outdoors; it's a hassle to take it all off again as soon as I get inside, but well worth dodging the frostbite around here!",5:50PM December 11

Happy belated December!!! I still exist, I just honestly had a very unfortunate med change that grossed me up for a while -- feeling much better now!!! -- and my thesis and PhD applications and general school pressures are beginning to mount. I'm very happy to be in grad school and I wouldn't change it for the world, but it's a lot of work, not gonna lie. QwQ I hope you've been good as well!!
A: Thanks, happy belated December to you too!! That's okay, I am still a bit sick and ended up missing a few things here and there when I was sick at first and I have bloodwork coming up on the 9th. I'm okay so far! That's cool that you made it to grad school!! Congratulations :D
Q1: On finding home: I completely agree -- home is a big mix of factors, from the history of a place, to the history you make in a place, to the people you know and what the land itself means to you as you find your place in the ecosystem... I hope that you've found a place that feels like home to you, but if you haven't yet, I know you will! QwQ
A: Yeah, I agree. Sometimes you never know where you belong, and you don't have to blend in just to fit in with the crowd. That's what I've learned over the years in school. I haven't exactly found it yet, but it's never too late to find out and discover where you belong.
Q2: On class structures and COVID: I actually saw a lot of that myself when my university went hybrid in my last undergrad year -- not only did the pandemic itself create learning challenges (for folks who struggled with online/hybrid delivery and plague stress), but it also revealed a lot of learning challenges that I think we're still trying to figure out how to cope with (like the fact that 5 classes a day was A Lot(c) to begin with!!!). I'm watching my current university try to find that balance between returning-to-the-status-quo and acknowledging-that-the-status-quo-wasn't-the-best-to-begin-with-and-maybe-we-should-learn-some-lessons-from-the-pandemic-years -- we'll see how it balances out?
A: Oh boy, that sounds tough, I mean how it depends on how the school system works because every school system works differently lol. I guess it can balance out?
Q3: On healthy eating: Definitely recommend!!! I've slipped in and out of healthy eating in general over these past few years, but you really don't realize how much energy you're missing when you get used to eating too much junk food. I know that kind of makes me sound old, but like, I was stunned at how much better I felt, even at 24, just getting my vitamins and greens in and suddenly having a better outlook on all aspects of life... now I just need to start doing that with exercise again, because omg am I behind on that!!!
A: Yeah so have I! I second that, definitely a good way to stay healthy! I do need to start getting healthier and also I'm getting a dietician soon so that's a good start lol. But I always wonder how you know.. you're like a mind-reader. Is mind-reading your secret superpower?  
Q4: On building book nooks: Yeah, it's basically a mix of building-by-instructions with pieces that are made to fit together (sort of like Lego, but with fewer combinations and more splinters, haha) and straight-up glueing things in place. So you get all the fun of building but also the satisfaction of not having to know how to design something aesthetically pleasing... which for me is good, because I've never done a hobby like this one before and I always like to start off with a build-by-numbers sort of thing just to get the hang of the craft!
A: Oh that's cool! It reminded me of an archeologist when I think about it lol! Awesome skills!
Q5:  On paper-making: VERY messy!!! But fun if you have a lot of paper scraps and wanna make something that's totally unique (and relatively cheap to get into, if you get your supplies from the dollar store and already own a blender!). I just wish I had more space for it -- the paper-making doesn't take up much room, but the paper-drying where everything is laid out across my tiny apartment can be kind of a hassle!
A: Awesome hobby!! I have never done it before but maybe I'll probably do it in the future! Oh boy that does sound like a hassle! That sounds like a complex and cozy apartment! Is it small like the size of a living room?
Q6: On guitar and whistling: Yoooo that's great progress!!! I still don't even know the notes on the guitar honestly, I can learn A Song(c) if I memorize the movements but I don't really know how it works still? Whistling is much easier for me!!! And I whistle all the time, and I guess I'd say sort of freestyle? Although tunes I know from elsewhere (not playing at the moment, but like, the chorus of a song I like for example) tends to sneak in, so it usually ends up being a mishmash of ""notes i made up"" and ""song that those notes reminded me of that I'm now mixing in,"" haha.
A: Cool! Have you whistled outside in public before? That's funny! The moment when your favourite songs tend to sneak in and next thing you know, you're whistlin' them haha!! :D
Questions of the day:
1) What's my favourite drink during winter? Hot chocolate!!! Hot chocolate 100%!!! I have such great memories as a kid of going skiing on Mt. Washington back on the Island and we'd always end off with hot chocolate and Beaver Tails (not sure if you'd have seen a Beaver Tail place before, although I gather they're actually a chain restaurant, but if not, it's like a big deep-fried flatbread thing that they absolutely slather in chocolate and toppings??? I always got Reese's Pieces, it was THE best). Even now I'm finishing a mug while I finally check all my messages, haha! It's just a symbol of coziness for me, health be damned. QwQ
A: Yes!!! I usually have hot chocolate and it's freakin' awesome!! I did have BeaverTails and heard of it too but never went to the restaurant! The first time I tried them was a few years back at an event called 'Sugar Shack' so I'm not sure if you have heard of it or not lol. And also when I was in middle school, we would celebrate this event called 'Carnival' (it's a winter festival that takes place in Québec around February, it's pretty fun although I have been to Québec, I've never been to the festival itself!)
2) Do I like Christmas carols? I used to, when I was younger, but I think working in that grocery store job for six and a half years killed it for me -- they'd start playing them in November, and it would always be, like, the same ten songs, and after a while it drove me crazy! (With that said, my mum LOVES them, and so I always get kind of a silly smile when Christmas morning comes and she rushes to go blast music off YouTube and I don't think I'd ever be able to dislike them at that moment... just the overplaying of them the rest of the year!)
A: Yep, I feel you on that! The Christmas songs on replay can be nerve-wracking most of the time!
3) Do I like flowers? Yes!!! Although there aren't many around here atm, snow and all. My Grandma's garden back home used to be full of them and it was absolutely gorgeous, though. If I had to pick a favourite, I think I would choose hydrangeas -- because they can be all sorts of pretty colours and I used to have a surprising amount of fun dead-heading them when the garden needed tending to! Do you have a favourite flower?
A: Ayy, that's quite the adventure! Gardens are the best! Hydrangeas are fascinating!! My favourite flower is hibiscus!!
4) And how is early December-ing going for you??? Have you had any snow? Does it feel like holiday-time yet, or is that later into the month? (I always find my level of festivity depends on how excited everyone else is around me, honestly, so it feels later than usual now that I live on my own!)
A: It's going good so far -- my family and I decorated our tree and our door (we decorated the door like a present and we put our wreath outside too!) The snow is coming later this week actually! It was cold last week (around -10 or -11? haha!) It feels like the holidays came early lol!!",10:15PM December 5

This is what I have written so far: 
BCIT - You will need to also have to graduate high school (as you would in other universities/colleges.) 
UVIC - You will need to complete any health information science which includes earning the Bachleor of Science if you are planning to go into the science field.  
If you are planning to apply to any university, you will need to have graduated high school.",12:45PM October 29
mentee commented at,"7:00PM October 28 
The schools I've done research on is BCIT, UVIC and VIU. 
Oh okay! I wasn't sure what you were saying lol, it usually takes me a while to fully understand what you meant! Oof, my ASD lol. 
Good choice, it's nice to be closer to family lol. I am moving down with family to Vancouver Island next summer when I graduate :) 
Oh I'm sorry about that. You sound like a good friend, and there's always a rainbow after the storm 🌈
Yeah, maybe. I did not get much done with the word document due to my capstone lol. Are you sure you are okay with it? Just double checking. If so, I will see if my laptop is working and I can try and do my best and send it to you. 
Candy is always the best! And I usually watch Halloween movies with my family and it's scary and funny at the same time! We were actually watching Goosebumps last week and it had some horror but with some funny twists lol! So you're going as a plague doctor for Halloween this year? That's cool! Yeah, I like dressing up! I might be a pirate this year, but not sure! Oh haha, I guess maybe they sorta like Halloween? Not really sure! 
Oh that's nice! Piano sounds great, classic instrument haha. 
I have never heard of an ocarina! What is it? Is an instrument? Sounds super cool! 
Same goes for guitar too! Guitar is an awesome instrument! 
Yeah, country is not really the best, but it's okay I guess. But I mostly like pop, hip-hop, and some R&B. 
Whistling is great! I heard it's supposed to boost your mood I think lol! What kind of genre do you usually whistle to? 
QOTD: What do you like about winter?",7:00PM October 28
mentor commented at,"3:29PM October 28 
Good news!!! From the tone of the last email I got on this, I'd say you're not gonna get in trouble for taking that extra day to do the last activity; it sounds like your teacher is more interested in making sure that you're engaging with the program, and we've definitely got that covered, so don't panic! :D 
I'm good!!! Had a big chaotic week but everything seems to be looking up now -- and it's my cooking day, so I'm currently busy making a tourtière and some beef stew and chicken stirfry, which ain't too shabby at all!
1) Factors as in anything that would influence you to choose one university over another -- for example, it sounds like you're moving wherever your family plans to go, so I expect you'd be more likely to choose a university near them, rather than one across the country? Anything like that. For me, I was really concerned with seeing family, with the sort of funding I was offered, whether or not I would be comfortable with the campus culture, etc -- those were all factors that influenced my decision to come here, whereas for my BA, I just picked the university closest to where I lived because my mum went there and liked it and I could keep living at home! What that decision-making process looks like is different for everyone, and you don't have to tell me how you feel about every single item on the list, for what it's worth -- just think about which ones matter most to you!
2) Many many things! As I said above, it was really important for me to be close to family, for one -- and considering that of my two main offers, one was here and the other was way off across the country, I knew it would be cheaper and easier to get back and visit from Saskatchewan! Funding was also a big factor; this school offered me a major scholarship to make their offer more competitive, because they knew that I was looking at the other school that had a higher ranking, and that other school didn't secure nearly as much funding for me, so I knew I would be more comfortable here financially (especially as I struggle to work and do school stuff at the same time -- having a full-time physical job while doing my papers would be really hard for me to keep up on with my ADHD symptoms/time management, whereas having a part-time tutoring job just a couple days a week to top up my scholarship funding is really comfy!). But I would say that it was the community culture that really sold it for me -- when I had my interview with my supervisor over Zoom for Saskatchewan, it felt so much more friendly than the other school, like a place I actually wanted to be instead of one I just wanted to endure until I had a degree, if that makes sense? It's an unfortunate reality that a lot of really high-ranked schools can be way more competitive in terms of individual students -- as in, the people that you have to show up to class with and make friends with every day are less likely to be friendly/helpful to you sometimes because they all want to be The Best Student(c), which can make you feel more like you're enemies with everyone than friends, and I... didn't want that. I didn't want that as a student, I don't want it as a professor, and I don't see the point of going to university if I'm going to be unhappy in it. That was one of my biggest things. All in all, I'm really grateful for the choices I've made!
3) Oh, that's fair!!! If you want to write down all of the stuff you WOULD put into that document in a reply, I can copy/paste it into a word document for you and you can have it that way, if it helps! I'm not 100% sure if your teacher will check it regardless -- sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, so you might be able to get away with just saying all of the things to me and then I can vouch for us having discussed it if anyone ever asks!
Favourite things to do on Halloween: eat tons of candy, enjoy the lax social rules that seem to come with weird holidays like this one, and particularly to dress up as a plague doctor and stand very still next to extravagant Halloween displays, trying to get people to think I'm a decoration, and then move a little right when they've decided I'm not real. That's such a good trick. How about you? Do you like the dressing up aspect at all, or are you less of the costume type? It's one of my favourite parts but my partner doesn't like it at all, haha. 
I am a very good whistler and enjoy it very very much!!! I also took, like, ten years of piano lessons, and a little bit of guitar and ocarina. I haven't done much musically in a while, but it used to be a pretty big part of my life! Even -- the horror, I know -- very specific country songs because they remind me of days out driving with my mum, but it's certainly not my favourite genre, lol. I miss those radio vibes, though; there's something almost less 'magical' about being able to just put on any song you want these days, whereas when they came on on the radio and you were like ""omg I love this song, turn it up!!!"" it was a treat, you know??? Good times indeed. QwQ",3:29PM October 28

Hey, how you doing? Sorry for the late reply, was tired when I came home from school. 
Q1: Location of the campus (i.e. is it close or far from “home”, do you want to live in that city?)
A: I didn't think too far ahead yet, but I am moving with family next year.
Q2: Residence and housing options?
A:  I also didn't think about that yet, but hopefully I'll get it figured out!
Q3: Distance to amenities (ie: grocery stores, pharmacy, mall, etc?) 
A: Yeah, it would definitely save time going there and back lol. 
Q4: Food on campus and in the surrounding community?
A: Most likely, it depends if I want to cook my own meals or not. (Definitely not cooking on busy days though!) 
Q5: Exercise and recreation facilities on campus or nearby? 
A: Yeah, good to have them towards campus. 
Q6: Transportation options (ie: do you need a car?)
A: It depends if I learn to drive in the future or not. 
That's a lot of oppurtunities! 
1) Factors as in how the school works? Sorry just confused lol. 
2) How did you find out about the University of Sasketchewan? What interested you to apply? 
3) I do not have access to Word at the moment, but I'll try and do it tomorrow if you're cool with it. I'm not sure if it's due tomorrow. My laptop is also not in the best condition (hope I can get it fixed next year!) But I can try and find a laptop at school and complete it on time.

Oh, hang on, there's one more bit, I didn't scroll down enough!!!
5) Share with me: do you think you’ll be admitted into the program(s) you researched? Why or why not? And then I'll review your final document with all your research and see if I have any info or advice to help you succeed in your applications! 
And THEN we'll be done and good to move onto whatever!!! Thankfully nothing else will be in this kinda rush. And hey, I know it looks like a lot of annoying stuff to write down right now, but I actually think this is probably one of the most useful activities we offer -- researching for university stuff can be a really scary hurdle when you're doing it on your own, so I think it's good that this is offered as an actual discussion. I was really lucky that my mum went to university herself and was able to help me understand some of the confusing bits of university websites and course requirements and all that jazz, so if there's anything that I can make easier and less overwhelming for you, I'm happy to pay it forward!!! :D",11:59AM October 27

Okay so I had this message finished this morning and I could have sworn I sent it but now it isn't here and I can't find that tab so we are gonna do this again! Technology. :'D
For part 2 of this unit, the tasks are as follows!
1) Look at all of these factors (or add your own!) that might influence you in deciding on a school, and pick the ones that are most important to you in terms of making your own potential university choice:
Campus Location Factors:
Location of the campus (i.e. is it close or far from “home”, do you want to live in that city?)
Residence and housing options
Distance to amenities (ie: grocery stores, pharmacy, mall, etc)
Food on campus and in the surrounding community
Exercise and recreation facilities on campus or nearby
Transportation options (ie: do you need a car?)
Supports and Opportunities for Students:
Cultural Groups
Online learning opportunities
Financial support
Part-time work opportunities
Hands-on learning and/or co-op opportunities
Student support centers, academic advising, peer mentor programs
Accessibility Services & Supports (including mental health)
Campus Culture:
Extra-curriculars: athletics, clubs, activities
School teams and “spirit”
Social climate (“party” vs. “serious study” schools)
Workload expectations
Libraries and places to study
Student Government
Diversity of faculty and students
Size of the school – how many students, faculty to student ratio
2) Look through the list of schools you found on BC Education Planner (ie. when you go to the site that summarized all the different jobs and found the info on them, there was a section that linked to All the Schools That Would Teach You This Job -- that list!) and see which ones might be the best fit for you based on the factors you chose.
For example, if you're really looking for a school with a small faculty-to-student ratio (which means there's one professor to maybe 10-15 students, rather than one professor teaching 200 people at a time -- this can really change your experience of classes and how much assistance you feel you can ask for when you don't understand something!!!), then see which schools in each of your careers boast a small ratio like that! You can find this info on each university's website, or by researching the city that it's in, or by looking up testimonies from students who already go there to see what they say it's like!
3) Share your factors and most-likely-to-have-those-factors schools with me and we'll talk about them! You're also supposed to ask me one question about my experience in this area again, but I'm not picky about what it is -- whatever you want to know about school life is fine in this case, although if you wanna know more about how I researched my university options, we can get into that too!
4) Finally, they want you to list (in a word document/PDF/etc) all of the entry requirements for the universities that you thought fit your bill -- that is, what you have to do or have (in terms of coursework, grades, etc) to be accepted at each university; every uni website will have a page that lists these out! -- and then save that document to your portfolio with the green button to the bottom right of the text box! That makes a copy of it on the website so that your teacher can check on it if they want to.
... And then we'll be home free! :D",11:53AM October 27

A: (I don't know if you're talking about the job am currently working at or in the future.) If you're talking about my ""future"" job, then here's my answer: My ""average"" job is a computer network technician, you will need a ton of skills with computers, you will need to study computer science or any courses related to computers and you will need a diploma/certificate of training for any of the softwares studied.",8:15PM October 25

Thanks for organizing the questions Challen! Makes it easier to read them all lol. I will answer them Q&A style if you're cool with it :D
Q1: What is your 'dream job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
A: For my dream job, a graphic designer and you will need to apply for a degree (e.g., Bachelor's degree.) 
Q2: What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'dream job' (eg. school is expensive, this job's more popular in another area, etc)?
A: It requires a lot of schooling, (although you can also be self-taught), and depending on the school, yes, it can be pretty expensive. It is a little bit harder to get into the dream university.  
Q4: What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'average job'?
A: Once again, it requires a lot of schooling, a degree or a diploma and lots of skills as well. 
Q5: How do you feel about the qualifications for these two jobs? Are you excited for it? Anxious? Why or why not?
A: I'd say I would be anxious, because you never know the odds of the two jobs and what your schedule is like every day. 
Q6: Do you think each of those careers would be achievable fo you? Why or why not?
A: Honestly, if I get to my goals, it would be achievable because of how much I wanna aim for my goals and make sure to do them step by step. 
Q7: What do you think are three potential benefits of going to university (just in general, apparently)? 
A: You might learn some new things (things that you might've not learned while in high school.) It's also good for job applications (plus, it'll look good on a résume!) 
Work question for Challen: What do you at your job?",7:15PM October 25

Sorry for the late response, I was in class.
Hah, the folks' home. Sounds about right lol. 
I mean, Tim Hortons has been kind of the norm recently, it's a good spot to have coffee, donuts and hanging out with friends :D 
My dream places would be to travel to Spain, Australia and probably Seattle :D
Oh, I forgot about that! Things have been busy at school this week with grad photos coming up and next week is literacy exams, so not really excited for that :'(
QOTD: How do you like to jam along to your favourite songs?",5:55PM October 25
mentor commented at,"2:20PM October 25 
Everything's good in moderation, I suppose. QwQ
Oh, yeah, I know those small-town vibes where all you've got as a hangout spot is the Timmy's -- it was such a meme in my town that when I graduated from high school and did a valedictorian speech, I joked about our town's biggest attractions being the Tim Hortons and the old folks' home, haha. That's one of the nice things about city life, I've found -- there's actually stuff to do, even if I'm mostly a homebody nonetheless! If you ever get the chance, cat café is highly recommended. ;)
Dream place to travel isssss a tough one, honestly! I feel like I've already seen all of the things I wanted to, and travel isn't necessarily a bucket list item for me, so I'm not sure I have one! Do you have a dream place to travel???
(Grades reminder: we have three days left to answer those questions I left for you -- and to finish the second part of this unit once we're done that, too!)",2:20PM October 25

Welcome back and that's okay, I think I know where you're coming from! I have acid reflux and it's mostly mild whenever I go overboard with the spicy food lol! 
And thanks for clarifying, I have never heard of teenage asthma, but have heard of asthma in general I think!
Oh, that's cute! I've never been to a cat café! Where I'm living right now, we have café-type places like Tim Hortons, haha ツ
I am not sure, probably both? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

(And I mean, all job stuff is Survival(c) so you're technically not wrong on your reading there, rofl!!!)",6:09PM October 23
mentor commented at,"6:08PM October 23 
Okay, I'm back!!! 1) I am very weak to spice so I'm not big on spicy food honestly, 2) teenage asthma = asthma I had as a teenager, it's not a separate condition, I just grew out of it, haha, and 3) my favourite animal is, without a doubt, cats. Cats cats cats cats cats!!! Perfect little furballs, I love them so much and I'm very much due for another visit to the cat café down the road, it brings me so much joy. QwQ How about you? Are you a cat or a dog person (or neither or both, gasp)???
Also, five days left to get this unit done!!! Here are all the instructions for part one, once you've read the Anchor Text 1 ""What Education Do You Need?"" bit and all attached links:
1) Go onto the website they link with all of the career profiles and look up two careers -- your 'dream job,' or something that you think would be really cool to make big money off of (art, for example?) and one more 'average' or 'traditional' career (something reliable and distinctly average that you could do for money in the meantime while you're trying to set up for that dream job). Then take notes on what you'd need for each of those jobs in terms of qualifications/education. The Rules(c) say you've got to share all this and discuss some other factors with me, so I've made you a fill-in-the-blanks thing you can copy/paste into your own message back to keep you on track:
1) What is your 'dream job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
2) What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'dream job' (eg. school is expensive, this job's more popular in another area, etc)?
3) What is your 'average job' and what would you need to do to qualify for it?
4) What are three (3) things that might make it hard to achieve this 'average job'?
5) How do you feel about the qualifications for these two jobs?  Are you excited for it? Anxious? Why or why not?
6) Do you think each of those careers would be achievable fo you? Why or why not?
7) What do you think are three potential benefits of going to university (just in general, apparently)?
Once that's done, you just need to ask me one question about career-planning/school-planning/something on this subject; the anchor text above gives some examples, but I'm open to anything on the topic of work/school life that you're curious about!!! Then we can finish whatever part two of this unit is next, and then all of your graded stuff will be done and we can talk about whatever you'd like! I know it's a lot of hullabaloo, but we're almost there!!!",6:08PM October 23

And I guess I'm not sure either, maybe it depends because people have their own way of cooking and spicing food, if you know what I mean. 
And I'm usually a fan of spicy food (like butter chicken lol.) How about you? Are you a fan of spicy food or not really?",5:35PM October 22

And also, what is teenage asthma? I have heard of asthma in general, but I don't think I have heard of teenage asthma, sorry!",3:37PM October 22
mentee commented at,"3:33PM October 22 
I didn't think to mention humidifiers lol. You read my mind again :')
Yeah, yoga and Pilates are both good when you're not a big fan of vigorous exercises lol. 
And bulk-cooking sounds good, I will most likely try to do it in the future! 
Oh hey, that sounds awesome! Usually I go shopping with my family and we go to popular places too :D

Alright, this one's open for us! As long as we get it finished by the 28th, we're all good to go for your grades -- and I have emailed the admin to confirm that we wanna keep chatting and going through other units after that's done, too! I've gotta get ready for work over here, so I can't dive into the first set of questions for this unit just yet, but if you wanna explore them before I get back and give me your initial thoughts on any of it, feel free! :D

Dis- and misinformation",10:28AM October 22
mentor commented at,"3:37PM November 24 
On living in one place: I think there are some nice benefits to not moving a great deal, at least in terms of familiarity -- you come to know what ""home"" feels like and you know your community, eh? I kind of miss that here sometimes. But on the flipside, I also felt kind of stagnant where I lived, probably because everyone knew me and then I transitioned and still had to deal with everyone knowing me as I was previously and all of the weirdness that entailed??? And it's genuinely good to have some space to work out who I am in the absence of the life-long environmental influences of my hometown/etc. So I guess staying still and moving can be healthy in their own ways!
On cooking: Pumpkin spice latte cake sounds so good!!!!! I think I made pretzels once, but I've definitely never made a cake like that... jealous. :P It sounds like you're enjoying new hobbies early, which can be really refreshing if you've had A Lot of the Same Stuff day in and day out throughout the rest of high school -- good for you!!!
On questions: Yes, you're free to ask me just about anything, I think? With the obvious caveats that we don't share personal info, talk about doing illegal things, or discuss anything particularly inappropriate, and that I'm professionally obliged to tell people if you're in danger or if you're putting others or yourself in danger, all the basic ethical rules of the platform. But like, for real, I'm here to help you learn stuff about life, so if life is out there being spooky and unknowable and you want advice on something that isn't in one of the units, I'm totally here for it!
On Sri Lanka: Sucks to hear that politics have once again ruined good things... I'm sorry to hear that, but unfortunately not surprised. QwQ Admittedly I had to look up the particular district because I hadn't heard of that, but it looks lovely from the distance that the Internet provides -- I see a bird sanctuary and that's all I'd need! Do you remember anything from back when it was still 'nice,' or was that before your time?
On tutoring: I actually don't have a set list of clients! It's not so much a one-on-one thing like you and I are doing here, where folks get paired up and actually get to know each other; it's more like a drop-in thing where a few tutors are available to help with whatever a student brings in that day, and then we're just paired up for half an hour or so while whichever tutor knows the most about X topic helps the student work out the kinks in their paper, and then... well, maybe after that I never get to see that student again, or maybe they really like what I do in particular and make an effort to show up on my shifts when they need help with other assignments in the future, but for the most part it's a one-and-done kind of job. I still try to be personal with people, though -- I really feel like that aspect is lacking, particularly because of our random-drop-in system where we don't build distinct rapport with particular folks most of the time. But I guess it also means that I get to help a lot more people, overall, so maybe it's the best system they've got for writing help? Blasting music is strictly prohibited in any case, lol!!!
On the many many questions: 
1) There's surfing in Tofino??? Really??? I'd never thought about that, but I guess it's possible. They do have some really nice beaches up there...
2) Chard is a leafy green vegetable with a red stem that looks... uhhhhh... kind of like a darker, slightly wilted version of green leaf lettuce? It sounds bizarre when I try to describe it, but it's really good if you boil up the leaves until they're tender and then serve them hot with a little bit of white vinegar!
3) This must make for THE best family Christmas photos, haha -- you all match!!!
4) All things considered, I've been doing okay!!! I'm still very excited for the holidays, just have to, like, make it that far past all the school stuff in the way. Such is life! QwQ
On names: That is actually such a cool name though??? I mightily approve!!! 
What would I say to someone having a bad day?: Depends on what kind of bad day, to be honest -- but in general, I like to remind people (wherever appropriate!) that life goes on, that a lot of the things that really hurt us now can end up making us much stronger and more resilient people in the end, that it's OK to be sad and it's also OK to let go of being sad when you're ready (because feeling like you Have to Be Sad about something as an obligation never feels good), and that while it's OK to have a bad day, if every day is a bad day, then I always encourage them to talk to someone about it. Legitimately, I've seen so many people in my life with mental health issues who just kind of don't realize that they deserve to not have to live with their symptoms, or that they even can have a life without that extra burden, and sometimes just being a person who says ""hey you know you CAN get help/talk to someone/do X thing you're afraid of and it's OK to do that"" is all they need to actually reach out and get meds or therapy or start whatever new chapter of their lives they've been putting off out of sheer anxiety. I do it a lot as a tutor and I try to do it a lot as a friend. I hope it helps them. QwQ
When did I learn to whistle and why?: I kind of picked it up, over and over again, and then forgot repeatedly how to do it? Like, I swear I breathed funny one day, went ""oh that sounded like a whistle"" and then freaked out trying to keep doing it and couldn't make it happen again... and that happened, like, four times? And finally I had one random time when I accidentally whistled, then figured out how to keep doing it on purpose, and kind of just never stopped because I was afraid to forget again, haha!
You're so sweet!!! I do my best!!! QwQ And hey, you seem like a wonderful person yourself, and I'm sure that all of the humans who know you out there in the overworld treasure you very very much!!!",3:37PM November 24

BC was very fun!!! I got to see my grandma for the first time in a while and we did some painting and Netflix-watching, so no complaints over here! :D 
That's cool, I didn't know you painted lol! And Netflix is okay, but what can I say? Haha. 
Q1: Living on Vancouver Island/in Saskatchewan have both been good experiences for me, but they're very very different ones!!! I'd say I liked the Island because the weather was nice, it had a lot of great scenic spots to drive through and stop for a visit in, and because it had a very contained atmosphere (as in, hard to get lost, I always felt 'familiar' with everywhere I went for the most part, etc). But Saskatchewan has been nice because cities have much more stuff to do, it's scenic in its own way, and the people are so friendly!!!
A: Oh, that's pretty cool, if I do say so myself. I've pretty much stayed in one city most of my life and never moved anywhere else. Although there were some times that we were gonna move to a different city but it usually never happened lol. 
Q2: Cooking and guitar classes sound wonderful -- I wish I'd had the chance to learn guitar in high school! QwQ
A: Honestly, it is! We made some good stuff lately. We recently made pumpkin spice latte cake (yes that's a thing haha!!) and we made bread pretzels too! And guitar is cool, we are planning to learn more songs throughout the course, but both the classes last ten weeks :( but at least it's good to try somethin' new! Except I've started taking cooking maybe about Grade 9 or 10? Not too sure lol. 
Q3: Yeah, I meant other units of this course! Honestly, since it's not for a grade or anything now, I think I'll just open them all for you and you can look through them and see if there's anything that you want to discuss further -- it's a lot of good advice throughout, so I recommend giving it all a look, but feel free to hone in on whatever interests you!!! (Discussion questions are those weird pop-out pages that we Had To Do(c) for these two units, but aren't necessary for the rest -- though you're free to look at them if you want to know what kind of questions you can ask me??? Eh. I'm here to answer whatever, so again, totally up to you, haha.)
A: Oh okay, I know it's been a while since the first discussion when I met you, but thanks for refreshing my memory lol! So like any questions? Even burning questions? Lol. 
Q4: I have heard of Sri Lanka, though I've never been! Which did you prefer, the beaches or the temples? And how does it compare to where you're living now, if I may ask?
A: That's a surprise! Usually some people I've talked to usually don't know what it is unless I explain (which I don't like doing, but I do it anyways lol.) or if they do research on it, which I'm not sure they do until they tell me a fact they've learned about it haha. I guess it used to be an nice country but now there's been a lot of situations involving the government and the system recently. Also I was born in a city called Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia :) I forgot to mention that earlier lol! (it's a suburb in Colombo, but I think there are types of district regions in Sri Lanka.) 
Q5: Generally speaking, tutoring is pretty quiet -- except when there are, like, three of us working and all answering questions at the same time because the room is small?? That's not bad though, a lot of times one of us will have a question we can't answer for a client so we just call across the room and go ""hey, who knows the answer to this???"" which is SO efficient not gonna lie--
A: Oh! I misread this one lol. Oh so you tutor two people then? Haha. That's pretty cool. I was expecting someone to just blast music for fun lol. 
Q6: Oi, if you love Indian food, then when you get to the Island you HAVE to check out Heritage Indian Cuisine in Duncan -- it's the best I've ever had!!!!
A: Cool! I'll be sure to check it out when I move next year haha! 
Q7: I love the existence of beaches, but don't visit them often; same with hiking, although I did once go on a REALLY cool hike where I got to spelunk through an underground cave!; I've never had the opportunity to surf (I'm not sure that's a thing on the Island??? our currents might not be good for it) and doubt I could ever balance on a surfboard, klutz that I am!; my favourite fruits aaaare strawberries, blueberries, plums, Mandarin oranges, and probably avocado, and I'm a really big fan of carrots, broccoli, and chard; and over Christmas, I've always really enjoyed the general feeling of togetherness and the morning activities above all! My parents have been separated pretty much my whole life, so the middle of Christmas Day was always hectic as I would travel from one house to the other to see both for the holidays -- but in the morning, Mum always had a tradition that we'd wake up late, wander out in our pajamas, open some VERY stuffed stockings and munch on chocolates while we waited on Christmas breakfast at my grandparents' place... and it was so peaceful. This year won't be nearly as relaxing, I expect, but I can still remember it fondly! QwQ How about you? Do you have any particular Christmas traditions?
A: That's good! I guess it's good to be active lol. Cool, I've never went in a underground cave! Yeah, I think it is, I'm pretty sure. I know that my friend said that there was surfing at Tofino! I haven't been there myself lol. That's nice, but what's chard? Usually we typically wear different colors every year, not sure what color my family and I are wearing this year haha! Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Hope you've been doing well.  
Q8: Do you have a preference for Jen or Segués, or are both equally good with you? And how does one pronounce Segués? I've never heard of the name before, but it looks pretty! 
A: I think I'm okay with either. I actually thought of the name Segués a lot, and apparently it means ""transition"" but it's a music term, so I don't know the actual meaning behind it lol. But thought it sounded cool. I think you pronounce it as: (segh•wayz) 
(yes, it sounds like Segway as in the hoverboard lol. sorry for the confusion!) 
Q9: And as for the bonus question: I already know how to ski, but snowboarding looks way heckin' harder to do and I guarantee I'd break my legs on the way down, so I'll stick with what I know, haha!!!
A: Ooh, good point there haha. 
Qs-OOTD: If there something you would say to someone who is having a bad day, what would you say to them? When did you learn to whistle and why?
Man, I wish I knew you in real life!!! You seem like a good friend :D",10:05AM November 21

(All of the units are open and you're free to check out whatever you'd like, but I will say that this unit is one of the ones I would have most liked to see myself when I was younger! Critical thinking is a much more involved skill than people realize, and recognizing and applying it has been one of the most important lessons I've learned at the university level -- that I would have liked to learn much sooner and more directly, haha.)
Well being and self care",8:32PM November 20

Oh, that's a good way to keep track of your routines.
Apparently, if I sleep around midnight or so, I usually wake up a bit later (what a surprise lol) 
I usually use pillow spray if I'm having one of those hard nights. Or I just casually wait until I feel tired lol. 
That's cool! Do you cook vegetables and stuff? Or do you usually cook whatever comes to mind?
Peanut butter cookies sound good :D
QOTD: What's your favourite thing to do on vacations?",12:00PM October 21
mentor commented at,"8:24AM October 21 
And on eating and sleeping habits (because I'm working on them too!!!): what would make it easier for you to eat/sleep better, do you think? I know for me, sleeping is usually a matter of setting reminders (so I know when bedtime is) and limiting my YouTube time (because if I fall into a rabbithole with a long video, I'm bound to stay up!), and for eating, it's a matter of bulk-cooking my food in advance (so I have healthy dinners with zero effort, which makes it easy to choose them over fast food!) and limiting the amount of junk food in my house (I recently made a batch of peanut butter cookies and I've been paying for that ever since, haha). Would any of those things work for you, or do you have other methods of keeping on track?",8:24AM October 21
mentor commented at,"8:22AM October 21 
Anytime! That's what learning is for, my friend!!! :D
It's a good activity and we can definitely come back to it later if you'd like, buuuut seeing as we've got one week left to get through a whole 'nother unit before your class deadline comes up, we should finish the requirements up first just in case it takes longer than expected to get through them! I just really don't want you to get a bad grade because of the time crunch... QwQ I will say, though, that while we're deciding, I think the Post-Secondary and Career Planning unit would probably be closest in content to what we would talk about in Adulting 101, if that helps sway your choice any! (And hey, from what I understand, just because your course requirements are due in a week doesn't mean I have to disappear or anything -- if you want to keep talking and going through all the other activities after the 28th is up, I'm pretty sure that's a thing we're allowed to do if we ask, and then we don't have to worry about deadlines! We just have to get through one more now for your class, and then after that the rest is up to you!!!)

Oh okay thanks, there are some words I don't really understand lol 
And Adulting 101 sounds pretty good 
Oh I have never heard of Dalhousie! Sounds like a good university. 
No problem, glad it made your day :)
That's really cool, I've never heard of that!  I should check it out sometime.
The countryside is nice, although I have never lived there. I'm not sure if I've visited though. I've lived in cities most of my life lol.
Oh good to know, because I think you mentioned consuming junk food as a sign of stress so I was like ""oh I wonder if it can make you nauseous or sick?"" 
1) I have a lot of tv shows, so that's a hard one :') 
2) would probably like to live in Vancouver or Seattle :D
3) I am currently trying to work on eating habits and probably sleep habits as well.
4) I don't really know, still trying to think about it, I'm a indecisive person :') 
QOTD: What is your favourite color?",9:25PM October 19
mentor commented at,"8:37AM October 19 
Accommodations are anything that an institution will change policy for re: a person's marginalized identities, most commonly disability. So when I got my ADHD diagnosis, for example, I started getting disability accommodations where, for example, professors would be more flexible with deadlines and extensions for me than what was dictated on their syllabi, or if I needed extra time on a test, I could ask for arrangements to be made to provide that for me. Another time, I (unofficially) asked for gender accommodations on account of needing a few extra minutes during breaks for one class (because it was in a building where the nearest gender-neutral bathroom was really far away, so I didn't want to be marked as late back if I ran there on my break). Whether you have any official paperwork or not, I think it's always important to know that you can ask for those accommodations to be made for you!!!
The Adulting 101 activity is more of the same stuff as this last one -- but not just about self-care, more broadly about your life skills! We would take stock of all of the things you're good at, then all of the areas that you think you might want to improve on as you move into adulthood (eg. ""I'm really good at cooking! but I don't know how to pay bills..."") and then for each of those learning areas, we'd come up with concrete steps for improvement! But that's an optional one, so we'll want to get through the other necessary unit first and then circle back around if that interests you.
On choosing universities, I actually applied to quite a few of them when I planned for my MA! I officially got accepted into two -- Dalhousie University, which is way across Canada in Halifax, and here in Saskatchewan. Part of my choice was the distance, honestly; I didn't want to be further from my family than I already am, and the time zone difference would have been hard on me. Another part was the length of the program, because USask's Master's program was a two-year thing, but Dalhousie was only one, and I didn't think that I could learn How to Adult(c) and also write a whole thesis in the same year, haha. And the last part was the funding, because USask offered me much more money and in a place that was a lot more affordable, so I knew I would be more comfortable in terms of scheduling (because I find it overwhelming to have a lot of work at the same time as I do school things, so having to have a full-time job or money stress on top of homework would definitely affect my performance!). There are a lot of factors to consider in choosing a school in general, and I don't think I ever had a dream school so much as a dream situation -- going somewhere I could still regularly connect with my family one way or another, where I worked and schooled but not too hard, and where I was just generally comfortable. I've definitely found that here! :D
Thank you!!! QwQ You're so sweet!
Qs-otD:
1) My favourite shows would have to be BoJack Horseman on Netflix and/or the 2003-2009 Battlestar Galactica (because I'm doing my thesis on it!). I actually don't watch much TV at this point in my life (I intentionally don't have a TV, though I still have the Netflix subscription!) but I think my vagueness here is more that I like too many shows than that I've seen too few of them, haha.
2) City or countryside... is a tough balance, honestly! I think I'm a countryside person all the way, just because I really love nature (and I miss being able to just wander into the woods, you don't really get that out here on the prairies!) and I like the quiet. But with that said, I think countryside home within driving distance of a relatively functional city would be the ideal, because then you can also choose to interact with all the city amenities when you feel like it, you know??? Balance is key, I think!
3) No nausea or anything, mostly I just get stomachaches! But I'm more concerned about how sugar and diet in general interacts with my meds, because I think they wear off faster/have more weird side effects if I don't eat healthy. It's a whole thing.
Questions for you:
1) Right back atcha on these Qs of the day -- what's your favourite show? Where would you like to live? (Have you had any experience with city life, actually? I didn't until I came here!)
2) Just to make sure we really definitely hit those unit requirements, what are three ways that you can improve your self-care in life? In terms of a) three areas that you think you could improve, eg. sleep, eating healthy, exercise, socializing, etc, and b) one actionable step each that you can do to encourage yourself to be healthy in all of those ways?

(Adulting 101 is just an activity, not a whole unit -- all of the unit titles are up in that weird circle at the top; let me know what topic would interest you most and I can open it up, and then once that's done we can do whatever you'd like!!!)",8:37AM October 19

For Adulting 101 - Would it be talking about like university/college and adulting life? 
And also what aspired you to go to Saskatchewan? Did you have a dream university/college you've always wanted to go to? 
And thanks, you are a kind person and an amazing mentor :)

PS: There's an Extension Activity on this unit as well, called Adulting 101, that seems to be optional (at least wasn't specified in my email?) but if you have the time and wanna do that after all the class requirements are over with, we can pop back to that, too! No worries if not, though -- I want you to focus on what you think is most relevant to you once the requirements are completed, not just check boxes for the heck of it! (And if, once we've done our requisite two convos, you wanna ask me about life things that aren't covered in any of the units, that's totally cool with me too!)",4:07PM October 16

Just because I know you need this unit and one other one done by the 28th(!!!), I'll see if I can streamline this so you don't miss anything importaaaaant--
So the self-care action plan part of this discussion asks you to 1) share three things with me that you could change in your life, right now, to take better care of yourself, and for each of those, 2) describe how you would make each of those changes happen. I'll give you one example from my life as an example, because I have not been getting my eight hours of sleep lately -- so one of my three self-care changes would be to ""prioritize my sleep schedule,"" and maybe some things I would do to make that happen would be, like, ""leave my laptop across the room at night so I don't feel tempted to stay up,"" ""go to bed right on time even if I'm in the middle of something and let Morning Challen deal with the clean-up,"" and ""keep the curtains closed so the light doesn't wake me up early,"" eh? I'm convinced I'll do at least two of those things (it's hard for me to stop mid-task, aaa!). And finally, you have to 3) ask me one question about self-care... literally anything at all, but some of the examples they give are, like, ""how do you prioritize self-care? do you have any time management tips? how do you break bad habits?"" Something of that nature, but ideally something you actually want to know so that you get some good advice out of me!!! And then you can let me know what other unit you want me to open and we can start on the next one (and hopefully finish it well before your deadline and then talk about whatever you want! :D)",4:04PM October 16

So is feeling tired the thought of wanting to sleep? I might be thinking of it differently.
And also it's weird how we don't want to leave our beds as if we were on fluffy clouds ☁️
And usually I watch funny movies to keep my mind of stuff or if I just want to escape 
from work for a while. 
And I guess exercise is good, I try to do it at least once a week, sometimes I do yoga (it's not too bad) and also I cannot ride a bike or swim :(
And also I like to draw and sketch if I'm in deep stress or just can't find my way out of my schoolwork.

Aaaaand here we are! It looks like the modules have changed a little bit from what I've seen last year -- so for now, we'll start with the linked article by Anne Bokma and the self-care action plan video and then have a discussion before moving onto whatever the secret second set of discussion questions are. :P I'll give you my lists here!:
1) ""Warning signs"" that I'm in need of self-care include:
- Feeling ""tired"" a lot. Not just physically, although sometimes I'm just not getting enough sleep either, but mentally tired like ""I want to take a nap so I can stop worrying about X and Y.""
- Compulsively eating junk food. Usually means I'm stressed about something else!
- Compulsively starting new projects as a distraction from whatever I'm actually avoiding. You know when you pick up fifty different ""oh that might be cool"" craft ideas but then you have all of the STUFF strewn around your room from those crafts and none of them are getting done and then you're like, ""well heck, now I have to do FIFTY-ONE things instead of the one I was avoiding because I've spent the money""??? That. I do that a lot.
- Compulsively (see the pattern here haha) playing games, listening to music, or having something ""on"" all the time. I call this ""passive consumption,"" because what I'm really doing is keeping my brain busy so I don't have enough silence to think about whatever's bugging me -- which can be really tiring in and of itself!
- Avoiding talks with family. Sometimes I'm busy, and that's OK and understandable, but I often catch myself feeling ""guilty"" about talking to them if I've fallen behind on schoolwork because I don't want them to ask... which is silly, because they know I'm responsible no matter what and they just want to know what I'm feeling well!
2) Activities that help me feel better when I'm in this state:
- Meditation!!! Bear with me here, because for years I (especially as an ADHD brain) heard ""meditation"" and thought ""sitting on the floor and struggling to be quiet and hating every second of it because Brains Don't Just Turn Off(c)"" -- but having looked more into it and found apps that actually work for me, I can say this one is a lifesaver for a lot of reasons. Firstly, meditation is basically mind-control in the long run -- it's brain-training to teach your mind how to check itself before you go off the rails worrying about something or falling into impulsive habits, and it helps you to control strong feelings that otherwise might ruin a whole day! Secondly, it forces you to turn off most of the other stimulation going on at the time (which helps me to turn off all my background music/YouTube videos that often distract me), but also has active options so you can practice while you're physically moving around or doing chores so that it doesn't get boring. And thirdly... it feels nice? It might be the first time in a long time that I found a way to genuinely relax, so when it works, it really works to get me out of a funk!
- Exercise, in literally any amount. When I'm not feeling super well, it's hard to go do a whole exercise routine or anything strenuous, but even something as simple as getting out of bed and doing a few jumping jacks or a quick stretch can fundamentally shift my mood. When paired with the meditation, this is really helpful in allowing me to check in and ask why I'm not feeling good -- sometimes I can spin myself big narratives of ""oh life sucks and this isn't right and that deadline's coming up and aaaa"" and then realize that the physical sensations I'm interpreting as stress could just as easily be stiffness, restlessness, or dehydration... so resetting my brain with a glass of water and a bit of movement can actually go a long way in shifting my perspective!
- Water -- as noted above. One of my ADHD symptoms is a general un-awareness of my bodily needs/a general un-motivation to go deal with them when I'm engaged with something else, so even though I'm in a tiny dorm that has a sink right across the room, I'd end up getting dehydrated a lot just because I didn't want to get up. Solution? I keep a water jug and a glass on the bedside table so I only have to periodically fill the jug (which I can do when I'm already in the kitchen for something else). Might sound silly for someone who doesn't have the exact habits I do, but for me having the important things Literally Within Arm's Reach(c) does so much for keeping me on track with actually taking care of my body.
- Probably one of the biggest ones: reaching out for help when you need it, esp. in terms of mental health and doctor visits and all that dull stuff no one likes to do. Getting on meds and accessing support services on campus to accommodate my personal challenges changed my entire life here and I'm so grateful that the earlier version of me was willing to go to all of the effort required to set that up. That should probably be number one on the list, honestly.
- And finally... balancing human contact and obligations!!! My first year of grad school was hard because I 1) hadn't gotten the ADHD diagnosis yet and 2) was living on my own for the first time and didn't really know how to take care of myself and 3) obviously had tons and tons of homework -- and one of the biggest things that took a hit was my social life, which left me feeling really isolated and demotivated. Now I realize that it's really important to keep up with people regularly, even if you see yourself as an introvert (as I do!) -- regular check-ins with family and regular reasons to physically get out of the house (bonus points if you have a bike -- I never learned to ride one until this year just because it got me some bonus exercise and a reason to enjoy the fresh air!) are crucial.
That's all for me for now! :D

Le intro: Hoi!!! Not much is up!!! The visit was really lovely, and I'm also enjoying the peace and quiet while I wait for the next one, haha. Currently switching up my medications again (fingers crossed this one works better!) and trying to get back into the swing of thesis-writing, which is going preeeetty slowly, but at least now I don't have to panic over it. Today's my cooking day, too -- I'm making lentil stew just now! How have you been?
A: Hey! That's good! Oh- I didn't know you can switch medications. I mean, a thesis sounds hard. Sounds nice! Hope it was good. I'm good, just had mint tea from my new tumbler :D
Q1: On setting a bad example: I meant that I did a lot of talking about self-care here, but wasn't really performing it myself until I finally decided to offer myself a break, which I worried would make you think self-care wasn't something to take seriously. It really, really is; it just took me a while to realize how overworked and stressed I'd become, and even longer to accept that that meant I had to prioritize my health over my workload. I'm feeling really good about my decisions on that front now, though! And I do my best to check in with myself where I can -- a lesson that needs to be constantly re-learned, but that's always worth re-learning. QwQ I'm glad you've been taking care of yourself and spending time with loved ones!!!
A: What made you worried? (I might have missed something) And that's good, you've been checking in with yourself!
Q2: On the Gather.town meet: Did they cancel it again??? I didn't get a notification this time about it, but I also don't think I got the invitation I was supposed to after signing up via the Google form they sent out, so maybe that's a bad sign? And hey, I'm not expecting anything, but it's sweet of you to suggest I'm worthy of rewards, thank you kindly! QwQ
A: Yeh, Juliet sent me an email saying that it may or may not cancelled lol. (there's like a 30/50 chance but idk) And no worries! 😊
Q3: On Alec Benjamin: I don't know much about the singer as a person, but I do know that I love his songs, so I'll take any comparison I can!!! Storytelling is my passion regardless of the medium, honestly -- books and songs and art projects are all just different ways of accomplishing the same goal of getting a message across to an audience!
A: True that!
Q4: On chocolate flavours: Rocky Mountain Chocolate was so good aaaaaaaa, there was a store for it in the mall on Vancouver Island and they just had e v e r y t h i n g, I used to love it in there!!!
A: Now I know what to check out when I potientially move down there!
Q5: What's my favourite dream destination? Honestly, I'm not sure I have one! Once upon a time I might have said London, but now that I've been to it and so many other places... I'd say my dream destination is my own house, somewhere I can be cozy and secure and not feel the need to run around all the time!
A: Lol, fair enough XD.
Q6: Why did Peter Parker fail his driver's test? Because he was a bad parallel Parker! This is silly and it made me smile.
A: Glad it did rofl!
Q7: Do I like milkshakes? I definitely used to, although they were the sort of thing that would make my stomach upset in the long run (usually because I'd get milkshakes at restaurants, and restaurants always bring out that second tin cup of extra milkshake and I'd never want to waste it but it would be way too much milkshake for me altogether!). I haven't had a vegan milkshake yet, so I can't say whether or not I still do, but if they're anything close to the real thing, then heck yeah!
A: Apparently vegan milkshakes exist online.. and they're homemade!
Q8: On ""Whether in conversation or in silence"": I just meant whether you wanted to talk about things or not, I was cool with it!
A: I mean, sure if you're willing to, that would be nice!
Q9: Do I have chronic pain myself? By my definition, not anymore; the only thing that I ever considered ""chronic pain"" for me at the time was before my hysterectomy (because I had incredibly painful periods and it would really impact my day-to-day life, probably in no small part due to the dysphoria that I didn't yet realize influenced me on that front) but once that was dealt with, I'm happy to say I've been pretty lucky on this front. My partner has it in spades, though -- so he does everything he can to help with my mental stuff and I do everything I can to help with his physical stuff and we get by. QwQ
A: Awh man, sorry to hear that. I wish you and him nothing but the best.
Q10: And also I looked up Battlestar Galactica, and it gave me Dune vibes for some reason lol This would make sense -- they've definitely got similar aesthetics!!!
A: Lol!
Q11: Do I like sushi? Yes!!!
A: Cool! Not a big fan of the store-bought kind though lol.
Q12: Do I like nachos? Not really -- too salty and I always thought nacho cheese tasted plastic-y!
A: Fair enough lol. There's this one gene where some people think that cilantro tasted like soap, but for some reason it doesn't really taste like soap.
Q13: Also forgot to add on QOTD: What are my favorite movie(s)? Good question! I'm still not sure I have a favourite -- I suppose something like Atomic Blonde, Silent Hill, maybe Interstellar because I watched that one over and over again... I don't have a definite favourite, honestly, and the answer will probably change over time, haha.
A: Cool! I'd probably say my favourite would be Love, Simon!
Q14: On food things: Yeah, it's possible that if I switched back to cow's milk now I would be queasy for a bit... and oi, I don't stuff myself with desserts often!!! I mean, I guess it's subjective, actually -- I think I have a relatively healthy diet, but mostly when my ADHD meds wear off I tend to get sugar cravings, and it's not so much that I intentionally eat a bunch of desserts so much as I tend to eat whatever I have on hand, and if that turns out to be a gluttonous amount of chocolate, then it might just be a night with an upset stomach, haha. All in all, environment is key -- if I surround myself with healthy things, that's what I tend to indulge in!
A: When you mean by ""a night"", do you mean like all night?
Q15: Have I worn leather jackets? I love leather jackets!!! I was a major fan of them in high school and early college, and even now (though here there's never good weather to wear one) I'd be happy to wear a leather jacket if I could get it secondhand or from a thrift store (so that I'm not contributing to the sort of factory farm stuff I generally try to avoid).
A: Cool! They're pretty dope.
Q16: And on a related note, Do I use cruelty-free products? Yes, everywhere I can!!! It's impossible to 100% avoid everything ever, but I really do my best to choose cruelty-free stuff wherever I can (and, in the case of things like leather jackets that I don't need but do like, to go the aforementioned secondhand/thrifting routes so that I don't contribute money back into cruel systems -- same with things I already owned, because the impact of purchasing them from the source has already been made, you know what I mean??).
A: Yeh, most makeup and shampoo companies are starting to take that into initative I think. And I think I know what you're talking about.
Q17: On Owl City, Alessia Cara, and Zendaya: I've only vaguely heard of the last one here, but I used to be a big fan of Owl City and I remain a big fan of Alessia Cara!!!
A: I used to listen to Owl City's music! Haven't listened to them in years XD. My friend used to be a fan of Alessia Cara! And as for Zendaya, I think you might have heard of her if you watched the Spiderman movies (Homecoming, Far From Home and No Way Home) or if you watched Euphoria lol.
Q18: Have I become a professor yet? Not even close!!! I still have to finish the MA degree (by the end of this year) and start and end my PhD (4-5 years) before I can call myself a ""doctor,"" and even then I'm not really a ""professor"" until I've got a job teaching after that!
A: Lol. Me and my sisters were talking about it the other day, and we were thinking that University would take forever and by the time you got your degree, we'd be old haha!
Q19: ""Even though the road is long ahead, it will all be worth it in the end."" Very true!!!
A: 👍🏽
Q20: On hair things: I suppose I used to change it seasonally because long hair was too warm -- but now I keep it short all year 'round and it suits me fine! As for perm stuff, nah, I think I just used one of those heat-up hair curlers? It never lasted long. And by ""like Rapunzel,"" do you mean super duper long??? I don't think my hair has ever been much longer than, say, the bottom of my shoulderblades, but I did have a friend in high school who let hers grow to the point that it almost touched the floor! Which looked really cool, but also really hard to manage, I'd think.
A: Yeh, I do mean super duper long lol. My mom also used to have long hair up to her calf I think when she was a teenager up to her 20s! My mom has a curling wand, but the curls never last long, probably like a day or two depending. Oh dang- that sounds like a lot of work!
Q21: On whistling: Yeah, that sounds about right! Occasionally someone would whistle along with me, but for the most part people thought it was an annoyance, unfortunately -- not that that stopped me!
A: Awh man, sorry people find it annoying. People probably love listening your whistling (much rather than the in-store radio), but they're all probably having a bad day. But really they're all clapping and going ""encore, encore!!!"" (idk if you know what that means lol) Do you still have the grocery job or no?
Q22: And on that note, Is whistling fun? Yes, I think so, but I think I also just do it out of habit because it's some kind of noise to make, you know? If I'm alone in a quiet room, I'm the type to talk to myself out loud to fill the silence, so whistling is just another way of doing that!
A: I guess it is! Whistling is pretty amazing (unless it's off-key in this case) I mean, you do you! Also there's a whistler named Molly Lewis, she does it pretty well!
Bonus question: I'll keep my eyes peeled for any info about the Gather.town thing -- we'll see how everything goes! QwQ
A: Lol, okay!
Qs-OTD: Would you rather surf or go mountain-climbing? Do you like summer or winter? Have you ever whistled inwards or just outwards? And do you hum as well?

Hello again aaaaaaaa -- I emerge from a cacophony of responsibilities to finally announce that I've come out the other end (though perhaps not necessarily in the way that I intended to do so). Long story short, I burned myself out trying to finish that big paper and then got smacked with a conference that I had a great time at but was not 100% prepared for, and then my family came and visited and what little self-management routine I had left is now all over the place. But good news -- I got my entry into my PhD deferred until January, which means I have a few extra months (expensive though they are to keep paying the tuition out of pocket, oops) to write this paper and get my meds back in order and Be a Human Person. Which means I also have time to actually catch up on the many many many emails and messages and friends and obligations and cool opportunities and etc that I've been letting stack up... and I actually have my head on straight enough to come say hi! So hi!!! QwQ
I'm glad to hear that you've been spending some time with your folks and friends over the summer months -- it's really important to make time for yourself to keep those connections going. I'm sorry about all the things going skewy, though; the caffeine crashes are very relatable to me right now, and though I won't pry if it's private to you, which it seems to be, I hope that whatever else is making you feel sick has either hopefully improved or that you're managing it as best you can. I don't have as much experience with chronic physical difficulties as some, but seeing my partner deal with chronic pain has taught me that sometimes looking for a permanent solution to sickness might be missing the point -- to just be as healthy as happy as possible within your circumstances. Whatever that means to you right now, I hope you've achieved it. QwQ And that goes for mental and spiritual healths as much as physical, for the record -- I'm glad that you're not sticking around in toxic dance halls or for classes you didn't enjoy, and I fear that I may have been setting a bit of a bad example as a mentor up until this point by exhausting myself with my own work and repeatedly running up against that metaphorical wall... because honestly, sometimes you just need to take a break and properly rest, or to attend to the things that need attending to the most. So I hope that you've gotten the chance to do that, that's all. Take care of yourself out there, friend, it's the best thing you'll ever do.
A: Yo, what's up? Hope the visit was good! Oh, glad to hear the thing went good! What do you mean that you were setting a bad example? Thanks, you take care of yourself too. And also I saw that question closer to the end and just wanted to add a bit. I am fine now, it was from before. But thank you for checking in. Hope you are checking in with yourself too. But yeh, I did stuff from kayaking and having barbeques with family and family-friends to working out with my friends.
And now the Q&As that need catching up on!!!
Q1: What blue frizz? My bad, I didn't include the hyphens, but I meant ""out-of-the-blue"" frizz as in frizzy hair that was unexpected/outside of my routine -- usually because of weird weather things, in my case!
A: No worries, I think I read it too fast so maybe that's why lol. I thought you had blue hair!
Q2: On staying out of the rain: Oh dear, I imagine that 24/7 rain does make it hard to avoid being out in the damp, haha. I suppose that would give you a very different perspective on it than where I'm at in my weather-based habits. QwQ But maybe that means that you get to enjoy rainy days more, in some ways? At least insofar as folks tend to get used to the weather around them so it might not feel like as much of an out-of-the-blue aggravation as it used to for me? (Actually, living in Saskatchewan has given me a strong appreciation for any weather I can walk outside in without dying -- I used to hate rain when I lived in BC and it was just an occasional annoyance, but around here it's like ""oh joy!!! something that isn't snow!!! i'll take it!!!""
A: Eh. The weather is improving a bit lol. But honestly, I feel like climate change is to blame at most.
Q3: On lactose intolerance: Oh! I'm actually not intolerant or allergic to much of anything, save for sugar in some cases (and even that's more of a sensitivity, because it's just me being cautious about being hypoglycaemic and not wanting to push that into potential diabetes down the line, but it doesn't make me violently ill to have or anything unless I really stuff myself with desserts to the point most folks would prolly get sick regardless). So when I imagine feeling gross from a bunch of ice cream, it's more about all the sugar than the cream part! Although now that I've done the whole vegan thing a while, I suppose real milk might do weird things to my stomach if I tried it again -- I'm not sure how that works???
A: Oh yeah, definitely not! So you just stuff yourself full of desserts? I guess if you're used to the milk you're currently using, your body probably won't be used to it.
Q4: On acting in Riverdale: I definitely agree on this front, haha -- I think I would maybe consider being in Riverdale for the memes, but it would be a very difficult production to actually take seriously???
A: I guess yeah. I dunno, honestly. If you're used to horror, I mean I can't really change people's minds. I guess it's their own opinion.
Q5: On all things hair-related: I definitely feel you on haircuts in the summer -- back when I had long hair and we'd have hot days, it was very warm and annoying to keep up with, at least for me (though I'm also the type to wear extra layers of clothes because I just like to have a jacket around, so wearing a hat/hood/etc in the sun probably didn't help with that any, lol). And in terms of modifications, I have never coloured my hair with proper dye before, though I think I did some temporary streaks once when I was a kid with that stuff that's supposed to wash out in like three days -- and in terms of hair curling, I have had that done in the past, but mostly for big fancy events where my mum encouraged me to ""dress up"" (think graduations, prom, etc) and while I liked it sometimes, I usually found that either the curls got in the way/distracted me when I was trying to go about my life, or that when they did look good, they never lasted long enough versus the amount of work it took to get my hair curled in the first place. Same thing with straightening it, too (which took forever and always got in my eyes) and makeup more generally (which took forever and always made my face itchy and uncomfortable and distracting). All in all, I probably would have enjoyed experimenting with that kind of thing more in my youth if not for my general (possibly ADHD-boredom-related?) avoidance of ""standing still at a mirror doing X beautification task for thirty minutes while thinking about doing anything else"" and/or the matter of ""changing something in my life/routine/sensory environment, however small, is inevitably going to pull me out of whatever else I'm focusing on for the rest of the day."" My mum thought I was no fun in this department, haha!
A: So basically your hair changes during the season? And when you said you curled your hair, did you perm it? And also, I guess your hair has been like Rapunzel's?
Q6: On your Quote of the Day: I absolutely agree with this, and I'm glad to say that doing things because they matter to you feels a lot healthier and happier than doing it for others. Admittedly, it was hard for me to give up on my (terribly unrealistic) self-expectations of success in school this year because I cared about the approval of a lot of folks way beyond my own network... and now that I've reeled that back in, it's seriously a relief to just ask what I want to do with my life -- and to realize that all the closest people I thought would be upset because I 'failed' my initial goal were just glad that I was taking care of myself??? Like, we really don't realize how much pressure we put on ourselves until we let it go, but dang, I'm glad to have gotten that deferral. QwQ
A: Yep 👍
Q7: On the previous Zoom meet: I'm sorry to hear that they cancelled the last Gather.town thing, that sucks! If it helps any, my email just pinged me about an end-of-the-year meet-up that they're theoretically hosting on June 26th, so at least there's another chance to be social if we want it? Now that my schedule has more breathing room, I should be able to make this one!!! I think it's 5-7PM your time? No worries if you're busy that day and/or if you wanted to go but hang out with other mentees or some such, but I'll be there in any case! :D
A: I will be there. I am willing to hangout with you. :)
Q8: Why did I choose to do the MA Thesis? Overall, or instead of an easier project option? If you mean the second thing, I chose the thesis over the project version of the MA because I was told that it would be easier in the long run to get used to writing gigantic papers (so that the jump to writing a 200-400page PhD dissertation isn't quite so much of a leap!), but if you just mean why I decided to do this in general... a lot of reasons, I think! Because I enjoy English, and because it's something I'm good at, because I think I could do well in a job with it, because I think it's an area in which I have a lot of potential to make a lot of change in the world (either by writing stories that change peoples' perspectives on issues or by teaching them directly as a prof!), because I wanted to do my PhD and this is a prerequisite, because I think it's my path in life... I don't have just one answer, to be honest, just a lot of factors. And admittedly, it can be a really stressful path to be in sometimes (I really freaked myself out with the deadlines up until now, I've had to live far away from family for a couple years, it can be really mentally taxing work), but I think that the benefits / other stressful things I won't have to do in the future make up for it (I'm more stressed out by physical jobs than teaching, I'm more likely to have a secure paycheque/benefits, this degree has a lot of transferable skills if I find out that I don't like this job but don't wanna start from square one, etc etc). All in all, I'm doing this particular thing because I hope it will make me happy -- not the degree itself, per se, but the skills that I'm hoping to gain along the way, and the prestige/opportunities that come with it that could get me more skills down the line.
With that said, I don't think that it's the right path for everyone, or even for people like me who theoretically want to do it in certain cases -- it really depends on what your goals are and what you hope to get out of it. I came to terms with the fact that I wanted to do my PhD, but that I wanted a break first more -- and while I'm lucky to have gotten it in this case, I have friends who have had to drop out or whose careers have been halted by non-school things getting in the way of the One Singular Path that academia sort of funnels people into when it tells them that there's one particular way to learn: the neurotypical/colonial/wealthy/privileged/etc way of showing up all the time every time, having no conflicting life duties, doing all of your homework, reading all of the books, never being late or making mistakes, blablablah. And that's just... not realistic. So I think it's the right path for people who are in circumstances that are beneficial to working with and/or around those systems -- for example, my situation of being late on my thesis but still having the money to be able to dump a few thousand dollars down the drain to extend my tuition instead of burning myself out writing everything at once by the end of the summer for free. But I think it's also important to recognize that education is as flawed an institution as anything else, and that sometimes it's not the right place for people -- whether that's altogether, because the system isn't inclusive enough for them or just won't give them what they want at the end, or just temporary, like ""I need to take a gap year or two to get my mental health/finances/family situation/etc together and maybe after that I'll see if university is a feasible and correct path for me.""
Long story short, I chose to do it because it worked out for me and I usually enjoy it -- and the times that I don't, I've been lucky and/or privileged enough (generally both) to make it work anyway. And even when I'm at my most frustrated with it all, I don't see myself doing anything else, so I feel like it's gotta be right at least for now, you know?
A: What a long list.. but it's okay anyways lol. You do you :)
Q9: On learning Greek: That's really cool!!! I never got into the language part, but I definitely remember being interested in Greek/Roman mythology when I was younger... that and Egyptian, after I got inspired by a poster project in like Grade 6. I think that was when I was still trying to figure out that I was interested in storytelling in general, but I didn't have the words to explain that yet, so I would default to getting really obsessed with particular types of stories? Good times.
A: Yeh, mostly Greek gods and all. It sounds in a way you could be Alec Benjamin (just kidding! it's probably because I've been listening to his music more recently lol) but also I keep reading that you like to do storytelling as well so I've been comparing, but no competition there, cool!
Q10: What's my favourite chocolate flavour?: Prior to veganism, white chocolate 100%!!! Used to be my absolute FAV when Easter came around (particularly in my youth when I could chow down on a whole Easter bunny and somehow not end up sick the next day, which is no longer a skill I possess, rofl). But because I haven't been able to find any I can still have, now I guess it's fake milk chocolate??? The best brand I've found so far is Camino vegan semi-sweet chips!
A: AYE, fake milk chocolate? That's kinda weird lol. My favorite brand is... *drum roll* ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE!!!!! (but seriously, there are so many good brands out there lol)
Q11: On emojis: Sorry I spooked you!!! Definitely wasn't intended at all and I'll avoid that one in the future, my b!!! QwQ
A: It's fine. You can continue to use it if you wish to.
Q12: Why is whistling much easier for me? I scrolled back to check but I can't remember what it was easier than! I'm going to assume either dancing (because I'm not coordinated) or singing (because it takes a lot more breath to make the same amount of noise and my lungs run out of air fast, haha).
A: Oof, fair point lol.
Q14: On the previous Zoom meet: I'm sorry to hear that they cancelled the last Gather.town thing, that sucks! If it helps any, my email just pinged me about an end-of-the-year meet-up that they're theoretically hosting on June 26th, so at least there's another chance to be social if we want it? Now that my schedule has more breathing room, I should be able to make this one!!! I think it's 5-7PM your time? No worries if you're busy that day and/or if you wanted to go but hang out with other mentees or some such, but I'll be there in any case! :D
Phew... another long catch-up message completed! I'm glad to finally have a minute of breathing room with everything to get back to you -- and I'm sorry that my life things have gotten in the way so much, I know that we're both human beings out living real lives with deadlines and obligations and friends and family and Things(c) but I do wish I could be here more, and now that I've gotten a bit of a break over here, I'm going to do my best to check in more often. I'm supposed to be working on my mental health with this spare time as I carry on with the thesis-ing, after all... and a big part of that for me is not letting all of the social check-ins stack up for centuries!
All in all, it's good to hear from you, I hope you're well and that you're having the best spring/summer you can, and I look forward to hearing from you whenever you find your own moment of peace between the waves of daily life! Don't let the rain wash you away over there! :P
A: Yeh, I got the email too lol. So far it hasn't rained a lot as it did before lol. And also there's this thing where mentors get awards, so maybe you might get some awards!!! :D Can't wait to hear what tunes you do!!! (whistling-wise)
Q14: On Christmas songs and whistling with customers: Very much true!!! I believe I did mention complaining about my radio at work -- but even then, I gotta admit in retrospect that the silly moments where people really really enjoyed those carols (even whistling along to them themselves!) probably make up for my humbuggish nature in having to hear them all the time. Ups and downs!
A: Oh, I was thinking about the coworkers and how they said that they hated it and that you were the only one who enjoyed whistling whether you were in the workplace, walking downtown, or just in your own house?
QOTD: What's your favorite drink in the summer? What's your favourite dream destination?

Do I like babies? You don't have to acknowledge that I said this next bit at all, you can totally 100% just leave this whole text chunk off your list of things to respond to and it'll be I never spoke and we won't ever mention it again, and if that's what you're comfy with then we're totally good -- but if I'm potentially putting clues together right re: this question plus you being suddenly ill and not wanting to get into it... well, then I won't get into it, because I respect your privacy, but I just want you to know that I hope you're OK. No matter what's going on in your existence right now, I'm rooting for you and your best interests, and I hope that you're safe and well and doing what's best for you in this moment. And I just wanted you to know that, even though I'm a sporadic presence on this platform a lot of the time when my life gets overwhelming, I'm here for you if you need me for something serious too -- whether in conversation or in silence -- and all that matters to me as a fellow random human on the Internet is that you're taking care of yourself at the end of the day. (I will let you know -- just in case it ever would change what you do or don't share with me directly, which is 100% your choice in any case -- that if I were to hear that either you or someone else is/was in danger of harm, either self-harm or from others, I'm obligated as a mentor to let the folks who run the platform know about it. I don't know what steps they take beyond that point, but that's a resource if you ever need it, too.)
You have no obligation to acknowledge any part of the above and I won't bring it up again unless you do. Carrying on!
On the previous Zoom meet: I'm sorry to hear that they cancelled the last Gather.town thing, that sucks! If it helps any, my email just pinged me about an end-of-the-year meet-up that they're theoretically hosting on June 26th, so at least there's another chance to be social if we want it? Now that my schedule has more breathing room, I should be able to make this one!!! I think it's 5-7PM your time? No worries if you're busy that day and/or if you wanted to go but hang out with other mentees or some such, but I'll be there in any case! :D
Phew... another long catch-up message completed! I'm glad to finally have a minute of breathing room with everything to get back to you -- and I'm sorry that my life things have gotten in the way so much, I know that we're both human beings out living real lives with deadlines and obligations and friends and family and Things(c) but I do wish I could be here more, and now that I've gotten a bit of a break over here, I'm going to do my best to check in more often. I'm supposed to be working on my mental health with this spare time as I carry on with the thesis-ing, after all... and a big part of that for me is not letting all of the social check-ins stack up for centuries!
All in all, it's good to hear from you, I hope you're well and that you're having the best spring/summer you can, and I look forward to hearing from you whenever you find your own moment of peace between the waves of daily life! Don't let the rain wash you away over there! :P",1:45PM June 10

Q: I'm sad to admit it, but I'm not gonna be able to make it to the video meet this time -- the first half of it is over a trip I have to take to Toronto to present at a conference I'm not even close to ready for, so I know I'm gonna be crunching more homework until the moment I get back home, and then once I get home my family has decided to plunk down in my house and visit while I'm still kinda sorta supposed to be doing school things (because they were originally supposed to be visiting, like, this week, but now I'm so behind on last month's stuff that they didn't wanna add to it, but they didn't ask when would be convenient and so landed in the middle of a conference -- I love them to death, but it makes me wonder, rofl). In any case, I'm sorry I won't be there to say hi, but if you're still going to pop in and try to make friends with other mentors/students/etc, I hope you have ALL of the fun at it, because it's a really cool chance to meet really cool people!!! You'll have to let me know how it goes (and what new weird minigames they add to the Gather.town platform haha) if you do!
Additional answer: It's fine, they cancelled it.",3:49PM May 28

Q: Hoooooooly heck I am behind-- QwQ Hey!!! Sorry I'm late -- not trying to be distant on purpose over here, I swear, I'm just running a real risk of Actually Not Finishing This Thesis On Time and I am very behind and that is my entire reality 100% of the day and I can't play games or ride a bike outside or order groceries without getting distracted and somehow losing days of paper time I'm supposed to not need in the first place because the whole thing was due three days ago and I'm about fifty pages short and????? I am e x h a u s t e d if I'm being honest, and as such I am chronically behind on all of my messages. I know that's not fair to you, and I'm sorry that I haven't found the time and energy to pop in this month, and I just hope that you're doing well in your whole general existence. I hope things are good. That's all. QwQ
A: That's fine, it must be stressful. The closest I had done was an essay (forgot what it was about and when.) and also I've been hanging out with friends and also I am probably gonna join one of my friends on Monday (the 8th) for one of her workouts. And also on thw 2nd, I went to the lake with my family and family-friends and had burgers and hot dogs! And also I've been having caffeine crashes recently as well so I am not really as alert anymore as I used to be, but otherwise it's going alright I guess.
Q1: My partner was here for a week to help, and it did help me focus while he was around, but now that he's back home again it's harder to do it on my own -- although today went well, kinda sorta, hopefully???
A: Oh that's cool, good for you. (Don't really have much to say about this at the moment, apologies, but that's good you tried to complete some of it!).
Q2: The wobbly legs after that first bike ride turned out to be a bit of an iron deficiency (which I suppose explains some of my concentration issues lately, whoops!) but I've tackled that and I'm starting to feel much better and more human. QwQ
A: I guess it happens to the best of us. I've been off recently, but it's whatever though lol. (can't do much about it at this point.)
Q3: Your dance stuff sounds really cool, and even though you don't sound like you'll head back to that specific place I hope you find moments at home to keep the skills alive!
A: Meh. Honestly, I'm kinda glad I left. The dance studio I used to dance at was somewhat toxic anyway. So besides me, some other people left as well. We probably wouldn't be able to handle it anyways I think.
Q4: I feel you on dropping French, it's a toughie, but Hawai'ian sounds really cool, so I'm very proud of you for having the discipline to pick it up on your own!!!
A: Thanks :)
Q5: I wasn't particular about what shampoo I used based on particular hair moments when I was younger, honestly, I kinda just used whatever was bought for me -- it worked really well for out of the blue frizz though!
A: Oh yeah. What blue frizz?
Q6: It is very cool that your friend still cross stitches!!! Tell them I didn't mean to ask for anything made for me, but I appreciate the offer, haha!
A: I know, I told her already lol.
Q7: Teleporting is a good choice!!!
A: Cool
Q8: Your quote is very inspirational -- it's important in life to focus on the process, not the product!
A: I agree 👍
Q9: I genuinely don't know what the nicest thing I've said or done is, actually... I try to be nice to as many people as possible, but I think it's less important how you do it than that you do it continuously and make niceness a habit, honestly! What's important is to just spread the good vibes and trust that they'll carry it forward!
A: That's cool, I agree!
Q10: Least favourite song would have to be whatever played the most at the grocery store I worked at back in the day -- something long and repetitive and popular and slightly old... I'm gonna say probably ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, that feels like one of those songs that would play like six times a day at that place, haha!
A: Lol, I think you mentioned that you kept hearing the same Christmas songs before (dunno anymore) and also you mentioned whistling with the customer before lol.
Q11: On rainy days I like to stay in and cozy up with my heating pad and read! (Or do homework, these days, but hey, the general point is to not be in the rain!)
A: Oof, well in my [current] hometown, it pretty much rains 24/7 unless it's summer, hah. Better than getting sick lol.
Q12: Quotes are hard, there are so many good ones... I think one of the most impactful ones was actually a rhetorical question that I once heard it was good to ask when things got tough, which was ""How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?"" because no matter how difficult things are, if you can find a single positive in it, it can help a lot to shift your mindset into things being less scary!
A: I 100% agree
Q13: I have certainly tried cheesecake (and I've even tried vegan cheesecake, which was equally tasty surprisingly!) -- my grandma used to make homemade cheesecakes for her catering jobs back in the day, so I've got a bit of sentimentality for it (even if I always ate way too much and got sick after, haha).
A: Cool! Sounds good I guess.
Q14: I would definitely rather have pizza for breakfast/lunch/dinner -- ice cream is good in small doses, but anything more than that gets my stomach upset pretty quickly, whereas at least pizza could sort of be customized into different meals (including dessert, if pizza = ""anything sloshed together onto a pizza crust"" in this hypothetical!).
A: I wasn't sure I understood but I think I misunderstood when I read this -- I thought you were lactose intolerant (I dunno if you are or not)
Q15: o3o is a silly emoji I remember typing on the Internet back in the day, didn't mean to be confusing!
A: Oh okay, I didn't know until I looked it up -- it kinda scared me for a moment and sent me into fight or flight mode mentally but I'm okay I guess.
Q16: I genuinely have no recollection of what we were talking about mentioning, sorry. QwQ And happy belated Easter!! I don't usually celebrate, but my partner was out visiting and I got a random invitation to a dinner party with some fellow grad students, so we took one single night off from the paper for that and it was actually really lovely (if a little weird because we didn't know anyone that well, lol).
A: Meh, it's fine I guess. Thanks I guess?? And cool, good to take a break from your paper for a day!
Q17: I would definitely rather have short hair!!! I've had both, and short is much much easier to take care of (and gets people to use my pronouns more consistently tbh).
A: Yeah, I agree. I usually get haircuts in the summer at most lol.
Q18: Oi!!! I didn't expect that you'd actually listen to the song! Hope you enjoyed it! QwQ
A: It was good!
Q19: Oh boy, there are many reasons I went vegan, but to make a long story short so it doesn't turn into a Whole Paragraph, the biggest reason was the animal ethics stuff, which I hadn't really learned much about until recently -- and once I did, I just didn't feel right buying animal products and I knew that I could either respond to that by changing my lifestyle or feel bad as I continued to ignore it, and it was frankly easier to change my diet than to keep thinking about it because my brain has really been ruminating on ethics a lot this year??? Idk, that could be me being weird. And after that, I'd say because I'm personally big worried about the environment but I also don't feel like there's much I can personally do to help with it from my current position in life, but one of the biggest carbon sources that we contribute to individually is participation in animal agriculture, so it felt good to be able to feel like I'm doing good things there as well (although I would've done it either way, it's just a nice bonus). Anyway, long story short, outside of not realizing I wasn't getting enough iron and having to learn some new recipes, it seems to be going well -- no complaints!!!
A: Oh yeah. Congrats, you do you! :D
Q19: You actually had me on that April Fools prank for a minute, not gonna lie --
A: OH -- I didn't even realize that. Eh honestly, I don't think I'd really want to guest-star (for that matter) on Riverdale, it's not exactly my type of show I don't think.
Q20: Ooh! Why Greek???
A: Uhhh, good question. I think I was just bored during lockdown a couple years back, so I just started learning it lol. And also I learned about some of it from Greek mythology.
Q21: Tell me more about the Lotus Tower!
A: It's pretty tall around 350m (1,150 ft tall!). It's also a couple feet taller than the Eiffel Tower apparently! It has 8 elevators and 13 floors. And the Lotus Tower kind of looks like the Lotus flower (hence the name lol), I'll find more info when I have the time!
Aaaaand I think that's everything caught up! Finally!!! QwQ
I'm sad to admit it, but I'm not gonna be able to make it to the video meet this time -- the first half of it is over a trip I have to take to Toronto to present at a conference I'm not even close to ready for, so I know I'm gonna be crunching more homework until the moment I get back home, and then once I get home my family has decided to plunk down in my house and visit while I'm still kinda sorta supposed to be doing school things (because they were originally supposed to be visiting, like, this week, but now I'm so behind on last month's stuff that they didn't wanna add to it, but they didn't ask when would be convenient and so landed in the middle of a conference -- I love them to death, but it makes me wonder, rofl). In any case, I'm sorry I won't be there to say hi, but if you're still going to pop in and try to make friends with other mentors/students/etc, I hope you have ALL of the fun at it, because it's a really cool chance to meet really cool people!!! You'll have to let me know how it goes (and what new weird minigames they add to the Gather.town platform haha) if you do!
A: That's fine! You do what you have to do! Good luck and take care until we talk again next time!!! And also I gotta keep my answers short since I have to go eat dinner now lol. Peace out!
Quote of the day: -You don't need other people's approval to say that you're awesome, only you and people closer to you know how awesome you are!

Q1: On Minecrafting and mental health: Never a need to apologize for being late, I never answer anything expediently! QwQ Yeah, it's a fun game, but I'm still running into some issues with overplaying games over here... though thankfully my partner is out from the States this week to help me focus on my thesis-ing and get me back on track and it's been really healthy for me, which is why I'm finally getting around to my messages! Brain stuff has been really tough lately, honestly, but with good supports and resilience I'm hoping to pull out of the funk. I sense from your reply that you may be in a similar spot, so I hope you've got similar supports?
A: Oh okay. Good to know. I've been a bit of Mario games recently too lol. Oh so he left the States to visit and help? That's cool, good for you! Yeeeee, don't worry about being late! I was out of town a couple days ago (April 2, I think, but it was just a daytrip.) so I'm still trying to get energized lol. And also I guess I got your old font back it seems like (If I remember correctly, I think you said you hated Times New Romans.)
Q2: On biking: The snow is not yet gone, but they've finally got around to ploughing the sidewalks and bike paths, so for the most part I can finally get around! And as for the jelly legs, I'm just veeeeery unfit these days (have been since my surgery a couple years back!), so after that first bike ride I was all wobbly and unstable -- like jelly!
A: Oh yeah. That's good, better than having cold feet I guess lol. Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Hope you're okay <3
Q3: On Wednesday: I meant that I would watch it again if she asked me to, but that I doubt the writing/politics would change any from one season to the next -- which is fine, if I'm watching it to spend time with someone else, but isn't something I would seek out on my own! Agree that the classics are way better, though. :P
A: Well honestly, I can only say that people may have different opinions (yours is good), and yeah, classics are good thanks!
Q4: On trans care and community support: Both of these points are very very fair, and I wish you nothing but the best of luck in each case!!! QwQ
A: Thank you! :D
Q5: On book-binding and dancing: I've never thought about searching the dollar store for that stuff -- it might be worth a look next time I go out! And hey, that's really cool -- I was never good at dancing, but I've known folks who have really gotten into it! Did you dance as part of a group or just on your own? And is it possible to keep brushing up on your skills in your house until programs are running again? It's a darn shame that COVID has knocked so many of us out of the activities that we love, but it doesn't mean that we have to give them up 100%!
A: Oh, great! Mind you, I'm not really an expert but I guess it's probably your best bet if you're towards the cheap side I guess? Good question. It was groups when I had classes at the dance studio. I took ballet, jazz and a bit of musical theatre. Honestly, I forgot about it during lockdown but might not plan to return back as I am moving next year anyways. I guess, yeah.
Q6: On languages: It's funny that you dropped French but picked up Spanish -- I always found them really really similar in a structural sense (though I kept on with French and dropped Spanish because they stopped offering Spanish classes, so I suppose I feel you on having to swap out! QwQ). How is Hawai'ian for you??? That sounds so cool, but I wouldn't even know where to go about finding lessons (around here, at least -- maybe there are in your community?). What are the biggest differences between Hawai'ian and the other languages you've tried learning?
A: Lol, hilarious. I stopped French 'cause it was difficult for me to process certain words. It's going well, I know the basics (e.g, aloha - hello or goodbye, and pehea 'oe - how are you?) No, there are no lessons near me that I know of -- I am learning it myself (thanks, google translate.) As for differences, I'd say there are not a lot, but they're pretty fun!
Q7: On Aussie shampoos: Oh yeah, I remember the purple bottles, this does sound familiar! I think my mum was using it for a while -- my hair wasn't terribly frizzy, so I don't think I actually needed anything of such a high quality, but I believe she was going through a period of dyeing her hair at the time, which I've heard can frizz you up, so I expect that's why she bought it? Either way, it worked really well and was a win in my book!
A: Oh yeh. Like I mentioned before, mostly people with curly and coily hair use it, although I mentioned there were other collections for different types of hair (except oily hair, I think.) Oh nice, was it when you had curlier hair or was it just out-of-the-blue frizz?
Q8: On cross-stitching: Hey, you don't have to try everything under the sun -- sometimes it's nice to stick to what you know you enjoy! What kind of designs does your friend do? o3o
A: I mean, it depends on the person, because they might not have the same interest as other people, y'know? Oof, I'm not 100% sure if she still does it or not, I'll probably have to update you tomorrow (April 11)
Q9: On the quote of the day: This is good advice!!! I'm still working on how to think positively, but meditation and CBT skills have helped a lot! QwQ
A: Thanks! Same here, but its progressing I guess!
Q10: Would I rather be able to read minds or be able to teleport? Definitely teleport -- I think reading minds would be as much a curse as a blessing, and that people should generally be allowed to have some privacy, but teleporting would be SO convenient for getting places on time and running errands and getting home for visits??? So I would absolutely take teleporting. How about you?
A: Yeah, you have a point there. I couldn't come up with anything else lol. And also I think I was half asleep at the time I thought of it :^) Would probably choose teleporting as well.
Q11: On mentioning things: I... legitimately can't remember where I was going with that, haha. Might've been something I rewrote and then forgot to delete, we have such long message chains that I always end up forgetting something! QwQ
A: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q12: On LaPerms: Omg!!! I've never heard of these babies but I LOVE them now -- they're so fluffy and cute, like little clouds!!! QwQ
A: Yeah lol, I was bored, searching up different cats then I saw the LaPerm, I was surprised when it had curly-like hair! Lol

Q1: On Minecrafting and mental health: Never a need to apologize for being late, I never answer anything expediently! QwQ Yeah, it's a fun game, but I'm still running into some issues with overplaying games over here... though thankfully my partner is out from the States this week to help me focus on my thesis-ing and get me back on track and it's been really healthy for me, which is why I'm finally getting around to my messages! Brain stuff has been really tough lately, honestly, but with good supports and resilience I'm hoping to pull out of the funk. I sense from your reply that you may be in a similar spot, so I hope you've got similar supports?
A: Oh okay. Good to know. Oh so he left the States to visit and help? That's cool, good for you! Yeeeee, don't worry about being late! I was out of town a couple days ago (April 2, I think, but it was just a daytrip.) so I'm still trying to get energized lol. And also I guess I got your old font back it seems like (If I remember correctly, I think you said you hated Times New Romans.)
Q2: On biking: The snow is not yet gone, but they've finally got around to ploughing the sidewalks and bike paths, so for the most part I can finally get around! And as for the jelly legs, I'm just veeeeery unfit these days (have been since my surgery a couple years back!), so after that first bike ride I was all wobbly and unstable -- like jelly!
A: Oh yeah. That's good, better than having cold feet I guess lol. Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Hope you're okay <3
Q3: On Wednesday: I meant that I would watch it again if she asked me to, but that I doubt the writing/politics would change any from one season to the next -- which is fine, if I'm watching it to spend time with someone else, but isn't something I would seek out on my own! Agree that the classics are way better, though. :P
A: Well honestly, I can only say that people may have different opinions (yours is good), and yeah, classics are good thanks!
Q4: On trans care and community support: Both of these points are very very fair, and I wish you nothing but the best of luck in each case!!! QwQ
A: Thank you! :D
Q5: On book-binding and dancing: I've never thought about searching the dollar store for that stuff -- it might be worth a look next time I go out! And hey, that's really cool -- I was never good at dancing, but I've known folks who have really gotten into it! Did you dance as part of a group or just on your own? And is it possible to keep brushing up on your skills in your house until programs are running again? It's a darn shame that COVID has knocked so many of us out of the activities that we love, but it doesn't mean that we have to give them up 100%!
A: Oh, great! Mind you, I'm not really an expert but I guess it's probably your best bet if you're towards the cheap side I guess? Good question. It was groups when I had classes at the dance studio. I took ballet, jazz and a bit of musical theatre. Honestly, I forgot about it during lockdown but might not plan to return back as I am moving next year anyways. I guess, yeah.
Q6: On languages: It's funny that you dropped French but picked up Spanish -- I always found them really really similar in a structural sense (though I kept on with French and dropped Spanish because they stopped offering Spanish classes, so I suppose I feel you on having to swap out!

On Aussie shampoos: Oh yeah, I remember the purple bottles, this does sound familiar! I think my mum was using it for a while -- my hair wasn't terribly frizzy, so I don't think I actually needed anything of such a high quality, but I believe she was going through a period of dyeing her hair at the time, which I've heard can frizz you up, so I expect that's why she bought it?

Q: Hello again!!! Hope all's well with you -- I'm doing my best to exist and be a student at the same time, but the thesis-writing has got me painfully behind the curve, so I admit I've got my nose to the grindstone right now. But hey, on the other hand, I see you've mentioned it but I just started with Minecraft this week and am actively trying to stop myself from playing it constantly instead of homework because oh god is it easy to just lose hours of your life to Minecraft-- May others learn from my mistakes. QwQ How's you???
A: Hey, sorry for the late reply, it was busy yesterday lol. OH I didn't know you played Minecraft as well! Yeah, my Xbox 360 stopped working a couple years back. Oof, hope you are able to. Usually it takes a while to get bored of something but that's just what I think honestly. I'm okay I guess.
Q1: On talking things out with friends: This is a very good idea!!! I'm glad that you have a strong network of people who get you and whom you can actually be open with. Keep those ones close -- they matter more than you know. And thank you, I'm glad I met you, too. QwQ
A: Yeah, I will try because one of mine graduated last year -- she's still around town lol. I think my other one is planning to stay for a while too I think? Not sure about me but I guess I'll know when the time comes. Thanks, I appreciate it 😊
Q2: On birthdays: well then happy early birthday again which I assume is the 31st but if i'm wrong then happy belated birthday regardless aaaaaa
For real, the most important thing about time is that you spend it happily. Full stop. No matter what that means to you, a happy moment is never wasted. So as long as you take time to appreciate each day as it comes in small, tangible ways -- no matter how clichéd that sounds, because genuinely, I know it does, but it's the best advice I've got in life so far -- it's worth it. Sometimes that's all you need to take the edge off that fear, even if it doesn't just magically go away. I think a lot less about aging than I do about purpose while I'm here... as long as I'm working towards something I really care about, then I figure the actual number of years is secondary.
A: Thanks!! You were very close, it was the 30th lol. Thanks.. I needed to hear this. <3
Q3: On vitamins and field trips: I don't know much about the Kardashians, but I'd be suspicious of any product, let alone a health one, selling on fame alone??? But that could be the cynic in me. QwQ As for field trips, I used to have a bunch in high school, but they genuinely just weren't to interesting places -- I think the most fun I had was a visit to one of the nearby islands once to go hiking, but even then we didn't have activities like yours!
A: That's true, like I said before, doctors (and apparently gynecologists) have mixed feelings about it. Oh yeah, well I guess it depends on the subject at hand (and the teacher as well, unless they're more of a classroom fan than others lol)
Q4: On biking: Hey, can confirm that it's never too late to learn if it's something you're interested in!!! I just got out biking for the first time in mooonths and even though my legs were jelly after like fifteen minutes, it was absolutely worth it, haha.
A: Oh cool, good for you!!! Did you bike in the snow or is the snow gone? The snow is finally gone in my city!! Wdym your legs were ""jelly?"" Lol.
Q5: On Wednesday: Honestly, this is a moooooood. At the end of the day, I don't know if I necessarily expect it to suddenly get better, but if they put out another season and my grandma wants to pick it up again, I'd at least be willing to sit through it!
A: Wdym by that? I dunno either, I didn't have much interest in it. I would probably just watch the classics tbh.
Q6: On trans stuff: As long as you're happy with yourself, there's never a need to change anything For the Sake of Society(c) anyway, at least as far as I'm concerned. You could have the highest voice known to humankind and as long as you felt comfy in your own presentation, I'd say it's perfectly fine!!! And I have no doubt that your generation will be nothing but supportive. QwQ
A: I'm still thinking about it, but I'll probably have to get a lot of stuff out of the way first though lol. I guess they probably would, but not 100 percent sure due to controversy with the LGBTQ2S+ community 乁( •_• )ㄏ
Q7: What is a hobby I've never tried but thought about trying someday? Ooh, I'd say book-binding! I've seen people make their own journals and stuff and it just looks so cool, but I have no idea how it works and I own none of the tools and I guarantee it's all expensive, so I'm holding off on trying it until I either find a friend into it or suddenly find buckets of money, haha. How about you?
A: That's sounds neat! It probably depends on the supplies you need for it, and the cheapest is probably Dollarama (or Dollar Tree in this case lol.) I dunno, I think I have this in my bio but I used to dance but I quit due to COVID.
Q8: On other languages: I took French as my minor in my undergrad! I never figured out how to speak it all that well, but I can write and read and such, albeit rustily, I'm sure.
A: That's cool, I took French until high-school (Grade 9), so I just gave up on it and decided to learn other languages for fun lol. I'm currently learning Spanish and Hawaiian :D
Q9: On Aussie shampoos: I genuinely don't know -- I think my mum used to buy them? If it's the one I'm thinking of, I think it was pretty good compared to the generics I'm buying now, at least???
A: Yeah, they have purple bottles and it smells pretty good actually -- I think most people use it for curly and coily hair but there's a collection for wavy hair, and different ones for volume and frizz control lol.
Q10: On knitting: I did it once upon a time -- my mum taught me a long time ago, but every time I tried I would mess up stitches and then forget how to do it right altogether, so I never got into it??? Highly recommend cross-stitching, though!
A: Oh nice!! Oof, not really an easy skill it seems like. I've never done cross-stitching, but my friend has however.
Q11: On ramen: I used to!!! Never tried it with just veggie stock, though, so we'll have to see if it still holds up, haha.
A: The vegatable stock is okay, I mostly eat the Kimchi brand though lol.
Q12: On bird whistling: As in whistling back to birds??? I can never do it realistically, but I definitely try -- they're so lovely, they deserve a conversation once in a while!
A: Yeah, I guess so -- I saw some of them on YouTube haha :p Yeah they are, just watch out when you have food lol!!

Q: On your poem: I... know the feeling. I'm glad that that isn't a present/real experience for you, but it sounds like you've been there, and I have too, at times. I know that art is just art, sometimes, but if you ever do start to feel that way again, I really hope you'll tell someone you trust and let them in to shine a little light on that darkness; sometimes we don't realize how much power others can return to us just by listening. QwQ I hope you're in a better place today. Be kind to yourself.
A: Yeah, apparently I had a fear of dying for 2 and a half years (I was thinking about what you said about looking forward to the stages of life.) Well I was talking to my friends about it recently and they said they were willing to talk to about it if I needed to. But thank you so much, I appreciate it. I'm glad I met you. :)
Q1: On birthdays and health and field trips and making music: Hello again!!! First off, have you reached your birthday yet? If so, happy birthday -- and if not, happy early birthday -- unless the ""birthday blues"" suggest that it's not the sort of thing you personally celebrate? I've never felt too strongly one way or the other about aging, just looking forward to the many stages of life left to go! Can't complain about gummy multivitamins, they taste infinitely better! And yeah, vitamin D is normally from the sun, but because there ain't much sun around here, I probably wasn't getting enough of it to begin with for my system, and I thiiiiink that vegans need a lil extra vitamin D anyway because it helps us absorb calcium better from other supplements? There's some sciency stuff to it, all I know is that I keep buying the stuff, lol. And on the field trip -- it sounds like you had an awesome time omg!!! That's a lot more Experiences(c) than I ever got to look forward to on a class field trip, by a long shot. I'm glad that you got to try so many cool things, and that your teachers managed to tie it into your curriculum, to boot!
A: Hi, how's it going and no, but it's getting close (hint: it's at the end of the month.) Yeah, feels like its getting shorter by the moment, but I dunno. That's just my fear though. Yeah, better than vitamin pills to be honest. And also it's not really sunny where I live right now -- it rains most of the time. More flavour too, tbh. Apparently there is this vitamin gummy brand going around recently, the brand is called ""Lemme"" (I dunno if you know Kourtney Kardashian) and apparently doctors have mixed feelings about it. And yeah, it was fun! I'm guessing you haven't been on much field trips?
Q2: On many forms of physical activity: Never too late to mention it if you wanted to!!! And I haven't tried that yoga pose, but uhhhhh I googled it for two seconds and there's no bloody way I could hold myself off the floor like that, haha. I would need so much more practice to get to that point! Maybe hiking is a more accessible activity, come to think... QwQ The distinction on bikes makes sense, I don't know much about them admittedly--
A: True lol. It's pretty difficult, but I think there are some easier ones as well I think? Same, I've never rode a mountain bike or a normal bike for that matter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q3: On Wednesday: Yes, I am talking about Tyler!!! Very cringe to have the only character seemingly dealing with his mental health issues in a constructive and communal way end up being secretly Big Evil, in my opinion. Enid was a difficult one for me, because I didn't mind her as a character -- I think irl I would have struggled a lot more with the sheer amount of endless chipper positive energy, but on screen it wasn't horrible -- but, much like my issues with Tyler, I felt that Enid completely missed the mark of her character arc by ending up transforming at the end. Like, they were CLEARLY setting her up to be an allegory for 2SLGBTQ+ marginalization -- with the ""wolfing out summer camps,"" the ""my parents could never understand me"" backstory, the clear struggle to fit into an otherwise homogenous monster-school culture... and so when she finally did wolf out, even if it was To Protect Her Friends, it was just like -- oh. Oh, so it's not okay for her to just be happy unless she also fits into this heteronormative paradigm. That's a shame. Oh well. I felt like most of the marginal representation in Wednesday was that shallow level of critique, though -- being willing to semi-represent different groups, barely and only in metaphor, but then not digging down to actually realize what it meant subtextually to set up those parallels and then not follow through? Idk. It was one of those things where I came away feeling entertained, but troubled the more I thought about it, too. That's how a lot of media is for me, tho!
A: Oh yeah, I respect your opinion. I on the other hand didn't think very highly of Tyler since I wasn't sure if it mattered tbh. Yeah, well her character description and traits just made me snarl in my head honestly. So I didn't think highly of her either. I would honestly rather watch paint dry then trying to listen to her trying to say or do something that would make her regret it later in the series like that, but that's just my standing opinion however. But yeah, I hope the series gets better though I guess (if not, I mean there's not a lot we can do at this point lol.)
Q4: On crafts: I love the energy of ""this was going to be bigger but now I'd rather just make it longer and get it over with"" knitting, haha! Me too, 100%. And hey, Cancun trip sounds lovely! QwQ (I'm not surprised that it's popular, lots of people are really into the tropics!) And oooooh, I can't imagine making your own dresses like that, that's so sick!!!!!
A: Yah!! Have you knitted before? Yeah, I guess mostly like Hawaii, Paris, etc lol. Yeah, it's pretty cool!!
Q5: On transcare and the Island: Oh, no worries! Maybe you haven't had to deal with 'performing' for care, which would be a great step forward for the trans world tbh -- I guess I mean the urge that some of us older folks have felt (and maybe still feel? I guess it depends where you are and who you talk to) to ""fit the stereotypes"" of trans-ness that doctors have come to expect in order to get approved for things... it's unfortunate, but I've heard it a fair bit from friends I have in the community, depending on where they get care and how knowledgeable their specific doctors are about transgender things. I'd like to think that that issue is actually getting better over time, though, especially now that transness is more visible in the medical community? In any case, I've been grateful thus far to find multiple doctors who are attentive to my needs and I've generally felt that I could be honest with them all the way through, so I wouldn't worry about it too much -- I'm hoping your generation has it easier, is all! I'm sorry to hear things are rough with the family situation, though -- I know that money stress can be a BIG thing that contributes to conflict around the house (something that my mum and I went through quite a bit when I was younger), so I hope that you're doing well and that you've got the support you need. QwQ And yeah, if you do end up on the Island, I could very well happen to pass you on the street one day -- you never know!!!
A: Ohhh okay, I just didn't understand what you were saying before. (Thought it was dancing or theatre-wise) Oh yeah. Well I wouldn't exactly worry too much, because I do have some facial hair on my face and my voice is somewhat deep lol. And I know you said before that you had a natural deep voice as well, if I'm correct. Yeah, my generation would most likely as well since it's talked about a lot and there are a lot of campaigns for the LGBTQ2S+ community. And no worries, we are trying our best (even though my parents don't really work anymore due to illness and injury.) Yeah maybe, we'll definitely have to catch up I think!!! I might be between Nanaimo and Victoria!! (✿^‿^)
Q6: What's my favourite video game? Uhhhhhhh, it's really hard to pick a favourite, honestly! My stand-by answer is always Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, just because it's a game that massively defined my childhood and future interests, but I haven't actually played many games in a long time... the only one I'm currently messing around with is a fangame called Poké Wilds?
A: Cool! I grew up playing Minecraft until I was in middle school lol.
Q7: On golf: I've never tried it, but my partner says it's fun!
A: Nice! I didn't know he played golf.
Q8: On the encouragement: Thank you!!! I wish you all the same, my friend!!! And you be sure to be unique, too!!!
A: Thank you!!! You toooooooo!!!!! Sending virtual hugs!!! ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ
Q9: On clothing trends: Ooh, I could absolutely second the grunge and the graphic tees!!! I hadn't heard of waffle-knit until now but those shirts look heckin comfy too, I wouldn't complain at all if this became a thing!!!
A: Yep, it's pretty cool not gonna lie! Yep, I'm pretty sure they exist, but they're probably a bit harder to find these days l think lol!!
Q10: Would I rather be a doctor but wearing tropical clothes or would I be a teacher wearing trendy clothes? I would absolutely rather be a teacher in trendy clothes -- I do NOT have what it takes to be a medical doctor, no matter how many cool Hawai'ian flowers I could have on my shirt, haha!!!
A: Cool choice!! I mean, you're not wrong there lol!!
Q11: On music and apparently Squid Game: I love chill music teachers who actually give you the room to explore the things that you're most interested in instead of sticking you into a pre-set list of songs; honestly, being too confined in the kind of music I wanted to learn was what kinda pushed me out of piano lessons in the end. So I'm glad that you got a chance to experiment! I'm surprised to hear you talk about Squid Game, though (because maybe I'm just a sensitive oldie, but I found that show almost too much for me to watch content-wise, haha -- though it was a pretty cool critique of capitalism up until they apparently started making a completely theme-ruining reality show about it after the fact, which is peak yikes?????). In any case, it sounds like you can officially do more on the guitar than me, so congratulations on that! ;P
A: Yeah, I've only watch bits and pieces of Squid Game but didn't watch the full episodes though. funny enough he used to go to VIU (I dunno if you know him or not lol) and yeah he did make us do one song which was ""Take It Easy"" by Eagles but it was for a class assignment. Haha, thanks!! Nah, I don't think you're a sensitive oldie -- you're generally a cool and caring person and that's all that matters in this case.
Q12: On Immortals: Oi, we do like a show with immortality and psychic powers and ominous-sounding character names -- I may snoop when I have the chance!
A: Lol, you definitely should!
Q13: On whistling: Well thank you very much!! QwQ I'm glad to hear that you've learned to whistle inwards, that's the first step to managing it yourself -- you'll be ahead of me in no time!!!
A: I guess so, you never know though -- but hey, if there is another Gathertown hangout happening, I think whatever you song/melody you whistle comes to mind, it'll be cool!!! And also I've watched videos of people doing bird whistling too haha!

QOTD: What is a hobby you've never tried but thought about trying someday?",8:39PM March 21
mentor commented at,"6:13PM March 21 
A: Thank you, you too!!! Oh yeah, he said that I might have to start taking vitamins (I take the gummy ones, because I have hate towards the pill) to help my immune system in that case lol. Vitamin D from the sun? Correct me if I'm wrong lol! Oh congratulations on going vegan! I've never gone vegan before but good for you, I'm happy for ya! No worries! I'm back and okay now, I just left for a bit. I have the birthday blues sneaking up on me since my birthday is towards the end of March (yay.) But happy belated birthday though! Hope you had a good one :D I haven't been the best, but I'm trying! And also I guess I'm making music now so yay lol! I disappeared from the platform for a couple days as well due to school (including the field trip.) Which the field trip went good by the way, it was cold and snowy though. One of the teachers from another class read this book called ""Oolichan Moon"" for the last bit the bus ride, I was playing Subway Surfers the whole bus ride though while my class and another class blared music. Funny enough, they played Taylor Swift music on the way back to school lol. We dip-netted for ooclican, and we stopped at a lake (it was like an ice rink and some of my classmates were skating and sliding on it lol) and we cooked it and roasted it over the fire, and it was so good!! We also had donuts, cookies and also one of my classmates bought stuff for s'mores!! So I had a good time :p And also I was video-chatting with my friend (the one who taught me how to beatbox!) Not sure if I'm gonna visit him and his family though, I guess I'm gonna have to plan with my family and find out!
On birthdays and health and field trips and making music: Hello again!!! First off, have you reached your birthday yet? If so, happy birthday -- and if not, happy early birthday -- unless the ""birthday blues"" suggest that it's not the sort of thing you personally celebrate? I've never felt too strongly one way or the other about aging, just looking forward to the many stages of life left to go!
Can't complain about gummy multivitamins, they taste infinitely better! And yeah, vitamin D is normally from the sun, but because there ain't much sun around here, I probably wasn't getting enough of it to begin with for my system, and I thiiiiink that vegans need a lil extra vitamin D anyway because it helps us absorb calcium better from other supplements? There's some sciency stuff to it, all I know is that I keep buying the stuff, lol.
And on the field trip -- it sounds like you had an awesome time omg!!! That's a lot more Experiences(c) than I ever got to look forward to on a class field trip, by a long shot. I'm glad that you got to try so many cool things, and that your teachers managed to tie it into your curriculum, to boot!
On many forms of physical activity: Never too late to mention it if you wanted to!!! And I haven't tried that yoga pose, but uhhhhh I googled it for two seconds and there's no bloody way I could hold myself off the floor like that, haha. I would need so much more practice to get to that point! Maybe hiking is a more accessible activity, come to think... QwQ The distinction on bikes makes sense, I don't know much about them admittedly--
On Wednesday: Yes, I am talking about Tyler!!! Very cringe to have the only character seemingly dealing with his mental health issues in a constructive and communal way end up being secretly Big Evil, in my opinion. Enid was a difficult one for me, because I didn't mind her as a character -- I think irl I would have struggled a lot more with the sheer amount of endless chipper positive energy, but on screen it wasn't horrible -- but, much like my issues with Tyler, I felt that Enid completely missed the mark of her character arc by ending up transforming at the end. Like, they were CLEARLY setting her up to be an allegory for 2SLGBTQ+ marginalization -- with the ""wolfing out summer camps,"" the ""my parents could never understand me"" backstory, the clear struggle to fit into an otherwise homogenous monster-school culture... and so when she finally did wolf out, even if it was To Protect Her Friends, it was just like -- oh. Oh, so it's not okay for her to just be happy unless she also fits into this heteronormative paradigm. That's a shame. Oh well. I felt like most of the marginal representation in Wednesday was that shallow level of critique, though -- being willing to semi-represent different groups, barely and only in metaphor, but then not digging down to actually realize what it meant subtextually to set up those parallels and then not follow through? Idk. It was one of those things where I came away feeling entertained, but troubled the more I thought about it, too. That's how a lot of media is for me, tho!
On crafts: I love the energy of ""this was going to be bigger but now I'd rather just make it longer and get it over with"" knitting, haha! Me too, 100%. And hey, Cancun trip sounds lovely! QwQ (I'm not surprised that it's popular, lots of people are really into the tropics!) And oooooh, I can't imagine making your own dresses like that, that's so sick!!!!!
Can confirm that cooking can be a fun and rewarding experience, and also that it is absolutely 100% important and I highly recommend learning it for all sorts of reasons! I didn't truly feel independent until I figured out how to feed myself, tbh. QwQ
On Immortals: Oi, we do like a show with immortality and psychic powers and ominous-sounding character names -- I may snoop when I have the chance!
On whistling: Well thank you very much!! QwQ I'm glad to hear that you've learned to whistle inwards, that's the first step to managing it yourself -- you'll be ahead of me in no time!!!

On clothing trends: Ooh, I could absolutely second the grunge and the graphic tees!!! I hadn't heard of waffle-knit until now but those shirts look heckin comfy too, I wouldn't complain at all if this became a thing!!!
On transcare and the Island: Oh, no worries! Maybe you haven't had to deal with 'performing' for care, which would be a great step forward for the trans world tbh -- I guess I mean the urge that some of us older folks have felt (and maybe still feel? I guess it depends where you are and who you talk to) to ""fit the stereotypes"" of trans-ness that doctors have come to expect in order to get approved for things... it's unfortunate, but I've heard it a fair bit from friends I have in the community, depending on where they get care and how knowledgeable their specific doctors are about transgender things. I'd like to think that that issue is actually getting better over time, though, especially now that transness is more visible in the medical community? In any case, I've been grateful thus far to find multiple doctors who are attentive to my needs and I've generally felt that I could be honest with them all the way through, so I wouldn't worry about it too much -- I'm hoping your generation has it easier, is all!
I'm sorry to hear things are rough with the family situation, though -- I know that money stress can be a BIG thing that contributes to conflict around the house (something that my mum and I went through quite a bit when I was younger), so I hope that you're doing well and that you've got the support you need. QwQ And yeah, if you do end up on the Island, I could very well happen to pass you on the street one day -- you never know!!!
On the encouragement: Thank you!!! I wish you all the same, my friend!!! And you be sure to be unique, too!!! 
Would I rather be a doctor but wearing tropical clothes or would I be a teacher wearing trendy clothes? I would absolutely rather be a teacher in trendy clothes -- I do NOT have what it takes to be a medical doctor, no matter how many cool Hawai'ian flowers I could have on my shirt, haha!!!
On golf: I've never tried it, but my partner says it's fun!
What's my favourite video game? Uhhhhhhh, it's really hard to pick a favourite, honestly! My stand-by answer is always Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, just because it's a game that massively defined my childhood and future interests, but I haven't actually played many games in a long time... the only one I'm currently messing around with is a fangame called Poké Wilds? 
 
On your poem: I... know the feeling. I'm glad that that isn't a present/real experience for you, but it sounds like you've been there, and I have too, at times. I know that art is just art, sometimes, but if you ever do start to feel that way again, I really hope you'll tell someone you trust and let them in to shine a little light on that darkness; sometimes we don't realize how much power others can return to us just by listening. QwQ I hope you're in a better place today. Be kind to yourself.",6:13PM March 21

                                                                                   Nothing will make me cry
Here I am, wallowing, not wanting to get out of bed. But there is this emotion wanting to get out of me. There are thoughts picking at me like looking for gold in a gold mine. I feel wrecked. I want to cry until people forget I exist. But why would I do that? I don't know but deep down, those are my thoughts talking.
(Disclaimer: What you read was not a real experience of mine. I have been through something similar like this at one point, but this is something I wouldn't wish upon myself or anyone else. I just wanted to say it in poem version instead of writing thousands and thousands of words.)",8:41AM March 20

Hey, happy March!!! :'D I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough day -- it's always important to take the time you need, so no rush, but I'm here when you're ready to return. I know how it is to just... have to go Exist(c) sometimes. QwQ My health has been good -- I feel you on the multivitamins, since I've gone vegan I've had to pick up quite a few of them just to make sure I'm getting my B12 and vD and calcium and all that in, you don't realize how important they are until it all catches up to you honestly -- and I hope that you're feeling better, mood things aside!
A: Thank you, you too!!! Oh yeah, he said that I might have to start taking vitamins (I take the gummy ones, because I have hate towards the pill) to help my immune system in that case lol. Vitamin D from the sun? Correct me if I'm wrong lol! Oh congratulations on going vegan! I've never gone vegan before but good for you, I'm happy for ya! No worries!

Not sure if I'm gonna visit him and his family though, I guess I'm gonna have to plan with my family and find out!
Q1: On yoga and hiking: Yoga was actually really good for me for the short while that I tried to get into it -- it was something I think I tried alongside tai chi (highly recommend!) and kickboxing (highly recommend but less so because it's hella expensive to get equipment for! QwQ); I find that lower-energy activities that really get me focused on feelings in my body helps to relax my mind in a way that I don't get a lot by accident, what with all the ADHD bouncing around in there. I might have to try yoga again down the line now that I've gotten into meditation -- I feel like yoga is sort of just the active version of it? As for hiking, I've never done super long hikes, but I used to go for an hour or two and follow trails back home! Once the weather is good out here in Saskatoon, I'll be back up to biking, at least (I'm not sure if my bike counts as a ""mountain bike"" in any sense, though -- it's built for rough terrain, but maybe it doesn't count unless it's motorized???).
A: Oh cool! I think my mom was gonna sign me up one time, but she probably forgot by the time school started back again lol. Oof, my not-so-favorite pose from yoga is crow pose. And I heard Chakrasana is pretty difficult to do. Oh kickboxing? Damn, I didn't know you did that! Awesome, the last time I went for a ""hike"" was back a couple years ago (around 2014-2015?) with my babysitter (she was nice, but I think me and my sisters would prank each other most of the time lol. Me and my sisters were in elementary at the time) Neato!!! I think mountain bikes are just like your regular, typical bike but the wheels looked thicker when I looked it up? For off-road biking, I think you might be talking about a dirt bike I believe lol.
Q2: On propoganda and Netflix: I absolutely feel you on this -- infighting and misinformation is everywhere. It's important to get away from it wherever you can for your mental health, at least insofar as possible considering how inundated we all are in our technology... I had to delete my Reddit account for the sheer amount of doom-scrolling I used to do, and though I have a Facebook technically, I check it literally once a year when folks wish me a happy birthday and try not to stay long. I don't even own a TV out here anymore, and honestly, I don't miss it at all, haha. As for Netflix, I do still watch that, but I agree that it's hard to really find anything ""worth"" watching half the time. I mostly use it as an excuse to have social time with my grandma, and finding a show that she hasn't watched, regardless of quality, is almost impossible from the onset; ergo, we literally go down the line and find ANYTHING that's new to both of us, and as long as we can both stomach it, that becomes our next series, lol. I haven't seen much of Stranger Things, but I found Wednesday alright too, albeit lowkey (sometimes highkey) colonial at parts and maaaaybe not technically the best mental health representation (if you've seen to the end and you know which character I'm talking about, cough cough). But I think it's OK to enjoy things while also recognizing flaws like that -- being aware of them is what matters, and it had a lot of good messages about friendship and consent and growing up, too, so all in all I'm glad I watched it! QwQ
A: Yeah I know, it's crazy of what the world suddenly turned into since lockdown a couple years ago (except the recipes were okay like the Dalgona coffee, I thought it was good!) Reddit is okay I guess, I ususally read it when I'm on break at school, or unless I'm playing Subway Surfers or just producing music from the apps I mentioned before lol. Yeah, Wednesday was okay I guess, I didn't like Enid very much though. I watched it with my sisters and family-friends. funny enough, I borrowed from the school's guitar (I had guitar class at the time, dunno if I told you or not but its fine lol.) to practice at home for a test and I decided to play along with her cello solo and it was pretty hilarious lol. Oh wait a minute, are you talking about Tyler? If not, then correct me! Yeah, Stranger Things is due for one more season, but when I was watching it with my family, it was happy, scary and sad. I also watched Love, Simon a few times when I had Disney+ before and it was good and had some pretty life-changing experiences. If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it for ya! (aaaand also there's books for it too lol) Yeah, when I was younger I would watch things like Blue's Clues, 4 Square, etc.
Q3: On cakes and knitting: I think I actually own Rosanna Pasino's geek cookbook!!! It must be back in BC, but I had an absolute craze of collecting intentionally geeky cookbooks back in the day (it was the only thing that engaged me in the act of Learning to Cook(c)) and the name sounds very familiar! As for knitting, that was one of the few things I tried craft-wise that I was notoriously bad at, probably because doing things in the wrong order is criminally unforgiving (in cross-stitch, if you miss a stitch, you can go back and put it wherever you want; in knitting, if you miss a stitch, something looks wonky foreeeeever!!!). It was something my mum really enjoyed when her eyes were good enough for it, though, so I'm still really fond of the concept. QwQ
A: Cool!! My friend was crocheting what used to be a blanket, but I think she said it was a scarf now? Not sure because she made it back in January/Feburary before she went on her Cancun trip, she said it was good!! (apparently Cancun is becoming a popular vacation spot now haha) But now she's making her walkup dress and prom dress which is pretty cool!! Can't wait to see how it turns out :D Lol, but its a pretty neat hobby you picked up there! I mean cooking is a nice thing to do and I guess in that sense, its pretty important!
Q4: On favourite books: I've heard of Heartstoppers and possibly The Immortals (although I could be thinking of a different author on that one???) but don't know much about them -- I might have to check out Heartstoppers on Netflix if it still exists there and I ever get a free day from all the thesis-ing to be a person (aaaaaaa). How are you finding The Immortals? What's it about?
A: Nice!! I believe Heartstopper is still there! The Immortals series is pretty good so far -- It's about a girl named Ever Bloom who unfortunately loses her family in an car accident and develops pyschic abilities and has been turned immortal by a guy named Damen Auguste. (I will not spoil the rest lol.) Oh and apparently there looks to be a movie happening soon but not sure, but when I was looking it up, I saw the announcement on the book author's Instagram page! So maybe there might be a movie but don't know for sure!!
Q5: On music: Yesssss!!! I'm glad we got to rock out on our Gather.town call! :D
A: Same!!! It was SO much fun! I liked how you were vibing, singing and whistling haha
Q6: On how loud I can whistle: Loud enough to hurt my ears, but proooooobably not loud enough to spook the local wildlife -- although I bet I could if I could figure out how people do that whistling thing where they put their fingers in their mouth and make that sharp trill sound??? I've never been able to figure that out, but I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy it if I did anyway, so admittedly I'm not trying very hard, haha!
A: You could watch videos on YouTube or look it up on Google if you want more clear instructions I guess, but it shouldn't be very hard I think? Coming from me, I think you are pretty talented when it comes to whistling tunes like what you were doing on Gathertown the other day, it was pretty awesome! If you can't do it, try again until you get it down perfect, you will get it eventually!!!
Q7: Quote of the day: I'm learning a lot of this lesson lately, thank you for the healthy reminder! QwQ
A: Thanks!! Not sure what you mean though lol. No worries on that healthy reminder though!
Q8: If I could play one instrument, what would it be? I can already play piano and semi-kinda-sorta ocarina, but I think it would be really good to actually know how to play the acoustic guitar that's been sitting here for as long as I remember... and then hey, if I can pick another one, I've always been fascinated by the cello??? There was this band I listened to back in the day called Apocalyptica that did a bunch of covers of Metallica songs, but just in cello, and it was just. Gorgeous. Such a big clunky instrument and probably super inconvenient and expensive to own, but in a fantasy world where I could do whatever I wanted??? Cello.
A: That's cool! I think my French teacher back in Grade 8 would play a video off YouTube and the channel was called 2CELLOS I believe. My friend has a piano too and plays on it and also I have a piano as well, but my sister plays it the most lol. I could somewhat play acoustic guitar, but the only songs I know how to do is ""Put Your Head on my Shoulder"", Red Light, Green Light from Squid Game, and I was learning how to play the Mii Theme :p (I was bored and Guitar class was pretty easy-going at the time I guess and most of the time you could do basically whatever song you wanted to do on guitar. The teacher's chill, he's pretty cool too haha.)
Q7: Which fashion trend would I bring back? I feel like you asked me this one on stream, but: BIG. GOOFY. HATS. I stand by this statement 100%.
A: Haha lol, you do you!! Well most of the fashion trends from the 80s-90s already came back but I'd say flannel shirts, graphic shirts, cargo pants, grunge clothing and can't forget about tye-dye shirts and acid-washed jeans. Although I can't really say if people wear acid-washed jeans anymore lol. Oh and I've been obsessed with waffle-knit henley shirts!
Q8: On coming out and talking to TransCareBC: Omg, I'm so excited for you!!! No need to rush at all, but that's really cool and I hope that everything goes lovely when and if you do take that big step. QwQ When you reach Vancouver Island, if you're looking for a really good transcare doc, I highly recommend Dr. Patricia Seymour at the Coleman Clinic in Duncan  -- you can even tell her I sent you if you'd like, haha! She's so kind and understanding and I didn't feel the need to 'perform' for her at all in order to get the care that I needed, which was such a validating and comfortable experience. She's the doctor who got me approved for my hysterectomy and put me in touch with a really lovely and validating surgeon (Dr. Liston who's also in Duncan, in case that's ever a name you need, but idk what your plans are and transition is always a unique individual journey!!!) and she was just... so sweet. I have an amazing memory of going in to see Dr. Seymour when I had first come out and was all nervous to get my gender marker change paperwork signed off on by an Official Authority of the Medical World(c) (which you need in order to get approved), and I walked in and just told her how nervous I was about doing something that would 'fail' me in front of her, and how badly I wanted to do the thing, and how I would come back no matter how many times she said no, and she just, like, took it and signed it and said ""there you go, now you don't have to worry about that part, now let's talk about your life and how you're doing and see what else we can do for you"" and it was sO WONDERFUL I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS--
A: I'm not 100% sure what you mean about ""performing"" (curse my ASD sometimes.) Cool!! I'm not so sure about the move to Vancouver Island yet because of financial problems, family situations and stuff like that. But my mom said that it's a possibility. Fingers crossed!! I don't know if we will bump into each other at some point or not when I move to Vancouver Island (will most likely be either in Nanaimo or Victoria) if you visit Vancouver Island again lol.
Bonus Question: Thank you for wishing me well on the homework; it's three days overdue and I'm kinda freaking out about it over here, but I'm working hard and doing my best to catch up and show my professor what I'm capable of! I wish you all of the luck with whatever's going on in your life and I hope things get better soon. Take your time and don't let people define you, my friend. QwQ
A: Thank you :) No worries, you show them who's boss!! Don't forget to eat and drink water or your favorite drink (food and hydration are key!!!) And don't forget to stretch and go for a nice walk around the block (if you can lol.) Heck, whistle with the birds to make it more fun haha!! Sending virtual hugs and high-fives :D

I haven't seen much of Stranger Things, but I found Wednesday alright too, albeit lowkey (sometimes highkey) colonial at parts and maaaaybe not technically the best mental health representation (if you've seen to the end and you know which character I'm talking about, cough cough). But I think it's OK to enjoy things while also recognizing flaws like that -- being aware of them is what matters, and it had a lot of good messages about friendship and consent and growing up, too, so all in all I'm glad I watched it! QwQ
On cakes and knitting: I think I actually own Rosanna Pasino's geek cookbook!!! It must be back in BC, but I had an absolute craze of collecting intentionally geeky cookbooks back in the day (it was the only thing that engaged me in the act of Learning to Cook(c)) and the name sounds very familiar! As for knitting, that was one of the few things I tried craft-wise that I was notoriously bad at, probably because doing things in the wrong order is criminally unforgiving (in cross-stitch, if you miss a stitch, you can go back and put it wherever you want; in knitting, if you miss a stitch, something looks wonky foreeeeever!!!). It was something my mum really enjoyed when her eyes were good enough for it, though, so I'm still really fond of the concept. QwQ
On favourite books: I've heard of Heartstoppers and possibly The Immortals (although I could be thinking of a different author on that one???) but don't know much about them -- I might have to check out Heartstoppers on Netflix if it still exists there and I ever get a free day from all the thesis-ing to be a person (aaaaaaa). How are you finding The Immortals? What's it about?
On music: Yesssss!!! I'm glad we got to rock out on our Gather.town call! :D
On how loud I can whistle: Loud enough to hurt my ears, but proooooobably not loud enough to spook the local wildlife -- although I bet I could if I could figure out how people do that whistling thing where they put their fingers in their mouth and make that sharp trill sound??? I've never been able to figure that out, but I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy it if I did anyway, so admittedly I'm not trying very hard, haha!
Quote of the day: I'm learning a lot of this lesson lately, thank you for the healthy reminder! QwQ
If I could play one instrument, what would it be? I can already play piano and semi-kinda-sorta ocarina, but I think it would be really good to actually know how to play the acoustic guitar that's been sitting here for as long as I remember... and then hey, if I can pick another one, I've always been fascinated by the cello??? There was this band I listened to back in the day called Apocalyptica that did a bunch of covers of Metallica songs, but just in cello, and it was just. Gorgeous. Such a big clunky instrument and probably super inconvenient and expensive to own, but in a fantasy world where I could do whatever I wanted??? Cello.
Which fashion trend would I bring back? I feel like you asked me this one on stream, but: BIG. GOOFY. HATS. I stand by this statement 100%.
On coming out and talking to TransCareBC: Omg, I'm so excited for you!!! No need to rush at all, but that's really cool and I hope that everything goes lovely when and if you do take that big step. QwQ When you reach Vancouver Island, if you're looking for a really good transcare doc, I highly recommend Dr. Patricia Seymour at the Coleman Clinic in Duncan  -- you can even tell her I sent you if you'd like, haha! She's so kind and understanding and I didn't feel the need to 'perform' for her at all in order to get the care that I needed, which was such a validating and comfortable experience. She's the doctor who got me approved for my hysterectomy and put me in touch with a really lovely and validating surgeon (Dr. Liston who's also in Duncan, in case that's ever a name you need, but idk what your plans are and transition is always a unique individual journey!!!) and she was just... so sweet. I have an amazing memory of going in to see Dr. Seymour when I had first come out and was all nervous to get my gender marker change paperwork signed off on by an Official Authority of the Medical World(c) (which you need in order to get approved), and I walked in and just told her how nervous I was about doing something that would 'fail' me in front of her, and how badly I wanted to do the thing, and how I would come back no matter how many times she said no, and she just, like, took it and signed it and said ""there you go, now you don't have to worry about that part, now let's talk about your life and how you're doing and see what else we can do for you"" and it was sO WONDERFUL I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS--
Thank you for wishing me well on the homework; it's three days overdue and I'm kinda freaking out about it over here, but I'm working hard and doing my best to catch up and show my professor what I'm capable of! I wish you all of the luck with whatever's going on in your life and I hope things get better soon. Take your time and don't let people define you, my friend. QwQ",8:40PM March 11

Q1: On respiratory viruses: Oh no! I hope you're taking it easy and getting all the rest you need (and hopefully the antibiotics are helping kick its butt by now!). Fingers crossed that you can have a mellow existence until your next appointment and that all goes well! QwQ
A: Ehhh, I'm alright right now I think lol. I do not take antibiotics currently, but I had them before (it was a wild + trippy experience!!!) Yes thank you!! Hope your health is doing good as well!!
Q2: On hiking and yoga: Yoga I've tried, but admittedly I really miss nature now that I don't feel like there's as much ""woodsy"" stuff to see out here -- hiking is a really good one!!!
A: Ooh! How did yoga work out for you? Yes, me too! Helps the headaches and such. Have you been hiking before? I heard people do mountain biking lol.
Q3: On TV/computers and misinformation: It's super overwhelming!!! It definitely feels like the Internet Age has really accelerated how much misinformation we have to sift through, just by virtue of giving us so much more content to deal with... I'm really working on limiting my general social media intake just to avoid the mental health consequences of it all. QwQ With that said, I'm not necessarily nostalgic for any sort of time Before Propoganda(c)??? Because every medium and story comes with underlying presumptions, no matter how wholesome the story tries to be... so I'm not sure I believe that there was a ""good old days"" before that was happening -- maybe just a ""good old days"" before I understood that it was happening and had to put up with it, haha.
A: Yes exactly!!! Especially with COVID news and stuff (old news is no news.) Yep, propaganda is as chaotic as a contruction area. Twitter is usually where [most of] the typical propaganda is. Yeah, I wish there was the ""good old days."" Too much drama on Netflix's end too, I think. Some of their movies are okay. (I just don't really like their original TV shows/movies very much especially that goes for reality shows, but me and my family only watch it for the memey, trashy drama though haha. Stranger Things is pretty good and Wednesday is okay lol. And also most of the good TV shows/movies got removed, including most childhood shows like Blue's Clues :( (they moved most Disney and Nickelodeon TV shows/movies (well except Sam and Cat, Victorious, Henry Danger and The Thundermans) to their own streaming platforms.)
Q4: Quote of the Day: Yes!!!!! I have to tell myself this often these days. QwQ
A: Please do!! :D
Q5: What talent do I have but never use often? I would saaaay cake decorating is one of those niche skills that used to be a daily thing at my job but is now just an occasional ""oh hey, I can do that, there's a holiday coming up and I still have the icing tips!"" sort of thing. Also, certain types of art that I've picked up but haven't done consistently probably count -- I learned acrylic paint last year but have hardly touched it since, same with cross-stitching. Lots of tiny talents that would crop up a lot more if I had more time for them, but for now they can wait patiently and hopefully not rust too much!
A: Oh that's cool! I've been watching baking channels too -- I don't know if you have heard of Rosanna Pasino but she is a really good YouTuber who bakes and stuff!!! Cross-stitching and painting are cool too, rainy days activities galore!! Have you knitted before?
Q6: Do I have any favorite books? Oh so many aaaaaa! When I was a kid I was super into The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, along with Redwall and Warriors (when I was younger -- I think eventually Warriors got repetitive, but Redwall had such good descriptions of things that it might be worth another go!), and as I've grown up I've been more and more into series like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and a bunch of weird one-offs that I've run into in the course of my school things, like Chorus of Mushrooms by Hiromi Goto (just a gorgeous book artistically).
A: Hey hey, that's so cool! I believe I have heard of the book before, but have never read it! Lol, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are nice books too! I recently found out that Heartstopper was a book series lol. (and also it's a TV show and it's pretty amazing) And I have a book series called The Immortals by Alyson Noel, it's pretty epic lol. Chorus of Mushrooms sounds funny (just by title, not sure how it is out of context)
Q7: On music folks: I've heard of a lot of these artists, but haven't listened to all of them -- but I love Alec Benjamin!!! I believe I used to listen to Big Time Rush and Ariana Grande back in the day, too, though I never got much into One Direction (maybe because it was ""cool"" and I used to want to be counter-culture about everything??? glad to have grown out of that).
A: Haha, good to see you're an Alec Benjamin fan too! My favorite would be ""Water Fountain""! Oh that's cool, belting out yesterday's era!! Lol, I listened to One Direction a couple times but never really listened to their songs again. My best friend is a fan of them lol. Me and my best friend also listen to a bit of Zendaya's music haha. Lol, good for you!
Q8: On watching Avatar and loud whistling: Highly recommend the first activity, don't recommend the second, rofl. I can whistle loudly, but I generally try to avoid it!
A: I already watched the first one, it was pretty good to be honest. Oh yeah, especially in public haha. I don't really know how to whistle well, so I can't really say from experience lol. How loud can you whistle anyway? (like extreeeeeemeeely loud that deers can hear, or low whereas other people can probably hear?)
Q9: Would I rather wear tropical shirts or trench coats in the summer? Since my transition I've become a bit of a tropical shirt fan, but trench coats are still VERY cool and I burn like crazy out in the sun, so I'd do both!
A: Awesome!!! That's pretty fashion forward I'd say! The pun: Dressing like a detective on summer days lol.
Quote of the day: -As long as you pick yourself up, you can dodge anything that would try to ruin a perfectly good day.
Qs-OOTD: If you could play one instrument, what would it be? (two instruments is fine if you had a couple favorites lol) If you had a fashion trend, which one would you bring back?

Q1: On thesis-ing: I'm sorry to hear you have a cold!!! Hopefully that's cleared up. QwQ A thesis is like a really long essay -- 80-100 pages made up of essentially four essays tacked together on one overarching topic! It's the big final boss of my MA program and I'm having a heck of a time of it over here (which is prolly why I'm so sporadic checking in with my messages aaaa); I've got to draft the first 10 pages by tomorrow night in order to send them to my supervisor and then hopefully polish them up as much as I can before we meet next week, and it isssss a lot. Quite a lot. But I'm passionate about it, so it's gotta be worth doing!
A: Oh wow! That's a lot, I understand if you message periodically, we've all got busy lives it seems like! It is worth doing and completing stuff. That's alright, I went to the ER (again for the third time maybe?) and turns out I had a respiratory virus. but still am a bit sick and I have a doctor's appointment towards the end of the month to find out why lol. (I got sick November, December and the second half of January.)
Q2: On meds and non-meds: I feel you on things being equal solutions -- I definitely find that meds can only take you so far, just like anything else can only take you so far, so having a bunch of coping strategies rolled up together that all support each other (whether or not that includes medical treatment, I'm sure for some folks a bunch of non-med strategies just work better for them!) is usually the most successful way to go, I find!
A: Yeah, I mean you're right there. Hiking and yoga are good strategies.
Q3: On surgery: I am totally OK -- it was very much worth it and I have no regrets!!! No need for concern, but thank you for caring. :P
A: Glad to hear!
Q4: On family stuff: No worries, my friend! I know we've got limits to what we can talk about, but at least I can say -- from someone who knows what it's like to some extent -- that things can absolutely get better to handle as you grow up and gain some independence and distance from it all. It may not sound like much, but I hope it helps. QwQ
A: Awh! It did. :)
Q6: On truth and weather: Absolutely!!! I'd always rather someone be honest with me at the end of the day, no mater what. And hey, we've had a lot of those sunny-but-cold days over here lately... I almost prefer it when it's cloudy out, just because it traps the heat in!
A: True that! And cool, I guess so! In my city it's mostly cloudy as well as rainy too haha, the weather in my city is pretty wacky! I didn't know it traps heat haha. 
Q7: On iCarly: It's a meme now??? I didn't know that! Of course, I also didn't know they made a new one, which is... probably yikes. I feel like the very premise of iCarly was tied to its time -- as in, the era in which the internet was this new and strange thing people weren't really used to growing up with to some extent -- and a lot of the comedy that comes from the idea of being a streamer is probably just, like, half the audience's day to day existence now? It was good while it lasted, though!
A: Yeah it is lol. There is a reboot that came in around 2021 but it's not really the same as it was (reference lol.) so I didn't really bother to watch it at all. :/ Yeah, I kinda miss the old days where there were cartoons and funny movies/TV shows and not platforms that spreads misinformation today (I'm talking about you TikTok.)
Q8: Do I have a favourite singer/band? I definitely couldn't pick just one!!! At a glance, picking a random assortment of bands: Halsey, Falling in Reverse, Twenty One Pilots, Mother Mother, Cavetown, Panic! At the Disco, Saint Motel, Icon For Hire, Marina & The Diamonds, Rise Against, Bug Hunter, Sweatshop Union, Waxlimbs, Breaking Benjamin, Downplay, Glass Animals... the list kinda goes on forever, so I guess I really can't say I have a favourite, lol! How about you?
A: Ooooh, I think I've heard/listened to most of these lol. Ummm, I'd say maybe Harry Styles (I listen to his music sometimes), I sometimes listen to Alec Benjamin, probably Ariana Grande, and I recently found out about a music artist named Andrew Bird but I listen to his music once in a while lol, but I think that's pretty much it on my end haha :)
Q9: On the Quote of the Day: Hey, that's actually really helpful for me today, thank you. QwQ
A: I'm glad it helped!!
Q10: Would I rather have the ability to whistle super loud or control water? DEFINITELY to control water, 100% -- sometimes I whistle too loud for my own ears already, so I'd probably find having super-whistling really uncomfortable! Whereas water powers would have all sorts of cool uses -- have you ever seen Avatar: The Last Airbender? Waterbending was, like, my favourite thing from that show!
A: That's cool, waterbending is epic! I have seen snippets and clips from Avatar, but haven't watched the full episodes lol. I didn't know you whistle super loud haha.

Hello again from the far reaches of the Internet void!!! We're deep in thesis-struggling (not quite thesis-writing!) over here but I'm doing my best -- I hope you're doing OK too! QwQ
A: Oh that's cool! Is it for an essay or something? You can do it, I believe in ya!!!! :D I'm okay, just dealing with a cold again, except it's not too bad lol.
Q1: On anxiety meds: Oh dear!!! I understand not wanting to bring it up if they're not super receptive to the conversation -- that can make things harder to deal with, too. With that said, if they're kind of receptive to it, I wouldn't count them out as supports -- but I would also look up resources on your own time if you can! 
In terms of chemical/brain stuff, I mean to say that I think medication worked for me because I (presumably) have some kind of chemical imbalance that physically causes anxiety to trigger (as opposed to, say, if your brain is producing all the required chemicals to be calm but you're experiencing external factors, eg. traumatic situations or environmental stress around you that influences you into anxiety -- which I think would probably be best looked at in terms of therapy? although as a person with some life trauma, I can say that having it stack on top of chemical imbalances meant that I needed meds and some external emotional support to figure my stuff out, myself, so again, it's all down to what works best for you as an individual). Chemical-wise, I just found that being on meds allowed me to calm and focus myself in ways that no amount of breathing exercises/talk therapy ever could, even though those things helped somewhat (and still continue to -- meditation is really useful for me!!!); so I'm betting that they correct a probable lack of serotonin in my brain that was causing/worsening those symptoms beyond the point where I could tackle it without filling the tank with more serotonin, so to speak.
All of this to say: medication and therapy and meditation and diet/exercise and support networks and all of the other things people use to make their lives easier with anxiety can be helpful, whether on their own or as one of a bunch of healthy coping strategies, and none are inherently better than others -- you just need to figure out which ones work best for you (and don't let anyone else tell you that there's a ""right way"" or a ""wrong way"" to cope -- as long as what you're doing doesn't hurt yourself or other people, then I'd say all strategies are equally good and moral and kind!).
A: Yeah, that's true if you ask me. I have been actually -- especially for ADHD and other ones too! I mean, it depends on what. I mean it could be equal solutions too you know? 
Q2: On acid reflux: Oh no, I wasn't upset with you asking! I only asked why because I was curious to know if you were asking for personal reasons, ie. that you had it too and were looking for advice or some such (the best advice I can really give is not to lie down immediately after eating or to prop yourself upright against a pillow so that gravity keeps everything down a little better!). And hey, I don't think any of us think we're equipped for big scary situations like that until they happen, but I have no doubt that you'd be resilient no matter what life throws at you! I always used to think surgery would be an impossible scary hurdle for me, but it ended up not being nearly as big of a deal as I thought it was when I went in for the first time a couple years back!
A: Oh okay, thank you. That's good to know. Oh hope you are okay from surgery! 
Q3: On families and distance: No worries at all for the vent -- I relate to it, actually. My biological parents split up when I was one year old and they fought over me all through my childhood/teen years in court, so I know how it can be to have Family Tension(c) to a high degree. I get along with both of my parents better now that we're out of that stage and I'm an adult at a distance from them, but I never really got ""close"" with my dad due to all the lost time and the arguments on both sides for why the other parent was evil or whatever; I can't say that I have any good advice on that front, except to keep close to the folks who feel healthy for you to be around and to recognize that your family is (at the end of the day) who you choose for it to be, not just who's related to you by blood. If you want to reconnect with your dad, maybe one day you will when you get the same sort of freedom and distance that I've had moving away and being independent; if you don't, then it's OK to feel that way too, and to heal from whatever grief that leaves you with whenever/however works best for you. Human existence is complicated and it's never gonna be perfect, but I'm glad that you feel comfortable sharing and I hope things get figured out for you one way or another (if anything in life can ever be said to be 100% ""figured out""!).
A: Awh man, that sucks. I wish I could say more, but y'know safety, rules and stuff. Thank you though, you've been a good mentor/friend. Glad you understand :) I hope you get through your stuff too
Q4: On doctors: Then that's a start! As long as you're comfy with this one, I'm happy for you!
A: Thank you!! 
Q5: On dating things (and snow!): Hey, I feel that, things turn out that way all the time -- and it was brave of you to share your feelings either way, and definitely an act of love and growth to be able to respect her in turn and to care about her as a person regardless of her status as a friend or partner. I'm proud of you for this! QwQ And yessss, it's freezing out here right now -- probably too cold for extra snow, tbh, but we've had the same batch just frozen on the ground for months and it never seems to go away, so we get all the fun of trudging through it and none of the days off, haha. (And I'm glad that I can help, thank you!!! QwQ)
A: Thank you for helping me, it's always good to know the truth whether you are saddened by it or happy, it's just good to know one way or the other. And oof, the weather in my city right now is pretty iffy and it changes too lol. It is currently cold but sunny as I am writing this! 
Q6: On trans visibility and customer-service voice: Yeah, you're picking up my meaning on the voice thing -- for some reason I always talked in a way higher voice at work, so that was the part that took me the longest to get rid of when I was training myself to speak lower??? It could be unique to me, though, lol. And on trans-ness in school, I definitely agree that the numbers will go up -- I remember seeing almost no trans visibility when I was in high school (maybe one kid was trans??? and there was one who was gay??? but it was never, like, discussed at all??? which is better than bullying them, of course, but it was sort of a neutral tone rather than a positive support of them, if that makes sense) but I visited my old school last summer and found that they'd started an entire LGBTQIA+ group and I met like five other enbies in one sitting and a bunch of other happy queer kids who were all handing out buttons and advocating for neutral bathrooms and stuff around the building and it was just -- it was so cool. I have no doubt that that positivity will spread as the years go by. QwQ
A: Yeah, that's true. I hope it does, because it needs more positivity all around!!!! 
Q7: On ""business"": My bad, I meant ""busyness"" as in ""my being busy"" lol! And yeah, I've heard rumblings that they could do other video chats in the future, but I'm not sure anything's finalized yet? I'll let you know if I get any emails about it!
A: Yeah, I got an email about a survey about if they should do it again (and so far she said it's been positive feedback!) and I spoke to Juliet about it as well :)
Q8: Quote of the day: A G R E E D
A: Thanks! 
Q9: What were my favourite cartoons growing up? This is a tough one, becaus I watched a lot of TV growing up but we had very few good channels to choose from -- so I was mostly stuck with whatever was on YTV when I was little? Which I guess would translate to, like, early Spongebob, the occasional Pokemon episode when it happened to air at a convenient time for me, aaaand some other ones that I remember just ran all the time so I ended up watching them, like iCarly and such? I'm not sure I ever had a strict 'favourite' because there were so few shows to choose from, but I appreciated whatever would entertain me at the time (usually while I ignored it to play video games anyway!).
A: Hey hey, that's pretty cool! Spongebob is (I guess) full of nostalgia!! Pokemon is cool too! iCarly was too at some point I think -- apparently they made a reboot and it's not really the same as it was before lol. And iCarly became such a meme over the years as well!
Q10: Would I rather have invisibility or super speed? This depends on the details of the power! If super speed was, like, ""you can do anything you want way faster, but without making the sort of mistakes that you usually make when you try to rush through things"" then I would take the speed power 100% -- I never feel like I have enough time in life to get anything done, and to stretch out my days way further and have more time to do the things I enjoy (albeit faster!) then I would love to. BUT. If the super speed is like ""you can do things faster but you're rushing and not enjoying/noticing anything the whole time and you feel like you're in a constant rush every time you use it"" then I'd infinitely rather not have that power, because it would just be a constant temptation to do the stuff I care about, worse, with less relaxation than I already have (which isn't much, because my brain already goes pretty fast sometimes!!!). In that case, I think invisibility would be a really cool power, because it's sort of synonymous with slowing down and being sneaky -- I could do for quiet walks through the woods and see all the animals that are normally afraid of me, or sneak into the movies and stand in the back and see what's worth buying a ticket and popcorn for instead of winging it, or just enjoy getting to wander around and see the world from a new perspective!
A: That's true lol. Speed could do some good I think -- you could get to places faster!! And invisibillity is cool too -- you could go for quiet walks in the woods and sing with the birds!!! :p

Hello again from the far reaches of the Internet void!!! We're deep in thesis-struggling (not quite thesis-writing!) over here but I'm doing my best -- I hope you're doing OK too! QwQ
On anxiety meds: Oh dear!!! I understand not wanting to bring it up if they're not super receptive to the conversation -- that can make things harder to deal with, too. With that said, if they're kind of receptive to it, I wouldn't count them out as supports -- but I would also look up resources on your own time if you can!
In terms of chemical/brain stuff, I mean to say that I think medication worked for me because I (presumably) have some kind of chemical imbalance that physically causes anxiety to trigger (as opposed to, say, if your brain is producing all the required chemicals to be calm but you're experiencing external factors, eg. traumatic situations or environmental stress around you that influences you into anxiety -- which I think would probably be best looked at in terms of therapy? although as a person with some life trauma, I can say that having it stack on top of chemical imbalances meant that I needed meds and some external emotional support to figure my stuff out, myself, so again, it's all down to what works best for you as an individual). Chemical-wise, I just found that being on meds allowed me to calm and focus myself in ways that no amount of breathing exercises/talk therapy ever could, even though those things helped somewhat (and still continue to -- meditation is really useful for me!!!); so I'm betting that they correct a probable lack of serotonin in my brain that was causing/worsening those symptoms beyond the point where I could tackle it without filling the tank with more serotonin, so to speak.
All of this to say: medication and therapy and meditation and diet/exercise and support networks and all of the other things people use to make their lives easier with anxiety can be helpful, whether on their own or as one of a bunch of healthy coping strategies, and none are inherently better than others -- you just need to figure out which ones work best for you (and don't let anyone else tell you that there's a ""right way"" or a ""wrong way"" to cope -- as long as what you're doing doesn't hurt yourself or other people, then I'd say all strategies are equally good and moral and kind!).
On acid reflux: Oh no, I wasn't upset with you asking! I only asked why because I was curious to know if you were asking for personal reasons, ie. that you had it too and were looking for advice or some such (the best advice I can really give is not to lie down immediately after eating or to prop yourself upright against a pillow so that gravity keeps everything down a little better!). And hey, I don't think any of us think we're equipped for big scary situations like that until they happen, but I have no doubt that you'd be resilient no matter what life throws at you! I always used to think surgery would be an impossible scary hurdle for me, but it ended up not being nearly as big of a deal as I thought it was when I went in for the first time a couple years back!
On families and distance: No worries at all for the vent -- I relate to it, actually. My biological parents split up when I was one year old and they fought over me all through my childhood/teen years in court, so I know how it can be to have Family Tension(c) to a high degree. I get along with both of my parents better now that we're out of that stage and I'm an adult at a distance from them, but I never really got ""close"" with my dad due to all the lost time and the arguments on both sides for why the other parent was evil or whatever; I can't say that I have any good advice on that front, except to keep close to the folks who feel healthy for you to be around and to recognize that your family is (at the end of the day) who you choose for it to be, not just who's related to you by blood. If you want to reconnect with your dad, maybe one day you will when you get the same sort of freedom and distance that I've had moving away and being independent; if you don't, then it's OK to feel that way too, and to heal from whatever grief that leaves you with whenever/however works best for you. Human existence is complicated and it's never gonna be perfect, but I'm glad that you feel comfortable sharing and I hope things get figured out for you one way or another (if anything in life can ever be said to be 100% ""figured out""!).
On doctors: Then that's a start! As long as you're comfy with this one, I'm happy for you!

Q1: In my experience, starting anxiety meds was one of the best things I ever did -- probably in no small part because they kinda sorta helped with the ADHD symptoms I didn't know I had, too. I started because I was, like you, really stressed in all sorts of areas of life; panicking (plus ADHD symptoms cough cough) got in the way of doing school stuff on time, so I was really freaked out doing all of my assignments last minute, plus I had a lot of emotional dysregulation to deal with (another thing I later realized was ADHD) that was making it difficult to relate to family members and keep my cool in a general sense... so for me, it was very much worth the downtime of being sick and adjusting to them in order to get to a place where I was suddenly a lot calmer and more capable of handling my feelings and intentions in life! But that's not the only path to handling anxiety if you're struggling with it -- finding a professional counsellor/therapist/etc to talk to can help you learn coping strategies that you can perform regardless of meds, and things like meditation still help me a great deal. I think the path that's best for any one person dealing with stress is bound to be different -- for me it was really chemical/brain stuff that I found I couldn't handle without taking a medication approach, but if anxiety is something you struggle with consistently (or even intermittently but in a way that makes you feel like you really can't handle it when it pops up) then I would recommend looking into the whole gamut of options and seeing which one(s) you're most comfortable with! Have you talked to anyone in your family you trust about it or looked up resources yourself?
A: That's true, and I guess in the best way it is ideal. I don't know if I have talked to them about it, conversations usually get heated whenever we drag on topics like that so I try my best not to bring it up all the time. But I do bring it up sometimes however. I try to look at resources whenever possible I guess. Chemical brain stuff? Science? 
Q2: On acid reflux: I have, although not to a really horrible extent -- I think as a teenager my diet contributed to some reflux that, for me, wasn't necessarily painful the grand majority of the time but had the consequence of making me clear my throat constantly? I had classmates ask if I had vocal tics because I did it so often, but I think it was just the back of my throat being bugged by it (and it seems to have largely gone away since I moved out and started cooking healthier, until I eat a bunch of sugar and then it starts back up again). My mum had it really bad, though -- she ended up getting burns in her throat for years that they had to stop via a surgical procedure that wrapped her esophagus around her stomach, such that the acid physically couldn't flow upward anymore... which is a super extreme case, I'll admit, so almost definitely not representative of most folks. Why do you ask?
A: Sorry, that's my mistake. I guess I'm just curious (I have a curious brain, so you might want to keep that in mind.) and also I sorta have it myself. Awh, sorry about her. Hope she's okay. That's a really long journey. She sounds like a strong and brave person, I would never be able to build myself to be brave, strong or courageous, y'know.
Q3: On families and distance: This is also true!!! I think it's harder on my mum because she spent most of my childhood as a single parent and pretty exclusively in my company -- so when I moved away, it was a really big shock to her system, whereas for my step-dad, he was used to having a few kids and they all moved out closer to him for the most part, so while he still misses me to death I think he copes with the distance a bit better? All down to what you and your folks are used to in terms of proximity!
A: I guess so, when you think about it that way. Oh yeah. So it was all like one big family pretty much? I guess so, because I don't exactly get along with my dad anymore so we drifted apart and I would only talk to him from time to time. I don't know how much longer it's gonna go on, but heaven knows. Sorry you had to read this, but I thought I would tell the truth and possibly vent as well. I just don't really like lying about my life to people and being phony all the time. It just feels fake, if you know what I mean.
Q4: On doctor switching: Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing at the onset -- do we like this one???
A: I don't really know, I've mostly forgotten all the previous doctors I had before lol. So maybe I guess?
Q5: On prom and weather: I feel you on being busy prepping for big events like that -- just don't forget to take care of yourself along the way!!! And oi, we used to get rain all the time back on the Island; I used to really hate it then, but now that my weather is, like, 100% snow for at least half the year, I find rain doesn't bother me nearly as much, lol! (And a bonus note on resolutions: it's OK to make goals that you don't reach!!! I used to kick myself about this a lot because I used to believe in this all-or-nothing idea that if you Failed(c) to do 100% of the thing you set out to, then there was no point doing any of it... but really, I go out of my way to set goals I don't expect to attain now, because they can still motivate me to do 10 or 20 or 50 or 99% of the thing and that's still buckets more than I would have done without the initial inspiration!)
A: Thanks, you too! I'll be getting measured for my suit pretty soon :p And last year, I confessed to my best friend and told her I like her, but she didn't feel the same way but that's okay, y'know? It happens. Snow, must be freezing most of the time over there, huh? Actually there was a snowstorm in my city the other day and apparently the power went out for a while at school and we had the day off but we had the go back the next day lol. I like this a lot! Good for inspiration, you really are an aspiring mentor :)
Q6: On voice changes: I actually didn't have any voice effects from my (incredibly low and mostly concentrated wherever I put it rather than free-flowing throughout my whole system) hormones -- I lowered my voice consciously over time when I first came out and trained it to be natural, though! I think mine was always a bit low, but mostly I had to train out the instinct towards, like, ""customer service voice"" if that makes sense? Like, at home I would speak mostly like I do now, maybe a bit higher, but whenever I went to work I had to speak over this big freezer buzzing noise in front of my station, so I got into the habit of speaking in a higher register to cut through the noise... it took a looooong time to break that habit, haha.
A: Oh, I see. In my school, there's currently not really a lot of trans/non-binary students and staff, but their population will probably increase in the next couple years, but that's what I think. Oh, I don't really understand, but from what I've read so far, so by ""customer service voice"" like store-wise? Correct me if I'm wrong.
Q7: On music tastes: I vibe with this!!! Very cool!!!
A: Yeah, I found out about R&B music I believe when I was either in elementary or in middle school.
Q8: On ocarinas: Ayy!!! I admit most of what I've seen of ocarina videos has been people learning how to play the songs from the video game that inspired me to start learning it, but I'm glad you're exploring and I hope you found some neat music! :P

Q10: Would I rather be 4 feet or 10 feet tall? I think, if nothing else in my life changed at all, being 4 feet tall would be way more convenient to my existence; most buildings/rooms/etc are built for people up to maybe 6 and a half feet tall, so past that you'd run into constant social issues trying to fit in and access basic services, and while I don't mind standing out -- I'm very much used to it haha -- I don't think that being 10 feet tall would offer me enough actual benefits to be worth the extra inconvenience (as opposed to, like, ""would you like to be able to fly BUT you have to deal with having really big wings on your back that make it hard to fit into most cars/through doors/etc?"", which I think I would consider depending on how far I could fly, if that makes sense).
A: True that lol, I guess it adds up, eh? Oh lol -- I forgot about the doors/cars/etc! I am forgetful. Yeah, I think I get where you're coming from ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q11: On Zooming and anxiety and meds and aaaaa: Oi, no worries about awkwardness or business or shortness of answers at all!!! I'm just glad that school was/continues to be going well and that we had a chance to meet up and, hey, it sounds like you're having a lot of fun between brownies and guitar stuff and family-ing it up, so no complaints! QwQ I'm feeling a fair bit better now, too, as the pills settle down! 
A: Well hey, after all it was my first time lol. I made crepes lol. Good to hear you're doing better! The dinner went good :D What business? But otherwise it was super cool to meet you in video chat! There might be another video chat meeting sometime soon but not sure yet!

Happy National Mentoring Month!!! Thank you for your patience with me, I know I haven't been around in a bit; getting back into the swing of things at school has taken up a lot of my time and energy and I'm kinda sorta going through a medication change to try and deal with anxiety (which, while definitely a good thing to be doing, has the un-fun side effect of making you feel gross for a while while you wait for your body to get used to the new dose) -- but we will prevail!!! I'm looking forward to meeting you on the Zoom thing tomorrow too! :D
No worries, I was busy with school and all (I had a guitar test and it surprisingly turned out good! The song I did was ""Put Your Head on My Shoulder"" lol.) And also I was making a lot of goods at school (I made brownies on Friday!) Oh no, I'm sorry to hear about that. I do not know what it is like to take anxiety meds but I have been stressing a lot. Hope all goes well. And also my answers will be pretty short, because I am going out for dinner haha :p
Q1: On vacations, Christmas, and resolutions: Cancun was pretty hype!!! Bit of whiplash getting back to this wintery weather though, lol. It would be really exciting to get out and see relatives, I imagine!!! And congrats on the Chromebook, I think I used to have one of those -- it was really freeing for me getting my own computer and being able to do research whenever I wanted... but also, don't let it suck you in too much, remember to unplug sometimes and spend time with your family! QwQ As for resolutions, that's actually not a bad answer -- statistically, goals are more likely to be achieved when you WANT to achieve them, not just when an arbitrary date comes up. Good on you for holding off until you know what you want to do! 
A: Thanks, I will try my best to unplug sometimes. I think Prom is gonna occupy me for a while lol. Yeah, the weather has been acting up in my hometown right now but no more snow. Just wind, overcastiness and rain galore! (If you were in my hometown, you would probably be sick of the rain so much you will look out the window and start singing ""Rain rain, go away!"") Yeah, I just do not like to have resolutions because I know I may forget to do them or I might not do them at all. 
Q2: On doctor-switching and hormones: 3-5 times is a lot of swapping doctors! I've heard that's more of a thing in rural areas, but I never realized how much so... as for me, I only switched doctors once before I moved, to find a doc more sympathetic to my gender needs, and she was the one who got me on hormones -- which isn't really necessarily just one treatment, because what kind of hormones folks go on to change their bodies for transition purposes can look really different from person to person? I have other non-binary friends who are on really strong hormones that have drastically changed how they look, but I'm personally only using a really small topical dose to target specific areas of dysphoria for me without changing too much of how the rest of my body looks. So for me, it's not ""like"" much at all tbh, because it's been so minimal -- although the changes I have had have made me very very happy, so I'd say it's nothing but positive in my experience! -- but I've heard that it can be a really big difference for others who are on stronger hormones and have to deal with a bunch of changes all at once. I have a friend who's a trans woman and she's described her experience as pretty much a whole second round of puberty, so I'm guessing for her it's probably come with more inconveniences and side effects and monitoring -- but she's also just incredibly happy with the results, so like, no complaints honestly!!!
A: Oh yeah. That's cool! Did your voice change during hormone therapy or was it the other way around? I'm just curious lol. Oh congratulations to her! She is strong, that's for sure! Hope she is doing good :)
Q3: On Winterfest: Yes, that sounds just like Light-Up!!! I love those sorts of events -- especially the snacks and hot chocolate, haha.
A: Totally cool! 
Q4: On flight delays: I'm not sure who's still stuck or not (I'd really hope everyone would be home by now!!!), but I did hear a great deal about WestJet and airlines flying out of certain airports (Vancouver? Calgary?) having BIG issues over the holidays... really hoping it's resolved for everyone! And I'm glad to hear that everything went well with the doctor -- I feel you on not enjoying the bloodwork (and to be honest I ended up dodging mine entirely because I didn't feel like it was necessary in my specific situation!), but it's good to have the reassurance, at least! QwQ
A: Yeh, it was all over the news and airlines were getting ""sued"" and criticized pretty much. But I do hope they get home too. 
Q5: On parenting styles: Oh, absolutely!!! And it's not like you're ever going to feel prepared whether you are or not -- like, no matter who you are, you're still a young person going out into the world for the first time, and being told ""congrats! you're an adult now!"" means, like, nothing??? Nothing, haha. I was encouraged to do some saving for university in high school -- and spent a very long time at a job I would have liked to quit much sooner in order to do it, admittedly -- and while I'm glad that I did, it's still a great deal of luck and scholarships that actually got me where I am, and I can't discount that at all. And no kidding on being closer to family -- there are a lot of folks I just didn't get to see this year and I miss them. QwQ But it was still a good vacation!
A: I guess it depends on the family I guess. Some families are good with it, some are different. 
Q6: On Universal Studios: Well, I didn't go alone, so I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted before everyone else got tired (lol) but I got to see some of the Harry Potter World stuff that they had set up! They had a Hogwarts exhibit and one of those 4D chair rides and everything, which was pretty neat. Also went through the Jurassic Park water rafting ride (where they have a big animatronic tyrannosaur lean down and pretend to try and eat you before the last waterfall, which is very well done) and I think we went through a horror exhibit (which isn't my favourite but thankfully it was so crowded that there wasn't enough room for anything to be scary???). All in all, it was a VERY busy day, but worth it... though I'm not entirely sure why people end up getting season passes to go over and over and over again, because once you've Had the Experience(c), I feel like it might not have as much repeat value over time???
A: That's pretty cool! Extremely :D
Q7: What's my favourite music genre? I don't think I have a favourite! My tastes are pretty broad, everything from video game music to rock to pop to lofi and classical and country and rap and jazz and everything in between -- I'm genuinely not sure I could pick one! Do you have a solid favourite???
A: Ayo, that's cool! Ehhh, I'd say R&B, pop, and I guess lofi too :p 
See you tomorrow aaaaaaa!!!
A: You too!!!
And also I found this YouTube video on ocarinas and it's pretty cool!

Happy National Mentoring Month!!! Thank you for your patience with me, I know I haven't been around in a bit; getting back into the swing of things at school has taken up a lot of my time and energy and I'm kinda sorta going through a medication change to try and deal with anxiety (which, while definitely a good thing to be doing, has the un-fun side effect of making you feel gross for a while while you wait for your body to get used to the new dose) -- but we will prevail!!! I'm looking forward to meeting you on the Zoom thing tomorrow too! :D
On vacations, Christmas, and resolutions: Cancun was pretty hype!!! Bit of whiplash getting back to this wintery weather though, lol.

Q1: On finding ""home"": It definitely takes time to figure out what ""home"" means -- I'm still not entirely sure I've figured that out! It's a complicated mix of factors that means different things to different people, I guess. Like, being a settler Canadian for example, I have a tenuous relationship with 'belonging' on territories that weren't necessarily mine to belong on, so even in BC where I felt at home, I recognize that that looks and feels different for me than it would for someone with a stronger connection to the actual land/ecosystem. And yet, when I moved out to Saskatchewan, that also felt like discovering home because this is where my family migrated from when my grandma was little -- so I've sort of found a generational connection to the territory around me in that way (colonial and problematic though it continues to be -- I'm still working that part out!). Home can be so much -- where you are, why you're there, who you know, who really knows you... I'm not sure there's ever a one-size-fits-all definition!
A: Oh, that's cool! I don't think I've heard the term before, but I immigrated to Canada with my mom when I was a year old. That is very true! And also it's about the memories we make there as well. I guess it's not just the connections we make there, but what we learn from our surroundings too!
Q2:  On world politics and seeing elephants: That is indeed how the world is -- thankfully people who see that as the injustice it is are growing up and will hopefully one day be able to steer things in a better direction than our forebears. QwQ I have never seen an elephant in real life -- that is very, very cool!!!
A: Yeah, I hope the world becomes a better place in the future! Yeah, it's really awesome!! :D
Q3:  On having class-schedule variety: I actually think that system of learning sounds like it could be really productive??? Like, you're probably less likely to get bored with what you're doing, because it's only ten weeks, but then you also don't have too many subjects all at once piling homework up on you! But then, I suppose they're probably way more condensed classes as a result of that timeframe, so maybe it all balances out... have you found it good or bad or somewhere in between, in your learning experience?
A: Yeah, it was structured like that since this year I believe? Last year, I think it was only one class a day for 5 weeks lol. Yeah, before COVID hit, it was 5 classes a day (which most people couldn't handle!) 
Q4: On chard and bulk-cooking: I definitely have never eaten it raw and so do not use it for salad -- I think it's less like a lettuce and more in the same class as cabbage, where the leaves are a lot to digest if you don't break it down with boiling first??? I could be wrong, though. And as for bulk-cooking... I recommend anything that will freeze, as long as it's enough variety to keep you from getting bored (eg. if you eat meat, then I'd recommend choosing three dishes with all different meats, or if you have two that overlap, making sure they're prepared in really different ways/with different flavours)! I just grabbed groceries for my next few weeks, for example: I'm making a family pack of chicken (8+ meals, seasoning the chicken three or four different ways so I'm not just eating the same food over and over) with steamed broccoli and carrots (not super interesting but healthy and I like them), a beef stew with veggies and mini potatoes (which most people think you can't freeze, because potatoes sort of hold water and end up gushy once they've been frozen, but I've found that if you defrost your food in the microwave and take it out a couple times along the way and prick/squish the water out of the potatoes, they turn out pretty normal!), and cabbage rolls with some kinda Knorr rice on the side (mostly an excuse to use up my Knorr packs that've been sitting in the cupboard for quite some time, haha). Once I've cooked everything up and done all the veggies to go with each dish, I cool them completely and then I pre-portion them into Rubbermaid containers (so each one has a dinner's worth of food all ready to go) to stack in the freezer. Saves on a ton of dishes/cooking mess/etc for 2-3 weeks!
A: Oh haha! I thought about lettuce for a second, I looked it up and it sorta looked reddish-purple? Oh that's a lot of food for bulk-cooking! And it sounds healthy too! Definitely gonna try and start eating healthy after my bloodwork. 
Q5: On surfing: I'm suddenly jealous that I never knew in time to try this, haha!
A: It's pretty cool but be careful!
Q6:  On schoolening: Thank you, I believe in you!!!!!! QwQ
A: Thanks!! :D
Q7: On whistling: I can whistle any song I've heard/can remember! It's not a tune-specific skill like piano or guitar (where you have to, like, learn A Song and then practice That One Song until you can get it right) so much as just being able to produce any note at will as long as it's within my range!
A: That's pretty cool! Yeah, the guitar and piano are pretty hard depending on skill! I just learned how to play ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and I am just learning how to play ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" on guitar! Cool that you can whistle anything!!! Do you usually whistle when you're out and about or just at home when doing stuff? And also do you usually whistle along to the radio or freestyle? ツ 
Qs of the day:
1) What's my favourite thing to do in the summer?: Until very recently, I would have said to stay indoors -- but I've actually grown quite an appreciation for getting out and walking/biking when the weather's nice, now that I know how and have new trails to do it! I'm not much of a beach person, but I really appreciate fresh air.
A: That's cool, I don't blame you! I haven't travelled anywhere in a while (especially since COVID lol.) 
2)  What's my favourite animal? Cats!!!
A: Awh, that's cute!!
3)  What's my favourite Christmas movie? Elf!!!
A: That's a pretty nice movie lol. 
4) What's a new hobby of mine that I've tried (and presumably liked)? I recently bought some book-nook-making kits (they're sort of like when you construct dollhouses, but for book/sized boxes open on one side that you sit on a bookshelf alongside all your books and it's like a little world in there and lights up and stuff!) and I've been finding them very satisfying!!! Something about getting a bunch of random pieces laser-cut out of plywood boards and just getting to snap them out and put them together one by one until they make something awesome... this is not a promotion of you spending your money, but since it's not a social media account of mine or anything I think I should be okay sending you the link to the product page so you can see what I'm working on! https://www.robotimeonline.com/collections/diy-book-nook/products/rolife-stories-in-books-series-book-nook-diy-miniature-house-4-sets?spm=..collection_db7b5007-32ec-457f-b7be-9d2cda7c9b10.collection_1.5&spm_prev=..index.header_1.1 I've done the two on the right and have the other two to go -- they're so cool!!!
A: That's pretty cool!!! I don't think I've heard anything like this -- so it's like building things? Super neat!! 
5)  On paper-making: Yes!!! I first heard about paper-making in one of my university classes early this year (it was on the history of the written word/books/manufacturing thereof -- covered everything from ancient Greece to how people in the 1800s made ink out of tree knots and how modern fonts are designed, very dense but very very interesting!) and quickly realized it's, like, one of those weird hobbies that apparently tons of people are into! You make paper by taking your old scraps (usually pre-used paper, but apparently fabric scraps and even dryer lint is supposed to work???), blending them up with a bunch of water and compressing the resulting pulp onto a mould and deckle (which, in my case, is two picture frames with the glass removed and a mesh sheet across one of them, so I can pour the sludge onto the frame with the mesh, put the other one on top, and flip it over onto a towel and squish all the water back out with sponges -- which is a mess, but a fun mess!). Then you just leave it compressed between towels/etc to dry until you have new, albeit slightly lumpy, sheets of paper! I've been experimenting with adding decorative beads/leaves/feathers/etc and paint to change the colour. I don't do this often right now (because it makes a mess and takes up my apartment), but I thought it was a pretty cool side-hobby!
A: Whoa, that's really neat!!!! I have never made paper before! I don't blame you for that, sounds pretty messy! Awesome side-hobby!

Q1: On living in one place: I think there are some nice benefits to not moving a great deal, at least in terms of familiarity -- you come to know what ""home"" feels like and you know your community, eh? I kind of miss that here sometimes. But on the flipside, I also felt kind of stagnant where I lived, probably because everyone knew me and then I transitioned and still had to deal with everyone knowing me as I was previously and all of the weirdness that entailed??? And it's genuinely good to have some space to work out who I am in the absence of the life-long environmental influences of my hometown/etc. So I guess staying still and moving can be healthy in their own ways!
A: Yeah, that's true! I guess it takes time to find a place where you can call ""home"" and to feel like yourself and I guess a place of reflection and memory? I don't really know, but I can say that basically anywhere that you could go can be called ""home."" 
Q2: On questions: Yes, you're free to ask me just about anything, I think? With the obvious caveats that we don't share personal info, talk about doing illegal things, or discuss anything particularly inappropriate, and that I'm professionally obliged to tell people if you're in danger or if you're putting others or yourself in danger, all the basic ethical rules of the platform. But like, for real, I'm here to help you learn stuff about life, so if life is out there being spooky and unknowable and you want advice on something that isn't in one of the units, I'm totally here for it!
A: No worries, I usually do not like to ask questions like that as I know that it can cause consequences. 
Q3: On tutoring: I actually don't have a set list of clients! It's not so much a one-on-one thing like you and I are doing here, where folks get paired up and actually get to know each other; it's more like a drop-in thing where a few tutors are available to help with whatever a student brings in that day, and then we're just paired up for half an hour or so while whichever tutor knows the most about X topic helps the student work out the kinks in their paper, and then... well, maybe after that I never get to see that student again, or maybe they really like what I do in particular and make an effort to show up on my shifts when they need help with other assignments in the future, but for the most part it's a one-and-done kind of job. I still try to be personal with people, though -- I really feel like that aspect is lacking, particularly because of our random-drop-in system where we don't build distinct rapport with particular folks most of the time. But I guess it also means that I get to help a lot more people, overall, so maybe it's the best system they've got for writing help? Blasting music is strictly prohibited in any case, lol!!!
Q3:  On Sri Lanka: Sucks to hear that politics have once again ruined good things... I'm sorry to hear that, but unfortunately not surprised. QwQ Admittedly I had to look up the particular district because I hadn't heard of that, but it looks lovely from the distance that the Internet provides -- I see a bird sanctuary and that's all I'd need! Do you remember anything from back when it was still 'nice,' or was that before your time?
A: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's just how the world is. It's pretty difficult. Oh the bird sanctuary sounds neat! I remember we used to see elephants and I think that's all I remember for now!

I think I made pretzels once, but I've definitely never made a cake like that... jealous. :P It sounds like you're enjoying new hobbies early, which can be really refreshing if you've had A Lot of the Same Stuff day in and day out throughout the rest of high school -- good for you!!!
A: Pumpkin spice late cake is really good!! You should definitely give it a try! And guitar is very cool but complicated! And actually, at my school, we are in two classes for ten weeks, then in the next quarter, we get two different classes - it's weird and doesn't make much sense - but we get through it! Thanks I appreciate it! 
Q8: On the many many questions: 
What would I say to someone having a bad day?: Depends on what kind of bad day, to be honest -- but in general, I like to remind people (wherever appropriate!) that life goes on, that a lot of the things that really hurt us now can end up making us much stronger and more resilient people in the end, that it's OK to be sad and it's also OK to let go of being sad when you're ready (because feeling like you Have to Be Sad about something as an obligation never feels good), and that while it's OK to have a bad day, if every day is a bad day, then I always encourage them to talk to someone about it. Legitimately, I've seen so many people in my life with mental health issues who just kind of don't realize that they deserve to not have to live with their symptoms, or that they even can have a life without that extra burden, and sometimes just being a person who says ""hey you know you CAN get help/talk to someone/do X thing you're afraid of and it's OK to do that"" is all they need to actually reach out and get meds or therapy or start whatever new chapter of their lives they've been putting off out of sheer anxiety. I do it a lot as a tutor and I try to do it a lot as a friend. I hope it helps them. QwQ
A: I really like what you said here - the wall of compassion! You are a compassionate and a generous positive role model and my wish for you is to continue doing it in the future! 
2) There's surfing in Tofino??? Really??? I'd never thought about that, but I guess it's possible. They do have some really nice beaches up there...
A: Yep, I believe so!! Not 100 percent sure lol! My family and I know some family-friends that went to Tofino one summer and got to learn how to surf! That sure is awesome! 
3) Chard is a leafy green vegetable with a red stem that looks... uhhhhh... kind of like a darker, slightly wilted version of green leaf lettuce? It sounds bizarre when I try to describe it, but it's really good if you boil up the leaves until they're tender and then serve them hot with a little bit of white vinegar!
A: Oh that sounds interesting, never heard of it lol! Do you use it for salad? Also what do you recommend for bulk-cooking? It can be anything to be honest - I don't really mind at all haha! 
4) This must make for THE best family Christmas photos, haha -- you all match!!!
A: Yep, it's a tradition in my family! Even my friends tend to mention that my family and I matched lol! 
5) All things considered, I've been doing okay!!! I'm still very excited for the holidays, just have to, like, make it that far past all the school stuff in the way. Such is life! QwQ
A: That's good!! Glad to hear!! You can do it!!! I believe in ya :D
On names: That is actually such a cool name though??? I mightily approve!!! 
A: Thanks, it's pretty cool :p
6) When did I learn to whistle and why?: I kind of picked it up, over and over again, and then forgot repeatedly how to do it? Like, I swear I breathed funny one day, went ""oh that sounded like a whistle"" and then freaked out trying to keep doing it and couldn't make it happen again... and that happened, like, four times? And finally I had one random time when I accidentally whistled, then figured out how to keep doing it on purpose, and kind of just never stopped because I was afraid to forget again, haha!
A: Haha, that's awesome! I wonder if you know any tunes? That would've been awesome!!! 
You're so sweet!!! I do my best!!! QwQ And hey, you seem like a wonderful person yourself, and I'm sure that all of the humans who know you out there in the overworld treasure you very very much!!!
A: Awh, no worries, glad it made your day!!! Thanks I needed that!!! :D 
Qs-OTD: What's your favourite thing to do in the summer? What's your favourite animal? What's your favourite Christmas movie? What was a new hobby you have tried before? 
And also I didn't know you did paper making! That's awesome!! I have never heard of it until now!",6:52PM November 24

Hi! It's okay, I guess it's a long flight back! Hope BC was fun! I wonder what it is like to live in Vancouver Island and Saskatchewan! And also I started my new classes actually (surprise lol!) which is cooking and guitar!! Thanks, my capstone went okay! There probably is lol. I like your profile picture, cool sign you have there lol! Yeah it does actually, I recently had a shower haha. 
BC was very fun!!! I got to see my grandma for the first time in a while and we did some painting and Netflix-watching, so no complaints over here! :D 
Living on Vancouver Island/in Saskatchewan have both been good experiences for me, but they're very very different ones!!! I'd say I liked the Island because the weather was nice, it had a lot of great scenic spots to drive through and stop for a visit in, and because it had a very contained atmosphere (as in, hard to get lost, I always felt 'familiar' with everywhere I went for the most part, etc). But Saskatchewan has been nice because cities have much more stuff to do, it's scenic in its own way, and the people are so friendly!!!
Cooking and guitar classes sound wonderful -- I wish I'd had the chance to learn guitar in high school! QwQ
Yeah, I meant other units of this course! Honestly, since it's not for a grade or anything now, I think I'll just open them all for you and you can look through them and see if there's anything that you want to discuss further -- it's a lot of good advice throughout, so I recommend giving it all a look, but feel free to hone in on whatever interests you!!! (Discussion questions are those weird pop-out pages that we Had To Do(c) for these two units, but aren't necessary for the rest -- though you're free to look at them if you want to know what kind of questions you can ask me??? Eh. I'm here to answer whatever, so again, totally up to you, haha.)
I have heard of Sri Lanka, though I've never been! Which did you prefer, the beaches or the temples? And how does it compare to where you're living now, if I may ask?
Generally speaking, tutoring is pretty quiet -- except when there are, like, three of us working and all answering questions at the same time because the room is small?? That's not bad though, a lot of times one of us will have a question we can't answer for a client so we just call across the room and go ""hey, who knows the answer to this???"" which is SO efficient not gonna lie--
Oi, if you love Indian food, then when you get to the Island you HAVE to check out Heritage Indian Cuisine in Duncan -- it's the best I've ever had!!!!
I love the existence of beaches, but don't visit them often; same with hiking, although I did once go on a REALLY cool hike where I got to spelunk through an underground cave!; I've never had the opportunity to surf (I'm not sure that's a thing on the Island??? our currents might not be good for it) and doubt I could ever balance on a surfboard, klutz that I am!; my favourite fruits aaaare strawberries, blueberries, plums, Mandarin oranges, and probably avocado, and I'm a really big fan of carrots, broccoli, and chard; and over Christmas, I've always really enjoyed the general feeling of togetherness and the morning activities above all! My parents have been separated pretty much my whole life, so the middle of Christmas Day was always hectic as I would travel from one house to the other to see both for the holidays -- but in the morning, Mum always had a tradition that we'd wake up late, wander out in our pajamas, open some VERY stuffed stockings and munch on chocolates while we waited on Christmas breakfast at my grandparents' place... and it was so peaceful. This year won't be nearly as relaxing, I expect, but I can still remember it fondly! QwQ How about you? Do you have any particular Christmas traditions?
Do you have a preference for Jen or Segués, or are both equally good with you? And how does one pronounce Segués? I've never heard of the name before, but it looks pretty!
And as for the bonus question: I already know how to ski, but snowboarding looks way heckin' harder to do and I guarantee I'd break my legs on the way down, so I'll stick with what I know, haha!!!",8:29PM November 20

Are you talking about the other units? Sorry, my mind is blank this week lol! I guess we can give them a try, and I don't really understand what the discussion questions are lol. 
Q1: Mexico is indeed very hot -- a little too hot for my liking, honestly, but I'll do what I have to do to see Danish! -- and as for scholarship stuff........ yeaaaaah. It can honestly be really hard to keep up with the sheer amount of opportunities out there, and you never know how much of your effort is gonna pay off; I just spent weeks working on a scholarship package for grad money that didn't even end up forwarded to the agency for review! But it's still a good idea to put in as much effort as you can reasonably spend, so long as you're also spending that energy wisely (ie. maybe choosing one or two scholarships that take up a lot of time to do and really focusing on those, but also throwing your name into the running for all of the ones that are essentially just ""tell us you exist and we'll assess you alongside everyone else"" school-wide opportunities, so that you cover the widest possible area of potential funding... without applying for Literally Everything Ever while the rest of your schoolwork piles up in the background!).
A: Yeah, that's true. There's nothing wrong with that lol, I guess you just gotta roll with it and do stuff one at a time!! I am from Colombo. It's a city in Sri Lanka. And it's pretty hot there, maybe around 30 degrees celsius! I don't know if you have heard of Sri Lanka, but if you don't, it's a small island just below India and it's a pretty nice place! They have beaches and temples haha.
Q2: VIU's courses are indeed good! I've had a lot of fun with them. (Sometimes depends on the professor you get, though!)
A: That's cool! Maybe they are funny too? I guess courses are different lol.  
Q3: I think my hair uuuused to be curlier when I was little, but it was always fairly straight? I think it's too fine to hold curls, there isn't enough volume for them to really be visible even if it was naturally that way!
A: Aww, that sounds cool! I guess some peoples' hair get straighter when they go through changes? Lol :p
Q4: I don't have much freedom to make tutoring fun for my clients, but I'd like to think I keep things interesting -- and I'm always making sure to ask about their lives outside of the homework aspect, both because I want them to have a real conversational experience instead of a transaction and because I think it's really important to pay attention to the non-school things that end up really impacting one's school experiences! 
A: Yeah, true! Sounds interesting I guess! I don't blame you lol! I guess most people have a hard time with certain things. I'm assuming it's lot of work or pressure depending on the person. What's it usually like? Is it like noisy (like musically) or is it usually quiet? (*dramatic pause* silence lol) 
Q5: I love sweet food all the way omg--I like salt, but I could eat sugary things for days. And especially when they blood sugar gets low, it's always the sweets that I crave... probably a biological thing, seeing as my body knows that's what it's lacking? Surprisingly not super big on fast food, though... I'll go to McDonalds or Dairy Queen for the ice cream, but seldom do I actually enjoy the food! 
A: It's a treat lol! I love their vanilla chai (iced), it's the best! I don't really mind what I get anywhere, I mean it's food haha! I heard that VIU has a lot of restaurants nearby (from what I have researched!) I love Indian food too like butter chicken :D
Q6: I've never heard that about my name! I actually named myself after the brand of my first piano, so it has a lot of meaning for me, but linguistically I don't know if it happens to match up with anything else, haha. And as for questions: I'd rather wear denim, my fav cartoon was DEFINITELY Spongebob (I used to memorize whole episodes and recite them, not sure why), I have very fond memories of playing Pokemon games in the backseat on road trips when I was a kid (until it made me carsick lol), and I genuinely don't know if I have a favourite restaurant! Maybe a Mexican place on Vancouver Island called Gina's? It had really good wraps!
A: Yeah, apparently I found it online lol. It was moon in Spanish, pretty awesome! Denim is cool! SpongeBob is very funny indeed! I love tacos and wraps too! They are super good with salsa, hot sauce or a little bit of sour cream I think! I used to have Pokémon Go on my old iPad, but it didn't work super well lol. Oh, I didn't know you get carsick! I usually watch movies/TV shows or I just look at the outside view the whole time! 
Q7: Enby is just a stylized shorthand for ""nonbinary,"" which they used to type as ""NB"" until folks realized that that was already an acronym for something else and then ""enby"" became the standard way of typing it online I think???
A: Oh okay, thanks! It sounds new to me! I am still learning about more new LGBT terms!

Hello!!!! I swear I exist, I've just been so busy these last few days, sorry!!! QwQ After getting back home from BC, I've been hit with a whole bunch of Grad Student Obligations(c) that I think I've finally gotten sorted out, but it's definitely kept me away from my messages for a while -- I hope things have been going well with you!!! Really glad to hear about your capstone being done and out of the way, and even though I indeed cannot see this picture (possibly intercepted by site admins, I'm not sure if we have a rule against photos or not but maybe?)

Yeah, that's true! Good to hear you are doing well! My sticky situations are out of the way :D And my capstone is done!! My final exam was very exhausting lol! Thanks for stacking the questions Challen, makes more sense! 
 
Q1: On bursaries and scholarships: You'll be glad to know -- at least in my experience! -- that those tend to show up more at the beginning of degrees, by the way! Lots of universities have 'entrance scholarships' that they use to lure new students in and choose their institution over others, especially if you go in with high grades or extracurriculars that interest them. And there are sort of 'exit scholarships' when you leave high school, too, sometimes! (On the flipside, it can get harder to get the same amount of scholarship money later in a degree, once they know you're already committed to seeing your schooling through -- but with that said, I still snagged a few based on keeping up my grades/getting involved in outside-of-school stuff over the course of my degree, so it's not impossible!)
A: Yeah, that's true. It's just like swinging from vine to vine (if you know what I mean lol.) with scholarships and bursaries that are like, ""You have a bunch of opportunities! Don't keep them waiting!""
Q2: On relationships: It really is amazing!!! We have visited in person a couple times, too; this time last year was our first meet-up, actually, because Dane flew up for my last reading break and stayed with me for about a week, and then early this year (March I think???) I flew down to stay with him and his family for almost two weeks, and we've got our next visit in about a month because my mum and step-dad are flying to Cancun over the holidays, and they bought my ticket to join them over my break, so Dane and I went half and half on his so he could join us and meet my parents this time around! I'm so excited for it. QwQ And ayy, that sounds lovely! I didn't really date in high school, so I actually also asked all my friends out to prom but just as a friend-group-there-to-consume-as-much-candy-as-possible-and-revel-in-our-mutual-inability-to-dance sort of thing; glad to see someone using prom for its intended purpose! :P
A: Yeah! I mean, it's pretty awesome when you think about it. Thanks! Ooh, Mexico sounds cool, I heard it's pretty hot over there and it's all around fun. My friend I believe went over there one year! 
Q3: On VIU: It's a lovely university and a really friendly community -- I'd highly recommend it if it's the closest one to you driving-wise and has a degree that suits your goals!!! As long as you don't mind stairs. It has lots of those, haha.
A: I did take a look at their website and emailed some of the team members and they said the courses were good so there's that lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Q4: On perms: Yoooo, I've never tried actually getting it curled on purpose -- I'm sure that looks awesome!!! And thanks! QwQ
A: It does! Oh, it's pretty cool but it's a pretty long process (mine took maybe around 3-4 hours?) And also was your hair naturally curly before? (e.g, maybe when you were a teen or a kid?) 
Q5: On whistling in the workplace: I'm the only one I've met who does it, but I'm sure I'm not the only person ever! Depends on the job, though -- I didn't mind making a little noise when I worked in a grocery store, but now that I do tutoring in a quiet room I have to keep myself in check, haha.
A: Do you make tutoring fun for students? You sound like the fun one haha. Oh that's nice, especially when you mentioned the worker and the customer whistle duo lol. And yeah, that's true, some people do get different reactions to whistling, but I ain't no expert lol! Whistling competitions?
Q6: On diabetes: I'm not diabetic, but I'm actually hypoglycaemic, which is a condition where I get low blood sugar! It's sort of the opposite of diabetes in that sense, but it also leads to it a lot because low blood sugar makes you really hungry and less picky about what you eat, so if not managed it can lead to a lot of impulsive junk foodening; I'd say that the best thing I've done to manage that is just... meal prep and make sure I eat on time? The best defence against blood sugar problems is to eat healthy food, and for me that means making sure that that's what's available for me when my blood sugar dips and I start craving -- but the best strategy is just to make sure I don't skip meals in the first place so that I'm never put in a state of under-sugared grossness!
A: Ay, that's smart! I hate those diabetic test needles (my mom uses them once in a while.) Do you usually crave sweet or salty (or both I'm guessing!) or are you a fast food lover? (e.g, McDonalds, A&W, Pizza Hut)
Q7: On food from around the world: I think I would try just about anything once -- I'd like to think I'm pretty open and adventurous, and I think it's silly to travel around the world just to look for the same experiences you have at home, honestly! -- but I'd saaaay the weirdest food I've ever tried is probably crickets? I went through a cricket flour phase where I would put it into all of my baked goods because it's honestly pretty healthy (good source of protein!) and gave things an interesting nutty flavour that was good in cookies, but it was kinda expensive and hard to find, so I don't have any in the cupboard right now, unfortunately! How about you?
A: Oh! That's pretty cool! I guess it never hurts to try new things? Lol :D
Q9: What does the name Challen mean?  I heard it meant moon in Spanish lol.

Hoi!!! I feel you on this, Everything Happens So Much in life sometimes. I'm glad to say I'm having a good time out here, but I'm also trying to keep up with school stuff the whole time and that can be a lot when you're out of your natural productive element, honestly -- although I think being home can also help in some ways, in that a change of pace can sometimes spur me onto changing my bad habits too, if that makes sense??? We'll see how much I get done around here, lol. How are your sticky situations going?

Q1: I honestly couldn't say why my step-brother chose UVIC, except maybe that it had the program he wanted at the time? I remember him being pretty annoyed with the long drive, so I think that all of the closer schools didn't have his specific woodworking/joinery program on the roster. And I've definitely heard of Ivy League schools -- but I really feel like that's a lot more about Prestige(c) than quality of the actual program you get into, in my opinion, which means that although they might be perfect for your needs, you really have to decide whether or not the massive difference in cost is actually worth it??? Because, like, unless there's a specific supervisor that you want in a graduate program for, say, MA or PhD work, or there's really something special about the program being offered at the Ivy vs quote-unquote ""regular"" school, then the only real difference is how impressed people are when they see the name listed on your résumé later... but it doesn't always correspond to how good a school actually is in terms of the experience you have or the things that you learn. I'm embroiled in a lot of that right now, as I make the switch from wanting-to-be-a-high-school-teacher to wanting-to-be-a-university-professor, which is one of those jobs where prestige really seems to matter in terms of who will hire you later on, but I dunno, to me it seems like a lot of talk to get folks to pay more for essentially the same degree at the end, unless you're in a position like mine where your employers really really really care about it! And hey, no blame if being a teacher isn't your calling -- it's just the passion that I fell into, but I can definitely see why it wouldn't be for everyone, haha!
A: Oh that's cool! I could definitely say for the long drive, pretty exhausting lol. Yeah, I don't think me and my friends can see ourselves as teachers or professors in the future lol. And I guess it can be from a degree. If you are just thinking to start university or college, I guess that's where the bursaries and scholarships come in. 
Q2: Yeaaaaaah, that was my lesson learned re: not trusting everyone who's behind a desk to know how to do their job. Definitely make sure that you know what you're doing, and that they know what they're doing, before you sign anything!!!
A: Yeah, you're right as rain! Definitely smart!
Q3: How do we make a long-distance relationship work??? Good question. It's a tough one, sometimes, but Dane and I have made it probably about a year and a half by now and we're still going strong, so I guess it's working out for us! :P I think the most important things are 1) finding ways to still spend time with each other even though you're not physically in the same room, and 2) being really really really good communicators. For the first one, we're video-chatting on Discord every day, a lot of the time just at random to say hi but also on particular routines -- for example, we call every night before bed and fall asleep with the call still running (which is hard on my laptop, but I have an old one that I use specifically for this purpose!) so that when we wake up in the morning, we're still together, which is one of the main ways that we still get to feel present, and even if we have really busy days or our timezones are way off (like right now, from BC we're three hours apart!), we know we still get to have that time. It also helps to plan in-person visits (when we can afford it!!!) and to send gifts through the mail once in a while (which is what we did last year for birthdays/Christmas and such!). And as for communication -- well, ironically I think this is one of the things that we do better than most people because we're in a long-distance format that kinda forces us to talk to hang out (lol), but just... being honest about our lives and our feelings is really important! Because we don't see everything the other person is doing, all day every day, we can't always ""see"" how the other one's life is going from moment to moment, which makes it important to be honest when something is bugging either of us or if something is getting in the way of the relationship that isn't immediately obvious (eg. if someone's in a bad mood, it might be easy to assume that it's something the other did wrong, but in reality maybe work/school is just being sucky and that person needs extra support to feel better!). And, of course, figuring out what the future looks like for us takes a lot of talking, too -- it's hard to make things work if you don't ask the hard questions like ""Which one (or both) of us is going to leave their home country to be with the other?"" and ""When will that happen?"" and ""What will our life look like together, realistically, once we actually get the chance to test living in the same house?"" There's really a lot to it, but I think so far we've done super well!!! :D
A: That's amazing, that's an awesome relationship you have there! Have you guys ever visited in person? And also I am also planning to ask my friend out to prom next year :) 
Q3: I have never heard of a Mocha Cookie Crumble, but it sounds delicious actually??? I might have to give it a try!!! And hey, I used to be a MASSIVE fan of ice cream cake when I was a kid, now it hurts my teeth though-- QwQ
A: It's really good! And Vanilla Bean is one of my favourites too! And also they have refreshers as well (one of my favourites being the dragonfruit drink!) 
Q4: I have never learned the skill of beatboxing! How does it work?​​​​​​​
A: I honestly have no idea! But I started off by watching some YouTube videos, but my friend taught me how to beatbox over video call for the most part lol. 
Q5: The coldest cold I have ever experienced was definitely last winter -- it was my first one in Saskatchewan and I was bundled up in a big down jacket and heavy-duty boots and longjohns underneath my jeans to keep double-warm, the whole nine yards, but I had to walk across town to get a COVID test (that thankfully came up negative in the end!) and I just remember this blistering pain in my knees??? It turns out that it was SO cold that the tiny line of just-jeans-and-longjohns that was between the bottom of my jacket and the top of my boots turned painfully red long after I got home... which probably would have meant frostbite eventually if I didn't keep ducking into apartment lobbies and coffee shops along the trip to warm myself back up! Honestly never experienced anything like it in my life (and this year if I really need anything, I'm just gonna call an Uber!!!).
A: Ouch, hope you were okay during all that! I would not be able to survive in a deep freeze like that lol. And great that your COVID test came negative! I don't blame you on the Uber part lol.
Q6: Hey, the coworkers might hate it, but once in a while at my grocery job I used to get a customer across the store who's also good at whistling and then we could strike up a song and it was really lovely!!! :'D I'd really like to think that more people enjoyed it who just didn't acknowledge it out loud! And I DEFINITELY feel like it's better than pacing around freaking out, which was what half my coworkers did, sooooo maybe they could've learned a thing or two. ;)
A: That's nice! A worker and a customer duo haha. The other customers were probably applauding and yelling ""encore!"" Makes the day jazzier! Jazz and pop songs sound like a good idea! Great idea for your coworkers lol! It might make their day brighter :D Are you the only one who whistles in the workplace?
Q7: Oh that's cool! I already have curly hair since I got it permed over the summer haha. And yeah, either way, I think your hair would look great!

I think this depends on if I get to change the thickness of my hair as well -- it's pretty fine and thin, so I like that it has a wave to it when it gets a little longer, but if it was thicker I think it would look better with curls! Hbu?",4:13PM November 6

Yeah, I guess so when it comes to most of the universities and what they offer in most campuses. Where I live right now, there's one college in town lol. 
Oh that's good! What interested him into going to UVIC? Also, I don't know if you have heard of Ivy League schools but they've been becoming the norm these days lol. And I didn't know you wanted to be a high school teacher. Most of my friends and I do not really want to become teachers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Oh, that's pretty bizarre haha. Definitely check what the requirements are for every career before you start the paperwork for it? That's just me though lol. 
Yeah, I guess it would be better then driving on icy roads. 
Oh, that's nice. Never heard of Bojack Horseman, but I guess it sounds cool. The jokes sounds funny lol. 
And also how did you make a long-distance relationship work? (you do not have to answer if you wish not to! I am just curious.)
Oh that's okay. I usually have Starbucks in the summer. (my favourite drink there is either the Mocha Cookie Crumble or Vanilla Bean!) 
I like Nanaimo bars too! And I like cake, ice cream, ice cream cake and other desserts :D
And also I've been learning how to beatbox, my friend has been teaching me how lol. 
But the annoyed coworkers thing though lol!! You're probably the ""mysterious whistler"" huh? They probably be like, ""Who's whistling super good? I wish I can whistle like that!"" (thought it can make your day!) And also it's better to ""whistle while you work"" rather than pacing around stressed out like, ""Oh my god, I have so much to do in one day, and I am so stressed out and tired. How am I gonna relax myself?""

It's tough to plan when you don't know exactly where you're ending up -- I feel you on this! Thankfully, both are very good schools from what I've heard and even if you live in one place and commute to the other, it is certainly possible to get by (though I would definitely schedule half-weeks in that case!!!).
My step-brother did go to UVIC!!! It was for an eight-month trades program in cabinetry, so he wasn't there for a terribly long time (or particularly involved in campus life, so unfortunately I don't have any info there!) but he seemed happy with it! He wasn't super big on school -- really good at what he did, but he definitely wanted it over with, haha -- but didn't have any outstanding complaints about the place, at least???
For me, applying to VIU was fairly straightforward, because 1) my mum already knew how that all worked, having done it herself, and 2) I knew what I wanted to get into, so there wasn't a lot of meeting-with-career-counsellors or anything to contend with. However, I will say that the one big struggle that I faced -- and I have no idea how this happened, it was really bizarre and I probably should have asked more questions when I saw the desk people looked uncertain, in retrospect!!! -- was that I ended up In the Wrong Degree(c) for about a year; when I started, I wanted to be a high school teacher, but apparently the person who did my paperwork with me didn't realize that you needed to specifically be in a Bachelor of Arts program for that, so I spent my first while in a Bachelor of Education... which is only for teaching primary/middle school! So I guess that's my biggest piece of advice, right off the bat: make sure your paperwork gets done right, and that you know exactly what you have to take to get the job you wanna do! I was lucky in that I got about enough scholarship money to laugh about that extra year of school later, but like, for someone who was living paycheque to paycheque affording semesters, having at least ten classes' worth of credits that didn't count towards their degree at the end might be much more of a problem. As it is, I have no regrets about it and I'm actually glad the mix-up happened -- that year or so gave me time to take a bunch of electives, expand my horizons and realize that high school teaching wasn't what I wanted to do after all, so I'm really lucky to have had that time to reflect! -- but it's something to consider. Every school will probably mess up some of your paperwork along the line, so keep an eye on it. (The same goes with choosing courses from one year to the next -- they usually have a program online that'll say ""if this is your degree, here are the classes you need to take to graduate,"" but mine spat out the wrong courses more than once, so uh, actually go on the university curriculum website yourself and count your credits just in case!!!)
Yeaaaah, I'm not a fan of slush either (I DEFINITELY hated it while I was driving, that's one of the worst driving conditions you can have tbh) buuuut sometimes I'd take it over the ridiculously cold days, so??? It's a balancing act!
Oi, I've never actually seen the Zelda cartoon!!! I've heard it's hilarious, though. QwQ
I didn't know whistling had so many healthy properties??? That's so cool!!! (I mean, tell that to my annoyed coworkers along the way, but still, haha!)
Questions of the day:
1) I'm surprisingly meh about Starbucks, probably because I don't love coffee and they don't seem to ever just have... normal tea? Or meal-type food that I'm into. That's one of the things I prefer about Tim Hortons, if I have to choose -- they're a little cheaper and they make good sandwiches!
2) I think my favourite funny joke comes from a show called Bojack Horseman (which can actually be a generally very adult and rather depressing show, but it has some legitimately silly moments!) where one character, Wanda, who the show paints as kind of an airhead -- like, not thinking things all the way through a lot, doesn't seem to be fully aware of what's going on around her, etc etc -- tells Bojack two jokes, one at the beginning of the episode and one at the end, and they don't make sense until you put them together.
So at the beginning of the episode, Wanda asks Bojack if he wants to hear a joke, and he's like, sure, and she says:
Wanda: Okay, so there’s this gardener, right? So, the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking. Like, he gets it right every time. He's the best.
So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on, and he's like, ""18 bags."" So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work. And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing. Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies, beautiful orchid bushes.
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.
He can't believe it. This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy. He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch. He's like, ""Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"" 
So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101.
And Bojack is like... that's not a joke? It doesn't have a punchline?? You're stupid??? And she's just like, you'll get it later. And then, at the END of the episode, she asks him if he wants to hear ANOTHER joke, and he doesn't believe that she's capable of making a joke at this point or even knows what a joke is, but he's like, sure, whatever, and then we get THIS:
Wanda: So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well. One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend. She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are. You know, the drama of young romance. So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too.
Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his [mind]. They get in a huge fight about it. He's all, ""Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He's going to think you're still in love with him!"" And she's just like, ""Relax, Brandon!"" So, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He's like, ""That ex-boyfriend's going to come back for you. He knows where you live!"" 
So, after dinner, he drives her home. She lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway. And he walks her to her door, but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down. He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know? 
Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away, but when he glances in his rear-view mirror, his blood turns cold. 
Guess what's in the back seat.
BoJack: The ex-boyfriend?
Wanda: No! The bag of mulch!
... And I don't know what it IS about that exchange, but the fact that I was puzzling over it myself the whole 20 minutes of the episode only to get the reveal at the end of the story once I'd just about forgotten about it -- well, there's something about that much effort and set-up that still makes me giggle every time I think about it. So that's probably my favourite joke, ngl. I hope you've got just as convoluted a story for yours, haha!
My favourite dessert??? Tough to pick just one, but as a list: Nanaimo bars, no-bake chocolate haystack cookies, peanut butter cookies, Moose Tracks ice cream, Reese's, pumpkin pie, aaaand just about anything else with chocolate involved in it!!!
I whistle for fun all the time!!! :D",12:31PM November 2

If you are planning to apply to VIU, you will need to have graduated high school in order to do so.  
VIU also has attractions as well as restaurants with different cuisine such as Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Italian, Greek and other cultures as well! They have attractions like the Malaspina Theatre, the koi pond, and the art gallery.  
VIU also has an offer on most courses from medical training to engineering. 
VIU currently has a student population of around 18,000 full-and part-time learners, including 1,100 international students from more than 40 countries, and over 1,000 aboriginal students that are attending VIU today.",9:40PM October 30

That's nice! I might be either moving to Nanaimo or Victoria due to family stuff. 
Oh, that's great advice! So your step-brother went to UVIC? How long did he go for or does he still go? And what did you struggle with applying to VIU? 
I'll see to get as much as I can. I will try and get it to you this evening.
Oh, sorry about that! Hope you are doing okay. 
My capstone is not due until Wednesday, so I think I should be okay for now. 
Man, winter in Rupert is gonna be cold this year lol. Either it doesn't snow much here or it snows but the snow usually washes away within a couple days (and it turns to slush. Not a big fan of slush! What about you?) Hot chocolate is the best :D
Oh okay lol. I think I've seen different videos of people playing ocarinas lol. I've heard of Zelda but never played the video game, but I have watched some of the cartoon :p
That's cool! It's nice when you just whistle to anything, brings out the best and super awesome :) And did you know? It's supposed to boost your mood and it releases stress and it relaxes your mind too!

Good choice, it's nice to be closer to family lol. I am moving down with family to Vancouver Island next summer when I graduate :) 
Oi, having grown up on Vancouver Island all my life I can 100% say it is a gorgeous and lovely place to be!!! Which end of the Island your folks plan to live on might influence your choice of university, then -- I lived in the central part of the island where it was about a 20min drive to VIU, for example, but my step-brother (who also stayed home during his university-ing) took a trades course at UVIC and had to drive for an hour and a half each way, every day of the week, so watch out for things like that if your intended program is a Monday-to-Friday thing and you choose a university further off from your house, it can get expensive on gas!
Pro tip on that front, actually: if you CAN schedule your own courses, though, it can help to cluster them on certain days of the week -- I would usually pick a couple Mon/Wed courses (where they had 1.5-hour blocks twice a week) and one longer course on a third day (3-hour course but only held in person 1 day a week!) and then I would only need to do three days of driving on top of the short commute; that really helped to keep the car costs down AND gave me half a week of uninterrupted homework time to focus without having to worry about commuting!
Again, no worries at all on me making a word doc for you when your research is done -- I'm happy to copy and paste! But honestly, if your capstone is a bigger pressure on you right now, prioritize that 100%; I'll still be here when you're ready, and now that I know you're not gonna get in trouble for the extra time, I've got no reason to rush you. :P
Candy is always the best! And I usually watch Halloween movies with my family and it's scary and funny at the same time! We were actually watching Goosebumps last week and it had some horror but with some funny twists lol! So you're going as a plague doctor for Halloween this year? That's cool! Yeah, I like dressing up! I might be a pirate this year, but not sure! Oh haha, I guess maybe they sorta like Halloween? Not really sure! 
Oh boy -- I wish I could do scary movies, but I really struggle to enjoy anything that's too graphic, lol. Yes, plague doctor has been my Halloween costume for a few years running, now that I've perfected it! And pirate is a cool idea -- lots of customization you can do with it, too!
An ocarina is kinda like a big round clay whistle??? Most people know of it if they've played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or any of the other Zelda games that include it, but outside of that I think it's a pretty niche thing around here. I got into it because of the video game, of course, but I never found it as fun as the piano -- having one octave's worth of notes (and not that much lung power) really limited my creativity, haha. Hopefully I'll get some more practice in with the piano and guitar soon, at least, I've been meaning to catch up!!! And as for music genres... I'm not even sure I have a favourite, I like so many things??? And I'll whistle along to anything, really -- I don't even have to like the song itself to entertain myself following along with the radio, it's just something to do!
What do I like about winter? That's a tough one, because my experience of Winter(c) has changed a lot between BC and Saskatchewan... as a kid, I really enjoyed BC winters because 1) obviously they led to snow-days off from school, 2) my mum and I would take long walks around our rural area of Cassidy, where the snow made everything really pretty, and 3) I used to really like the idea of building snowpeople and forts and all that jazz. Plus, the feeling of coming in after a long day of playing outside and getting warm by the woodstove with a cup of hot chocolate and some cartoons -- that can't be beat! Now, winter HERE is a lot less ""let's go outside and enjoy playing in the snow for an hour or two until we get cold"" and more ""omg we need three layers of clothing to make it the twelve minute walk from the residence to the classroom or we'll all end up with actual frostbite"" and I think a lot of my pleasure comes from... well, not having much to go outside for, haha. Like I've said, I'm a home-body kind of person a lot of the time, so while it occasionally got isolating last year to spend so much time in my room, I'm also happy to just cozy up under my blanket with an electric heating pad and enjoy looking at the snow out the window knowing that it can't get me!!! Hbu?
Lemme know when you find the time to finish up the questionnaire/research stuff, and when you've got all your info together I'll make that document -- but no rush to get back, you do whatchu gotta do with your capstone and stuff!!! (And when you do return to this, if you have any specific questions about VIU life -- because that's where I took my BA, after all -- I'm happy to answer!)",2:40PM October 30

I'm alive!!!!!!! Sorry I'm late, it's been really hectic on my end, too. QwQ But ahoy, I hope your studying for the literacy exams is going well and that everything has hopefully calmed down a wee bit (or will soon enough)!
I'll do my own Q&A first to catch me up:
My favourite way to jam out to songs is ABSOLUTELY while I'm driving! I no longer own a car (sold it to my step-dad when I moved to Saskatchewan, because BC gas prices were getting ridiculous for his own -- much larger! -- vehicle). There was always something for me about cranking the radio up, rolling down the windows to get some fresh air, and taking the scenic route home while singing myself hoarse... I really miss it, honestly!
I have two jobs with different duties -- one as a tutor at my school's Writing Centre and another as a Research Assistant for one of my profs! 
As a tutor, I sit down with all sorts of university folks (mostly undergraduate students, but sometimes grad students like myself and occasionally even faculty who want a second pair of eyes on their applications/papers/etc!) and just go through whatever project they're working on with them, offering feedback and what few corrections I'm allowed to give (because my boss doesn't want me doing people's work for them, haha) and mostly just talking. Honestly, I'd say that the most important part of my job isn't actually the grammar-checking, but the moments where I get to check in on how students' lives are going; I'm really open about my own experiences as a queer/enby/ADHD grad student, and I've actually had quite a few cases where I end up spending our whole session helping people figure out where to get their own accommodations/further info for non-paper-related supports! It's really cool that my experiences in life get to help other people reflect on theirs that way -- it's kind of like mentoring, but with pay and sometimes a weird amount of free time to sit around assembling Halloween decorations (a bizarre and very funny thing to be paid to do, but my prof also has ADHD and we get excited about all sorts of fun stuff!).
As a research assistant, I'm paid to help one of my profs with her own work -- which currently means I'm doing some research for her so that she can prep for a conference presentation she's giving in about a month! So lots of reading, but thankfully her research is on Indigenous methodologies and that's the area I'm looking at for my PhD thesis in the future, so it's kind of like getting paid to research on my own time -- can't complain!
In other news, your Q&A-style answers work perfectly, your grammar is just fine, and it's really cool that you're looking into graphic design in the future!!! I agree on the cost of schooling being steep at times, especially depending on your institution -- one of the reasons that I've been able to scoot by without debt so far is because I did my English BA at a smaller institution with low-ish tuition (and lived with my mum while I did it, and had high enough grades that I got some pretty good scholarships along the way... so your mileage may vary on how much you can save/spend!); unless you're going into a field where the prestige of your school matters to your potential employers, I would really really recommend not going to a place that's super high-priced (unless the benefits outweigh the costs for you, of course!).
One day left to go -- let's see what part two holds for us, and then we're free and clear!!! :D",7:46AM October 27
mentor commented at,"10:23AM October 22 
Pillow spray is a cool strategy to help stay asleep! I struggle with scents and stuff (teenage asthma, not sure if it still counts but I don't like wheezing) but for me a lot of sleep quality actually comes from humidity levels in the air, so I run a humidifier all the time now that I'm out on the Prairies to keep things as level as they would be in BC! Also makes exercise more pleasant -- and cool to see that you're a yoga fan, too! I don't love vigorous exercise, and honestly, every little bit of movement helps, so it sounds like we're both doing pretty well with it!
Yes, I highly recommend the bulk cooking especially, no matter what you're doing in the future -- it saves a HECK of a lot of time and makes healthy choices infinitely easier, haha. As for what I cook, I like to do three big meals at once, each comprised of one protein (usually meat) to about two servings of veggies; for example, my last bulk-cooking-fest, I made 1) a family pack of 7-8 chicken breasts, with steamed broccoli/carrots, 2) a roast beef/tomato gravy, with mini yellow potatoes/beans, and 3) a pork stir-fry with broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower rice, and then I just took that massive amount of food and sorted it into, like, twenty Rubbermaid containers and froze them all. Then every day for the last 2-3 weeks I could just reach into my freezer, pull out a container that has exactly one dinner's worth of food in it, pop the frozen lump out onto a plate (never microwave in the plastic container, it gets chemicals into your food!!!) and then microwave it until it's hot again. Super easy way of feeding yourself consistently, and I have no idea why more people don't do it, but for me it has been a lifesaver (especially because then I only have the massive mess of dishes once!!!). Having a few dishes that are really different helps with variety (so you don't get bored with what you're eating) and once in a while I like to spice things up by stopping by the university cafeteria, where they give me seven free dinners per term, and/or occasionally going out to restaurants/events with friends where I'll have different food (and it makes the freezer dinners stretch even further!).
Peanut butter cookies are amazing!!! Usually I make chocolate chip, but I was 1) out of chips and 2) had two jars of peanut butter halfway empty that needed using. No regrets, as long as I'm responsible with my snacking! :'D
Favourite thing to do on vacations... for me, it's a balance between relaxing and exploring, usually! If it's a short vacation -- eg. sometimes my mum and I would just go to a hotel for a night or two -- then mostly relaxing (at which point I like to laze about and watch silly TV and do some drawing) but for big vacations, eg. to other countries, I really wanna get out and see where I've ended up (I can sit on the couch at home!!!). For me, our Europe trip was a real treat because we managed to balance those chill hotel-room-only resting days with getting out and seeing all sorts of cool stuff! My favourites were the Doctor Who Shop in East London -- I had a Doctor Who university class that term, everyone was very jealous haha -- and the Catacombs in Paris -- not a ""tourist spot"" so much as a very impactful experience for me that I'm grateful to have had. And of course, Iceland had hot springs everywhere, so ""going out and exploring"" and ""lying in a warm bath and relaxing"" were pretty much synonymous... no complaints there!
I'd love to keep chatting with you once your class time is up! I'll let one of the program people know so that they don't close us off automatically, and then once you've gotten your grade we don't have to rush anything, yay!!! For now, though, I'll open that Post-Secondary and Career Planning unit just because it'll fulfill your requirements and sounds like good life advice... and then we can go from there! :D",10:23AM October 22

Yeah I have, there's some countries I don't really remember much haha.

This is really interesting!!! I had a lot of the opposite problem -- I was the weird kid because I talked infinitely too much for groups, haha. But I also preferred individual work a lot of the time on account of my style of thinking not jiving with group projects (and my style of doing everything last minute, to be fair...)
Great minds think (and stress) alike!!! What other signs tip you off to stress? How about physical self-care? I always struggle to make sure that my bodily needs are met (food, water, exercise) but is there anything specific to your routine that you reaaaally notice when it happens? Like ""if I wake up and I'm immediately in a bad mood even though nothing's happened yet, I know that's a sign I need a day off"" or some such? 
Oi, it sounds like you've done a great deal of travelling too -- that's really exciting (and often a heck of a privilege in terms of broadening the scope of your worldviews early on in life). I'm thinking about visiting Japan someday (just to get some use out of all the Duolingo hours I'm putting in -- albeit with little result, lol) but I've never thought of Spain or Australia (though my mum has always wanted to visit Spain and my step-dad is a huge history buff, so I'm sure he'd have plenty to do). I'm a moderate sushi fan, at least -- spent a few years as a sushi roller in a grocery store as well, which was a neat skill to pick up!
Any superpower at all? I would sayyyyyy probably metamorphosis. Not just for the obvious dysphoria reasons, but because honestly, being able to turn into any object/animal/etc gives you most other superpowers anyway (flight, invisibility if you pick something small, etc etc). And one superpower I wouldn't want is the ability to see or affect the future -- too much pressure! How about you?",10:22PM October 14

I did not talk until I was around 8. And I didn't go into groups much when I was in elementary and middle school and mostly worked alone, or if my friends were in the same class as I was. Otherwise I was a weird person most of my life lol.
Yeah, it actually is! You read my mind :')
I've also travelled through London, Singapore (can't remember), and most of Canada (except New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.) I'll probably update if I can think of more lol)  I also wanted to go to Spain, Australia and Japan! 
And my favourite food is butter chicken, sushi, burgers and salad and rice.

Hello!!! I have FINALLY completed my scholarship application (submitted it two hours before the deadline, which doesn't sound like much but for me is probably a really good sign haha) and I am back and alive!!! I'll try to keep myself organized in responses here...
On the activity: I should have mentioned art!!! As both a warning sign (if I'm doing way too much of it suddenly) and a self-care activity (when I finally give myself permission to sit down and work on the things that matter to me). It's a tricky balance with that one sometimes, for me at least. I'm glad to say that I'm doing better with it atm, though! It sounds like you have a strong appreciation for those little moments of relaxation -- using art to wind down or just enjoying a good cup of coffee and chilling. Sometimes, savouring and celebrating can be that simple, honestly. What would you say are your indicators of when you need to take a break like that? Do you have any warning signs? (I'm sensing ""unable to mentally disengage from schoolwork"" as probably a strong stress indicator here... at least, it is for me!)
Favourite food? Teriyaki chicken wings!!! One of my favourite special dinners as a kid. Also pumpkin pie (seasonal, I know), mushroom caps, butter tarts, aaaaand weirdly enough, steamed broccoli and carrots (very plain, but a staple of a lot of my bulk cooking... and also I just really like broccoli idk--). Hbu???
Favourite travel destinations? I've travelled a fair bit for my age: been to the States, Mexico a couple times, Cuba once, and across the pond to Europe the other year (visited London, Paris, and Iceland)! I would saaaaay the States is my favourite right now, just because my partner lives there and I don't get to see him often, and obviously BC, because it's wonderful to get to see family, but that's not terribly vacation-y -- so in terms of going for places instead of people, probably Mexico? (Cuba was gorgeous but I didn't love the food, and a lot of the Europe stuff felt more like ""going places to Do Stuff rather than to Relax and Enjoy the Experience"" half the time, particularly in London, so I'm not sure it clocks in as a favourite place even though it was definitely one of the best trips I've had!) Have you been anywhere interesting?
What's it like having ADHD? (And don't worry, I won't disclose any of your info -- but thank you for sharing!!!) This is a Big Question(c) and probably more than I can capture in one answer (and I might not even realize how much of my experience is ADHD-related, it's hard to know what being neurotypical would be like???) but for me... it's a mix! I could talk a lot about symptom management, on one hand -- I definitely have some struggles with, for example, executive function (getting ""motivated"" to actually do things can be hard, even when they're things that, in my head, I really want to do, because I still can't make myself do, if that makes sense?), time management (I've handed in pretty much every assignment of my Master's degree late/under an extension, haha -- very grateful for accommodations!!!), and emotional dysregulation (which is something that you don't hear about as much as an ADHD symptom, but it's actually a big part of the experience -- feeling the same emotions as everyone else, but sometimes they just get clocked up to 11, so something that would make most people kinda happy makes you stoked and something that would make most people kinda sad can send my brain spinning for hours, y'know?). Things like that are definitely one end of the deal -- but on the other hand, there's also a lot of gifts with it, too: I'm definitely creatively inspired by my ADHD habits (being able to jump between a million thoughts at a time makes a lot of connections that most people might not puzzle together!), and knowing my potential pitfalls has made me a lot more understanding and resilient in general (like, knowing that I have symptoms that might need working on in some areas is what pushes me to self-improve, whereas people who don't have -- or don't know that they have! -- a form of neurodivergency might just go, ""why improve my experiences in life? this is Just the Way I Am(c)!""... and recognizing how much of my experience has changed just in a year or two of self-improvement really encourages me to encourage others to aim for their best possible lives, too, which leads to a lot of advocacy work!). At the end of the day, I know that I can range from being really frustrated one day -- completely scatterbrained, late on assignments, stuck in a rut, impulsively doing things I know I don't want to and recognizing that those are all symptoms and feeling bleh about it -- and then another day can seriously benefit from my brain chemistry -- getting hyperfocused on the right thing at the right time, pulling some stellar work at the last minute that amazes everyone around me and myself, and working with my ADHD rather than against it -- and for that reason, I think it's kind of a gift like just about any other experience of being. I wouldn't wish it away, even on the hard days!
What kind of ""tired""? This might be a symptom thing for me, actually, so maybe I don't have the right words to explain it, but like... not so much ""wanting to sleep"" as ""wanting to be mentally inactive for a while,"" which, because it's hard for me to achieve sometimes, tends to naturally lead to ""well I guess I should take a nap, because if I was unconscious I wouldn't have to think so much"" (whereas my body might not even be tired, so I might just lie there and not be able to sleep anyway, silly enough!). Nowadays, I try to err on the side of meditation and mindfulness to relax my brain a little more reliably than just lying down and hoping sleep will take me (which is hard to do with my meds anyway, because stimulants tend to keep you awake during the day regardless). ""Tired of thinking too much"" or ""tired of stressing out and having racing anxious thoughts"" might be a more accurate description?
I'm curious, if you wanna share (but no pressure if you don't!) -- do any of my ADHD experiences speak to any of yours with ASD? I know that ASD presentations vary wiiiiidely between people (just like ADHD ones!), but from what I gather they're pretty commonly comorbid experiences (meaning that they tend to either 1) have a lot of overlapping symptoms/experiences or 2) tend to be diagnosed in the same people because they affect similar parts of the brain). I didn't score high on my ASD testing when I got my ADHD diagnosis, but one of my best friends has ASD and we have a lot of the same behaviours, so I dunno, maybe we'll have some common ground!",11:34AM October 12

Sorry I'm late -- but happy Sunday!!! :'D Surprisingly busy weekend over here with the scholarshippy stuff, but that's all Officially(c) due Tuesday so hopefully soon enough I will be free to be a person aaaaaaaa
Yes, I do use they/them pronouns!!! I was one of maybe two or three (max?) people I knew on Vancouver Island who did when I lived in BC, but surprisingly, a great deal of my graduate cohort in Saskatchewan is visibly trans and largely non-binary as well, which is really cool. If you have any questions on how they work grammatically, feel free to ask! :D And heck yeah, I love it!!! The tutoring is technically a side-gig for me to supplement my scholarship funds while also gaining relevant work hours on my resumé, but it also basically doubles as more mentoring in my experience (because honestly, half of the folks who come in asking for paper help also just need life advice and resources on keeping up with mental health and such... which I gotta admit was really validating for me in my first year, too, being both 1) in need of accessibility support on account of fighting for an ADHD diagnosis and 2) being able to then pass all of my experiences onto other students who didn't even realize they were Allowed(c) to get accommodations? it's really gratifying and important work sometimes QwQ). And finally: my favourite season is 100% autumn, and not just because of Halloween, but because I love scarves!!!

Jen it is, then! And I definitely feel you on the divide between Halloween and Christmas... for me Halloween has always had a certain Energy(c) to it that I don't see in other holidays, but Christmas is pretty high up there for me too, between the chances to see all the family gathered together and my step-dad's absolute s p r a w l of amazing Christmas dinner side dishes -- both are a treat!!! And I'm not super familiar with Diwali myself, but what I can see at a glance looks gorgeous -- maybe you'll have a chance to celebrate someday! And ""non-binary"" is a pretty blanket term for ""not one of the two binary genders"" that can end up meaning a lot of different things to a lot of different folks... like, for me, I think if I had to pick a more incisive label I'd go with agender, but I find non-binary useful enough that I haven't really gone with a more specific label! QwQ
Thank you for the well wishes!!! Fingers crossed on the scholarship stuff, I'm never 100% confident but I know I'll be OK!!! In the meantime, would you like me to open up our first unit?

And Halloween, 100% -- I've always loved the autumn and the general aesthetic and weather and fall vibes to begin with, and then you add a holiday about breaking social customs and wearing costumes and eating candy and relishing in spookiness??? I am ALL for that. :D How about you?",8:31AM October 6

Hi sorry for the late reply, I was tired and also I was having a family movie night with my family as well 😅
How you doing? And also any name is fine, I will think about that later since I get off school a bit early today

Hello!!!
Welcome to the program! :D No worries about getting used to the site -- the platform changes a bit every time I use it, too, so I might be a bit rusty myself, haha! 
Anyhoo -- nice to meet you!!! My name is Challen, I'm an English MA student from BC (currently living in Saskatchewan while I do school things!) and I use they/them pronouns. I see that you've listed she/they on your profile (so excited to have more gender-diverse mentees, heck yeah) -- and is Jennifer your preferred name or do you have another that you'd rather I use? I've had a few genderqueer mentees get stuck with default adhering-to-legal-names-on-school-attendance situations in that regard now, so I always like to ask first!
Also... what is Life(c)? What are you interested in? Anything in particular you're hoping to get out of the program or are you more so going through the motions? (The email I got said that you need to complete two Conversations -- one on Wellbeing and Self-Care, which I expect we'll end up doing first, and one more of your choice, both by October 28th... but if there's anything in particular you want to learn about that isn't covered by those two units and you'd like to either open other ones afterward or just Ask About Adult Human Existence(c) while you've got me on the line, I am very much here for that!!!) Do you have any plans for after high school, career-related or otherwise? And most importantly... you're an artist too??? Tell me everything!!!!! I'm a varied hobbyist myself (digital art, graphic design, traditional sketchwork, acrylic painting, plush-making, cross-stitch, Sculpey clay... I've tried a bit of everything, honestly!) and I'm always super curious to see what other folks are working on! :D
If you have any questions about me or the program, my ears are open! 
Cheers,
Challen",4:12PM October 5
