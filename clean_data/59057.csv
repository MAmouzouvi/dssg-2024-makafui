Hey Nicole! I see online that it's around 65%, but I also think this might not be totally accurate. I think there's a chance that more people than this get accepted. I know when I was in grade 12, a bunch of people in my grade were applying, and I only knew one person that did not get accepted to UVic (and I think they missed a lot of school and had pretty low grades). Also keep in mind that this depends on the program you apply to, e.g., I think something like engineering or biochem would be a bit more difficult to get into, but there would be a very low chance you would get rejected from a program like psychology. I think the acceptance rates are an average of all programs, including ones that are harder to get into.
I hope you applied if you are considering UVic!",4:05PM February 1

I am so sorry it's been so long!! I will resspond fully later I literally just woke up thinking about what is the acceptable rate for uvic?? i know the application deadline is the 31st and fast approaching and i'm trying to figure out if i even have a good chance of getting accepted or not ...",4:42AM January 28

I loved reading about your career aspirations! It's so nice to hear that you seem to be passionate about so many different things. I think it's always good to keep different options open, especially when you're at the stage where you are now (but even at any point in life). I am in dental school now, and I have classmates that want to be dentists, but they also hope to try out other careers later in life when they can. 
It's great that you were able to see what the daily life was like for a graphic designer. I think that being able to shadow someone locally in a job (without any of the sugar coating that I sometimes notice on social media day-in-the-life videos) is one of the most helpful things you can do when trying to decide what type of job you might want to do after school. I think you should really be able to visualize yourself doing it everyday.
As for marine biology, I would try not to get too discouraged right now if it's something you think you might want to consider more. I know people that are now in dental school that had to overcome many set backs to get here. Some even failed science classes at their univeristy and had to redo them, and others had to apply multiple years in a row before getting in. Whatever job you decide to aim for, just remember that a lot of people who get the job they want got it because they never gave up. Even when they doubted themselves, they just kept pushing on and trying their best. Have you thought about taking a marine biology class as an elective to see if you like it? A counsellor would also be a good job where you can interact with others and have each day be a bit different!",3:20PM November 22

Hello Nicole,
Thank you for all your questions! To make sure that I can respond to everything, I will paste your response and then put my answer below. 
I also took a look at other majors available but I still feel like I have the most interest and passion for psych!!
That's awesome! I personally had a great time taking psych, and I am really happy I ended up taking it over other majors, but I also know that everyone has different interests, so I think it's important that you also keep an open mind (once you have started taking different types of classes) incase there's anything else that you might want to transfer into. 
as far as the classs... like would I be able to take English as an elective right? becasue i see that it isn't ""required"" but I do actually enjoy english. 
Yes! So for english, there's actually a required academic writing and reading class that I believe almost every major requires in the first year (called ATWP 135 at UVic) which is pretty helpful for the rest of your degree when you have papers and assignments for different classes, but you can also take other english/writing/literature classes if you want. In the planning sheet for first year (BSc psyc), you will see at the bottom that there's a line that says ""electives any level -- 3.0"" This means that you can take two classes in any faculty at any level (i.e., 100 level/first year class, 200 level, 300 level, or 400 level), although beyond first year classes, many classes have prerequisites that you need to take first before you are allowed to enrole in them. I took a contemporary literature course where we were assigned things from different forms of media (movie, graphic novel, poems, etc.) which we wrote essays on. It was pretty interesting! 
50-120 min classes sound quite doable... I feel like I can stay seated and semi- focused for that amount of time most days. 2 hrs and 50 mins may be a bit of a stretch but maybe If the subject is extremely interesting it will be easy!! 
Yeah, 2 hrs and 50 min can be a lot, but then you also get the reward of only having that class once per week haha. So, it's a trade off, but my favourite style ended up being 50 min for most types of classes. I found it was easy to stay focused the whole time and digest all the info during that time frame.
from experience, would you say that a ""typical"" first/second year student's schedule is fairly manageable? it can be difficult to figure out what to expect because certainly on social media there are some people who say they barely have time to eat and sleep because the course load is so demanding, while others say wow, there is so much time!! I imagine it would also depend a lot on how savvy a person is with their time management skills... sadly an area I lack in a bit!! like would it be reasonable to maintain a balance of studying, social life and personal time? I dont see myself spending a lot of time going to parties lol since I am quite an anxious person but I absolutely love to hang out in smaller groups. would it be unrealistic to think about taking on a part time job while being at school? I mean I know people do but like for first year? I think it would also be nice to be able to study with friends and stuff because it can help me to focus (sometimes it makes it harder lol) and less lonely!! 
I would say that a typical schedule is pretty manageable, especially in a major like psyc where there's not a ton of labs/tutorial that are required in addition to regular classes. At the same time though, I think it's normally to feel a bit like there's no time for anything else at first. I think this is because when you're new to university/college, it's hard to know what to spend the most time on, and which types of classes/assignments you can do more quickly and still get a good mark. For example, you might have a class where there's a ton of required readings, but after the first midterm, you realize that almost all the exam questions are taken from the lecture slides. Sometimes the profs will be nice and tell you how many questions are from readings vs lecture, but sometimes they won't, so in this case, I found my self studying everything just incase, but then when the next midterm or final came, I was able to save a ton of time by only studying the things that I think will be on the exam, and then skimming the other stuff if I have extra time after. I think there is enough time for anything that you really want to do (e.g., if you really want to have a part time job or work out daily), but it might come with the consequence of less time for other stuff (e.g., feeling like you don't have enough time to hang with friends or get lots of sleep). You kind of need to pick your top few priorities and make a point of doing those things, regardless of if it feels like there's a lot of stuff to do for school. I had a part-time job when I first started university (twice a week for four hours), but I later quit after my first year because I realized I wanted more time to hang with friends, get good sleep, and have even more time to spend studying so I could get better grades. Saving 8 hours a week doesn't sound like much, but I find if I over-scheduled myself, then I would also just feel burnt out. So, when it came time in the day to study (e.g., after work and school), I sometimes found it quite difficult to motivate myself or to get through my work quickly and efficiently without just getting distracted and taking a bunch of breaks. Sorry this is a lot of info. . . in conclusion, I think my biggest piece of advice would be to start university/college with minimal other commitments, focus on getting good at the ""simple"" stuff in term 1 (e.g., sleeping enough, staying on top of your studies, eating healthy meals, doing a bit of exercise, and making time for friends and family), and then I would take on one commitment at a time once you feel like you have all those types of things under control. E.g., in term 2, or year 2, you could get a part-time job or sign up for a volunteer position.
how did you find making friends? was it really scary, or like were there a lot of people with shared interests who were looking to be friends as well?
I found that making friends was harder than in highschool because I lost the ability to have ""convenient"" friends -- those types of friends that you just end up always having around because you have similar classes or interests. If you go to a bigger univeristy, you might find that you have different people in every class you go to. I found that if I wanted to make friends, I needed to seek them out. E.g., sign up for an activity where I could meet people with similar interests, go to social events and add people on social media, strike up conversations with people in my classes and ask them to work on a class project or to study together. At times I found myself a bit lonely, but in my last year, I found that I had a really good social circle. It helped that I took honours, so I was able to get to know everyone in the honours cohort and see them multiple times a week for the whole 4th year. I think it can be different for everyone though. Some people make a group of friends right away that they stay super tight with the whole 4 years (e.g., met them in residence and then rented a place as roommates in year 2-4). I also had COVID online lectures for a lot of my classes, so it will probably be easier to make friends now that everything is pretty much normal again.",3:05PM November 22

so I did the little warm up exercise for that section on career aspirations and dreams I have had in the past. it says to write for 2-3 mins lol and I ended up writing for 15 minutes and filling an entire page!! 
I will summarize—
I kind of always knew I wanted to do some work that would involve helping people in some meaningful way. starting from when I was quite little I wanted to care for babies, like an obstetrician or midwife. then I became interested in being a nurse or doctor, and then I became passionate about working in a field of emergency services, like law enforcement or paramedic. I discovered a passion for graphic design in grade 8, and considered pursuing that subject but after a work experience placement which was great, I realized it would be an ""8 hrs sitting at a desk behind a computer every day"" sort of job which is exactly what I want to avoid. so i figured I would stick to like freelancing for graphic design. I have been very excited about marine biology as well, but I am just unsure if that is just a passion but maybe not a career? I didn't do quite as well in sciences as I'd hoped which discouraged me a bit. so currently I am most interested in psychology with the goal of becoming a counselor!
I will look at the videos tomorrow!!",8:30PM November 18

you can probably tell from my tone of msg that I'm feeling a little more grounded at the moment!! my brain is organizing thoughts a little better than usual which is always nice :) 
how did you find making friends? was it really scary, or like were there a lot of people with shared interests who were looking to be friends as well? I am just worried that everyone will already have enough friends and not be interested in getting to know me at all. but I really like to be around people... usually. I would describe myself as quite a social person, I'm extroverted but definitely not the type of person that has 1000 friends lol.
I may have mentioned this before, but I would love to get into going to the gym. but i feel so insecure going alone, and it would be great to meet someone who knew a bit and also would be willing to go with me!!",6:50PM November 18

Rachel thank you for being so sweet and understanding!!! I really appreciate that :)
yes, like I feel like the transition to living quite independently could be a bit rough at the beginning but once I settle in and start to feel more comfortable, I think it will actually be a really good change for me.

Hi Nicole,
You really do not need to apologize! :) I am here anytime you need to talk about something. There's no specific schedule you have to stick to for messaging me. Of course I want to keep chatting with you!
That totally makes sense about your concerns about UVic. It's difficult for me to give you advice about a smaller college because I personally have not been to one, but I did have friends who went to Camosun College in Victoria and really enjoyed their time there (some of them liked it even more than they liked UVic). I think staying closer to home could help if you're worried about being lonely, although I think if you do want to try a bigger city or bigger university, you will probably get used to it and not feel lonely after being there for a while. I would try talking to friends and family to see what they think as they probably know you well, and whichever you decide, you can always transfer after a year if you wish you make a different choice.
Yes! You can choose to take a bachelor of science or arts in psychology. The biggest difference is what type of degree you will get at the end (BSc vs BA), but the classes are pretty similar as they both require quite a lot of psychology classes. The required classes outside of psychology is where the degrees differ the most. For example at UVic to get a BSc in psyc, you have to take BIOL 184 and 186 (first year bio), but you don't have to for a BA in psyc. You can search ""UVic psychology program planning worksheet BA"" (or BSc) to see which classes are required for each degree. 
Yes you can transfer pretty easily between science and arts at UVic, you just have to meet their minimium requirements for the most part. Although, I have heard it can be more difficult to switch at other schools (such as UBC) as you would have to apply, and sometimes the applications are denied depending on how competitive the program is. 
Sorry, my previous message might have been a bit confusing. In total you need to take 10 classes each year to graduate in 4 years. I believe this usually adds up to about 3 hours of classes per day, although sometimes you need to register for tutorials or labs (if they are required to pass a certain class) which might be additional hours per week. Each class is usually 50 minutes (10 min transition time to get to your next class), but classes can also sometimes be 120 min or 2 hrs 50 min, although the latter two are not as common. Your schedule will look different depending on which classes you sign up for. For example, you can try to register for classes at times that are back to back, but sometimes it's hard to find one that fits, so you might have to have gaps in your schedule (e.g., one or two hour break between classes), or you might have to take a class even in the evenings during some semesters. One benefit of going to a bigger school is that there will likely be more different types of classes available and more sections for a class that you can register in (e.g., at UVic, psyc 100A might have 3 different sections going on during one semester, all scheduled at different times). This just allows you to build your schedule in a more customized way to your preferences.
During your first year, if you go to a bigger university, probably most of your classes will be in big lecture halls, but as you advance through the years, your classes will probably get smaller and smaller as calsses become more specialized. Although, there are some classes that always seem to be small. For example, language classes such as english and french always seem to have around 30-40 students at UVic, so they feel more like high school classes.",11:17AM November 9

I am really torn right now if I should go like the UVic route or like maybe look into going to a smaller college. I am really worried about being lonely wherever i go, and also coming from a relatively ""small town"" I am also just not used to being around so so many people! 
so you can do a bachelors of psych in science or arts? what is the difference? at this point i can't get into sciences because I don't have the right classes but I have heard you can transfer later if you want, after being accepted into Arts? 
I was also wondering like with the classes, you say there is 8 classes to fill up your first year schedule... is it like going to school 9-3 every weekday or are they structured at different times? and like about how long is each class? They are like lecture format in a big hall with a ton of people right?",11:17AM November 5
Mentor commented at,"10:14AM September 16 
If you're not sure whether you want to major in psychology (or another subject), I would recommend trying out one of the first year classes and see if it interests you enough to take more classes in it for the rest of your degree. I hope that helps :)",10:14AM September 16
Mentor commented at,"10:13AM September 16 
I am glad to hear that you have a close friend you can live with! I think that should really help a lot :)
I really enjoyed majoring in psychology! In first year, we basically just learned a huge overview of all the different areas of psychology. So it was a little bit of everything (e.g., psychological disorders, major theories and who developed them, how research is conducted, some major resesearch studies that have changed the study of psychology, etc.).
For the actual psychology content, it is broken down into two first year classes at UVic. Then there are eight classes left to take to fill up your first year schedule. For the rest of the first-year classes, they will be in other subject areas (e.g., math, philosophy, biology, etc.). If you google ""UVic Program Planning Work Sheet Psychology BSc"" (or ""BA,"" depending on whether you want to graduate with a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts as the required classes will be a bit different) you can see the different types of classes that will be required.",10:13AM September 16

I think how hard you find being away from home for the first time will depend on how close you are to your family and how much you like your current living situation. I am pretty close to my family, so I found it hard at first to live without them, but I would personally recommend trying to find someone you can live with as a roomate if you are worried about feeling lonely. I think it is natural to feel homesick at first, but I adjusted to being without my family after a few months, and my new living situation started to feel like the ""new normal."" I also think you can avoid some homesickness by setting up regular facetime appointments with the people you miss most and thinking ahead to the next time you will be able to visit home.
I have talked to friends who were not as close to their family or were just ready to move on and start a new phase of life, and they didn't seem to find it hard or miss home much. So, I think it just depends on each individual and their situation.",2:50PM September 3

I am not totally sure about the approved grade 12 course. I think it sounds like it has changed a little bit since I applied. When I applied, they just asked for my grades in specific classes and I entered those into the application. Probably the best thing to do is email someone at the schools you are applying to, just to make sure you entered everything correctly. 
According to UVic's website, if you have yet to submit your application and you have application questions, you can contact a recruiter. Here is the link to the webpage for this https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/contact/contact-a-recruiter/index.php",2:44PM September 3

I am actually already on my summer break! I am currently traveling and then I will go back home to work the rest of the summer. Are you looking forward to the end of the school year?
I believe at UVic you are guarunteed a room the first year, but then when you're in the 2-4 year, you can apply but might not get a dorm. I think most students just end up living near by campus in their second year with some roommates in a rental apartment. 
 
okay that sounds great! You can just let me know which topic interests you most, and we can start with that one. If you need a recommendation, I like the self care module a lot.

I think the biggest difference between teachers in high school and university is just that there are a wide range of professors. Some can seem a lot like a high school teacher--very nice and wanting everyone to suceed, whereas other professors might seem more intimidating and might not seem to care as much about trying to help students or provide help/flexibility on assignments, attendance, or other things, but I think, in general, if you reach out to a prof, they are going to be pretty helpful, kind, and respectful (if you show respect to them). Office hours are usually set up weekly in each class which is a great time to get help with class content, and your profs should always be willing to provide more explanation/examples if you attend the office hours.
There is some mental health support, but they tends to be some issues with it. For example, there can be a waitlist of a few weeks to speak with a counsellor and the appointments can be short (e.g., I think they tend to be booked for 20 or 30 min), but I have noticed since COVID, my school has tried to set up more supports (e.g., connecting to a peer or online/phone services). UVic has a wellness centre where I think they would be pretty good at provide more information about the available programs/supports. They also have nurses there that can perscribe certain medications and possibly refer a student to a doctor for a more complex mental health difficulty.
The food is cafeteria style in the dorms, but there are also other food outlets that are more just like a deli/coffee shop/restaurant. For example, I think some serve pizza, others have tacos/burritos, there is a Starbucks, etc. I think it's pretty good, but I have heard that some people don't like it after a while when you have to eat it everyday. The price of the meal plan is included in living costs if you live in residence.",9:51AM March 27

It's good that you're starting to think about post-secondary education! There are definitely pros and cons to university vs college. I went straight to UVic rather than going to a 1- or 2-year college first, and I really had a good experience and enjoyed it, but I think college would also provide a great transitional step (for academics and social life) so starting university wouldn't feel as jarring as it can as well as a good way to save money on tuition (I think).
Applying to post secondary can seem very overwhelming at first, but once you get into it, a lot of schools don't actually require too much from you. For example, I think when I applied to UVic, the main part of the application was just entering in my grades and sending in my transcript. I think some schools might allow you to apply now and defer for one year. Every university/college would probably have a different policy about this and you could probably find out about it on their website or by talking to an advisor at that school.",9:31AM March 27

Hello Nicole!
I hope you had a good Spring Break and trip to Cali! At UVic, we don't really have a Spring Break, but we do have Reading Break which is a one-week break that is usually lumped in with Family Day, so it ends up being in February about half way through the second semester. The first semester runs from Sept - Dec, then the second semester runs Jan - April. Students only usually need to be in school for those two semester each year, but there are also a smaller selection of classes offered during the summer (May - Aug). There is usually a break of 2-3 weeks between semester one and two, Reading Break, and then another break after the second semester if you are taking summer classes.",9:19AM March 27

Hi Nicole! 
Sorry I forgot to respond to your messages sooner! I have been helping with UVic's student elections the past few days, so I have been running around a bunch and trying to balance it with my school work. Thank you for your messages!! I will respond to them in the morning if that's okay :)",10:24PM March 26

that sounds good about the support. yes I am usually very engaged and i love to be involved and try to fully understand concepts as best i can. what differences do you find with like professors vs high school teachers? are they scarier?
what about emotional support? I have struggled with my mental health a lot during high school, and although i'm doing much better now I was just wondering what, if any, mental support there could be at uni if a student needed it? 
so the food is like a cafeteria style? it is included in the tuition if you get a dorm right...",3:48PM March 23

I haven't done any post secondary applications yet, actually the whole idea is super overwhelming because i don't even know where to start!! I think i've already missed a bunch of deadlines and im not sure but it's so confusing to me . i have to do some scholarship applications soon though... 
high school has definitely been a long go, i've had to take an extra year to finish for a few reasons but mostly because I have bad time management skills :/ graduating is scary but I am excited at the same time, and i think i feel the most ready that i've been yet!! 
because I am thinking to take next year as a gap year, i was hoping that i could somehow like secure a spot or whatever get accepted into but like start the program in 2024. I think that is possible... one of my teachers said they do that but i really don't know... 
I am also trying to decide if i want to go to a smaller college first before going to uvic.. ahh I don't know!!",3:42PM March 23

hi!! I am so sorry for not responding for a really long time. i've been on vacation in california for the past few weeks so school-related topics haven't been on the top of my head!! i also intended to respond much much sooner but sometimes i have the memory of a goldfish. I hope you're having a good spring break! that is actually something i'm not too sure about... do you have the same normal break schedule as like grade school? like winter break, spring break and then sept-june?",3:35PM March 23

I wanted to mention, you have thought of some really good questions, but also, there's no pressure to come up with a long list if you can't think of everything at once. You can always just ask me things anytime you think of them :)",12:51PM February 28

Awww maine coons are super cute! I'm jealous :p
As far as feeling out of your comfort zone in the gym, my best advice would probably be to find a friend to go with who already has a weightlifting routine. I would just ask them if you can come along and try out their workout. This way you can watch them do all the machines/exercises before you try them out. I also wouldn't be too worried about looking new. Although it might feel awkward at first, no one would really notice or think anything of it because everyone was a beginner too at some point.
I do think there is a lot of support at university, but I think you kind of have to seek it out more. For example, you might have to go out of your way to attend a professor's office hours or plan in advance to set up an academic advising appointment, but once you do connect with the right person, the staff is super helpful. I have found almost every professor I have talked to to be super nice and helpful. For the most part, they want to see you suceed, and (as long as you respect their time and look engaged/interested) they will try their best to answer all you questions and explain concepts well.
I would say the food is pretty good. Some of it might not be quite as good as a nice restaurant or like your family might make at home, but there a lot of good options. For example, there are different dining halls with different menus each day, and there are also a bunch of different food outlets throughout campus that have the same thing each day (for example, pizza, sandwhiches, wraps, tacos, breakfast food, sushi, etc.). There is also a Startbucks on campus if you're into that.",12:49PM February 28

I think there can definitely be an adjustment to the ""adulting,"" but I have noticed that, for most people I know, it really doesn't take that long. Once you figure out a routine and how to do everything, it starts to just feel normal. I think the adjustment also depends on how independent you are in highschool. For example, if you already take care of your own schedule, laundry, cleaning, exercising, etc., you probably won't find things to be too different. Also, everyone in first year will be in the same boat as you at first, so you can lean on others for help or advice, and no one will expect you to have everything figured out right away. 
As for time management, I found I got a lot better once I went to university since it gave me, like you said, frequent deadlines and pressure. I also found it was pretty easy to motivate myself to get work done once I had a goal in mind of what I wanted to do with my life. I finally felt like my grades really mattered and the stuff I was learning would help me get to where I want to be in life.
That's amazing that you're finishing up grade 12! Congrats! I found high school felt like a really long four years, but it's great that you can now look forward to some new and exciting changes in your life. Have you completed any post-secondary applications yet?",12:32PM February 28

that's so cool!!! I have two cats, both rescues and one of them is a maine coon so he's very large and fluffy :) 
it would be really cool to get into lifting, especially if there's a great facility to do so. i wouldn't know where to start tho lol which might be embarrassing!!
do you find there's a lot of support at university? like aside from your friends and family... from your professors and other school staff?
this might be a silly question but i love food and i was just wondering how good the food is... 
im really tired right now haha so i don't think my brain is doing all that well thinking about university :)",10:00PM February 27

I have the sense that university involves way more ""adulting"" but not fully on your own sort of thing. Truthfully I really struggle with time management, getting assignments finished in time and that sort of thing... but I do perform quite well under pressure so maybe having constant deadlines might help! 
I'm finishing up grade 12... graduating this June!!! which is super exciting and at the same time terrifying!! 
I am just at the ferry right now and i'll respond with more later today :)",8:24AM February 26

Oh wow! We have so much in common. I love cats too. My sister has two cats, and I absolutely love spending time with them. I also used to roller skate all the time. Me and my sister would spend hours rollerskating around our drive way after school and on the weekends. 
Maybe you can try out weight lifting if you come to UVic. There's a new athletics building here called CARSA that I think was built in 2015. It's super nice and has a huge weight centre.",3:52PM February 23

Oh, that's good that you live near by! I think it will be nice to be able to visit home on your long weekends, if you attend UVic.
I would say there are a lot of things that are different. Compared to where I went to highschool, it was a huge change. First of all, I really enjoyed being in University a lot more than high school. You get to feel like an adult where you take control of your own schedule and responsibilities. For example, no one is going to try to track you down if you skip a class or don't hand in an assignment. Although this is nice to feel in control, you also have to be a bit more diligent about making sure you know when all your due dates are as usually, you are not allowed to hand in assignments late or re-take exams/tests. But regardless, I found that this was a really positive change. I am a pretty independent person, so by the end of highschool, I started to feel really bored and tierd of the environment. 
Can I ask you what grade you're in right now?
Another thing that is different is that there are a lot more people. For example, in every class, there could be up to a few hundred people, and most of the people in each class will be new. This can make it a bit hard to make friends if you rely on talking to people in your classes to find people to socialize with. 
As far as the difficulty, there is a lot more information that you need to learn in each class, but there are fewer class hours per week, so there is more time to spend outside of class studying and completing assignments. Although it might feel like a big adjustment when you start, over time, you can figure out how you learn and study best, and things will start to feel pretty easy by the third and fourth year. I find it's also very important to get good at writing down all the assignments and tests and managing your time well so that you start well in advance for all the due dates.",3:42PM February 23

Hello Nicole! It is so nice to meet you :) My name is Rachel and I am a fourth year psychology student at UVic. I saw in your profile that you are considering attending UVic! That's great! Is it far away from where you live now? I have enjoyed my time here. Let me know if you have any questions about being a UVic student.
It is great to hear that you are interested in learning more about applying to post-secondary, scholarships, etc. I hope I can help you and answer any questions that you might have. In August, I will be starting dental school at UBC with the career goal of being a dentist. 
A little more about me: I enjoy weight lifting at the gym, playing golf and tennis, and spending time with my friends, family, and boyfriend. What are your favourite things to do in your free time?",9:43AM February 20
