I was literally practicing interviews in my car, and even had a screening interview in my car... My neighbour saw me in my backseat like ????? ahhh so embarrassing. LOL. Anyways, after exploring their website, UNBC sounds like a great school! I know you've done your research and really, I think you'll get a fulfilling university experience no matter what school you chose. I believe if you enter UNBC with an open mind to fill your schedule with enriching experiences (both academic related and not), you'll come out not just as a successful student, but will graduate with 4+ years of fond memories. ?( ? )? Unfortunately, I don't have personal experience or advice I can pass onto you regarding moving out for school. But, I'd be more than happy to ask my friends (who did move for university) about the process, talk about some of the resources you find, and answer some questions that I do have some insight in. With all being said, and as we usually chat first before getting into a new Convo, how have you been doing? Anything new happening on your side of the province? OH. THAT JUST REMINDED ME. Do you mind me asking you about living in a rural community? More so, I'd love to gain insight on small town living, and what's life like there. I'm in the middle of interviewing for a job that will involve travelling to remote/rural communities, and I thought oh boy... I literally know nothing... But I definitely know someone I could ask.

So, you may remember my Capstone where I theorized a CRISPR-Based Ebola vaccine. I was meeting with my teacher Monday to discuss a scholarship and she mentioned she thought I should do the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair. The registration closed on March 11th, but she sent a couple emails and somehow got me in yesterday. So, I had about 30 hours to write up this project board for 4:00pm today and I finished it about 30 minutes before I needed to submit it. I have a lot more work to do but next week (Thursday &amp; Friday) I am going to UBC (Vancouver) to present a version my capstone project in the GVRSF! I am also going to do a smaller science fair with one of the libraries near where I live. Anyways it's cool and I did not think my Capstone would take me this far. :D I don't have time to watch the video and answer the questions right now but I will do that this weekend.

T___T Long story short, my laptop decided to go into an early retirement and no longer turn on, which meant I've been navigating everything via my iPad for the last week. I just took the plunge today and am writing this on my new lappy (goodness are laptops expensive nowadays!) I sincerely hope you've been well during this time... Well, at least I hope you've been better than my old laptop LOL. I do have one more interview on Tuesday so I hope to get back to you with good news next week! Fingers crossed, and thanks again for your patience during this crazy time in my life x). Anyways, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CAPSTONE AGAIN. Seriously, I'm so glad your work is gaining attention, because not only did you put in a ton of effort (and scored 100% which I will forever be proud of!!!) but I think this is an excellent way for you to network, connect with likeminded students who may be your peers in the future, and get valuable experience with presenting. Seriously, shout out to that teacher for getting your project in! And just think... This is just the beginning with your Capstone. Imagine when you do future research projects, presentations, etc. I can't wait to read your future publications one day. ;)) Speaking of practicing presenting, while I'm not sure how prevalent presentations are in more STEM based courses, I had a professor who made sure to have final presentations in every one of her class. There was a dress code (business casual), time limit (&lt;10 minutes), slide limit, and besides her own marking, she would have random peers in our class evaluate our presentation skills. While this was absolutely nervewracking, she made a point that she wanted to prepare us for the future when we would have to stand in front of professionals and present our work - better to gain experience practicing with our peers as students. That's why I think this is a great opportunity to be in that environment of people coming up to you and asking more about your work. You'll do great! ?? So glad to be back!

Sorry about your old laptop though :( Updates from the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair: 1) there was HUGE student interest in my project, there was over 200 project and so many people were talking about mine. When I would meet new people, they would ask what my project was and I would tell them and they would say things like ""oh you're the one who did that? People are talking about it on the other side of the room!"" ""Oh, I heard about your project."" Etc... 2) I won bronze! I liked that I gained respect for my ideas from people who understood my ideas. I also enjoyed proving myself, people realized that they shouldn't underestimate me or my idea just because I don't go to a private school or I haven't done IB/AP (my school doesn't offer it). I like the idea of a presentation final project but it depends on the class. I can imagine some of the presentations would be boring. It would be great practice though. Ways of Knowing This is not what I was expeting for this topic. What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? You can study something as much as you want, but living the experience/living in the place is completely different. You could read everything about a place but when you live there for a bit you learn about the people, the customs, the hidden places, where to go/where to avoid. I think when you live somewhere you can understand it on a much deeper level. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor No? How might know the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? It might encourage us to be more thoughtful about how we use it. From my understanding, indigenous people were very good at running the land they lived on and the habitats around it, perhaps we would benefit from incorporating some of those into our lives. Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Scientific knowledge is viewed as better and more advanced but I think that they can often be viewed together. One type of knowledge isnt better than the other, both have pros and cons and they can be better when combined. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledge working together? They conflict with each other because people think science has no traditional knowledge. People like to reject the past when thinking of science, yet traditional knowledge tends to contain science without clearly stating the science behind it. ( I heard this somewhere, Im going off memory, might not be 100% accurate) Indigenous people would/will only peel the bark off certain sides of the trees because certain sides (i forget which) are needed more to protect the tree and if you damage the tree on those sides it will have a higher chance of dying. The reason some sides are more susceptible is that weather is harsher from certain directions, the sun shines from east to west (more growth where the sun shines), etc Where does this program find these videos? These past few have been very niche. Your mentee, Rachel",Mentee,Posts in Ways of Knowing

Congratulations on your bronze, and again, this is just the beginning! If you recall a few conversations ago, we talked about getting into research at the start of undergrad: Certain schools distribute research awards across their faculties, where students receive a stipend to conduct research with their professor(s) and a chance to present their findings (Like UVic's JCURA). There are also awards like the NSERC / USRA that are nationally awarded in Canada, which can help fund your research as an undergraduate student too. As you start your studies and begin reaching out to potential professors / P.I.'s, keep awards and grants like these in mind! Not only do I think you'd be a strong candidate to win these research awards, but having formal presentation experience + an established interest in research can help you stand out as a prospective research assistant to your future professors. Just keep your head up and keep trying (as securing funding for anything can be so iffy)! I think no matter where we go, we always run the chance of meeting those who undermine others. But you've got a strong foundation and you've got something to prove! You just keep doing what's important to you, and I know it'll pay off. :) Haters can just stay in their lane lol. - - What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? I totally agree with your answer on this one. I said this during one of my interviews - It's one thing to study a patient's chart, but it's another to actually handle it. Living on the land exposes you to lived experiences, whereas studying the land can only immerse you so much. However, there is value in both experiences, it's just a matter on what you are trying to achieve. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor. ""No?"" LOL. Your answer cracked me up, but honestly, I don't think I have any stories either. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? Totally with you on this one! When I visited Halifax a few years ago, I noticed their trees were so much smaller than on the westcoast. While I'm not entirely certain on the history behind the reason, it would definitely make me think twice before cutting one down for resources (From memory, I remember being told it was due to logging / an accident that affected the trees? Correct me if I'm wrong tho.) Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I think ""scientific"" knowledge is more accepted than ""traditional"" knowledge when it comes to standard science / studies. I think there is more openness to different types of knowledge, and with that comes more opportunities to collaborate with others and advance our studies together. There doesn't have to be a divide between ""science"" and ""tradition"", when we can start building a history utilizing both. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledges working together? When you think of scientific knowledge, you think objectivity, you think quantitative, and you think replicable. You can't express sig figs differently from one person to the next, because no matter how you experience science, it's typically stable. I hope that makes sense. However, with traditional knowledge, this comes with experience. This comes with stories, with trials and errors, and the feelings that take part in that. I feel there is a conflict between the two, because as you said, people may reject one in favour of the other - In reality, there is truth behind both and nobody is necessarily in the right or in the wrong. In the video, they often expressed ""living"" and ""being"" as themselves in that land. I thought that was very insightful. You can live anywhere you wish in the world, but could you ""be"" yourself? ... Maybe these videos are getting to me hahahaha. Happy pre-Friday! ;) Your mentor, Mary",Mentor,Posts in Ways of Knowing

While I've done it before pre-pandemic, some countries having restrictions and certain requirements (i.e. uploading time-sensitive information onto country travel databases) makes it a different process! Just something to keep in mind if you or someone you know plans to travel soon! Hm... I'm not sure how available stipends or grants may be for freshmen (that's something you'll have to explore within your uni and discuss with your undergraduate counsellor), but if I were in your shoes, I would first look into building familiarity and rapport with a professor. For example, this is how I approached my professor for research: While in their class, they had mentioned to everyone that if any student was interested in... Say, social determinants of health, to speak with them personally. I sent them an email, introducing myself as a student in their class, who was interested in their lecture regarding the social determinants of health, and if there was any possibility of volunteering with them during their research. During these emails, my professor asked what research I was interested in, my research experience, etc. When I met them in person in their office, I presented them with my resume / CV, and explained further in detail what I was looking for, what I could contribute, and if there was a position that could possibly be a good fit for me. While you know the end to this story (unfortunately COVID disrupted the research!), I definitely think establishing that network early on for potential continuity would be highly beneficial. In other words, being able to conduct and continue your research every Summer throughout the course of 1-4 years would be neat, wouldn't it? It could possibly open doors for publications, presentations, and build that experience needed for a career in research and academia. I guess to summarize, while I don't think it would necessarily hurt to ""cold email"" professors regarding working with them, it would be advantageous to have that familiarity of being their student, and definitely having that awareness of going into research that you're truly interested and passionate about. But if you're just keen to get started, maybe we could look into UNBC's research faculty and see professors whose research interests align with yours? :D -- Thanks for asking about my job updates! So unfortunately, for the job that I was asking you many questions about (the rural opportunity), they weren't able to process my application any further past the interview. While I was super excited about it, there were certain factors that were included in the work that I wasn't ready to commit to yet (for example, having to drive solo for 2+ hours on the mainland when I've only ever driven on the Island!). As they say, when one door closes, another opens. Just hoping this next door is the right fit! I'm down to move on to Part 2! I'll see you there, my mentee!

School starts in 2 days so I was very busy getting secondhand furniture and unpacking stuff! Starting to settle in now which is good :) I think being self aware of how your feeling, and what things might brighten your mood is very important. My recommendation would be to reward yourself when you get stuff done - big or small. It can help you realize that you are making progress, even when you feel like you aren't. The rewards could be anything that you like that feels motivating (food, games, exercise, seeing your friends, time on your phone). It can also help with not feeling guilty about schoolwork (because you've already done some - or maybe even finished it). I find a lot of recommendations that people may have are easier said than done, but some of them will work for you. There are lots of study tips online that might help when the time comes. It's important to remember that a lot of these things take practice. You might have to try them a couple times before seeing whether they actually work for you or not. Ideally you will develop skills that means your work is getting done, but you also have time to take care of your needs. Balance makes school a lot more sustainable long-term.

I'm really trying to be better this year, but time will tell... lol Last month, a guy that teaches study skills recommended a book to me (Help Your Kids With Study Skills). Although it says ""Kids"" it is really relevant for any students. I would definitely recommend if you want any idea (I think it was around $10 on Apple Books, but you can get hard copies on Amazon as well). In the past I have noticed that breaking bigger projects into smaller chunks, especially when you are just starting the projects, makes them a lot less inimidating! This paired with taking lots of breaks can make work feel a lot more manageable. I definitely struggle with starting, sometimes I will sit for hours trying to start something but being unable. I find that starting a timer can really help. Even if it's just for 5 minutes - a super manageable amount of time. Then take a timed break and start another chunk. This method may not work for you, but it's definitely worth a shot! Your school might have people that can help with study skills like time management as well!

I think that transitioning to adulthood is pretty drawn out in modern times for many people. I think something I noticed right away is how difficult it can be to make friends, especially if I you're not in school. It definitely still happens, but not with the ease of elementary and secondary school friendships. I think putting yourself out there, and joining clubs can really help you meet people. I also find that the friends I've made as an adult are much more like myself. Another challenge I have faced, is living with my parents and not having the independence that I need. Now that I've moved for school again, its such a relief to have my own space, and be able to decorate it in a way that I like. And not having to constantly worry about keeping someone else's space clean. I am lucky in that I get along with my parents very well, but it's definitely gotten to the point (especially after the pandemic) that I really need my own space. There are also the obvious challenges of having to take on different jobs - paying taxes, working full-time, and renting/buying housing. It can be pretty difficult learning how to manage your money, and possibly stressful too! I've been lucky in that I haven't had to rent anywhere before this year, but I think that means I am a little more stressed now than I would have been if I was used to it haha. As of now these things are all that come to mind, but I'll let you know if I think of anything else! Hope your week is going well so far :) Madia",Mentor,Posts in Well Being and Self Care

Something that I thought was neat was how each individual found inspiration in their very own way - it was unique to them! I think people often get inspired by the events of their own lives and their own experiences. What stood out to you from this documentary?

Many times the strength we find to propel ourselves forward in life comes from finding it in those who may not have the same opportunity as us. I also think that raising awareness who diseases is very important and you would do great work and help a lot of people if those were your goals. I find inspiration for studying and working in knowing that I am not only setting up my future but also my future kids future, by creating for myself a stable career. I also do have other hobbies, and the inspiration I have to do those is for my mental health. Now a days we see burn out happening a lot, and so I try and avoid them by making time for healthy habits. please continue to anchor text 2.",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Please watch the video titled ""The Creative Process: Where Do I Start?"". Consider the following statement from Mina Shum: Everybody wants somethingI think you plan everything. I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled. Think about what inspires you... What do you want in life? What are you passionate about and why? Share your thoughts, and try to write 5 things that you want in life, and why you want these things. They can be materialistic, experiential, etc!

No worries about the structure of your message - it's great! this doesn't have to be formal in any way, it's all about just writing out your thoughts. :) I definitely agree that creating from what you know really does create something authentic and I think other people will resonate with that authenticity as well! But I actually disagree with the guy a little bit lol ~ as a writer myself, I often write about situations or things I haven't personally experienced, but I always draw on the emotions that I have felt and that I think would be relevant in those situations, since as humans we can all relate to the same emotions. For example, I have never played hockey but I think I could write about someone who did and had to give it up because I know what it's like to feel dissapointment and resentment and yearning and I could draw on those to write something that is still authentic. Of course, there are definitely things I would never write about that aren't my experience ~ like POC experience for example ~ so there are lines about what is and isn't ok to create from. But yes, it's definitely best to draw on what you know first, because that will create the most true to you and genuine result. And I think people can tell when you're creating from your heart, versus trying to use someone else' voice. People resonate with what you create when it comes from you and it makes it all the more special and important, because you have something only you can share with the world from your own unique persepctive. I really like what Mina said -I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled. I think we as humans have this innate desire to create things - with whatever materials we can! For example, I always find myself folding napkins into origami cranes whenever I'm waiting for food in a restaurant. I think creating things and making art gives us a sense of purpose and helps us express ourselves, whether that's art or writing or building in minecraft or cooking or something. Okay, enough rambling from me haha! Do you have any creative outlets or any creative projects you want to try out? Thanks &amp; looking forward to your thoughts!

For example: Spending half-an-hour after school in the library going over the notes you took in class that day will likely improve your grades. Visiting your grandmother every Sunday will help you build a stronger bond with her.

I can fill it out every Friday afternoon and the first thing I will put in it is my self care tasks. This way there will be time for my self care tasks and they won't get forgotten/overlooked. (2) By the time school starts, I want to be able to get up at 6:45 am so I have time to get ready. I can do this by starting to go to bed a little earlier each night and waking up a little earlier each morning while I am still on summer break. I would do this until I am able to go to bed by 10:30 pm. This would be so I get used to this sleep schedule. By the time school starts then I will be used to going to bed by 10:30 pm and waking up at 6:45 am. (3) I would like to have a more definite idea of what I want to do after I finish high school.

I understand that a scheduled day of the week may be too difficult to keep up with, so we can stick with the standard 1 week to reply and you can do so whenever. I can agree with your list of things you want in life and they are each very important. I am sure you will get to a point where you are genuinely happy and passionate about what you do! I think it is important to sit with yourself and explore different career options and find one that sparks that passion. You do not necessarily need to find a passion in high school, or at any other stage in your life. Sometimes, people find something they are passionate about along their journey, and that is okay! Now, where do I find inspiration? That is a great question! I think something that is inspiring to me is thinking about my past and where I am today. For instance, there was a certain point in time where I just wanted to be where I am today. And now, of course, I have other goals. But, thinking about how I was able to acheive my previous goals inspires me and motivates me to acheive my new ones. This applies to all areas of my life such as school and hobbies. Great job at identifying your goals and thinking of steps you can take to make it happen! One habit I have built is finding the perfect time of day to be productive and work towards my goals. For me, that is waking up early and getting things done - for instance, studying. This has helped me work towards my goals because I have found that I study best at this time of day and starting early makes me feel better about my progress. This does NOT mean that you need to be an early bird and work in the morning. I would advise you to figure out what works for you - some people work best at night, and others allocate their afternoons to work. Finding a routine will help you set time for all the things you need to do. This reply was on the longer side - if I missed anything or if you want me to talk more about one of the points I mentioned, please just let me know and I will elaborate. I hope that was at least somewhat helpful :). I wish you the best of luck with school and out-of-school activities and remember to take care of yourself :).",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Q: How do the goals and habits you had in high school compare to the ones you have now, as a post-secondary student and young adult? A: Some goals have changed drastically, while others have remained. For example, I've always known that I wanted to work towards a career as a medical doctor, and it remains a goal of mine. I heard a quote once that went something like ""be ridgid in your goals, but flexible in your approach"". This is something that I've really had to practice as there have been many times when things havent gone as planned. Despite this, my goal of becoming a doctor prevails! Some goals that I no longer strive for are (1) moving to Vancouver Island and (2) learning the guitar. I've replace these goals with (1) staying in the town where my mom lives to live at home and save on costs, and (2) keep practicing the piano, an instrument I already play but would like to master! Q: How did you decide what your major/ career was the best fit for you? A: Originally, I planned on majoring in biology as I read online that it was the suggested major for students wanting to persue medicine. As such, I applied to UBCO with this major in mind, and took all the necessary first-year science courses. When it came time to formally choose my major (in 2nd year university), I thought about some of my favourite aspects of my classes. I realized I really enjoyed all the chemistry-based lessons. I made an appointment with the school academic counsellors, who suggested that I consider majoring in biochemistry. After some research, I decided it would be the best fit for me. I know this can be an intimidating decision to make, I'd be happy to answer any more specific questions you might have! - Sarah",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

After all, the planner should be a tool for achieving better self-care :) The Interact club sounds like a great volunteer activity. What kinds of things does the group do around the community? Remember to reflect on these experiences as they will teach you very important lessons, and describing these reflections may come in handy on a university application (or in an interview) one day. Over the time we've spent getting to know eachother, it's become clear that you have a goal and that you are willing to work hard to achieve it.

I can totally understand why you have an interest in persuing a medical career! These experiences/ interactions with the community will definitely help you when you find yourself in an office with patients one day. I thought you might enjoy taking the Work BCs Career Discovery Quizzes at https://careerdiscoveryquizzes.workbc.ca/#career-quizzes On this site there are three different quizzes: (1) Abilities, (2) Work Preferences, and (3) Interests. When you get some time, work through at least one of these quizzes as an opportunity to really explore your options. Then, choose one of the careers from your quiz results and share your answers to the following questions... 1. Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? Developing the skills needed for a career takes time and dedication  so if you follow a career path because someone else wants it for you, or because you heard it pays well, you may not have the passion you will need to persevere. 2. Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? On average, you want to be able to balance satisfying work with opportunities for social connection, creative and physical activity, and simply enjoying your life. 3. Will this career offer me financial security? Although there needs to be more to career choice than money, at the end of the day, you will need to be able to pay your bills with the salary you can earn from your chosen career. 4. How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? Job security refers to the likelihood that there will be jobs available in this career area  now and for the foreseeable future. You will need to think about and research!  whether there is a current and future need for the work you want to do. 5. Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Some career paths will require you to relocate, others will allow you to return to home to work. Its important to think about how location will factor into career decisions.

Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? I would say that I have a strong personal interest in this type of work. I have been interested in pursuing this type of work for a while. I think that it would be a very interesting job where you get to interact and /or help others daily. When I clicked on the specialist physician it said that specialist physician work in a specific area of health care, including clinical medicine, laboratory medicine and surgery. If I chose to pursue this job, there are many options. Once I had a more definite answer on what I wanted to do, I could choose a job that fits me and that I have a strong personal interest in. 2. Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? I think this job may be difficult to maintain a work-life balance because if you are a physician you usually have to be on call sometimes and if there are not many people who do the job that you do where you are located you may work long hours. However, with time I may be able to work out a more balanced lifestyle. 3. Will this career offer me financial security? According to WorkBC, the annual provincial median salary is 256,202. Based on this salary I think it is enough to offer me the financial security to pay all of my bills and allow me to have all the necessities I need. 4. How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? According to the job site from 2021-2031, the expected number of job openings is 3,002. I think there is a current need and there will be a future need for specialist physicians because there are always people who need to see a physician and you need to be able to replace the physicians that retire. I also think there will be a need for more specialist physicians because as the population grows the number of specialist physicians would need to grow. 5. Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Since I live in a rural place I would probably have to move to a more urban centre to be a specialist physician. Our hospital does not really have any specialist physicians because it is too small. People here are referred to larger places (ex Prince George).

I like what you said about there being 'many options' if you decide to persue a career path as a physician specialist. This is so so true, and from what I've heard, most specialists decide their specialty years into being a medical student. In a way, I think this takes pressure off of having to plan out your future too precisely, as no matter what specialty you choose, they share the common first steps of getting an undergrad degree, and then attending medical school. That being said, I am curious - have you thought about what specialties you would like to learn more about? Are you leaning towards any one particular area?",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

Yeah sports are great, especially when they are just for fun. When I was in highschool I took volleyball very seriously, but soccer was just to have fun more or less. I played on a house team, as well as my school team, and neither were very competetive, but it was great to get some exercise and hang out with my friends. Even if your school doesn't have a lot of sport/club options currently, there might be some opportunities in your local community - might be worth a look :)
Rotary sounds really cool! I have some friends that did rotary at their school and it sounded like it was very rewarding! If you're looking for more things to try you could also start your own club with friends!

Moreover, I'm very interested in joining volunteer clubs like that of Best Buddies! I would love to have a chance in the future to join a club like that! I would also love to learn how to play soccer and volleyball, (though my gym class proved my skills to be very bad ??). 
I'm very interested in extra-curricular activities like volunteer clubs and sports like badminton! Actually, last school year, I joined my school's rotary club, where we did activities like bake sales to raise money. They were very enjoyable and fun to organise and do, and were for a cause too! I also joined my school's badminton team, which was a very fun but tiring experience. I would love to do much more, but my school has very limited amount of extra-curriculars :(

Yes, rent can definitely be a big factor, especially in BC as we have a very high cost of living. I am actually just figuring that out for the first time as I was able to live with family during my undergrad, which was a huge help. I'll be going to UBC in the fall and Vanvouver is exorbidant! And yes, alcohol is very expensive - especially at restaurants and bars. It can double the cost of a meal!
I lived off-campus previously, but mostly because I could stay with family for free. I know people that have done both though, and I think that it does really depend where you are. At the small college I went to, I've heard that the accomodation is really bad, and not all that much cheaper in the grand scheme of things as rent nearby is fairly affordable.
I have been looking into UBC housing in Vancouver recently and it actually looks a lot less expensive. My mom stayed in family housing when she went to UBC (she had 2 kids at the time) and I think she saved a lot of money. Currently it is really hard to find studio or 1-bedroom apartments for less than $2000 in the Vancouver area, especially if you want to be close to UBC. Most on-campus housing is less than $1500, even for a 1-bedroom (no roomates). I do think this can vary from city-to-city, and there is more than just rent to consider. Living on campus might mean you can spend less money on transit, but you might be farther from downtown. 
I definitely did fewer extra-curricular activities in University than I did in high school. During my first 2 years I had a part-time job, so I didn't really have time for other activities. I was in a very small program though, so it was pretty easy to make new friends. When I moved to Montreal for my last 2 years of my degree I joined a club called Best Buddies. It is a volunteer organization that sets students up with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to form meaningful connections. It wasn't your typical extra-curricular activitiy, but it was a great experience and it helped me make some new friends (which was a lot harder to do at a big school). 
Now that I am going back to Uni, I think I would like to do more extra-curricular activities. I would love to do intermurals or something. I really love volleyball, and would love to play again. I would be open to soccer and badminton as well. I would also love to do some pottery or sewing classes!

Based on the article, I learned that learning all about such finances and knowing how to manage them would really help, and that budgeting is a very important thing to do. As mentioned in the video, rent is the biggest factor for these finances. If you don't mind me asking, did you live on-campus or off-campus, and how did you make your choice?

I'm 22, I live with my boyfriend, I read a lot of books, and right now I'm working at a coffee shop for the summer. I just had a read through your profile, and it seems as though we've got tons of interests in common!

At the moment however, my career goal is to get my PhD in English and become a professor. I also love to paint, crochet, hike in nature, cook, and write poetry. I am a member of the alphabet mafia (I'm pansexual, and maybe somewhere approaching genderfluid but that remains to be seen). I also loved social studies and all things historical and mythological in highschool, although that interest has changed somewhat in university. I'm really excited to get to know you and hopefully share some of my experiences with UBC and the arts as an avenue for careers, and also for what its like being from a small town and moving to a big city! Are there any specific questions for me that you have right from the get go? My questions for you are: 1. What is your goal for the e-mentoring program, since you're completing it voluntarily? 2. What are one or two conversations that you immediately find interesting when you see the title? 3. How long would you like to work on the program for? Are you cool to go with the flow and see how things develop even into summer, or are we doing a speed round and trying to finish talking by the end of June? 4. Do you like to read? If so, do you have a favourite book at the moment? I look foreward to hearing from you soon. All the best, Kira",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I am very interested in healthcare and health science in general, so I'd love to explore different program options in that area! I've also considered going the route of medicine, or potentially sonography or respiratory therapy? I'm not really sure yet! Anyways, that's me! I'm very excited to be doing this program!

Attached is a picture I find beautiful (PHOTO). It is a photo I took of my dog Mocha while she was relaxing outside with me on our deck.

Congrats on graduating. My name is Ryver (River), I am 18y/o and graduating from Charles Hays SS this year. My favourite class this semester would have to be careers, but our school system is pretty odd since we only have 2 classes a day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) and we have four 10 week terms throughout the year. Throughout the year my favourite class was definitely Pre - Calc or Fitness and Conditioning for obvious reasons. Some of my interests are: basketball, weightlifting/powerlifting, track and field/cross country and volleyball, I also like walking a lot since I live in a small town so you could walk anywhere in like 20 minutes at most. I just started doing track and field/cross country this year because I wanted to do a bunch of stuff during high school since I wont get another chance to play high school sports, I started playing Volleyball in grade 8 with a few of my friends since we've never played any sports on a team together. Basketball for me has always been fun, especially since i would get to play with all my friends, high school basketball was a great experience but covid did mess it up a bit. lol that was a bit longer than expected Some questions I got are: How much more different is University than High School?

To tell you a bit about myself, I am a fourth-year Bachelor of Applied Psychology Student at Douglas College. An interesting fact about me is that I used to do background work in the Film and TV industry. How about you, do you have an interesting fact about yourself? No worries, that's a good question! This semester we will be working through three modules. The modules include: Well being and Self Care, Entering the Job Market, and one of your choices from the wheel. You will need to let me know which one you would like to begin with and I can unlock it. Each module includes an anchor text which is basically a discussion point for us to talk about and work through. The goal of the program is for you to hopefully be able to identify your interests and skills and explore some ideas regarding post-secondary and life in College/University.",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I'm currently working on my PhD in cancer genetics research at UBC and I want to be a clinical researcher after I graduate. During my bachelor's degree, I worked at a biotech company developing antibody therapeutics and did my final project in a virology lab. I also saw you mentioned that you enjoy taking in really scenic locations. BC has so much to offer! Do you have a favorite place so far? I really like Broughton islands north of Vancouver Island.

My favourite quote is probably from the TV show Ted Lasso- ""be curious, not judgemental""- I think it's very easy these days to jump to conclusions when we see the news or just in day-to-day life, so it's a good reminder to stay curious and always ask ""why"" instead of jumping straight into judgement.

Do we have to do the conversation things? We totally can, but I'm not too fussed either way. How are you liking Vancouver so far? How's the rain? I've been to the UBC campus only once before but it was absolutely gorgeous the last time I saw it. Is it pretty easy to get everywhere? I'd love to learn more about healthcare field options and what kind of schooling gives me the most options. I've looked into different health-related careers and there are so many different programs! Some are through colleges and others are university ones, I'm not really sure what would be better for me. How did your first year of med school go? Was it hard? Also, what did you do before med school, like what kind of undergrad program did you do? You mentioned that you considered a few other healthcare careers, what kinds? I'm definitely leaning more toward nursing at the moment because (as you mentioned) there are so many different routes you could go with a nursing degree! I'm still not entirely sure if nursing is for me though, that is why I decided to start by doing first-year science so that I can explore that as well. I am definitely an introvert and so I feel like working with people, especially people who are going through tough times could be very draining, but could also be very rewarding? Thanks!

To answer your questions: 1) I first learned about criminology when I was in grade 12. I live near SFU and they are very well-known for their criminology program, so I looked more into it and found it very interested; 2) I actually got accepted into UBC's psychology program, but ultimately chose to study criminology. It's hard to reflect on why I decided to do that, as my current path is geared more towards psychology (I'm hoping to pursue a Master's in counselling psychology!) but I will say that I learned a lot throughout my criminology degree and am a much more critical thinker today; 3) I would say that the most difficult part of my degree was the amount of reading and writing I had to do. It's a big jump from what I was expected to do in high school, but it got easier as time went on. Also, Brooke, since you are choosing to do the eMentoring program on your own - are there any specific Conversations that you wanted to touch on?

Before then I believe I wanted to pursue a career in either political science or medicine. For me personally pursuing psychology was giving me the opportunity to learn about the taboos of mental health that no one at home talked about. I got to learn about why certain people's brains aren't wired consistently to others, why my emotions are valid and although in your undergraduate degree you won't be learning about how to help others it gave nice examples of what to look forward to in graduate school.

No need to do the conversations if you don't want to. I LOVE Vancouver! It does rain significantly more than my hometown, but I really enjoy the changes in weather. We are so close to everything, mountains, snow, hiking, beaches, all while being in the big city! I also like that it doesn't really snow here (only on the nearby mountains of course). We got a LOT of snow where I used to live and it made driving and getting around in the winter very hard. It is so beautiful too, the cherry blossoms in the spring and all the maple trees in the fall give the best backgrounds ever haha. It's really easy to get around in, I just moved to live by the skytrain, and I feel like everything is SO much closer now! But you don't have to only use the skytrain, there are so many buses and they come really often (especially compared to small town transit haha, if there even is any!). There's also a ton of fun things to do all the time, but it is definitely a lot more expensive than rural living unfortunately... There are a TON of different options of healthcare careers. Even within nursing, there are registered nurses, nurse practitioners, licensed practical nurses, home care nurses, nurse educators, the list goes on! If you haven't already, I would consider looking up the different responsibilities of each, because there are just so many different things you can do! Outside of the nursing scope, healthcare is a HUGE field. It's a great idea to keep your options open until you truly know, that's what I did! I think there are pros and cons to both university and college programs, I have done both and I have enjoyed both. I went to a small program in the Kootenay's called the Rural Pre-Medicine (RPM) program at Selkirk College. It's a three year program that sets you up for entry into a variety of different fields, including medicine, pharmacy, optometry, chiropractics, etc, so these were all careers that I had considered. I ended up choosing medicine because that was what I was originally interested in, and I liked the idea of the independence that came with being a physician, while still getting to work in a team-based atmosphere. I also liked the subject matter more. The RPM program was really nice because the class sizes were really small, I got to save money, and they helped prepare you for big exams like the MCAT (medical college admissions test) and for the MMI (multiple mini interview) that you need to get into medical school. My first year of medical school was great! I really really enjoyed it. There is definitely a learning curve, because it's a little different than an undergrad program, where your studying habits need to change to adapt a different style of learning. That being said, it's SO fun to be able to practice in a hospital, and put the things you're learning into practical use. You also get hospital or long term placements in first year of nursing, so I'm sure it would be a similar experience to getting your feet wet in a hospital career. There are plenty of places for introverts in healthcare, so no worries about that at all. It can be draining to work with patients all the time, but I think if you're passionate about it, it's well worth it! There are also different specialties other than nursing that interact more or less with people as well, like lab techs, medical pathologists, radiologists, etc. If you're interested more in what the day to day could look like, I definitely recommend speaking with a nursing student. You could also ask them what exactly the patient interaction level is, but I would imagine it's on the higher side. Hope you're having a great day! Kira",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I also took lots of elective course in anthropology, archaeology and crim. I also had to take credits in English and science. I did a dinosaur course which was really interesting, but a lot of work. Seeing as you're interested in law enforcement: my crim courses were about the structure of the Canadian legal system, the problems with it, analyzing major court cases in Canada and other stuff like that. There are also courses about criminal behaviour, youth in the criminal justice system, but I didn't take those because I was focusing more on psychology. I've always kind of struggled with knowing what I want to do. I don't really even know now. I wanted to be a psychologist for a while. I've thought about being a teacher on and off. Then I thought about archiving after I worked at the museum. I also thought about law enforcement and the military when I was first starting university. So... I don't really know because I have so much that I want to do. I've been working at the Student Union Building at my university since September and I recently got a full time job there for after graduation. It's not what I want to do forever, but it is a good place to be while I figure out what I'm going to do. Have you looked much into how to get into the careers you're interested before?",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

To answer your question I would prefer to have a back and forth chat, but I do have about some topics that I would like to ask about first. The first topic I'd like to ask about is mainly about education in high school before going into criminology 1)What kind of science classes would you recommend I take before going into criminology?, 2)What kind of math would be the best choice for this course?, 3)What should be my minimum grade for all my core classes?(core classes means english, science, math, and socials), and 4)What other classes should I be taking to be ready for criminology?.",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I also did some other sports like martial arts and swimming but those were done competitively outside of school only. I totally understand when you say sports are a big part of your life. Sports shaped a lot of my life I found that it taught me about good work ethic and helped me explore different parts of myself. My highschool was known for our sports teams, making it a very competitive environment. I would definitely say that it was successful but if I could change anything it would be to really cherish those moments when I was out on the field instead of getting caught up in some of the drama that was happening during that time since I dont play sports anymore. Its really strange going from playing so many sports to none. School during the pandemic was not fun. I found that the school work was harder and being isolated from the campus made learning bleaker. Going back in person was a lot more fun since I got to see everyone and we could all struggle together instead of alone. How did you find highschool during the pandemic? Since starting at UBC I never actually gave any thought about transferring. However, now that Im graduated and looking to apply to med school Im considering schools that are farther away like Australia and Toronto since I feel like it is something I am able to do now. But part of the application process for applying to medical school is writing the MCAT (medical college admission test) and distinguishing yourself through extracurriculars like volunteering. So I currently volunteer with a crisis line, the Canadian Red Cross, a tutoring company, and this. I also work as a background actor. I try to spend around 16 hours a week volunteering but it depends on my schedule. I knew since grade 5 that I wanted to be a surgeon so I always knew that Id have to go to school to achieve that. But I know that some of my friends struggled with deciding if the university was indeed for them. I actually had one of my friends drop out after the first year to go traveling and figure out what he wanted to do and he ended up coming back to school to get a business degree so he could open up his own business. Some questions that I have are: How do you think sports have shaped your life? Do you work or volunteer? Are you conflicted at all about going or not going to university?",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Perfect pitch means I can hear the pitches of everything around me, like a car honk or the key someones speaking in. Playing by ear is the same concept, except it means I can hear a song and instantly repeat it on any instrument! Also that's so cool!

I ended up talking about my experience working at guest services at a mall, when a guest had fainted. I had to communicate with the security gaurds, maintenance, and my fellow guest services coworkers about the situation via radio. As a team, we communicated well and worked through getting the guest an ambulance, cleaning up the floor area, and alerting alarmed guests about the situation. It was quite the experience, but sometimes the craziest experiences can lead to the best stories to tell during interviews!

Do you have any favourite places or must-see places in Vancouver? Thanks for the tip about looking up the duties of different nursing careers, I've only ever done that for LPNs and RNs before so it was cool to see the different range of duties among different professions! In the past I did consider going the LPN route first, just to test it out/see if I like it, but I feel like I will probably get a decent idea of if I will enjoy working in an environment during my first year in any nursing program. I have also looked into a few different specialties other than nursing like you mentioned, and I like those kinds of jobs too; I think those would also be a good option for me if I found nursing to be too draining lol. I love the idea of working in a team-based hospital environment so I'm also excited about that. Do you know of any healthcare scholarships or where I could find some? I feel like that is probably a useful thing to look into for future schooling but I'm not sure where the best place to look would be...any suggestions?

At first there was a chance i would've been at vancouver on my own for the test which i would stay at a hotel and take a taxi to where the test is at, it was kind of scary to think about being in a city i haven't been to in a long time and on my ownw but thankfully i have someone to go with now.So yeah just a little update on whats going on, i might not be back until monday.

When we came back to school we would have one class all day for 5 weeks, so it was good but bad because some classes would suuck if you didn't have any friends in it. but this year they switched it to two classes a day for 10 weeks which is definitely better, but i havent used a locker since the pandemic started, we also dont have any bells anymore. High school is alright now i guess but it'd be a whole lot nicer if the pandemic just didn't happen. Australia seems like it would be super nice, but i heard they got some wild spiders down there so i ain't messing with australia because spiders are gross. How is volunteering for this type of stuff, do you enjoy it? how did you get into background acting, was it more like a right place right time type of thing? School for me is something that i have to do if i want to do what i want to do, because if i dont do school then i cant play sports competitvely, i think your friend who traveled for a bit then went back to get a business degree is what i think im going to do after high school, but i also want to make a lot of money so i could open up a gym in 10-15 years with one of my friends who's studying kinesiology at viu. I think if i didn't play sports i'd not be in a good place right now because in prince rupert there are a lot of stuff that goes on that people dont know about and a lot of bad influences, but i've also grown up with older siblings who didn't really get the chance to play sports or do much extra curricular activities so they would get into the wrong group of ""friends"" who dont go to school and get in trouble. So in a way sports helped me stay away from all that type of stuff whether i noticed it or not, sports allowed me to hangout with friends everyday and create many more lifetime friends. sports also taught me how to work hard and push myself physically and mentally I had to do volunteering as a fundraiser for my basketball team because my school is big broke. i also did volunteer reffing for the minor basketball league (grades 3-8) here, i reffed every other weekend from september to the end of november. For work i offloaded crab last summer and i was supposed to go on a crabbing trip but it was to late. This summer i plan on going on as many crabbing trips as possible and offloading as much as possible. Crab fishing has been really good for the past year and a bit so i want to make sure i take advantage of it. Going to university has been a bit conflicting for sure but i recently decided to work for a year and head off to Van Island next year for school. Do you plan on going to med school with any friends or are you gonna make new friends once you actually get there? would you rather go to toronto or australia if it was your choice and why? what do you usually spend your summers doing?",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I personally love kits beach, theres lots of beach volleyball, running, parks, and general fun stuff to do! I love to run and hang out with friends/have picnics there. It's also super close to 4th, where there is a lot of good food options. There's great food everywhere, enough that you can definitely try something new every time! Rain or shine is really popular for ice cream, and I definitely reccomend trying out some different sushi or poke places because they are SO tasty! There are some great local hikes really close by that you can get to by bus in North Van, so I definitely recommend those as well! In the summer, the night market is very fun (or so I've heard, I'm going for the first time tomorrow haha). That's awesome that you're being so proactive and checking everything out, I think having experience in those areas will also help in any future applications or interviews, because it seems like you are much more invested in the program, which admissions wants to see. Healthcare scholarships... That's a tough one, there are entrance scholarships to UBC, and bursaries and general scholarships that open a little later in the year. Medicine has a few rural healthcare specific ones through the REAP program, but I'm not sure if they have any ones for nursing. I'm sure they exist, I just don't exactly know where they would be, sorry! I can do some loking and get back to you though! There are sites like scholarships canada and scholartree where I found a few healthcare scholarships, signing up for an account is really easy, and then searching through there, but they are generally bigger scholarships that have a lot of people applying. I funded my entire undergrad and some of medicine through scholarships, and my biggest tip is the local ones in your hometown. There is a lot of money available in rural areas for rural students, it just is a matter of finding them. They all add up, so even the smaller ones or ones that you don't necessarily fit the criteria for are good to apply to, because usually there isn't a lot of applicants. For example, I think I applied for scholarships from the credit unions in my small town (as well as the mill actually offered scholarships!), so I would be sure to check those out! I'm sure there are also existing healthcare scholarships for rural northern students too. Healthcare-related places to volunteer... Honestly most of my healthcare experience came from working. I worked as a student receptionist for a wellness/medical clinic, and that gave me some experience in the area. I know some friends that worked as pharmacy assistants as well. There are options for volunteering at hospitals too, but those differ from place to place (You can work with hospital staff, spend time with patients, do some administrative tasks with staff, etc). I feel like a really good place to get involved and volunteer in healthcare is through policy making or supporting causes in healthcare you believe in. A lot of people don't realize that that counts as healthcare volunteering as well. Finally, there's a lot of work you can do in palliative care or with the elderly. You can volunteer in palliative care clinics, which is very sad, but can be very rewarding work. I did have to do a little bit of training for that, but it was a fairly short and free course. There are also volunteer positions available visiting folks in long term care homes, and that can also be really fun! Really, you just have to look into different options, they mainly depend on WHERE you're trying to volunteer, so I can't exactly tell you a specific place or answer unfortunately, but they are out there! Hopefully that helps a little... Hope you're having a great day! Kira",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I have been looking for schools, courses and careers for a while now. I have found some careers such as private investigator, detective, etc. Honestly, I have not looked into psychology much more than the course I took this year. I found it really interesting though, but I'm not sure if it is more of a hobby than career for me. I would definitely enjoy a Criminology course, no matter what I do for a career. I think that what interested me in psychology was learning about the biology (the brain &amp; neurons), neurochemicals and the effects drugs have, and more towards defense mechanisms than people's overall mental health. I found psychodynamics to be interesting, though I think it was just because my love of history. I would love to be working out in the field though, no matter what the career.

Sure, a back and forth chat works for me! I'm aiming to get back to you within 3 days of receiving your messages, but absolutely no worries if you're unable to get back to my messages within the same time period. To answer your questions: 1. One of the most interesting classes that I took was Forensic Science. I think it would be very useful to take chemistry and biology in high school to give you a better understanding of what you would learn in Forensic Science! I did not take physics in high school, but I could see how that would be helpful in the Forensic Science course because I remember learning about forensic ballistics in that class! 2. I took Pre-Calculus 11 and 12 in high school. I didn't find that that type of math was very useful for my degree. I'm not sure exactly what math courses are offered in high school nowadays, but you will definitely be learning about statistics if you pursue a criminology degree. 3. I wouldn't be the best person to ask about the program requirements! To learn more about SFU's admission requirements, have a look at this page: https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission.html 4. I think Law 12 is an excellent class to take in high school, because it gives you a good foundational knowledge of the law in Canada. I hope that helps!",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Finding a doctor, dentist, etc. &amp; making appointments (yes/ not yet) - I can get more comfortable talking on the phone to people by answering my phone when it rings and I don't know the number.

Paying bills (yes/ not yet) - I can gain knowledge and experience about paying bills by watching/learning how my parents pay them so I can see how it works. If I have any questions I can then ask them about it. Once I am more confident and have a better understanding of what is going on I can tell my parents the steps on how to pay the bill as they do it.

If I was ever in a situation where something broke and I needed to fix it I could always look it up online or call a repair service. I can get more confident in calling by practicing talking on the phone a knowing what needs to be fixed so I can tell the repair company.

Usually us mentors are required to reply within 3 days from the previous message our mentees send, but for the mentees it is way more flexible. It's great to hear you have physical self care down, as physical wellbeing is correlated with your mental wellbeing as well. Therapy is also good too! Do you find it helpful so far? I think that can fit into mental self care. Of course, self care doesn't have to always involve doing an activity. It can also be knowing your limits and setting boundaries, setting time aside for yourself outside of work/school, or getting enough sleep. For me, I take care of myself by either meditating, dancing, reading, or engaging in my other hobbies. Have you tried anything like that to take care of yourself mentally other than counselling?

But it sounds like sports have really been a lifeline for you and has provided you with some structure. Also, thats so cool that you want to open your own gym. Getting a business degree will really help with that and it sounds like opening a gym will really align with your interests in sports and fitness. Plus working for the year will give you a chance to save up for school as well. Btw, crabbing sounds cool hopefully its a good season. Ive never done it before but I looked it up online and it looks like a lot of work lol. Volunteering is a lot of fun. It can get difficult juggling everything since its can get hectic but Id rather stay busy then bored. As for the background acting, I auditioned for an agency on a whim but ended up getting signed. So right now Im working on this movie called Totally Killer. I usually spend my summers hanging out with friends and going on little roads trips and flying down to Hawaii.

The first year or two of unievrsity you can be a bit flexible with what classes you take and you can apply to transfer into a different program if you decide you prefer a certain subject. So if you go to university, you have time to decide. It sound like you might be interested in biopsych courses. Psychology as a degree is quite variable - you can focus more on social psych, developmental, or more biopsych. Here's an example of a biopsych course that I took which focuses on hormones, chemicals and their effects on behaviour (which sounds a bit like what you're interested in): https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2021/spring/psyc/381/d100 Looking at course outlines for classes from different subjects might be cool if you're interested. it could be a cool way to see what's studied in differen majors. But you will have time to decide once you get to university. Working in the field is for sure cool! I actually do best when I'm not in class or doing research at a desk, so I totally get it. Something else you can look into at in University is co-op. How co-op works here is that you take classes for one semester, apply for jobs through your university, work for one semester, and then classes the next. It's a way to get work experience, pay for school and also experiment with different careers. My co-op advisor was the SFU co-op contact with the RCMP, and quite a few students do co-ops there every year. I /think/ most universities in BC have co-op.",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I dont personally like replying to messages days after recieving them, but my family has planned a lot of camping trips where there is barely to no service. Thank you for answering some of my questions about about high school courses, it is very helpful for planning ahead in course selection. Im very glad that Law 12 is something you recommend, it gives me more reassurance that I made the right choice for what classes I want to take for my Grade 12 year. But since you found that Pre-Calculus wasn't very helpful for criminology would you say that Foundations 11&amp;12 would be a better choice? For Science classes what grade level would be the minimum I should take for Chemistry? Beacause you see I'm not the best at Chemistry, but I will take it to to the required grade level (even if that means to grade 12) so I can get into the Criminology course. But other then that I'm perfectly fine with Biology, and somewhat with Physics. So far that is all the questions I have for you, Thank you for all your help so far.

We help around our community wherever there is something we can volunteer for. Last year, since the club did not start until late in the school year, we could only do one thing. We had a bake sale fundraiser so that we could buy helmets for a speed skating club. So far during this school year, we have volunteered to help with a silent auction where we helped people if they were looking for something specific and made sure nothing went missing. We made dignity boxes for women that were donated to a youth centre. Dignity boxes are boxes that have some necessities people may need (ex. toothbrush/paste, hairbrush/ties, and shampoo). For the Christmas season, I was able to help with our town's Christmas tree light up, help prepare dessert and serve food so people could have a Christmas dinner. There was also an Old Fashioned Christmas our club could help with, but I was unable to attend this event. To figure out what we do next in our community we look for things that we can do to help and that we are interested/passionate about.

I was also actually just recently in Vancouver and while I was there, I was thinking about how I will probably need a good raincoat. Ive heard that people in Vancouver dont really use umbrellas that much? Do you have any rain management tips or raincoat suggestions for when Im down there? Thanks!

I would definitely encourage you to talk to your high school counselor to help you make a decision about which math class to take as I'm not too familiar with the course content of Foundations 11 and 12. I also highly encourage that you connect with universities about their admissions requirements specific to their criminology programs, as they may require that you take a certain math in high school. Moreover, the Admissions department would also let you know what grade you need earn in chemistry. As for the top 3 to 5 things I wish I had known about criminology in high school, I'd say: 1. I wish I took more time to learn about what possible career paths I could take and really gain a better understanding of the populations I'd be serving. 2. I wish I learned more about where graduate studies in criminology (so, completing a Master's or PhD) could take me. 3. I wish I connected with people who have already completed the program so that I can see where they degree led them.",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

SO sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I have been shadowing at the hospitals here and haven't been checking my email!! CONGRATS on the graduation! Super exciting! You're gonna be a great valedictorian! I was also valedictorian for my class, and no worries, I wrote the speech the day before, haha. SO no matter what you do, it'll be great! Just try to remember to take some deep breaths beforehand, and it always helps me feel better to remember that I'm talking to my friends! Not a crowd of strangers! Either way, good luck! Course selection is an exciting but daunting process. 5 courses is definitely a lot. Of course, I think it's possible, but given that it's your first time in university, it depends how much work you want to devote to it! It is always nice to have the option to drop courses too (especially before the date that they get on your record). My course schedule was pretty insane, with 6 courses a semester, but that is to say that it was definitely doable with a LOT of time management. I definitely recommend getting a planner, because there aren't reminders for things like exams or assignments, and often the only time they are mentioned is in the syllabus at the beginning of the year. What I would do (and still do!) is as soon as I got my syllabus, I would put ALL the dates in my planner that same day, so at least I could look back and have them all written somewhere! Again, maybe this was just something that was helpful to me, because I like to have all my school and life organized haha. Sincerely hoping this advice isn't too too late (SO sorry if it is). I did finish my exams, thank goodness. There were a lot of them this year! My number one trick is (unfortunately) to start studying early and in short bursts (I find this is what works best for me). But, when in need, cramming does the trick, just not for long term (and that is NOT my official advice if REMBC asks). Definitely take breaks, focus on self care, exercise, sleeping, and eating healthy are all SUPER important in study sessions. I like to motivate myself with snacks, or studying/reviewing while walking or exercising, so that I can kill two birds with one stone. The night before/day of an exam, I try to not study at all, and not stress, you'll make it through! Vancouver rains A LOT. I will say that you do get used to it (eventually), and it makes it even better when the sun comes out! The summers are BEAUTIFUL though. I personally don't love using an umbrella, but it works in a pinch, and is easy enough to carry around with you if you don't trust the weather app (which you probably shouldn't). The main reason I am not a huge umbrella fan is because if it's windy, which it can be, they are useless. They flip so easily! They definitely have their time and place though lol. So I tend to prefer a good long raincoat, and I did splurge and get one that is really really waterproof (I would also get some waterproof shoes!), you WILL be sorry otherwise. You can't really avoid the rain, you gotta just make the most of it, so getting some good gear (even second hand or thrifted, because depending on what you're buying, it can be expensive!) will make your experience SO much better.

I have shadowed different doctors, including the OR (surgery), obstetrics and gynaecology, and Pediatrics so far! I've really loved Pediatrics, the cases are so complex and interesting, and of course the babies are adorable. I actually shadowed in my hometown, because u wanted to see what rural medicine looked like, and it was great! Hoping to do some more shadowing when I come back from my vacation in a month (I'm currently writing this in the LAX airport on my way to Costa Rica!)

In 2020 my family hosted an exchange student from Belgium for a few months, before covid happened and she had to go home without finishing her exchange :( And so this year she is coming back to our town to visit everyone and she is staying with us, and she will be coming down to Vancouver with us! So she'll get to come on our little road trip too and see the things she wasn't able to see last time she was in Canada! We are going to try to stop at Barkerville (I love it there; so cool) and also Vancouver island, and Vancouver! I'm really excited for that. Shadowing sounds super cool! What kind of stuff do you do while shadowing? Are you just watching or are you able to like help and participate? Is there any specialty that you are particularly interested in? I hope you've had a good summer! Hannah :)",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

It's a great idea to make some money before the big move too! Super cool that there's a family trip in the works, even cooler that your exchange student gets to join!!! Are you all close? I've never been to Vancouver island (yet, I plan on going later this year!!) so you'll have to tell me all about it. BC is such a beautiful place to explore! Hopefully you're getting excited to move, I'm looking forward to hearing how you like Vancouver! Costa Rica was BEAUTIFUL, very very fun. We basically spent a month hiking and beaching with some amazing scenery! It's really cool, almost ALL of the plants there are ones we would pay hundreds of dollars for here (like orchids and gigantic monstera) but in Costa Rica they're literally like growing in the ditch, or considered weeds or something! The animals were super super cool too, we saw lots of monkeys, frogs, sloths, toucans, parrots, dolphins, and lots more! We also got to hike a volcano and visit waterfalls and hot springs which was super cool. I definitely recommend a trip at some point in your life if you're interested! Shadowing is really cool, it's basically your opportunity to experience different specialities. I've so far only shadowed surgery, Pediatrics and obstetrics, but I'm hoping to do more soon. I'm really interested in Pediatrics, so that's kind of where I'm leaning right now but I am trying to keep an open mind! You're not really supposed to do anything when you're shadowing, just observing and asking questions! It kind of depends on your preceptor however. You have time in the school year to practice skills and things under supervision. Hope the move goes amazing, and you have a great trip with your family! kira :)",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I live about 20 minutes out of town, so there are never really any crimes out where I live, except for the occasional theifs or druggies trying to hide in an urban area to escape the cops. Its also nice because parents will feel safe enough to let their children walk to school without them by about grade 1 or 2 (with exceptions), and there's always a house nearby if anything were to go wrong. 2. Everyone knows everyone. Because where I live is such a small area, everyone knows everyone from something. whether its your friends, cousins, uncles, friends, grandpa or someone who plowed your driveway. This also makes it feel alot safer, but also like you arent just some outsider because we have community. 3. I also just really like not having to smell the pulpmill everyday. Our town is a logging town so it was built pretty much right next to our two major pulpmills that we have. Which makes in town, pretty stinky. You do get used to it after awhile, although somedays not even that will make it less bad. 1. Something that I dont like, although it contradicts a point about me liking where I do, Is that we were out of town too far. It takes 30 minutes to get to school, (which is alot of gas) and when I was younger I always just wanted to go hangout downtown with friends like other kids, but my parents wouldnt let me because it was too far. 2. Because it's a pretty small area theres also not alot to do where I live. We have a school (k-7), a community hall, a skating arena (closed all summer of course), a small diner, and a general store. There is a really big forested area on the west side of our community but unless you had a dirtbike, or wanted to just go build forts with the ""bush kids"" that wasnt much fun either.

For me, growing up in an urban area meant that I had a lot of things to do around me and everything was very convenient such as stores for shopping, the arcade for games and there was always new restaurants to try.

I grew up/am living in an urban community and what you've shared gives me a glimpse into rural life that I'm so ignorant about. Really appreciate that. To note, I know you're aiming for UNBC so my experiences may be a bit more ""urban"" than the community there but should still give you an idea of some similarities and differences. I'm at UBC in Vancouver and have lived in this area my entire life. Urban life: Unfortunately there's a lot of things I have to do to feel safe such as not being out at night by myself or locking up everything/taking it with you (even if you're just gone for a handful of minutes). For example, I've had friends (thankfully not me) who left their backpack out of sight for 10 minutes on campus to go do something and when they came back, it was gone. It's not super common but does happen. Community is an interesting one - I definitely have communities (such as within my church, class, friend groups, etc) that I know most people and feel completely safe, supported and cared for in. I also remember the first day walking into class with 191 other students and going, ""oh my goodness - it's high school all over again. I don't know anyone, this is too much and I have to socialize????"". Added fun - this was just coming off of COVID (2021) where we were just starting to see people again. I know my personality comes into play a bit (partially introvert and socializing is a lot of work) but there were a lot of us feeling lonely, having difficulty connecting or even finding someone to eat lunch with. After a year, I can definitely say I have a good group of friends in class now and know many others. I'm continuing to work on getting to know everyone else :) (an aside - for undergrad b/c you don't always have the same classes with the same people, it can be even harder to connect with people. I thankfully had one friend that I spent most of first year with and the years past that I made sure I had the courage to get to know at least ONE person in each course. School clubs also really do help with getting to know people, particularly when you're attending one regularly.) Distance! It's interesting our comparisons of what's considered ""far"" to travel. I grew up with most things (church, school, parents' work) within a 15min drive but now anything within 30min driving or 60min transit is a decent commute. I know people who have shorter or longer commutes to school/work. Right now my transit to UBC is about 45-90min one way though driving could be anywhere from 25-40min pending traffic. I actually often prefer transit if the route is handy as I don't have to pay attention while driving/GAS AND PARKING IS EXPENSIVE. They're also trying to make our city easier to cycle in. I did cycle 45min to work for a bit which was a nice workout. I also find it incredibly funny because to that particular workplace I would have to leave at the same time (1hr before start) for either transit, cycling or driving because the way traffic/parking worked. A quick note on entertainment - we definitely have a LOT of stuff we can do. Can get costly but there's definitely a lot depending what you're interested in. There's been days where I'll go hiking in the morning, hang out/play sports in the afternoon and watch a movie at night. To your last question - yes. Being in a big city has been overwhelming at times. I have definitely felt lost, insignificant, lonely/don't know anyone. At the same time I feel incredibly enriched with all that I have at my fingertips - all the different communities of people I've gotten to know, skills and experiences I've been able to develop and opportunities to try different things. I can also say it definitely helps to focus on the small (like hanging out with a small group of friends/family) when feeling lost in the big. Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear more about what personal challenges you might face moving/being part of an urban environment.",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

Do you have any schools you're interested in? Don't worry if not, I didn't think about that until I had to start applying in grade 12 lol",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I just wanted to let you know that unfortunately I'm not going to be able to keep mentoring because my school workload has turned out to be really heavy this term :( I wish I could continue but school is going to be taking up almost all of my time over the next little while. I'm so sorry about this, but I want you to know that you have been wonderful to work with and I'll miss chatting with you. Thanks so much for being such a great mentee &lt;3 I wish you all the best in whatever comes next for you, and I know you're going to do amazing things :)",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

 ""shes participating voluntarily, so there are no deadlines or requirements for certain modules.""

I have a similar sentiment towards interviews I think. It's easy to get in your own head and stumble over your words - especially when you haven't been in many interview-esque scenarios. It's definitely a skill, which is a bit of a relief because it means you can improve. 
I never really prepared for job interviews in the past (or interviews in general) but I had to for my university applications over the past couple of years, and I think I have really improved!! I would definitely recommend getting friends or family to help you practice answering unexpected questions.
What I find to be the hardest part now (after lots of practice), is getting to feel comfortable with the interviewer. The sooner you relax a bit, and are able to let your personality come through, the better (in my opinion).
As for a memorable interview, my interview for a summer student position comes to mind. I had to take a drug test, and normally they do it after the interview, but I did it before. The guy administering the test said ""compared to the interview, this part is nothing"". And I had to tell him that I hadn't done the interview yet... it was funny but also made me a lot more nervous for the interview. I didn't feel like the interview even went very well because I was so nervous, but I got the job! So I think I was probably being too harsh on myself. 
I'm not sure if that's what you meant by memorable, hahaha but it was indeed memorable!
Hope you have a nice thanksgiving weekend!",Mentor,Posts in Getting Hired

Anyways, I finished watching the video for the second anchor text! I'll gladly keep these tips in mind, for the future! I have never had a job interview before, just school admission interviews (which at a young age I didn't take very seriously). I think I'll be alright in keeping a professional aura, but not so sure about the talking part. I'm able to sometimes answer questions and speak what's on my mind, with a bit of stuttering in front of a group of intimidating individuals, yes, but there are times when I just completely blank out. That's what I'm worried about in future interviews  not being able to communicate as well as I know I'm capable of. But practice makes perfect and I'm sure I'll be able to practice well enough and prepare myself before such interviews! Have you ever had a memorable job interview before?
I hope you're having a nice week!",Mentee,Posts in Getting Hired

And I don't think I have any more questions about the resume part of the conversation. I'll try to read the next anchor text during my free time!
