Hi Mentee,
Is that... ✨ growth ✨ I hear? Isn't that incredible that just a year ago, you were planning what courses to take, running around and finding your buildings/classes, getting to know your friends and profs, and adjusting to a new city, and now, you can confidently say things like that? I probably sound like a broken record, but you make your mentor proud and you should be proud of your hard work too! 🥹
By 2nd year, I'd say I had found my bearings also. You spend your 1st year learning about yourself and adjusting, so that in the 2nd year, you can know what to expect and apply what you've learned as a student. You also build the skills to feel more confident in taking on additional responsibilities like part-time jobs and co-ops, without them interfering with your academic success. I think 3rd year is when I took things more seriously, because depending on the school you're interested in, they might take your upper-year grades into consideration for Masters (Graduate) programs. Dependent on the school and program, of course. 
I guess while I'm on that topic, is it too early to think about what Graduate program and school you were interested in getting into? Course-based, thesis-optional, thesis-required? There's so many options! I pulled this from UBC's Biochem & Molecular Bio Graduate Program admission requirements just as an example, but I'd recommend following a generic blueprint to be as eligible to as many of your goal programs as possible, keeping your options open across BC and Canada. I'd imagine you'd not only want to be in a program, but also in a lab, which according to this Grad program, 20-25 students get a lab placement out of 100 applications. If you were aiming for the researcher trajectory, it seems you're right on track!  
Masters Program
You should have advanced laboratory experience in a biochemistry research environment, e.g., summer student research project, co-op work experience, a directed studies laboratory research course, or employment as a laboratory technician in a research or relevant industrial environment.
At the minimum, you should hold or be in the process of completing a four year science BSc or BScH.
You should be knowledgeable in organic and physical chemistry beyond the introductory level.
You should have taken an introductory Biochemistry course, an introductory Biochemistry laboratory course, and at least two advanced Biochemistry courses.
Courses in genetics, physics, microbiology, or cell biology are strongly recommended.
North American degree holders must have obtained an overall transcript average of B+ or have a first class standing in 12 credits of combined 3rd and 4th year relevant coursework.
Non-North American degree holders must review the minimum academic entrance requirements as set by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. 
I was poking around UBC's other graduate programs and thought that Medical Genetics sounded very interesting and possibly aligned with your interests and degree. Give it a browse if you're curious! I could totally see a genetic counsellor Mentee, an epidemiologist Mentee, and let's not forget, researcher Mentee. 😎 
Congrats on your final grades! You worked hard for those and I hope you celebrated a bit before you hit the books again! And you're going to get a Summer position, I can already feel it. 2024 is going to be lucky for the both of us 💕 ! With that said, I wonder if it'd be worth while to also make a CV? I think resumes and CV's are different? To be honest, I've always used a resume when asked for a CV, but I do recall being specifically asked for a CV when I was applying as a lab volunteer back in undergrad. But it's been so long though, maybe I'm just getting old and forgetting haha 👵 !
Let's stay in this section for now, so you can refer to the resources as you apply to your Summer jobs. Let me know how it goes!
I've got to get back to studying too lol! 📚 Talk again soon!

Hello! Happy New Year!
I think the first floor of the library is our go-to study spot because we're able to talk but also get work done, and it's kinda central. I spent most of last year studying on the library's second floor, and I haven't studied there at all this year. 🤷‍♀️
My finals went well, and I'm happy with my class grades, which is good. The interesting thing I've found with the second year is that we're all just better at school. Classes are more difficult, but we know how to study, we're more relaxed for exams because we know how they work, and we better understand what we need to do to succeed. 
Okay, I feel the same way about if January 2023 me talked to December 2023, so much happened last year (most of it good) but ultimately it was a good year for personal growth!
How did the December (mid-year) performance review go? Did you get a raise?
MCAT studying sounds exciting and stressful! How's it going?
I appreciate that we're in the getting hired section because I'm about to start applying for a summer job! I'm going for the same approach as last year, getting a job in a lab at UBC. So I've updated my resume and getting my references in order. Wish me luck!
I've got to get back to studying 😅

Hi Mentee!
WELCOME BACK TO MENTORING TO THE BOTH OF US! Goodness, 2 months pass just like that and now look at all these upgrades ReMBC has for us... I'm not even sure what half of these buttons mean, so let's have fun trying them out as we get back into the swing of things. Like are those... Emojis?!  (I think we can stick with using our Apple ones for the variety though so shhh 🤐 ). My heart felt so warm reading all your life updates, because I always feel like we have this telepathic understanding that we can go off and do life and come back and update each other! So let's catch up, shall we?
Ooooooo Notion! As a student I used a coil-bound agenda and handwrote to keep track of things (still do), but now, being the corporate girlie I am (but am I really if I work in publicly-funded health care? LOL), I use OneNote. How are you finding it? And I was always amazed at how people used Excel as a means of tracking things... But maybe it's me? Hi? Were my ugly spreadsheets the problem? It's me? HAHA. It seems like your program arsenal is getting more stacked every year, look at you getting Premium Grammarly. Only the best for my mentee 😏 . 
You know what they say, a healthy body is a healthy mind. Especially now that it's getting darker and colder, it's good to hear you're sticking to a healthy routine that will take care of you now and later. And it's even opening up your social circle beyond classmates! There's this fun meme about your closest co-workers being nearly double your age with kids, and it's so true. It's like that in my workplace too, so I'm glad it's similar to you making friends with your grandma/grandpa gymrats! 
I think one of my first university tips to you was to find a favorite, reliable study spot and just like a full-circle, you've found one! And sounds like your friends have found yours too! What makes that place your go-to study spot? For me, my place was in the basement of the library (quiet floor), where the desks were large, used comfortable computer chairs, well lit, and each desk had a 2-4 socket outlet. Bonus points for being only 1 floor away from the coffee shop! 
So, I did end up going crabbing a few times! I imagine it'd be similar to fishing, where the appeal is being out in the sun and open waters, waiting for a catch. I ended up using the waiting time to read a book, but the interest dwindled down as the weather got colder. But you know who really took a liking to crabbing? MY DAD. Haha, I turned this man into a fisherman, and we even got traps of our own! And truthfully, I don't eat crab really. I just came so my dad could catch more (he's more of the crab fan) 🦀 .
- GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FINALS. You're prepared, you're confident, you've got this. The only mountain is you, and you've moved them last year and you'll move them again.
- Rock climbing seems so fun! I remember doing that waaay back in high school and a few times after that in college, but it's just another cool thing to mix your physical activity up a bit!
- I've never seen a moose in person but I've seen videos and they are actually massive. That is intense that you've seen them while going on your Twilight runs through the forest (I'm sorry I had to #TeamEdward LOL). Running, gymming, rock climbing, what will my mentee get up to next? Find out in our next mentor message!
- -6 °C to 0°C being warm is crazy sounding as an Islander. But you know? I'm still so proud of you. You moved out of your town, out of your comfort zone to be in a completely different city and environment and the weather is still the least of your challenges! Just like you've been along for the ride in my job hunt, I feel the same way in seeing your growth from high schooler to now university student. Cheers to seeing our self-growth, and double cheers to seeing more of it!
Updates from me to you!:
- I'm not sure if you've seen those memes floating around like ""If January 2023 me met December 2023 me, they'd be flabbergasted"", but I feel like that sums up my year. 😂  I went into 2023 with certain expectations, but am exiting the year with a changed perspective - Instead of expecting this is how things will go, I'm going to accept how things do go. Feels less stressful that way! Looking forward to what 2024 brings!
- Something you may come across in the future are performance reviews, which tie into pay adjustments (raises!). You work on goals you've set throughout the fiscal year, so it may look something like setting your goals at the beginning of the fiscal (April), having a mid-year check-in (December), and a final review the following year (March). I have my mid-year one tomorrow, so wish me luck! Manifesting that raise 💰 
- Making use of the benefits at work, just like you're taking advantage of what's available to you as a student! I've been getting massage therapy every month which sounds heavenly and is. I also joined my work's ethics journal club!
- Something that I'm working on and is quite significant has been starting my MCAT studying! I'm projecting to take my exam next Summer, but it's been admittedly more challenging having been out of the student mindset for a while. If you know any materials you think might help, let me know! I think the 'Chemistries' might be my achilles heel for this behemoth of an exam!
- And at last, being in the adult world... It's been a gratifying experience working steadily towards my goals and filling my life with meaningful experiences. Trying something new, making new friends, saying yes to more things, you feel like there's so many opportunities everyday, and there are, so long as you don't close your eyes and your mind. I hope you keep the stars in your eyes once you graduate, because I know there will be so many doors open for you!
Good luck on your exams, Merry early Christmas, and as always, I've got your back.

Hello!
Okay, so it's the end of November.... 
I'm back; sorry I was gone for 2 MONTHS. Time got away from me 😅
The school has been keeping me insanely busy.
My priMentor software for everyday school includes Grammarly (Premium now), Notion, and Microsoft programs. Excel is a game changer for keeping track of everything.
I have 8:30 am classes five days a week. However, I've been getting up at 5:30 am to go to the gym every day, so by the time 8:30 am rolls around, I've been awake for 3 hours already. Morning classes are still a drag, though. I'm just avoiding the 8:00 am lab times. 😬
I'm on campus studying in the same spot all the time. People know where to find me, and it's very random to have people walk up to me and say, ""I thought I'd find you here. Could you help me with this?"" I guess that's just small university stuff.
It's great to hear that work's going well. I feel like I've been a long for the ride regarding your job search and everything, so it's good that you're settled in now. 😊
Did you take up crabbing? Like fishing for crabs? That's so cool! Do you eat all the crab?
As far as my life updates: 
- I'm still an academic wepon. Finals start in two weeks, and I'm stressing but confident
- My roommate and I went rock climbing as a residence activity on Monday, and we had a lot of fun, so we're thinking of starting that as a hobby in the new year. The indoor rock climbing place in Prince George has a good student discount.
- I've seen so many moose this year. I've been running through the woods every weekend and seen them there and walking through campus. As I was walking to the gym on Wednesday, I passed by two. Let me say they're massive and scary. They will attack you if they feel like it.
- I'm friends with many elderly seniors at the gym now. The thing with going that early in the morning is that's when the old people go. So, I've become friends with them, which includes going to Thanksgiving dinner with one of their families.
- For the end of November, Prince George is warm with little snow. There was 3 to 4 feet this time last year, but it's basically melted today. The temperature hovers between -6 °C and 0°C, which is warm for this time of year.'
Things have been very academically focused this semester, which is good, but my social life has also grown, which is nice.
How have the past couple of months been for you?

Hi Mentee,
$15 for a software you can apply to not just all your classes, but resume building, scholarship essay writing, etc! That is so neat and kind! It's those little things like punctuation that can make your work look that much cleaner and put together. 😄 I'd also like to think people can review your work more comprehensively VS getting distracted by the typos and run-ons. While we didn't get Grammarly as our handout, we did get other software a bit more specific to our program like Tableau! On the topic of software, aside from Tableau, more program-specific software we frequented (not free and on school computers lol) was Microsoft Office/Project, SAS, OpenEpi/Epi Info, and the likes. What softwares have you been finding you've been using more or are new to you? A thought would be to brush up on them from time to time, as you never know when they may be applicable for future research positions, co-op's/job placements, and more! Spoiler: Know Excel. Lol. Excel is everywhere.
Now that you're in uni, how are you finding those 8:30am classes?! Are you choosing those intentionally?! 😂  I thought a strong appeal of being in post-secondary was being able to pick out your schedule... But to be honest, I was on campus by 8am everyday too lol. Even if I didn't have classes until later, I'd use those mornings to get some readings/reviews/homework in. Super quiet in the library especially, which is where I'd be 99% of the time. Are you just staying on campus until 3:30/5:30, or what do you do to kill the time in between? 
Updates updates! Let's see... So I'm back to work! Project work has been ramping up which has its impacts, like say... You want to build something and you're assigned a builder who will help you. But that builder is also assigned to other projects at the same time, so you can only do so much as reesourcing is limited. Wanted to mention that as we often think resources to be things like time, money, materials, but people are resources too! Something also coming up for me in the next few months is goal planning and vacation planning. There are personal goals, but there are also performance goals in the workplace. These are what they sound like, being what you plan to accomplish in the next year. I think one of my goals I'll be aiming for is to create some new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documentation for the team as I enjoy doing that! Vacation wise, I've got to think of my plans for 2024. I know what you might be thinking - Already? How would you know what you need off this early? Lol. I kinda don't. But in the healthcare space, planning vacations a year in advance makes sense, doesn't it? But don't worry, these are just to plop some time off and secure them (especially for in-demand times like Summer and Christmas). We can always move them around as, naturally, we don't know what tomorrow brings, let alone what may happen a year in advance. Just some possible things you might experience in your future workspace! Life-wise, I had to make the tough call and skip ballet this year. Crabbing took its spot as a hobby while the weather is still nice 🦀 ! There's always next year though, so I'm looking forward to putting 🩰 on my 2024 vision board and all those fun things I wanna manifest. Any updates you'd like to share? School, life, whatever floats our boat! 🛥️ Hope you're doing well, my mentee! Your mentor's got your back. :)

Hello, 
Welcome back!
I'm back at university, and things are going well so far. My classes seem more reasonable this semester compared to last semester. My school got us a Grammarly premium for $15 for the year. It's great my punctuation is much better! 😁 Other than all that, I'm just waiting for stuff to pick up so I'll have something to do between classes (I have an 8:30am-9:20 am class and no other class until 3:30 pm Monday and Wednesday or 5:30 pm on Friday)
Anyway, update me on what you've been up to!

Hi Mentee,
I'm back! ... Albeit a week later than I said I'd be. LOL. 
My apologies for underestimating how bad I'd be hit with jetlag; it's been... 7(?) years since I've travelled across the ocean and significantly different timezones? I think I'm just getting over it now, but that first week back had me d e l u l u from adjusting to my whack sleep pattern lol. But yes! I've returned from my family vacation 🥹🗾🚄🍵🍱🍣🍜!
I'd be happy to share some story times or tips, but firstly, I'd love to hear how you've been! Congrats on the honey by the way LOL, local, fresh honey is the best! Have you tried just eating it straight from the honeycomb? It's soooo sweet but soooo good! 🐝🍯

With the sayonara and the emojis including sushi, I'm guessing you've gone to Japan?
Also, just a random bonus of working in a lab where half the people study bees: Honey! I got a big jar of honey for free, which tastes so good.

Hi Mentee,
I wanted to stop by here before I get swept up in all my vacation planning, panicking, and packing on top of work this week, but... GUESS WHO'S FINALLY GOING ON VACAY (and literally leaving this Friday lol)?! I wanted to share the story of how I'm going to _____, and how everything happens in its own way. That sounds a bit spiritual, doesn't it? Divine timing, manifestations, and the like. I'm not sure if you believe in those? No judgment either or - While I think it's important to acknowledge outcomes, I've been leaning towards stoic practices in the past year. Fortify yourself in what is in your control, so you can be resilient across what isn't! Anyway, I digress. Story time! ✨
Back when I started university (I only graduated 2 years ago but why does it feel so long?!), I told myself and everyone around me that I'd be going to this country once I graduated. Love the food, interested in the history, fascinated by the culture, and I've been told it offers something different every visit. Fast forward through the semesters and even while convocating as a ""pandemic graduate"", I still told everyone that I'd be going to _____ with my mask on. Well, COVID had different plans for me, and as borders weren't opening up in the foreseeable future, I decided to start my future early by applying for jobs. Now in my career where vacation days (and vacation pay!) are a thing, I unknowingly booked time off at the same time my brother and sister-in-law were planning to go travelling. They've been waiting 2 years to go, and throughout those 2 years have been asking me if I'd meet them there. I'm not sure if I'd shared this yet, but initially, I had planned to go to Chicago this year - Attend a music festival, see the museums, eat their pizza, so I said not this time. But life brought all of us together in the form of a wedding (not mine ofc lol)! So sayonara to Chicago and hello to... Have you guessed where I'm going yet?🎋🌸🍜🍣🍱🍡🍵🥢🚄⛩️
I guess where I'm getting at is: Your life starts everyday. Although you can plan and prepare as best you can, there is only so much in your hands and the rest is out of them. Maybe something doesn't go exactly as expected, but maybe it will work out for the best, we really don't know. It's all about perspective and strengthening your mind, body, heart, and soul!
I don't mean to pressure you by calling you my Nobel Prize winner; As cheesy as it sounds, you'll always be a winner in my books. I just know you're going to do your best, and that's already the best thing you can do for the world. :) I refrained from opening another conversation because I thought I might be lost when I come back lol. Let's start a new one together when I return? 
Fri., 21-Jul-2023 until Mon., 14-Aug-2023 - Mentor's vacay!

Hi Mentee,
I'm so happy to hear everything about the lab is going well, especially the immaculate ✨vibes✨. It must be exciting learning hands-on and just getting the feel for what wet labs are all about - What a fun and productive way to spend your Summer! Keep those ideas tucked in the back of your mind for next year (or maybe even this upcoming Fall semester), when we look into possibly applying them for student research grants and proposing them to PIs. An added benefit to your research experience is now having built connections with those in your lab, as your colleagues could very well be your future co-workers (happened to me, my friend and I are on the same team at work lol)! ... It's the fact I YouTubed ""bee dissection"" for me... 🐝⚔️
Honestly, you're going to feel imposter syndrome anywhere, everywhere. As a student, as a researcher, in your career, maybe even as a person (hello existential crisis lol). I wish I had some sure fire advice to give you, but to this day, I combat those feelings of, ""Why am I here?"" ""Why was I hired?"" ""I'm not good enough for how long I've been here"". But like you said, you just have to trust the judgment of those who placed you there. They believed in you, so try to find that part of you that believes in yourself. I have gratitude for the day, even the hard ones - Because I know it's all a part of life's story, and you learn from everything and grow through everything. Look at you go! Mentee about to enter her dry lab era 🔬💻. But just like how those grad students are finding a bright undergrad to learn from, you never know where or who or how you'll learn about something that will apply to your studies and life! Stay curious!
That's my future Nobel Prize winner right here, folks! For real, can't wait to see where you go in research, because I know it's not a matter of if, but when you'll make a breakthrough. No matter how big or small, I'm sure it'll be meaningful to humankind. 🏅I'm gonna be that Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme like, ""HEY, I MENTORED HER."" LOL.

As you can tell by the timestamp I'm writing this, this is me doing my usual drop-in before work LOL. I'll get back to you as soon as I can (but I skimmed your reply and saw dissecting a BEE? So I can't wait to read what that's all about!). I'll fill you in with adulting just like you've been filling me in with studenting 😄.
Quick question for you in the meantime: How do you build your study habits/routines around life, or do you build life around your routines? I haven't been consistent with my studying, especially when life gets busy, and just want to get something going. 1 page a day is better than 0 pages a day, as they say! I want to reach my goals ideally next year, but whenever I'm ready too 😅 Maybe I need to start off with an end date like a SMART goal. What do you think, my mentee?
See you super soon!

Hello,
The summer position is excellent. The vibes in the lab are perfect and I'm enjoying the research. I'm learning a lot which is great. I've been introduced to many new ideas, research techniques, and scientific concepts which is amazing! I've been taking care of two cell lines and then infecting them with viruses or doing knockdowns. I can't think of any funny stories but there have been some moments where I'm just surprised something is even happening since it seems so out of place. Such as the lab paying for us to go to a bird sanctuary, but nobody is doing anything to do with birds. 
I watched someone dissect a bee. ONE OF THE WEIRDEST THINGS! They pull out the stinger and the guts come with it and it just keeps coming. It's like one of those clown magic tricks where they pull a hanky out of a pocket and it just keeps coming. 
I've learned a lot about working in academia and myself in that field. I went in with the experience you get in labs at school which is basically nothing and I respect those who are more advanced in their education who believe in me and are willing to teach me even if it takes time away from their projects. I was talking to another undergrad working in the lab and she said, ""the imposter syndrome is real"" I just said ""same"" because I've really been feeling like I don't have enough background knowledge to be in the position I am in. When I feel that way I just remind myself that these are smart people I'm working with and who hired me, if they didn't think I was capable I wouldn't have been offered the job. I still panicked when I was asked to present something at a lab meeting but I did it and it went well. I've also been asked to look into a course that teaches you how to analyze mass spectrometry data using Python. Which I was game to do because I enjoy coding and I know a little Python. But then a couple of the grad students were like ""hey if you figure out how to analyse data with Python instead of R could you teach us?"" and I was like ""...sure?..."" But I'll give it a shot and needing to teach someone is motivation for me to learn it better myself. 
What drives me? good question. Science is always something I've wanted to pursue and it's because I like the feeling. There's this moment when things just click, kinda like a runner's high but nerdy. 😁 I like the search to know more. My brain gets very excited when I learn something and let's be honest science is important. The world needs people researching everyone so we can be healthier, more environmentally intelligent, and better people. 
Should we move on to another topic?

Andddd we're back to regular programing with me, your host, Mentor! 🥳
First off, oh my goodness, please don't feel bad for keeping busy! It's funny, because I also had this kind of ""That's So Raven"" pause last week and thought, ""Oh my gosh, mentoring. R a c h e l. M e. We both just fell off the planet."" LOL. But I think we also have this back-of-the-mind, mutual understanding that we're both working through life (literally and figuratively) and will eventually come back to each other! (That commute really do be a synonym for brutal tho... 4-5 hours of commuting a day. #Commited🫠😭)
You had mentioned that you'd gotten a Summer position with a UBC graduate student, so how has that been? What have you learned so far? Any funny stories to tell? While you'll naturally learn skills in new environments, being able to make connections, nurture your interests and fuel your passion will take you even further. My dentist often tells me, ""If I did dentistry for the money, I would've quit a long time ago!"" What drives you to want to do what you do, pursue post-graduate education, and achieve your dreams? Keep those in mind as you continue to grow into the student, professional, and person you want to be! Interesting enough, I'm going to be talking to my mentor today about how to explore ones interests and sustain consistency, so if there are some valuable, applicable tidbits I can share with you, I'll for sure let you know! Edit post-meeting: He said finding your passions early on is advantageous, as when you begin to build commitments to things (e.g. family, income, mortgage), it's difficult to take risks for your passions. 
OKAY, GO OFF MS. MASS SPECTROMETRY! 🙌 Add that to the list! And who knows? Maybe the next lab job that's hiring or your next research project may require these skills and you've already got the experience! Always keep your mind open to what you'll learn and how applicable it can be to other positions. You'd be surprised at how much overlap there is, and how transferrable everything is. Can't wait to see what doors this position opens for you, but by this time next year, I think we'll be gunning for you to start your own research project 😉.
Anchor text question time!
If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better?
It's hard to say if I've had a lot compared to the average person, but I do believe I've had plenty of job interviews. My uni program actually had mock interview clinics, where we would be interviewed by real professionals in the industry and get their feedback. Looking back, that was an incredible resource - We all treated it like it was the real deal (both sides dressed up, gave resumes, had interview papers), and it was a very real opportunity to meet some people who could be our future hiring managers. If your university has something like this, I highly encourage you to do it! Like mock-MMI clinics or something!
What I do well in interviews is maintain eye contact, speak clearly, and be able to relate the questions to a skill / story on what was included in the job posting. These are standard. But I've also mentioned before that personality has often been a factor in interviews - Have you heard the recent saying that during an interview, it's 50/50? They're interviewing if you'd be a good fit, and you're interviewing them if you want to fit. Just as much as you can offer your skills, you're in the position to see if this is where you see yourself working, and more importantly, growing. So I really encourage being yourself during interviews (while of course, maintaining professionalism! 🤪)
If you have never had a job interview before, what are some things you’re nervous about, and what are you comfortable with?
Oh, you know what? I've definitely been asked what my greatest strength and weakness are during an interview. The trick is to answer honestly, but leverage your strength to improve that weakness. Why be honest, you ask? Personally, integrity is my core value. I want to be true to myself. Professionally, I think they'll eventually find out if I embellished the truth, if not through my references, they'll see it once I've started working lol. For an example, I've said that my weakness was being shy and reserved, never speaking up unless spoken to. But my strength is being friendly and hardworking. I acknowledge that I'm shy, but with my bubbly persona, this shyness eventually goes away. I work hard to build rapport with my colleagues, and in turn, that reduces my shyness and builds connection = Leveraging my strengths to strengthen my weaknesses. (And yup, I got the job with this one!)
ASK your mentor to tell you a story of a memorable job interview. It might be the story of a successful interview – or it might be the story of the worst interview they ever had.
How fun! I think it's important to see the good, the bad, and the funny side of job hunting, so enjoy! Spoiler alert: I'm employed! LOL!
Best interview: I applied to be a research assistant with 0% research experience, 100% research interest, and ""got the job"". How? Again, never underestimate the combination of honesty, personality, and being able to reflect experiences to meet what they're looking for on paper! I was very up-front that I had no research experience - COVID unfortunately happened during the time I was trying to get research together, and it made it hard to continue (honesty). However, despite this, I had still tried to apply for volunteer research opportunities, which showed that I was determined to get experience in the field (personality). I had experience with computer programs and was already working within a Health Authority under my belt (what they're looking for). I'm sure there were applicants with actual research experience, but I want to believe they saw my spirit haha! After everything, I did reach out to the program manager, to which she commended my grit to do so. The reason I put it ""got the job"" in quotes was because while I did get the offer, I didn't end up accepting it, because...
Worst interview: Not to say the interview itself was bad, but the circumstances before and after it were less than ideal! So this job had 3 parts: After applying with your cover letter and resume and waiting weeks for the job posting to close (1), you participate in a screening call and wait a few more weeks to see if you make it to the next stage (2), and then were given an assignment to present during the final portion in an interview with the program director (3) and then wait some more. After passing the screening, I put a lot of effort into the interview assignment I was given, which was creating a powerpoint on how I could fix a sample problem (yes, an interview assignment, but I'm thinking they used that to screen out serious candidates). I was maybe 2 days out until my interview and I did it. I dropped my laptop. I dropped my laptop with my presentation, my notes, and it was what I had been practicing on. It literally died that day and possibly part of me died with it lol. See WHY I stress the importance of autosaving places like Google drive / Onenote?! Luckily, I had been making my powerpoint on Google slides, so all hope was not lost, but it was definitely a scramble to rehearse it using a tablet, seeing if the tablet would launch your slides AND hold the interview call, all within 2 days. Honesty, hardwork, and hustle... ""Got the job""! Uh oh, that's in quotes... So you know what that means...
Shortest interview: Like you, I basically met my supervisor and manager in what was like a coffee break chat. But funny thing is, I had no idea it was an interview - I literally thought I was just introducing myself and networking. Imagine my surprise to get a call from HR, saying I got the job? LOL. Not in quotes, because I accepted the offer!
Funniest interview: Basically at the start of the pandemic, so everyone is still transitioning from in-person to virtual everything, including my co-op interview. My dad went into the kitchen (which is by the table I was interviewing at)... And whispered, offering if I wanted some soup after my interview. I can't stop grinning remembering. ""Mentor... Do you want some soup? I'm going to cook some soup..."" Me whispering back: 😃 ""Not right now..."". My interviewers laughed about it and it opened up a conversation on how we're all adjusting to the pandemic, how many of us were wearing pajama pants on the bottom but business wear on top, etc. It was so funny! And yes, I got the job. When I asked for feedback on why I was chosen, the manager told me that while I may not have been the strongest technical candidate, she appreciated my personality, and that was what she was hiring for her team. She said that while you can train people up to fit your team skill-wise, you can't train people to fit your team team-wise!
I don't repeat the things I tell you just because they're important, but because I've experienced them myself! So I hope you were able to see something from these rollercoaster rides of interview stories! But don't let this handful of successful interviews fool you, I've definitely not gotten the job after the interview, and even more so, not even been able to land the interview. But throughout it all, I stuck to my 3: Honesty, personality, and performance! You'll have your own interviews to share with me one day, and I can't wait to read them with you! Cheers!

Ahhhh hello!
 
I feel so bad for not sending anything for OVER A MONTH!? but I was dealing with moving back home from university and starting work and my days are very long (8hs at work with 2-2.5hs commuting each way)  so, I basically get home, eat dinner, shower, and go to bed. 
I've really been enjoying working in the lab at UBC and I have some downtime today so I thought I'd reply to your message... from April.
I appreciate the resume tips and I will remember to add them when I'm adding this summer's experience to my resume. I've been keeping a list of everything I'm doing and learning because if someone asks me, I will forget. 
On the topic of technology, I've got to say my Microsoft Excel skills are improving via this job. I've done a bit of Mass Spectrometry data analysis and learned some basic, but helpful Excel hacks.
Onto the second anchor text question:
If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better? 
I don't think I've had a legitimate job interview yet. For the job at the grocery store (my first job) they basically were like ""are you okay working somewhere that's cold? how are you with lifting heavy stuff?"" and then they asked me if I could memorize the produce codes (which I never did), and what my availability was. 
For this job, I basically had the job by the interview, and it was just a chance to meet the person I'm now working with. 
Nobody's asked me what my greatest weakness is, to describe myself, or any of the other basic interview questions.
I know I'm told to ask this question but I feel like it could be interesting, do you have a memorable interview story? I feel like a lot can happen in an interview, especially those group interviews.
Anyways, how's life going? It's been a while!

Hi Mentee,
You mean to say... You actually learned skills applicable in real life aside from the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell????? But it's the ""personal info they said to remove"" on your resume for me 😂. Thank you for keeping us safe in the ReMBC space! But HOLY ACHIEVEMENTS, BATMAN. That's my mentee right there 🥹! If I could suggest improvements to your very aesthetic resume:
Just a minor tweak in adding periods to your UNBC extra curriculars, just for consistency across all your sections. 
You can just say ""Collaborates"" rather than ""Can collaborate"" under Team Play(er?)
My co-op advisors taught us to use past tense for jobs you've done in the past and present tense for those you're currently doing, so I'm looking at your Girl Guides and customer service parts.
It might be just the way the link converted your resume, but some of the -'s at the end where your achievements are listed had some -'s looking longer than the other (e.g. October 2022 vs June 2021)!
What's the difference between using | vs - in your achievements section (i.e. April 2022)?
And honestly, good for you! You don't need brand name gym clothes to get the same pump in. 💪 Literally wore my ""free t-shirt when you sign up for a gym membership"" when I went yesterday 😆. Also started journalling recently, so we in that mental and physical self-care era 💖.
Alright, let's talk the first page of our Discussion Questions for this week's message!
Communication
Being bilingual is so cool (speaking as a bilingual baddie myself LOL), but also very useful. With your French immersion, besides being able to apply for jobs that require French fluency (e.g. government jobs), did you know there are also schools/programs that have French specific streams? For example, the University of Ottawa has both an English and French stream for their medical school. Although I'm not certain if their requirements are different between languages, I would imagine less applicants due to teaching in a fully French curriculum.
Additionally, your time in Girl Guides means you're experienced with speaking in groups, specifically youth (""engaging younger Guiding Members"") and public speaking (bronze award at the Science Fair / debates in model UN club ).
Responsibility or Dependability
As you've been a senior Girl Guide, you've been responsible in helping guide your more novice members. I'm sure you could also speak to your dependability being in your clubs, whether it be planning and succeeding in your fundraisers, how you progress and meet project deliverables, and of course, being timely like you said!
Quick Learner
This one is a bit harder to describe on a resume, more so they'll have to see it in action! But something that came to mind as I thought more on it... I've been told I'm a quick learner as well, but what's impressed my managers up to now was my habit of creating How-To like documents that enable others to learn quicker as well. Which is a great lead up to...
Team Work
24 HOUR HAND IN? The way some people would highkey fail if that was standard across all classes 🥲. But YOU'RE ONE OF THE SAVIOURS WHO START GROUP CHATS🙌! BLESS YOU LOL! I owe my 4th year sanity to whoever started my cohort's discord channel where we could just talk and help each other during the height of the pandemic. But that is a great example to speak to if team work is brought up! You're able to take lead in a group in-person and remotely, encouraging engagement among your peers.
Technology
Oh man, Mentee. Believe me when I say that older generations will find your skills cool! Even for me, I'll find myself pointing out some Office shortcuts you would just do automatically, but there's a lot of appreciation for even those little things! And of course, it's not just that awesome feeling of helping someone, but also being able to learn from each other. Something I keep in mind is to keep an open mind - What can you teach someone and what can you learn from them? And overall, if you're bettering yourself, that has a compounding effect in bettering the world, and bettering humanity. :)
Let's talk about the 2nd anchor text when we're ready! I hope your exam went well!!!

I'M ALIVE
this semester is trying to kill me but I'm surviving, I have one final left on Monday and then we're good! This is going to be a quick reply.
I didn't catch Alphalete's birthday sale, I'll be honest I had to google the company. My gym clothes are just random pieces I've picked up on sale from a variety of places. 
I emailed the people at UBC to see if there's anything I need to know ahead of time and though I do have a bit of googling to do it sounds really interesting and I'm looking forward to it!
I feel like writing resumes was the one actual life thing they taught us in high school. So they've been making us write them since like 7th grade. Therefore, nothing in the article was new information to me. 
Ok here are some of my amazing skills
• Communication
I can communicate in more than one language which is an asset. 
• Responsibility or Dependability
I am rarely ever late, on time is late for me and if I am running late for some reason I'll send a text or something. Also, as written in my resume under ""responsible"" I excel at managing myself and others.
• Quick Learner
University. Also, at my last job in the grocery store, they would tell you something once and you were expected to just understand and do it perfectly (unreasonable? yes). I got pretty good at expecting what was expected of me and it got me on my manager's good side real quick once I learned to predict how she would want things and to in general just learn stuff quickly.
• Team Work
Again from my resume, I can collaborate well with others and works well individually when needed. A real-life example is labs. My bio lab this semester was brutal (did I mention the 24-hour hand-in period for lab reports, well 21 because you lost 3 hours being in the lab) but our class had a group chat where people would help each other and even in class we would all help each other out with concepts we understood well. (I was the one who started the group chat and let's just say it saved grades). In general, I've gotten good at trying to include people in stuff and seeing people as teammates and not as competition.
• Technology
I can code which is cool, I'm good with other programs like Office and Canva and all that which to me doesn't seem cool but I guess for adults who haven't grown up with the stuff it's a real skill. I am good with Excel too, I put all my assignments and exams into one colour-coded document organized by the due date. It scares people to see that we have/had over 130 things due over 12 weeks but it helps me stay organized. 
 
I'm not about to find a job I can apply for but I'll send the resume I sent for the UBC gig. https://gounbc-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/smid_unbc_ca/EdE4mt1FDMNDiAxl3KsJoewBbQxp8u2nnTxcH4w8_fjg_w?e=0yteoW 
let me know if the link works or not.

Hi Mentee,
I chose to open this conversation as you'll be interning this Summer for a Masters student at UBC. While you get that experience, exposure, and learn from this opportunity, it's always important to keep your resume up-to-date with the skills you're acquiring! I know this is much ahead of its time, but as you build your skills, building your network is also just as valuable. A prime example was how you networked with the UBC professor from your Science Fair (award winning!) presentation, which helped open these doors. I like to believe it was meant for you, but you still worked very hard for this! Anyways, before I go on my usual tangent of how proud of a mentor I am for you... LOL. 😂  Perhaps you'll find someone who can be comfortable speaking as your reference, especially as you consider future Summers where you may very well lead your own research project! Perhaps you'll find your future PI/supervisor, maybe you'll get inspired for your future! Some of my best references (and some I still use to this day!) have come from my co-op supervisors. Co-ops, being paid work-studies for about 2-6 months are basically internships - The same amount of time you'll likely be working for the Summer, you may foster some very strong, meaningful connections! Keep them close, and value them accordingly. :)

Hi Mentee,
OMG, that shouldn't even count as a Reading Week!! Girl needs a do-over LOL. You know what I don't miss? When professors would either assign something right after reading break or the absolute carnage that was the lead up to reading break where it was just exams on projects on presentations on due labs. As crazy as it sounds, I actually preferred the latter so I didn't have the anxiety that something was about to smack me in the grades when I came back lol. IT SNOWED HERE TOO! Like... 🛑 stop it, go back into the clouds or something 😭. It made the ground so icy, I was waddling to and from my car 🐧. A quick Google search says that:
Spring 2023 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on
Monday, March 20 2023
Will that actually happen? We'll have this chat to look back on to see if Google was right. 
I'm not a gym rat by any means LOL, but did you catch Alphalete's birthday sale a few weeks ago? I'm definitely a believer in that you don't need name brand items to execute the same thing, but hey, I was ordering joggers for my friend anyway and thought to pick a few things out for myself. Hopefully they arrive soon so I can give us a cheeky review like a YouTuber HAHA.
I'm going to go ahead and close this conversation and pick our next one. :) I do have to say though, your answers to these were just mindblowing. I know you're mature for your age, but you speak with such clarity and maturity! Just beyond your years! Makes me excited for when you'll write your first research publication, because I know it's going to be written with honesty, passion, and super smartly of course! 🤓

Hello,
ugh, reading break is almost over and I need another week off! It's been between -20°C and -30°C here this week, with lots of snow and lots of wint. Walking back to my dorm after the gym this morning was more challenging than my 1.5 hours of workout. And my plan to catch up on sleep was interrupted many nights in a row by the people downstairs partying (I called the RA on them at 1:30 am) and the fire alarms going off at 12:00 am the following night (walking outside in -30°C weather after just getting out of bed is not fun).
Sorry to hear that you're sick and happy belated family day to you!
I liked your responses to the questions. It's good that fencing is turning out so well and as someone who goes to the gym 5-6 days a week for 1.5-2 hours at a time, I'm happy to hear you're doing that too!
What should we move on to next?

Hi Mentee,
The last few weeks on my side of the province have been absolutely bonkers as well, so I'm sorry for the delay too (but we've been  together for so long that I feel like we just know that when the other goes MIA, it's never intentional! 🥺) I'm actually typing this from bed because I got sick as the 🍒 on top of it all, but I thought... Oh my gosh? I'm actually in one spot long enough that I can do my mentorship? I'll take it! LOL. And since it's family day, I'd like to wish you and yours a Happy Family Day and superb long weekend! ☀️ 
Mentee!!! That internship is amazing news, I'm so happy it worked out for you! Sure the commute isn't pretty, but what an incredible opportunity to get firsthand experience! You get to have a behind the scenes look as to what being a STEM grad student entails, what it involves to write a thesis, finding and working with a professor/PI, etc. And yes, a great chance for you to catch up on some reading. :) I've been going to the gym more frequently and use my cardio time as an opportunity to listen to philosophy videos (currently into Stoicism right now!). While you can use that time to study for sure, I think squeezing in some time to study your interests will help with that balance of not having to constantly be on 100% of the time.
Thank you for that tidbit on left-handedness! There aren't any lessons tonight because of the holiday, but I will say that there is a left-handed fencer in my session who uses a left specific foil (blade). Since our last message, we've gone all the way up to being on the piste. So that means we're now connected to the scoring machine via retracting cables, wearing electrified lames that trigger the scoring when poked by the foil, and fencing against each other. I'm sure you've heard of the term, ""En garde""? Yup. En garde, pret?, allez! is how we start our matches (I'm too lazy to find the accents on my keyboard right now forgive me LOL)! It's definitely a workout, and with such a welcoming community, I'd encourage you to give it a try if you get the opportunity! Or as the weather gets better, maybe there's an outdoor sport that you're interested in giving a try? I'm lowkey eyeing tennis, volleyball, or a martial art after this... 🤺🎾🏐🥋.
 Let's try the Self Care Action Plan together!
Self-Care Action: Go to sleep at a more consistent time 
How I will make it a part of my life: I've been telling myself to get to the gym earlier, so I can come home earlier, thus sleep earlier. However, if I get to the gym later, I compensate by staying later, since I want to get my workout fully in. I will try sticking to a certain arrival/leave time this week, so that my weekend mornings aren't just me catching up on zzz's that I lost.
Self-Care Action: Balancing hobby time 
How I will make it a part of my life: I've been baking a lot recently, which although I enjoy, I go to bed realizing I didn't get to pick up where I left off in my book again or that I wish I saved time for this or that. This leaves conflicting emotions that I'm ""procrastinating"" or having to pick and choose between two hobbies that make me happy, which ultimately takes away from the joy of the hobby. Thus, I think I can slow down with baking every evening, or start reading as my goodies bake in the oven? :) 
Self-Care Action: Organizing/Cleaning my room 
How I will make it a part of my life: Likewise with you, I would generally classify myself as organized, but maybe it doesn't look like that all that time LOL. I want to find the time to regularly clean my room so that it brings peace/is a space for relaxation instead of looking like chaos. 😅 My plan for now is to stick with a schedule that helps keep things controlled, so laundry regularly so it doesn't pile up, putting things away once done with them, etc. Hope to get a better system in place soon too. :)) 
Mentor Q's:
How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have?
I think everyone learns about self-care in their own way, as you mentioned, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. How I prioritize self-care is by understanding what works for me to help me feel good, not for the sake of outwardly looking good, but also internally feeling good. For example, skin care. While I don't have a 7-step skin routine, I'm comfortable with the time and effort it takes to do what skin care I do use, and the results? Outwardly, yes, it's nice to maintain one's complexion. But internally, it's even better knowing that I can take care of myself and I can see the differences. Tips I would give would be to try and find what works best for you, your schedule, your circumstance, etc. Not everyone can spare 30 minutes in the morning to journal, but if you find it helps, how about 5 lines of a journal prompt? Or if you want to get into fitness but it's too physically demanding, how about a low-impact exercise routine? And what works for your self-care routine now may not necessarily be applicable in the future, and that's okay. It can be easy to fall into the hole of depriving yourself from self-care, but starting small and building the habits up so they aren't ""treats"" but actual practices is important for living well. 
Can they share any time management tips?
If possible, ""eat the frog"" aka get the hardest thing done out of the way. But I find starting with a routine with room for flexibility can help. Say you plan to get XYZ done within 2 hours, but then you find Z is taking you much longer than expected. There's no need to stress if your schedule can be flexible and accommodate for that. What will be important is prioritizing what does need to be done today, tomorrow, some day (kind of like the Moscow method). 
How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult?
""Survive and then thrive"". Brilliantly put. Being out of school and now working, I would say my stress was just shifted into a different direction in my life. How self-care plays a part in this is through mindfulness. Self-care would be taking a nap after studying for hours straight. Now, it's valuing work-life balance and seeing the sun/breathing fresh air during lunch breaks. It's not always as elaborate as getting a massage, treating yourself to something nice, booking a vacation. Yes, self-care does encompass these things, but the simple things can be just as healing.
What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and post- secondary student?
It's important to find an employer who values you and work-life balance as much as, if not more than you, when you enter adulthood. My team mates will ping me on Microsoft Teams or email me, reminding me that there's always tomorrow to get things done and to log off. We are also encouraged to take our vacation days to rest and prevent burn out. It's funny, but also a kind gesture. However, at the end of the day, we have to be responsible for ourselves and know when to just put things down and come back at it tomorrow with a fresh mind and pair of eyes. And when things are getting tough, knowing when to book those days off for yourself. I find self-care can be more regular as an adult, as your work schedule can be stable/expected (job dependent). So you know when the best time to schedule a massage, or go for brunch with your friends, or go to the gym is. 
Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.)
I had to laugh out loud at your answer because last month, I literally shocked my body into going to the gym 1-1.5hrs everyday. Would I recommend it? Probably not. But did it work for me? Very much so. LOL. But again, it's all about what works for you and routines work for me! 😆 There's a quote: ""The best time to start something was yesterday, the next best time is now."" Hitting rock bottom and having to face yourself with ""I don't want to live like this anymore"" is difficult, so forming good habits to counter the bad ones will help to prevent spiraling to that point. I love your analogy about jumping over a bar without practice, because that's exactly it! We don't have to start big, we can start with what we can, and building this to regularity and consistency until it fits what we need it to in our lives. We should also practice forgiveness and extend this to ourselves like we do to others. We shouldn't condemn ourselves and backtrack on our progress. We now know better, so we can do better. What's important is our courage to keep going.
Wishing you great health and let's blossom like the flowers in March!

Hello,
These past couple of weeks have been super hectic (hence the delayed reply).
First, the joke with the flowers was so funny, I showed it to my roommates the moment I read it and they enjoyed it too.
About the UBC thing, looks like I'm going to be interning at UBC this summer! The person I knew put me in contact with a graduate student working on finishing her thesis so I'll be helping her with some of the daily tasks. Am I looking forwards to the two-hour transit commute every day? not really but it will be a good time to catch up on reading I guess?
Fencing has always seemed so cool to me, my school has a fencing club that I understand to be quite popular. Have you had any more lessons? I'm left-handed and I've heard I have an advantage in most combative sports because people will typically train against right-handed people and won't expect hits from left hands to be as strong. I read once that the fact that most of our population has been right-handed for an extended period without fluctuations in left and right dominance could be an example of how humans can survive without hand-to-hand combat. Because left-handed people have the advantage of surprise so they would beat all the right-handed people, and the population would become predominantly right-handed and keep flowing between the two sides. This theory is of course dependent on genetics being the main way handedness is determined. They do say that left-handed people are more likely to die earlier and get injured in more accidents. This is a valid point because it is definitely a right-handed world out there. Let's just say whoever created left-handed scissors deserves an award.
I don't think we've done the self-care action plan so we can move on that. This is something I've been somewhat working on in counselling because I'm not really one to relax. She told me today that at younger ages we're not really designed to be able to sit and relax for long periods and trying to get yourself to sit still and be calm can be like trying to get a puppy to calmly lay next you. Once our metabolism starts to slow down (typically later in life) it becomes easier to be calm and relaxed. 
Self-care action: taking time to unwind before bed 
How will I make it part of my life: I've been trying to get better at relaxing and unwinding for a while. My counsellor suggested I try using other parts of my brain that aren't focused on logic and processing information, she suggested I listen to more instrumental music while doing something mindless with little-to-no structure. 
Self-care action: Keep my room more organized 
How will I make it part of my life: Idk because I'm an organized person but when I get supper busy it's easy for things to pile up. But it doesn't make me happy to have my binders spread out all over my desk so I need to think of a new system.
Self-care action: moving in gentler ways. 
How will I make it part of my life: I spend a lot of time at the gym lifting weights, running, and biking. All that stuff is great but it can be demanding physically to constantly be putting myself through that physical stress. Therefore, I want to incorporate more gentle movements such as yoga and stretching into my routine to help myself recover. 
I'm going to answer the mentor questions too because why not?
How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have? 
You need to work on understanding yourself, your routine, and your habits before you can go and change them. Working to understand what makes you feel good and what doesn't can help determine where you need to make changes. Nothing is one size fits all and though stuff like going to the gym, reading, meditating, and journalling has been helpful that may not be the case for everyone. I am a firm believer that self-care encompasses more than the mainstream idea of self-care (bubble baths, candles, face masks), though those are great they don't fulfill your baseline needs. Making sure you're eating nutritious food that also makes you feel good is self-care, moving your body is self-care, allowing yourself to feel things (this is where I slip up) is self-care, and being able to remove yourself from bad situations is self-care.
Can they share any time management tips? 
The concept of a mandatory minimum (Knowing what's the minimum amount of time you need to do a task and making sure you designate that time to it.) This can include tasks like doing laundry, completing assignments, and whatever else might be needing to be completed. It makes it easier to schedule your time.
How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult? 
It's become less fancy. Self-care is about making sure I'm able to first survive and then thrive. ​​​​​​​ 
What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and postsecondary student? 
Less time to actually take care of yourself.
Having set tasks you do regularly and making taking care of yourself part of your routine.​​​​​​​ 
Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) 
We usually do such habits because they're easy. You need to make it easy and enjoyable to do good things. For instance, watching TikToks late into the night is probably revenge bedtime procrastinating, making going to bed an enjoyable experience. Listen to music or podcasts (I like Sawbones it is about medical history). Also having snacks that are easily accessible that are nutritious. It's also good to lower the bar. Imagine trying to jump over a 5ft bar with no practice. It would be almost impossible, you'd get discouraged and give up. What about stepping over a 0.5ft bar? Seems doable. Habits are the same way. Let's say you want to start going to the gym. Going for 1.5 hours 5 days a week is intimidating. But going for 30 minutes every Sunday? That's doable. Once you get the basic habit down to a routine you can add more to it. Spend more time doing your habit, make it more complicated, etc...
Also, it's okay to slip up. Missing a week at the gym, eating fast food, whatever it may be. Life is more than your habits and routine, being able to pick yourself up and continue where you left off (or near that point) even after you haven't done something for a while is how you build sustainable habits and routines.

Hi Mentee,
""Imagine not being able to photosynthesize"" LOL it's giving... 
🌺: U hungry
🌸: I could use a light snack
Good luck on contacting the department head at UBC that you met during your science fair! 🍀 While I'm hoping for the best with that contact, as you apply for opportunites with other PI's, remember to keep your a CV/Resume up to date, have a copy of your transcript, and know your reasons as to why you want to research and research ideas you may have swirling in that bright mind of yours! And I respect the hustle - As valuable as experience is, you should get compensated for your work, and thankfully, I think most professors are aware that students need money to live lol. Also a reason to keep your resume up to date so you can just fire them off to where you want to apply and just customize the cover letter or get reference letters, etc.
I did end up signing up for fencing and took my first lesson last Monday! 🤺 The stance you take is something between standing and squatting, where you form a right angle with your feet, depending on your dominant hand. Are you right or left-handed? They say that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed fencers. I think I've heard something similar with tennis players?
Good gravy... 5 courses (8 including labs). But you know what? When you pursue professional studies in the future, being able to demonstrate the ability to balance full work load with high grades will look so favorable. 💪 Keep special attention to maintain your standard of excellence! I believe UVic Masters programs look at your 3rd/4th year grades, but thinking long-term, what if you pursue a Masters at UBC? Out of province? Out of country, even? I guess your best bet is to just continue killing it from first to final year and keep your mind open to all the opportunities ahead! Also keeping in mind possible programs that you don't actually need to complete your degree for (e.g. Certain medicine, pharmacy programs you can apply to in your 3rd year going into 4th!)✨
Bro, here I am, having seen exactly 0 moose and you and your roommate ran into 3 of them. I'M GLAD Y'ALL SAFE THO? BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE MASSIVE??? Although your semesters are full, so are your memories :) It really warms my heart to hear how you and your roommates / friends are doing, and although I've always regarded you as mature, I feel like I'm reading about you growing up! 🥹 Not me getting sentimental during mentorship for the millionth time, but I digress... LOL. 
Anything else about self care we care to explore as we continue to look into student research/employment opportunities for you?

Hello,
Thank you for sending over some job opportunities! Today I'm hoping to email the person from the science fair I did at UBC who said some opportunities might be available. If I don't get a reply by next week I'll start sending out other applications. I want paid work this summer because life is expensive and I don't want to work for free for 4 months. 
Good deals on groceries aren't a weird flex rn. Prices are insane and I cringe every time I go into a grocery store. 
Congrats on 6 months at your job! That's honestly a pretty big deal. Fencing seems so cool! I did ballet as a kid and it wasn't my favourite thing but I still remember the teacher telling us to make pizza slices with our feet for the first position and telling us to open and close the blind when doing plies. 
My life is going. I have an even heavier course load this semester. I have Functional Anatomy (with a lab), Biology (with a lab), Chemistry (with a lab), Health Care Systems, and English. Basically, eight courses because labs are so much work. I'm currently cringing about my 6:30 pm - 9:30 pm bio lab tonight. 😬
My roommate and I went for a walk this past weekend and ran into three mooses. We didn't stay long to say hello, because that's dangerous but it was quite an experience. We also learned that bathroom mirrors and windows go great with whiteboard markers. So our bathroom mirrors have motivational messages and science jokes on them with some gems including ""Imagine not being able to photosynthesize"" and drawings of the AmongUs characters. Our living room window has a bunch of cyclohexane and benzene on it from the organic chem we were doing last night as well as to-do lists. University life is definitely an experience.

Hi Mentee,
NOT ME REPLYING ON THE DIS- AND MIS-INFORMATION CONVO TOO LOL. I was looking for the questions you were answering like... Why am I still looking at misinformation for the 2nd month in a row? Okay, let's do this properly, shall we? I'll try the warm-up question with you because why not x2? :) 
Think about the circumstances or situations when you're most and least healthy. Physically? Mentally?
Most healthy - I think you're right that it's not selfish per se, but self-focused? I was a pandemic graduate and now I work from home, so my version of health involves going outside, getting fresh air, and interracting with people outside of a computer screen. I really value maintaining my relationships, and doing things that mean something to me, like building a life I'm proud of.
Least healthy - Similar to you, when I'm super busy and stressed, I tend to let go of things I can ""catch up on"" later. For example, I'll sometimes bring my lunch to my desk so I can keep working instead of taking my lunch outside and reading a book. Luckily work-life balance is very emphasized now a days, and it's encouraged for us to take our breaks, not just because we're entitled to them, but because we need them to maintain a healthy balance.
LOL @ ""I'm already sad"" and continue with their lives. It's giving... Doctor: Have you tried exercising to help with your depression? And the jump rope with your own tears meme.
Create a list of your own ‘warning signs’ that you might be in need of some self care. (Eg: low energy/mood/creativity, often tired, procrastination, irritable, etc).
I can tell it's time for a little TLC when I procrastinate things that I know will make me happy, I stay up way too late (which snowballs throughout the week), sleeping in too much, forgetting to eat, low mood, and just knowing that it's been a while since I took care of myself.
Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy. What lifts your mood or brings you joy? (Eg: making art, reading, spending time in nature or with friends, etc).*
Self-improvement / growth! Over the last few months, this has meant driving more, but I'm hoping to start going to the gym again to get my body moving (as I work a very, very sedentary role). I love eating delicious food with my friends and family. Doing my skin-care routine. I also like listening to podcasts and videos, especially the types that move me in the direction I want to go in life. I've also heard of ""finding a vacation in everyday"", which has helped me reframe how to enjoy the little things, like grocery shopping and finding a good deal (which like... weird flex, but I found cucumbers on sale for $2 each and bought like FIVE LOL 🥒 ). 
Mentor Q time!
Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re
feeling low, or not like themselves?
Totally agree with the first step being acknowledging that you're in a funk! I think I have the same answer as you. :) Go back to things that ground you as a person, and give it another go. Before bed, I always tell myself that ""Tomorrow is another chance for a better day"".
How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources?
During post-secondary school, self-validation was important to me. You invest so much of your time and energy into your education, and sometimes the best person to go to when you need support is you. And it never hurts to have things to look forward to, whether that be a hangout with friends after class, or the samosa you packed for a snack later.
As an adult, my schedule is much more predictable, so I can make more time for myself. While self-validation is still important, I like to find effective ways to ""rest"". For example, if work is getting too much, I'll take a quick minute to play a song on the piano to help myself relax and glide across another type of keyboard haha. I believe clinical psychologists or other mental health professional services are covered under benefits (will need to check that), so that could also be an avenue to explore.
What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult?
I'm again reminded why we were a match made in e-mentoring heaven, because same. Whenever I go through periods of mental hardship, I think back to when I experienced significant loss. Nothing truly compares to that distress, especially living through it and going through the aftermath. I literally thought this a few days ago too, ""If I can survive that, I can survive this"". 
But typical challenges that one should expect upon entering post-secondary / adulthood can be: Peer pressure, societal pressure, pressure to succeed, making ends meet, creating and maintaining relationships, making time for oneself, failing (especially when others are impacted by your decisions), what's to come next in terms of career
Mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult: Dependable schedule you can choose (students choose their courses and adults choose a job with hours that work for them), maturity is hopefully easier to come across in people, having time to build a life outside of being an adult
What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health?
Whoa, you covered all the bases and then some LOL. I'm not sure what else I could add to your A+ answer... But I guess mindfulness? Like how you said mindset can make you or break you, it's all about perspective. Anxiety can be a challenge, but socializing however you're comfortable, and moving around to get your endorphins released. Doing things that contribute to your life but don't dig you in a deeper hole, like how scrolling on social media for hours is such an addicting time sink, that you sometimes feel worse because of how much time you spent on your phone looking at mindless things. 
Work situation: The end of this month marks my 6 months in this role! I still think back to the bridge I burned having to make this decision, but I come to peace with it everyday, knowing I made the best choice for myself. I don't regret it. I hope you never have to be between a rock and a hardplace like that was for me, but there will come times in life where you just have to make a choice and accept the consequences of that. Improving your decision-making is a life-long skill.
Life wise: Because I'm closing in on 6 months, I'm feeling comfortable to start exploring new hobbies outside of work hours. As you know, I do mentorship, but I was thinking of also volunteering at our local homeless shelter. Recreation wise, I've been getting ads for introductory fencing and ballet, so... Catch me having crazy footwork in the coming months once I look into them more! 🤺 🩰

Hello again, 
I just realized that I sent my last message in the Dis and Misinformation channel so that's fun.
Alright, I'm going to answer the warm-up questions because why not?
Think about the circumstances or situations when you're most and least healthy. Physically? Mentally? 
I'd say I'm least healthy when I'm super busy and stressed. I tend to let smaller (though still important) things go when life gets super busy. So I might take a break from doing yoga, meditating, etc... stuff that helps keep me healthy and sane
I'd say I'm most healthy when I'm on my own. At times what it takes to be at my best is more on the selfish side (though I don't think selfish really works here). But me going to the gym, taking time to do things for me, and even eating healthier meals, can be slightly annoying for those around me. For instance, I'm happy with each quinoa grain bowls, but my father is not. So it's challenging to have a meal with both want that is healthy sometimes.
Onto the article. I like that getting enough sleep and eating well are considered basics. ""focus on the positive"" isn't always helpful as toxic positivity is a thing, but I get the point.
The “If you smoke marijuana all the time, you will be sad."" line made me chuckle. I don't smoke anything, but I would love to see a poster that says that around my uni. People would probably just say ""I'm already sad"" and continue on with their lives. 
Create a list of your own ‘warning signs that you might be in need of some self-care.  
Procrastinating, going to bed later (revenge bedtime procrastination), not picking my clothes up off my bedroom floor, wanting to scroll on my phone.
Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy. 
​​​​​​​Going to the gym, reading, food, learning stuff.
Like last time I'm going to answer the mentor questions.
• Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves?
Assess where you're at and start fresh. You need to realize you're in a funk to get out of a funk. Figure out what's causing you're funk -> take a break -> try to get rid of the cause -> start fresh.
• How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources?
Having people around who can help you take breaks is helpful also working to understand when you need to take a break. Sometimes I'll be so done that I'll knock on my roommates' doors and see if they want to do something. 
I started going to counselling once a month, it's free so why not? 
The basic things you can do for your mental health in any situation are good, but it's good to only have a few things you do regularly. For instance, I go to the gym a lot, I do weights and run. When I'm stressed I've learned to go for a run. There is a logical thought process to going for a run (or doing cardio) when stressed because stress triggers the fight or flight response which releases hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. The thing is, 1000 years ago, humans didn't exactly need to deal with finals but they were probably running from something or each other. For me, running is an easy and effective way to give the fight or flight response what it wants. 
• What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult?
I mean it depends on your life. I'm at a point where my mindset is the troubles school causes me is no match for what I've been through (mostly with my mom dying). Basically, there is nothing school can throw at me that is worse than what I've already been through and if I was able to get through that I can get through this.
Challenges to expect, failing, being afraid to fail, coming close to failing, social issues, relationships, and money problems.
Mental benefits to being a Uni student, free therapy, lots of people having good friends too, and living away from home can be good for a lot of people.
• What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health?
keep yourself functioning (eat, sleep, exercise), aka do even when you can't do much do the bare minimum
building up endurance and skills when you're in a good place can help you get out of a bad place. For instance, meditation has short-term and long-term effects. Just because you may not need to have these practices or skills in place in the moment they can really help you in the future.
mindset can make or break you
sometimes if you have low energy, depression, or are really stressed even everyday tasks like showering, eating, or doing your homework can be really challenging but anything is better than nothing. If you don't have the energy to shower can you wash your face? If you can't make yourself a meal do you have a granola bar or some cereal in the cupboard you can have? even better what about an apple (you don't even need to cut it up)? This is where planning ahead can be helpful because you can make sure you have okay food on hand that's accessible. Don't think you can write a research paper? Can you at least set it up? Maybe make a graph?
So what's up with you? How is the work situation?

Hi Mentee,
Just realized this definitely belonged in the Dis and Misinformation Conversation, but since I already closed that... 😅 imma put it here: When I was browsing social media, I came across an article about Canada minting a new black toonie in remembrance of the late Queen (now Googling it, I also see it on an article as the 'Goth Toonie'... Like who is calling it that?? LOL). Though I didn't click into the article itself, I hit share to DM it to a friend... When suddenly, a text box pops up like ""You're about to share this article without opening it. Sharing articles without reading them may mean missing key facts."" with the options to open the article or continue sharing. I thought that was an interesting measure added to prevent the spread of dis and mis information! I'm not sure if it was always this way, but I can see the intention to get users to stop for a second and think about the news they're consuming.
SO, I totally know it's finals season right now and right after that, you're headed into your winter break until the new year and NEW SEMESTER OMG. When you get back to this message, how did your finals go? How does it feel to be officially done your first sem of uni?! Any plans for your winter break? Look at you go, superstar! ✨💪 Couldn't be more proud of you, my mentee! I know I'm forward-thinking here, but did you have any classes / profs that particularly stuck out to you this semester that you feel comfortable enough to reach out about possible research opportunities? I know you were hoping to get started on research as early as possible, and while I'm not sure the timelines of profs getting research grants (aka money so they can research and possibly hire students), it doesn't hurt to plan ahead. If not, there is also the option to possibly go into a co-op for the Summer sem if you're not taking any classes, which I'd totally be happy to help you with too!
I opened this Self Care Conversation next because finals + starting a new year and new semester + all the while snow is blasting and Mariah Carey is telling us all she wants for Christmas is us for the millionth time is a stressful time! I also went to the dentist the other day, and they were crazy busy and saying tis the season for people to be stressing (i.e. clenching their jaw, grinding their teeth) so take care of yourself and your teeth at this time! 🦷 Breathe, un-tense the shoulders, and relax the jaw. :) 
I'm off to go last minute Christmas shopping for the 4th time 🥲 but let's get started on this convo and our Summer semester thoughts and plans next message!

Hi Mentee,
Happy new year and welcome back to school + e-mentoring! 💖 Hearing about all of those flights that got stranded in YVR had me worrying if you arrived and came back home safely (which you did, thank goodness). A three hour delay is not cute, but I'm still glad you were able to make it home for Christmas! There was definitely something in the air during that time, and suddenly we were covered in a blanket of snow ❄️ And you know how the memes go, once it snows on the mainland/island, nobody knows what to do lol. I was supposed to go up-island for some site visits, but we turned all of those meetings online because driving up and down the Malahat was a no thank you. It's too bad your break was so hectic, but I bet seeing your friends and family healed you in a different way too! ✨ 
And no, it wasn't just you! Especially the days between Christmas and New Years... They were just... there. Like... What a weird time. But look, we made it to 2023 and we're going to keep making it!
You absolutely rocked first semester, and you took 7 courses, right?! I find that initial transition from high school to university can be quite steep if you're not prepared, because students tend to underestimate the demand and overestimate their capacity. But you finished it gr-ACE-fully (get it... bc you basically aced your semester??? ok I'll stop LOL). Once you establish your routines, study habits, etc., university can be quite straight-forward. Sure, you learn more and the expectations grow as you advance, but there shouldn't be any surprises if you prepare yourself well.
Not me going to UNBC's website to find out why you can't do co-op as a biomed major?! Like why is it on their website if they're just going to be like ""no"" 🫠. But like you said, we're going to make it work:
1. Something that came to mind was FSWEP under the Government of Canada, and doing some clicking on there, I also saw their Research Affiliate Program for students. Just to note though, I haven't gone through FSWEP or their Research Affiliate Program, but when I was at Service Canada, a lady recommended I check it out after hearing I was a university student AKA I don't know what it really offers either. I have worked in a Summer job that was funded by Canada Summer Jobs though, which I believe is a grant with the same requirements through the Government of Canada (i.e. Have to be a full-time post-secondary student, between a certain age range, etc).
2. Checking out your local health authoritities for opportunities you're eligible for and interested in, like a casual or temp position.
3. Literally Googling ""Summer student co-op"" or something along those lines! OMG. I GOOGLED ""BC HEALTH RESEARCH STUDENT"" AND CAME ACROSS THIS? https://www.bcchr.ca/ssrp I think this is totally up your alley! Please look into this and if you want me to double-look into it with you, I definitely will!
4. If I come up with anything else, I'll let you know! But I just wanted to add that it's not necessarily where you work, but how you'll be able to find meaningful connection and gain skills for your future. I didn't have a health oriented co-op 2 out of the 3 times I went on one, which definitely worried me coming from a health focused program. However, I was able to leverage the skills and networks that I developed, and still ended up working in the field that I studied. So keep an open mind for opportunities that are the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" type!
See you in my next message!

Hello and Happy New Year,
Okay, so I read your message during finals but forgot to reply. On the plus side, I'm back at UNBC from my winter break, I got back this morning. My flight back to Vancouver was an experience. My flight was delayed over 3 hours, and the rest of the flights after mine from Prince George's to Vancouver were cancelled for a few days. I was so lucky to catch the last flight to Vancouver that left before Christmas. For context, I went home on the 18th, which was when that lovely snowstorm hit Vancouver (and the lower mainland in general). I left Prince George when it was -25°C, clear blue sky and sunny, and I arrived in snowy damp Vancouver 😑. Also, my winter break was supper hectic, I had to catch up with friends and family and I only got one day where I didn't have to do anything or be somewhere. I feel like I need another break.
Also, was it just me or did Christmas and New Year just kinda happen? Like they were just normal weekdays for me 🤷‍♀️.
my finals went fairly well actually. My grades were good (mostly A's). I'm happy with my first semester and worried about this semester because I have an extra lab but I'll make it work.
My plan with research is to contact the department head at UBC who suggested I email him after the science fair I did. I'm going to email him this week and I'm hoping I can get in there or somewhere. For some reason, my school doesn't let you do co-op if you're major is BioMed, which mine is. Soooooo I can't do co-op which sucks but I'll make it work. But if you know of any opportunities for students, please let me know. I've been looking at a few places like the government of Canada, and the Health Sciences Association of BC (by looking into them I know they exist but not what they offer).
Thank you for reminding me to unclench my jaw btw 😬.

Hello,
On the topic of spreading information, I've noticed that everyone in science, whenever we say an uncertain fact we always say ""fact check me on that"" or ""I can't cite my sources to on that"". It's funny how quickly everyone has become so vigilant about where they get their information.

Hi Mentee,
Oh my GOODNESS, look at that snow! ❄️ Thank you so much for sharing those pictures! You know, even with the snow covering most of your campus, I can tell from the infrastructure / architecture that it's so pretty! Something that I really admired about my old university was how nice the campus looked among the foliage and greenery, and I bet UNBC will look just as stunning once it becomes Spring time. (Ps. I love how when I Google image searched ""University of Northern British Columbia"", there was already snow-covered campus pics! I think that's part of Prince George's charm ✨). But you know what's not pretty? Being woken up by the fire alarms LOL. I'm sorry that happened to you twice. It's not even December yet, so I hope they don't wait until it gets even lower in temp or later in night to start doing it a third time 🙃 ... Pls tell me I'm not jinxing it rn. It snowed in Victoria once earlier this month, and you know everyone was losing their minds (including me l o l). 
*GASP*! You did NOT tell me you got into your uni's Model United Nations club executive team, but you just did! So congratulations! Reading that for the first time, I was thinking... 'Wasn't Mentee literally the president of that club in her high school?' AND THERE YA GO. What position are you, if you don't mind me asking? I hope with you now being older and in uni, you'll be able to have a wider reach with the work that you'll be able to do with MUN. 😄 Oh, you know what? I think UVic had something similar for volunteering to be a patient for med students! I'm glad you're giving it a shot and I hope it gives you more perspective on health and the healthcare field. Let me know what kinds of ""illnesses"" you've come down with if you're ever chosen for a case study. 🤪
Onto the questions with the fake news unicorn 🦄:
How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media?
I think as we age, there isn't as much of a need for external validation on the internet. When we were younger, those comments and likes were valuable... But now? It's all about that internal validation, baby! I'm also the same with you, I hardly share anything on social media, because... Frankly, I don't really care. LOL. 🤷‍♀️ I'm here for the memes!
Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation?
If I scroll past something that piques my interest, I will take the time to verify it myself. How many times have we passed by a headline of a famous celebrity passing away for what seems to be the third time? Misinformation can really draw you in, especially with ""click-baity"" photos and titles - I try to be aware that these are tactics for more views, shock factor, and may not necessarily contain the information they claim to have.
What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading or false information?
Seconding you on older adults. Facebook is not a reliable news outlet, I'm sorry! Lol. I'm sure they mean well, for example, they share an article about foods that help to de-stress. However, it'd be nice to recommend research articles/academic journals/reliable sources that can help support those claims.
How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student?
THE CORE COMPETENCIES STRIKE AGAIN LOL. Critical thinking is a valuable skill when browsing digital media, but also extemely valuble just in general, as you said. Being able to move forward without every step explained to the tee, ask ""deeper"" questions, and evaluate the task at hand is going to come in clutch no matter what.
Second set!
How prevalent is dis- and misinformation in their world, as an adult and post-secondary student?
As an ex-post-secondary student, very prevalent. As an adult, very prevalent. Dis-/Mis-information will always exist in our society, especially in a digital world where we will all eventually be ""online."" 
How does the importance of being able to identify dis- and misinformation differ between being an adult/post- secondary student and being a minor?
As a minor, there is probably more leniency due to lack of maturity and knowledge. At most, you probably lose social credibility among your peets. As a post-secondary student, there is risk of losing marks, like you said, because you can't just cite Wikipedia and call it a day. As an adult, I'm sure there are also risks, depending on how dis-/mis-information is a part of your life. I personally don't work in media, but I can imagine the PR nightmare if mishandled and it was your profession.
Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information?
I get very ""digestable"" news like everyone else, the internet. For fact-checking, I seek databases, academic articles, scientific journals, etc. Sometimes you'll even want to narrow it down to more current events, like news from within the last 5 years, to make sure it's up-to-date and what you're citing is that much more credible.
What are some habits they’ve built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation?
Avoid click-baity videos that look like ""NOT CLICKBAIT!!! (FOR REAL)"" because they are 1000% click-bait, save your time and brain cells. Try not to mindlessly scroll, because there will be some dis-/mis-information mixed in there that you may not even realize you're subsconsiously consumming (then later, you're thinking... Where did I see that from? Was it true?). Always fact-check, do your own research and if you're sus about it, take it with a grain of salt and see for yourself.
Your responses were great, don't worry! I can't believe it's almost December, and soon the new year...! Keep warm, keep healthy, and keep trying to be the best Mentee you can be!

Hello!
I'm back. University is busy. I'm doing less of a variety of stuff than I was in high school (fewer clubs, extracurriculars, no job) but I'm still busy. Have I told you I got onto the executive team of my uni's Model United Nations club? At our first meeting, they were like ""we need someone for this position"" and I went up after and was like ""I ran my club's school for this in high school so I can do this"" and the next thing you know here I am. Everyone there is surprised I'm in Health Sciences because MUN is not a very science club but I enjoy it so who cares. 
Another thing, I'm in my school's Health Sciences Student Association and I found out I can be a patient for the med students here. So I'm working on doing that. I guess all the med schools in BC have something like that where you can be a guinea pig for the med students. Seemed cool so I'll give it a shot. 
OMG, do you want to see the snow here!?
View from my dorm
View from the lab building 
The walk back to my dorm
The coldest it's been here was -29°C, which does not as cold as you'd think. What's great is people waited until it was -20°C to start setting off the fire alarms. In the other dorm building, one night they went off at 2:00 am because someone vaped into the hallway smoke detector and another night they went off at 3:00 am because the R.A's craft cupboard caught on fire and set off the sprinklers, flooding part of the first floor. The alarms in my building have gone off twice. Once was a drill but I was in class that same day at 7:00 pm because people had some cooking issues. 
 
Ok, onto the discussion
First, I would like to start by saying I love the unicorn. It's a good symbol of fake news. 
How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media?
Very little. I rarely share anything on social media. I don't post on my Instagram story and I post like one set of photos a year. My ""clicking"" on social media consists of scrolling through reels.
Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation?
University has made me so vigilant. I've gotten used to doubting stuff and checking sources. I'd like to think I am a careful consumer. 
What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading or false information?
With older adults, it's such a regular occurrence. My habit is to ask them where they got that information and did they fact-check it. People will fight you all the time when you call them out but the moment you pull out a research article that proves them wrong they shut up. 
How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student?
noooooo not the core competencies. Critical Thinking is great but writing a self-reflection on your ability to think critically is not great. Being able to think critically is important. Being able to question is important. I feel like no matter what you do being able to think critically is important.
The second set of questions:
How prevalent is dis- and misinformation in their world, as an adult and post-secondary student?
Very. 
How does the importance of being able to identify dis- and misinformation differ between being an adult/post-secondary student and being a minor?
you have more depending on your accuracy. If I spread misinformation in school I lose marks. 
Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information?
Credible news sources credited scientific journals. 
something I look for from news sources is if they release statements and corrections when they make mistakes. 
What are some habits they’ve built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation?
questioning everything, fact-checking. 
Ok, I need to go so I'm not sure how great my responses are but I need to go. Have a good week!

Hi Mentee,
""Cite your sources."" LOL. It makes you think that once you're getting up there in the 10s of references and they're taking 2+ pages of your paper, if the prof or TA are even checking that they match... (Spoiler alert: They do lol). I was hoping to pop-in to see how you were doing, and just like the sudden snow, all these midterms came falling down! Best of luck, you absolutely got this! I didn't even know bio papers were a thing, but there we have one. I'll be dropping in to reply to the anchor text + questions later too. :)

Hello,
I have more midterms next week and, I have a bio paper to write which is fun. 
I have heard about dis- & misinformation in ALL OF MY COURSES! ""don't read articles that aren't peer-reviewed (even then be careful)"", "" Always find the original source for news articles,"" and ""aim to only read stuff regarding First Nations peoples written by First Nations peoples"". It's funny because someone will tell me something, and I'll be like, ""cite your sources"".
Since I have so much to do at the moment, I will read the article and answer the questions later. 👍

Hi Mentee,
I've just opened the newest conversation pick, Dis- & Misinformation. Now as a post-secondary student, in what courses have you heard these terms and in what context?
Before I read the anchor texts above, I'll start off our discussion by saying that ""misinformation"" seems to be a word quite commonly thrown around nowadays. Haven't heard ""disinformation"" all too much though! When people are misinformed, or have misinformation, it can definitely lead down some rabbit holes and another popular word, getting ""cancelled"". That's why it's important to question your sources of information, question their credibility, and frankly, not believe everything you hear and see right off the bat (though I'm sure you already do that!). 
I think as information becomes more widly accessible and our generation grows more tech-savvy, this increases both the spread of true and false information... Like, sorry dad, but no... You didn't actually win a free iPhone or cruise from that spam website. LOL. 😂 But seeing my dad flip through the newspaper the other day did make me think, man, we're right in between the generations of people using paper and people using devices for their day to day news. When the next generations after us come, I wonder what they'll be using? 📱

Hi Mentee,
THOSE GRADES THO 🙌 ✨. Not gonna lie, I did crack a smile when I read the ""(once you round it)"" because that's when you know you're really thinking as a post-secondary student. LOL. So long as you get anything .6% and above, that's a round UP, baby! But for real, I knew the Thanksgiving week + week after would be swamped full of content, so I wanted to give you some time to do what you needed to do and take time to recover too. And as always, so happy to have you here on Mentor City!
Don't we just love reviewing content that looks 2000% testable and it's completely MIA from the exam itself? Like... I could've used that brain space and time for more things...🫠. Ah well, that's just the luck of the draw, right? I remember one time, our prof gave us a list of 10 questions that he would pick 7 of for our exam. I studied my answers for 8 of them. Guess who was surprised that the 2 questions she didn't study appeared on the exam? 🤡 Yeah. I probably played myself, but again, just the luck of the draw! Lol. But on the plus side, I bet those notes on the Krebs Cycle will be useful for the final exam!
I'll go ahead and close this conversation and open the next one you pointed out. See ya there!

Hello,
Last week was busy, I had 4 midterms so lots of studying! So midterms were a lot of fun, but I spent over 32 hours studying and doing assignments last week, which was fun. (When you add that with how much time I spent in class that's over 40h of school) On the very positive side, I got 82% on my bio midterm (an A) which put me in the top 9% of the class. I got 80% on my chem midterm (once you round it) and I got As and Bs on everything else. So the hours of studying were worth it. 
What's great is I (and everyone else) spent so much time working on learning the citric acid cycle and there were like no questions about it. Here is a parody of Macklemore's Thrift shop that goes through the cycle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMBIs_Iw0kE 
Moving on to the next topic sounds good! What about Dis & Misinformation? I keep hearing about that in my classes.

Hi Mentee,
Hmm... That's a tough one! School can feel a bit like they're putting you inside a hamster wheel, where you just keep going, hop off and get some water (reading break), hop back in until you're done the semester, then repeat the cycle (LOL weird analogy I know, but I hope it makes sense!). Something to think about is that while students are put on a schedule to learn everything by the profs, profs are also on a schedule to have grades in at a certain time by the university. So it's almost the balance of the profs giving enough material to ensure students are well rounded and prepared for the upper level of the course (quantity), while leaving it up to the students to ensure that they are getting the knowledge they need and producing it at an acceptable standard (quality). Not comparing your progress to your peers is a great outlook to have - Focus on what you can do to be the best Mentee you can be! The best student you can be! 
Noooo! I hope those girls from the bathroom stick it out, because having more women represented in STEM is always 💯! But I'm also thinking those feelings might be a part of a bigger picture, like the imposter syndrome of, ""Oh wow, I'm actually here""! Because if you think about it, just this time last year, you were all just high schoolers planning university applications, and now you're all university students actually doing all these university things! Going through that transition of being responsible for just your grades to now being responsible for all aspects of being a student is huge! But you've got the right attitude (as always, my mentee 💖 ): You CAN learn anything, everything, and more. You ask the questions you need to, seek out your TAs and profs during office hours (and hopefully they DON'T trauma dump on you??????), and keep on top of your health and studies. Actually, I eventually have to learn the Krebs Cycle myself, so if you have any tips of learning it, send them my way!
CHIM = Certified/Certification in Health Information Management
CHEM = crying LOL JK
My turn to answer the mentor question!:
What factors did they consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there?
That is so interesting, because I knew SFU was close to you and that we reviewed your UBC application together! But your reasoning to attend UNBC, I think, will take you in just the right direction you need to go to reach your educational goals. I mean, with your smarts, you were going to succeed anywhere 🤷‍♀️. But I think the smaller class sizes really do give you that opportunity to know your peers and professors on a more personal level. This can open doors to deeper connections, references, etc. And imagine making your way full circle by being able to contribute what you've learned to smaller communities (as you studied in a smaller school)? How beautiful would that be! 🥹
My circumstances put me in a bit of a pickle back when I was choosing schools 😅. As you know, I took a gap year after high school to save money while finding a program that I was happy with. I eventually decided to attend BCIT for their Medical Laboratory Technology program (so yes we could have both been on the mainland!), because I loved the idea of a career that combined science, health care, and living somewhere new! Unfortunately, there was immediate family illness back to back, and after some discussions with myself and my family, moving away for school at that time was just not feasible. So, I made the hard decision to study at UVic instead. My program, HINF, was never on my radar, but I found myself excelling and now I'm actually employed full-time in the field. The factors that kept me at UVic actually ended early on, so it wasn't as important once I was in. Now that I'm done school, as crazy as it is, I'm trying to get back in (in the form of medical school)! 
Cheese! 🧀

Hello,
Can I just say I am loving the constant feeling that a could/should be doing more. Like for every assignment, reading, notes, etc., I never actually feel like I accomplished anything. At least everyone is feeling this way. I'm not even comparing my work to others I can work alone for 6 hours, finish two assignments, do the readings for a class, and make notes for another and still feel like I did nothing. 😐
Regarding the 7 courses two of them are labs but the work load for labs is just as much as for my lectures BUT THEY'RE WORTH LESS CREDITS! 😡 Anyways, the prof went over the krebs cycle in biology yesterday and I went to the bathroom after class, girls were in there talking about changing their career plans to eaiser things. WHICH SUCKS. Sure the krebs cylce is complicated but I can learn anything (I think). 👍 I hope that puts school right now into perspective. 
Also my TA for First Nations Studies trauma dumped on our entire class for a good 45 minutes yesterday. 
What is CHIM? I read it as CHEM but I'm guessing they're very different.
I thought I'd look at the second portion of this discussion, I'm going to answer the question for the mentor because I'm not about to do a bunch of research for schools when I'm alredy where I want to be,
• What factors did they consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there?
Location: I liked the idea of going somewhere new and having a fresh start. This was actually a HUGE factor in my decision (certainly since no one wanted me to go here because of how far it is). I enjoyed high school and had lots of friends (my dad likes to say I was popular but idk). The idea of being able to start from the beginning and make something of myself again was nice. 
Program: UNBC actually has some very good programs. I got into a great program that I'm enjoying.
Size: UNBC is smaller, it was easier to get into the residence, lectures are smaller, and my labs aren't even 30 people. There are opportunities actually to ask questions. Also, you get to know people better (In my option at least) The lady in the dining hall who checks me in every morning knows my name (her's is Victoria). I doubt you could become so familiar with people and a place as fast in a big school.
Cost: though I am paying more since I'm living on residence my tuition is still less than it would be at UBC or SFU. Living in residence is a good experience though. 
I asked my roommate why she chose UNBC and she said cheese, so different perspectives. 🤷‍♀️

Hi Mentee,
Gosh, I've said it before and I'll say it 10x over - I love your answers. They're just so honest and sincere! As you were a part of my career finding journey, you'll know I'm a bit in that middle state of having just graduated school and starting a new job. So I can speak to both what you're saying and the perspective of someone in ""the adult world"" (but the imposter syndrome is still so real! lol). Firstly, I wholly agree with you! Someone's got to do it... So why not you? If everyone just ""settled"", we wouldn't have Olympians, we wouldn't be deflecting asteroids in space, and we wouldn't be making small and ground-breaking discoveries everyday. I know some peers who've decided that they're not going to pursue XYZ due to factors like age, resources, time, etc. But really, who is making that decision but yourself? Who is really gatekeeping you from chasing your dreams... But you? When I told my brother about my interests in medicine but doubts due to how long it'd take, he responded with: ""You're going to be 40 anyway. Might as well be 40 and a doctor."" 🤷‍♂️ HE'S NOT WRONG LOL.
But now being out of school for a year and a part of the working class, I can emphathize why it may not be that simple. You just gain so many more responsibilities after graduating! There's bills to pay, commitments, responsibilities, scheduling issues, lack of free time, and I'm speaking as a childless person! Imagine the added costs and responsibilities associated with also having a family! Now you're not just thinking for yourself, but thinking about your partner, your kids, pets, and more. That may be why security is deemed more attractive than taking chances, and why we choose the safer, more realistic choice over chasing our dreams. And sometimes, it's not up to you, but what works for everyone, and even then, it's still up to a number of factors in and out of our control.
What education you need for BOTH careers you researched.
Realistic: So this might be cheating a bit as I'm already in a career, but I can say that I required a bachelor's degree to be where I'm at today. However, a bachelor's degree in my particular program isn't necessary, as I have teammates who graduated with designations (i.e. CHIM) and are from different health-based backgrounds (e.g. computer science, lab work)
Dream: Did you know that you actually don't need your bachelor's degree to get into med school? Depending on the school, you can apply starting your 3rd year of university (which if successful, you'd enter 1st year of med school during the year you were supposed to take your 4th year of uni). But that's also the thing, while you don't necessarily need your degree, you do need to make sure you meet the right admission requirements.
Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary
1. Education just introduces you to the coolest ideas and people
2. Opens doors to new experiences. Post-secondary isn't just about studying, it's about gaining work experiences (co-op), taking part in clubs, research, etc.
3. Helps you get to where you need to be. If you want to be a dentist, you have to go to school. There's no going around that.
Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example: cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions.
1. You mentioned it, but cost. School is so expensive, even when you're a domestic student. Luckily, I was able to get by my undergrad through co-ops (paid work experience), but that won't cut it in med school where you most likely will have to take loans.
2. Length of schooling. 4 years seems like both a short and long time, but it's a lot of yourself to commit. Especially with what we're both considering (medicine and PhD), those paths take a long time to complete. But I can't wait to call you Dr. Mentee! And I'll be Dr. Mentor! Oooo!
3. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes there are factors in and out of our control. What if the person reading my application had a bad day? What if the post-doc program you're looking for is competitive/hard to come by? We do what we can and love, but at the end of the day, sometimes it's just a lottery.
How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why?
I mean, it's always going to be worth it once you're there. But instead of focusing on the goal, we can try focusing on the process to feel more fulfilled. It's not just about getting into med / post-doctoral programs, becoming doctors / researchers, and that's it. With that type of thinking, when would we ever stop moving the goal post? I found it helped to think about becoming someone who will make an impact, make a change, no matter how big or small. 
Your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? Why or why not?
Totally! Like you said, someone has to do the job, so why not us? It is a bit wishful thinking to go in, do everything by the book, and expect it all to fall in place linearly. But everyone's success story is different, and there's no regrets in giving it our best.
I'll do the second half of the discussion questions another time with you!

Hi Mentee,
Okay, so I totally got sick last week as well. We really be twinning with your roommates on with whatever was going around lol 💃. But I'm feeling much better and I hope you are too! 
GIRL, you said HOW MANY courses?! 7?!!? I should've taken a closer look at your class schedule when you sent it to me, because that is bonkers! LOL. But you're enjoying them, and from the sounds of it, balancing them well, so all I can really say is to keep it up and stay healthy. :) I do think 5-courses per semester is considered as a typical ""full-course load"" (depending on the program), so by doing 7, you are just on another level!
As requested, here are some midterm study tips from Mentor had a little Midterm 
1. Find out what you need to know
Sometimes your professors will tell you the cut-off for the content that will be covered on the exams (check your syllabus!). So I find doing an overview helps to find: the topics you know inside out (requires less review time), topics you need to brush up on (moderate review time), and topics where you're just ?????? (most review time). Ask yourself if this is testable material, is the prof's exam style more lecture-heavy vs reading-heavy, what type of subject is it (memory-based vs problem-solving vs interpretation), and allocate your resources that way.
2. Study guide it up from high yield to low yield
Once you have a grasp of what you need to know, try nailing down the topics / concepts that you feel will be heavily tested on, from highest to lowest yield. Once you've got those down, you can start going into and studying the details. Lastly, if time permitting, you can go in even further and study those ""little things"" which we're always convinced won't be on an exam, but by sheer luck, are always included anyway. I think by doing it this way, in the worst case scenario that you don't quite know the exact answer, you'll at least be able to write what you do know and not just leave it blank.
3. Consistency
While we ideally want to know everything, that's just not realistic. That's why it's so important to maintain the habits that keep your studying motivational, healthy, and consistent for you. Midterms are stressful, but being well-prepared leading up to them can help cut that stress down to size. So if you need to take a run to clear your head, do it! Will an all-nighter really help that much, or should you call it in early for the night? Especially when you've got exams back to back, it's important to know yourself the best.
And OMG 😱 did you just say co-op?! Co-op is my JAM. LOL. If you're able to attend those info sessions, that'd be awesome! I'd be happy to fill in whatever I can from my own experiences too. :) 
Conversation answers will be in my next message too! Cheers!

Hello again,
I'll respond to the first discussion topic now and I'll do the other one another time.
Dream career: being able to travel to different countries to study infectious disease
Realistic: (I mean people are doing my dream job so why can't I be one of those people...) frankly Idk realistic would be? I worked in a grocery store and I was good at that!
What education do you need for BOTH careers you researched?
Dream: probably a Ph.D. in some kind of science, work experience, or lab experience.
Realistic: I did the job in high school so I didn't even need a high school diploma for that. There is probably extra training if you want to be a manager.
• Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary
- Education is always a benefit
- Meet new people & network
- Learn more about yourself and what you want from your life
• Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example, cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions.
 
- cost is a quality challenge. It's costing me about $20,000 per year with residence, meal plan, etc... I did get an email telling me I got a $2,000 bursary from Girl Guides of BC last night so I've won over $7,000 this year. 
- School in general is challenging and it's not going to get easier when I'm trying to get a Ph.D. or something similar. 
- Lots of people want the experience for entry-level jobs and it's hard to find people who want to work with those who are beginning their education. I'm hoping my school's Co-Op program will help me overcome this challenge though.
• How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why?
So far, so good. I'm enjoying university and I'm willing to put in the work and study for a long time to get to where I want to be. I'm enjoying the journey so far. 
 
• Your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? Why or why not?
I've done hard things before and the career I want isn't the only good possibility for me. It may not even be the right one. I can change paths as needed but for now, I don't see why I shouldn't go for the career I want. Maybe I'm naive but someone needs to do the job so why not me?

Hello,
I am sick! So that's fun, my three other roommates aren't doing too good either. 
Regarding enjoying my classes, I am really enjoying my classes. 7 courses is a lot! I have midterms the week after thanksgiving weekend and I have no clue how to study for midterms (I didn't have many in high school). So if you have any advice for studying for midterms I could use that.
Someone visited my chem lecture today to tell us about the school Co-op program and it sounds like I can work during the summer semesters (which I was planning to do anyways), and they will help me find work within my feild and it will show up on my transcript. So, I'm planning to go to the info sessions next week.
I think the equivalent of shadowing for non doctors wanting to become doctors is shadowing a vet. Lots of people who did Co-op in high school did that if they were interested in medicine. 
I'll go through this topic in another message.

Hi Mentee,
Y i k e s . Well, at least you didn't have to find out the hard way! Learn by example, but don't lead by example when it comes to testing your prof's due date / time strictness... LOL. But your classes are going well? You should be coming up to your first midterms, right? The one thing I remember about uni was as quickly as the semester started, it'd seem like you'd be magically halfway through the semester, grinding through everything before holidays / breaks. Although the grind can be brutal, I preferred it over having something due right after a long weekend - how about you? Team get everything done before the holiday or Team assign it when we come back from holiday? 😄
Things change, feelings change, people change too (isn't this a Drake song? LOL). Anyways, I think you're in a good position to explore your options. I believe most STEM programs are structured to have similar 1st and 2nd year curriculums to allow for that flexibility. Not every pre-med will stay a pre-med, but that isn't to say their courses won't be valuable (or transferrable) to say, becoming a biomedical engineer or physiotherapist. Though I'm totally manifesting a research position for you and a nice grant so that you can still get that coin while you do research and research career options lol! 🙏✨  Something that came to mind while I was talking to my friend the other day: Say dentistry is calling out to you. You could take a walk to your local dental office and talk to the dentist there if they have time. Being a dentist for the military (which I believe they help pay for your education?) vs being a dentist + business owner may have dynamics you may or may not want in your future career. Similarly, if you go down the medicine route, although I believe shadowing isn't recommended is B.C., even just talking to a family doctor or medical student can give you an idea of ""Can I see myself doing this for the long haul? What will the future be like for me by the time I graduate?""
And regarding what's next, actually, you know what... I opened this convo just to see if I could and if any of the content had changed since we last did it. But now I'm thinking... Wouldn't it be fun if we revisted this topic again, after your first semester or your first year at UNBC? Just to see how much things have changed since you were in high school? 
I'll keep this topic open for now, but is there a topic you'd be interested in going into next?

Hello,
Regarding handing things in a couple of minutes late, my chef prof takes off 50% when you hand stuff in late. AND THIS MAN IS NOT JOKING! 3 people handed in their chem problem set ONE MINUTE late last class and he put them in a separate folder for late work.
Regarding citation style, my English class is MLA, my First Nations studies class is APA, and my science courses ask for CSE (which is new to me).
This place was definitely designed well, it’s also accessible for people with disabilities which is good.
To reply to your second message: I’m going through life right now with the idea that my plans are probably going to change. What I like about my program is it’s considered pre-med so I can do that, go into research, or do whatever else may spark my interest. 
What’s next?

Hi Mentee,
Don't mind me, just picking a convo about post-secondary planning... While you're already settled in at uni LOL. I just wanted to check it out to see if there were any new anchor texts / questions / resources since the last site update. Actually, while I'm here, there is something I could speak briefly on the topic before we get into it... I know you're all in for science, being a scientist/researcher, and being the Nobel Prize winner I know you to be 🥹! But recently, a few of my friends who've recently graduated university have gone back to school and switched their programs up. For example, I know someone who is now in massage therapy school, one who is considering going back for pharmacy, and an ex-STEM major now studying design. And you also know me, who'll be attempting the pre-med route soon. :) Being in school and being in a career are two completely different worlds, but at the end of the day, I think it just comes down to fulfillment. What you're studying now doesn't mean you have to be in science or research for the rest of your life. Similarly, if you find something that you like, but then it isn't sparking as much joy as before, you don't have to stay put. I think the beauty of knowledge is being able to share it, and that also includes applying it to different fields in different ways. Don't feel you're limited to a certain direction just because of your education, because really, the sky's the limit!

Hi Mentee,
So let me get this straight... You had a quiz that you couldn't go back to review your answers on + time limit + minimum % threshold to pass + you didn't know how many questions you had ahead of you... That stressed me out just reading it! 😩 But hey, good work on the 6/8! In the wise words of my past Math 100 professor - ""[Professors] don't know what you don't know."" I'm sure I've mentioned this before and I know it seems like common sense, but when you come across a question on your exam that seems like boss battle music should start playing in the background, just give it your best shot and show your work! The worst you could get are no marks, but the best could get are partial marks for having the right idea. Another thing that just came to mind was giving yourself at least a minute to submit your quiz/test/exam. I find that when everyone is trying to submit at the same time, right at the deadline, it takes a few extra seconds to submit fully, and sometimes your quiz/test/exam has a ""review"" page before the option to do a final submit. Especially if your prof is strict on time limits and gives no clearance that it's alright to submit past the time limit, please save yourself the stress and submit it a minute or two before. Again, I know this is like, ""Of course I would do that?"" but it's always the moments when you least expect it, and your mentor's got your best interests at heart!
Different syllabi?! HUH?! I guess all universities standardize their syllabus differently. But you've got the right idea with making an Excel spreadsheet! I personally used Google Calendar because I needed a system that alerted me 2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days, and 1 day before anything was due lol. It also helped me book specific hours for group meetings! But use the system that works best for you, whether that's Excel, a planner, Google Calendar, your phone, etc. AND GIRL, I KNOW! Plagiarism scared me too!! I've also heard that profs can run our papers through a program for plagiarism checks 😭. But really, if you just cite and reference your work properly, you're totally fine! I was by no means immune to quick citing machines, but cleaning it up with Owl Purdue was my go-to combo. Totally random fact, but I think I used APA 99% of the time in uni, with 1% being MLA and literally 1 assignment I had to cite in Chicago style. Let me know if it's any different at UNBC!
Omg I love how you specifically highlighted the froyo machine because absolutely that is the best part LOL. But WOW, I think my favorite perk of your campus is everything being connected! Talk about meaningful engineering for the students. Hope you enjoyed the party and I totally respect your honesty! As your mentor, of course I'll never condone harmful activities, but I got nothing to worry about with you having such an awesome head on your shoulders. Just make the best of your time, make lots of memories and friends, and remember, uni isn't about grades, it's about learning and getting to where you want to be. :) And I'm with you every step of the way!
Oh, they are totally faded out for me too AKA I have to unlock the convos again. Actually, if you wouldn't mind, I'll probably open one we've done before just to see if any of the contents have changed. Who knows, maybe our answers have changed too since last year!

Hello,
YOU'RE BACK!🥳
Wow, so the travel agent just didn't do the main part of their job -_- that sounds like a very stressful time. 
As far as my uni experience so far it's going well. I just finished one of the most stressful pre-lab quizzes (it's 8 questions, you need at least 50% to pass, and you have 15 or 20 minutes to do it (note: you don't know how many questions there are when you start so you're rushing to get it done) and you can't go back to questions you've answered.) I got 6/8 right, the last two were based on information I had not read, nor could I find it in any of the pre-lab stuff. At least the pre-lab quiz for my bio lab was reasonable. 
In terms of the syllabi, EVERY SINGLE ONE IS DIFFERENT! My goal was to collect all my due dates, put them into an excel document and arrange them by the due date, well I spent more time trying to find what was due than actually entering stuff into the document. 
The plagiarism speech scares me because I'm afraid I'm going to plagiarise without knowing I plagiarised.
Another fun thing, the bookstore screwed up their book orders. Most of the textbooks were supposed to come with access codes for online quizzes, lessons, etc... (most are required for classes), but they ordered the ones without the codes. So now my name is on a list for my biology textbook (along with at least 100 other people), for this code so I can access my assignments. My bio prof is understanding though so he's willing to push back due dates because of this. For chem and English I bought the digital versions of the books from the publishers so I had no issues but for those who didn't and got their copies from the bookstore...they're having problems.
Overall I like my dorm and my roommates, the dining hall food is good (They have a frozen yogurt machine), the gym is super nice and I enjoy going there, and best of all, all the buildings are all connected (other than the dorms and the gym) so in the winter when it's -30 or colder, I won't need to constantly be going outside for my classes. 
I went to a party on Friday. It's a thing here to stick notes under the Appartement doors in the dorms. So everyone in my building got a note under the door on Thursday night inviting us to the party. It was in the middle of the woods, next to a lake, and it was very dark. But I went with two of my roommates and we had hiked to the lake a few days before so we knew the route. The best part was the dining hall the next morning ( I didn't drink, smoke, or snort anything at the party so I wasn't hungover) most people looked absolutely miserable and hungover. 
It's always interesting to see how our answers to the discussion question differ. 😁
Shall we move on to the next topics? I wonder If they changed the ones that are now locked (even though we did them) do you get a different...experience?

Hi, it me! Back at it again, but this time, to respond to our conversation (☞  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) ☞:
Okay, first off, I'm glad I read your message before reading the contents of our conversation topic because whaaaaaat is going on with the format. 🤪 I clicked into the discussion questions by mistake and it redirected the page when I was already typing stuff out LOL just sharing in case you do that too!
Sharing 3 people in my life that could be allies:
My past co-op supervisors: Although co-ops aren't very long (typically 3-4 months), I was very fortunate to have served 3 supervisors during my time in uni, 2 of which I still keep in contact with and who act as my references. What I really appreciate from their allyship is their genuine support in my endeavours, and while I haven't actually read their references of me, they've always been happy to write them whenever I reach out. And well, I got this job, right? So I'm sure they're saying something nice. LOL.
My current supervisors and people I've met in this field: I don't think I'm doing this right, but I'm gonna keep going with it because I've already started 😂. But my current supervisors were so supportive during the whole ""Is Mentor going to Vietnam or not???"" saga, and not just that, but have been very flexible in my desire to learn more outside of my position. Additionally, on my way to getting this job, I've met with researchers and other staff who just have so much encouragement to give. It just reaffirms my decision of being in this field. :)
You!!!: It's not because you chose me as one of yours, but because I really feel that we've built a great connection over the past year that helps me keep going! When I chose to become a mentor, it wasn't just about helping a student with advice I would've valued at their age, but also wanting to learn from them too. I really value what you say, and look at me - Now I'm jumping rope and reading books again haha. Thank you! Can't wait to see what my future Nobel Prize winner will teach me next :D !!
My turn to answer the mentor questions below (great job trying to answer them too btw!):
Do they have any tips for identifying who would be a good ally? These could be tips for identifying professional, emotional, and/or personal allies.
I think for a professional ally, you'd want to look for someone who will encourage you, critique you (in a constructive way), but also support your professional growth. An emotional ally would be someone who can empathize with your reactions and knows the right language (e.g. love language) to ensure you feel emotionally supported. Personal allies are those who, I suppose you personally choose to get close to you and who know you well. Their allyship can keep you accountable or support you in how you need to be (while still respecting boundaries on both sides).
How do you get someone to be your ally? What can you do to build trust and respect between yourself and someone who you want to be your ally?
Your response was so funny LOL. ""Will you by my ally???"" I totally agree in that you should look to build that connection first, and see what kind of allyship you're looking for (just because they're say, your boss, they may not necessarily be the professional ally you're looking for, but could be, say, a networking ally).
How do you approach someone to ask them for a reference letter?
Before ceasing my employment or volunteer role, I typically ask my supervisor if they would be comfortable being my reference. From there, it'd be a matter of reaching out for the reference letter, being mindful to give them a date you need it by and if necessary, a reminder of what you did in the role.
Do they have any tips on networking?
I'm honestly still working on this skill myself, but what I've done so far has really been shooting my shot 🏀 lol. For example, I reached out to a research manager a few months ago and she said she was impressed at how I just put myself out there and we had an awesome conversation about her work. No harm done on either side aside from the nerves of sending that initial ""are you free to chat?"" email.
How do you know who is trustworthy and who is not, when you are seeking emotional or personal support from your allies?
Totally agree with you!!! I think it's a combo of trusting your gut feeling + seeing how this person interacts with others + knowing that person well enough to confide in. You wouldn't want to be vulnerable with a wolf in sheep's clothing, right? Trust yourself first and foremost.

Hi Mentee,
MENTOR IS BACK!!! I am so so sorry for dropping off the face of the planet like that so suddenly! o(〒﹏〒)o Man, my heart when I got your message checking up on me... That should be my job as your mentor! lol. To explain my disappearance long story short, 4 months ago, I was planning a trip to Vietnam to attend/take part in a wedding (not my own obv hahaha). So, here I was, a sitting duck still waiting for my tourist Visa to process through, 2-weeks until we fly out... and we come to find out that the travel agent didn't apply for the right Visa. B r u h. I didn't even have time to be mad LOL. It. Was. Crunch. Time. I was calling embassies, resubmitting Visa applications left and right - Anyways, what came of it was that I did what I could in the last few weeks, but it was way too last minute to fly with everyone else since my Visa is still processing (+ the ticket prices were growing to be like $4000+, not including spending money, insurance, etc... UM!?!). Told my managers I'm staying put and now I'm here, sitting in front of my laptop, finally having the chance to tell this story to my lovely mentee and catch up with her!
SO, with that all out of the way, how have you been?! Have you been settling well? How was your first week of going over syllabi? Did you memorize the whole 'plagiarism is bad' speech they make in every class? I want all the tea! LOL. 😂 Throughout this whole time, I knew in the back of my mind like ""Oh, it's Mentee's first week at school! I wonder how she's doing?"" And now I'm so excited to hear all about it! I couldn't wait to send this first, so I'll be responding to the conversation message right after! 
By the time you're reading this, you've survived your first week as a freshman at uni! You go, Mentee! (it's giving me 'You go, Glen Coco!' energy ✨)

Hello,
Well, it's Sunday night and I leave for Prince George on Wednesday. So that's fun. Also, thank you for handling everything with the email.
Somehow I am still in pain from my wisdom teeth surgery. It's only on one side though so IDK what I should be doing, but the swelling has gone and I no longer look like a chipmunk. 
I had to fill out a questionnaire with lifestyle questions in my residence application. They asked questions like ""what time do you wake up?"", ""What time do you go to bed?"", ""How tidy are you?"", ""Are you comfortable with partying?"", ""Are you comfortable with drinking?"", ""Are you comfortable with smoking"", ""Are you comfortable with your roommates having overnight guests?"", ""Are you planning on having overnight guests?"". So I doubt I'll get placed with a messy person who goes to bed at 4:00 am and wakes up at 12:00 pm (I hope).
Ok so UNBC sent out a course I had to go through to get to know the uni and the resources they offered. Free tutoring!? and they have people whose job is to help you find undergraduate research opportunities within the school. Free workout classes and gym access. At this point, it seems like UNBC has more resources for students than my high school.
Looking under Agency in the World they definitely modified the layout. Maybe that's why they re-locked the conversation? I'm not a fan of the text being aligned in the center instead of the left side of the screen. It looks like a poem.
List of allies:
My Ranger Leaders:  
Helped me gain leadership and community service opportunities -- They both wrote me very nice reference letters
You :  
Why not? you've helped me out A LOT this past year and you would absolutely qualify as an ally in my books. 
The example only listed two so that's what I'm going to stick with. But I will attempt to answer the mentor questions.
Do they have any tips for identifying who would be a good ally? These could be tips for identifying professionals. emotional, and/or personal allies.
A good ally is someone who supports you/wants the best for you and in this context, I'm going to add someone who is older and wiser than you. 
How do you get someone to be your ally? What can you do to build trust and respect between yourself and someone who you want to be your ally?
I wouldn't recommend walking up to them and asking ""Will you be my ally?"" because they will be confused (Very few people use the word ally in this context). Ask for mentors, or if it's a group leader, coach, teacher, etc... build a relationship as you would normally with someone like that. 
How do you approach someone to ask them for a reference letter?
""Hello, I am [working on scholarships/applying for uni/applying for a job/etc..] since you've known me for [length of time] and I feel like we have a good relationship would you be able to write me a reference letter? [offer to send something such as a brag sheet to make their life easier]. ""
if they say yes make sure to say thank you many times and give them a deadline for it that's a few days or weeks before you actually need it. I've had people forget when I've been depending on their reference and it just stresses everyone out.
Give them more than 2 weeks notice. 
Do they have any tips on networking
It's okay to email people randomly because you're interested in their work. 
How do you know who is trustworthy and who is not, when you are seeking emotional or personal support from your allies?
Well, don't go and approach a stranger off the street and start trauma dumping. 
You need someone who can listen and offer quality advice and who will keep your secrets.

Hi Mentee,
For your first message: Thanks for letting me know that you got that email! Though a bit odd as I wouldn't think mentees would get it too, I've reached out to e.mentoring to personally request continued access for both of our accounts - If I hear anything back, like if they say my mentee has to request continued account access on their own behalf, I'll let you know! But for now, your mentor's got this 💪.
For your second message: Have you lost teeth since we last spoke? LOL. But the impeccable timing of your wisdom teeth removal though?! I'm sure your swelling will be down in time for your first week of school. :D But still... Rest up, take your medications well, and eat when you can. 😄🦷. Let me know how your recovery goes!
Oh, you know what... I scrolled up to look at my wheel and I see what you mean. In the mentor perspective, once I've unlocked a conversation, it's usually bolded out, but more than half of our wheel has been unbolded... Weird? I can only think that they're making preparations for the new mentors/mentees coming in for September 2022 school year and resetting stuff? Wondering what'll happen if I click into a convo we've done before and unlock it again. I'll probably unlock our last one (Agency in the World) to test it out.
Honestly, that sounds awesome! I've never lived on res, but seeing those layouts where you'd have to dorm with 1-2 others in one shared bedroom made me feel like you wouldn't have the chance to have your own personal space. I think this would be a great opportunity to practice having that independence and freedom, while still getting to know your roommates. Say you move after university, you'll already have an idea of what to expect when renting with another person, what you would and wouldn't buy again, shared living courtesies, etc. Were you given a questionnaire to pair you with similar roomies? I've always wondered how that would work, if say you're the type to sleep early and someone else was a complete night owl. All you can eat, 7 days a week with study rooms. Sounds like a dream combo for studying for finals LOL. 
I know this is going to sound like, ""HOW???"" but I remember meeting this girl in my first year who lived on residence, but she was still late to every class 😭😭😭. This goes to show that while living close to school is convenient, it's still only but an ingredient to success if not applied correctly. I was thinking of other ""just uni things 🤪"" 😂:
Find out who your undergraduate academic advisor is, find out who your co-op undergraduate advisor is (for when you need someone to help point you in the right direction; for when you are interested in getting some on-the-job experience during your summers)
I think when you're registering your student info on UNBC's website (i.e. your student account), they ask for your preferred contact number. In my case at UVic, it was my cell number. When something happens on campus, they send a campus-wide text to everyone, even if you're not at school (e.g. School closed due to inclement weather), similar to when BC sends everyone an amber alert text. 
Totally go to Orientation! I unfortunately missed out on mine because I was coming back from vacation, but you can explore campus with other freshman, get toured by your RAs, and best of all, get SWAG like shirts and stuff lol.
Explore on your first day/week, because that's when clubs will be trying to recruit new members! I think they recruit year round, but I recall first week back to school, many of them had booths to attract new students - See if there are any that speak to you! There might also be some vendors, like I remember getting these really good mini donuts on my first day back lol.
Once you're more settled in, I'd bus into Prince George and see the city life there if you're not familiar already! I'm sure it'll be a place you go often with your friends - Coffee dates, study dates, trying new restaurants, sightseeing, picnics, hiking, etc. 
More related to school, but looking at your library reserves could also be something to try (Basically, it's resources that you can't sign out but can look at in a special part of the library).
You can also look at the copy store, say if you want to buy past exams for the practice questions, or an assignment requires you to print and laminate.
If anything else comes to mind, I'll keep adding to this list! Until then, I'll unlock our Agency in the World convo and see where that takes us (again).

Howdy,
I just got my wisdom teeth pulled today so I'm like on three different kinds of drugs, just enjoying allowing myself to chill after having four teeth pulled out. I took tomorrow off work too so I'm taking care of myself as I should for once 😁.
I'm just replying to your messages in General Disscussions because a couple of the modules we have already done have been locked for me. 🤷‍♀️
I'm going to be living on residence, the only thing I know is I'm going to be staying in Keyoh (which is one of the two residences) UNBC has an intelligent design for their residences because there like small apartments. So I get my own room but I share a kitchen, bathroom, and common space with three other people. There are also study rooms, common rooms, and laundry rooms on every floor. My meal plan is also ""All you can eat, 7 days a week"". 
I got noise-cancelling headphones for Christmas this past year and they are an absolute game changer! I don't think I could study without them anymore.
Luckily for me, I have a 5-minute walk to the center of campus and it's a 15-20 minute bus ride into the city of Prince George (The bus stops right at the school too!).
I get my student card the day I move in and I will start getting to know how to use it ASAP. (I copy and pasted your list :) ) 
OK, I def need to fix my sleep schedule 😬 My sleep schedule is quite regular but not what I need for university.
Thank you for the rest of the tips too! I copy and pasted them to a note on my laptop desktop so I can be reminded of them regularly.

Now for your second message!
I liked your short story. Especially the part where your teacher would have been satisfied but you weren't, it's good to work for what you believe is good.

Hi Mentee,
I know, right?! It just goes to show that there are truly many careers out there to discover. As you progress through university, I'd encourage you to reach out to professors, graduate students, and even your peers, to learn more about their path and how they came to study/research what they are. Who knows, perhaps you'll pull some inspiration and maybe even open some doors you didn't know were there!
Omg... That 6PM ENGL class... RIP. I do, however, find that ENGL classes go very quick (I mean, they are only 50 minutes long)! While it really depends on your prof's teaching style, I found success in writing down the points my professor would make, versus what I already knew / what was provided on our handouts. For example, if your assignment handout states that there will be an oral presentation, but your professor mentions points on how to effectively present an oral presentation, that's what I would be focusing on jotting down. It's all about pulling key information from lecture - But you already knew this! 😋
OKAY, THANK YOU MENTEE'S COUNSELLOR!!! I was wondering where your entrance scholarship was, but thought you just included that with your UNBC acceptance. I also believe you have a strong chance with getting in-course / renewable scholarships, but always keep your eyes open for awards you do have to apply for. There's no risk to shooting your shot! It's free money! LOL. I wouldn't mind my mentee being showered with more scholarships 😂🤩😎😏. Keep me updated!
I'll choose a topic for us! I don't see a ""End this Conversation"" button on my end for this one, so General Discussion will just stay open. We can come back to it for any topics that may come up outside the Conversation.
For Mentee's pre-med friend:
So, you might have noticed that medical school in Canada is a bit more ambiguous compared to the US. We don't have nearly as many schools, and each school has their own requirements. While I'm definitely no means an expert, and you may have done this already, you may have more luck browsing your university of choice(s) medical school site versus the university site itself. Let's take UBC for example: https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/admissions/before-you-apply/
Here, you're able to view valuable information like Admission Requirements, Admission Statistics, Evaluation Criteria and more. While some schools may evaluate your application hollistically, it is still important to be aware of both your academic components (e.g. course load requirements, MCAT, AGPA vs OGPA, etc.) and non-academic components (e.g. Experiences, employment, research, etc.) to best reflect 'you'. For example, strictly speaking for UBC, you'll notice that the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) is a requirement for applying to their med school, with minimum scores required in each section to successfully apply. While I cannot speak for adcoms, approaching your course selection to best equip yourself for success (especially for components like the MCAT) is what I could recommend to you. As cliche as this is, pursue what interests you and do your best!
Long answer short, I'd check the Admission Requirements > Prerequisites section for the schools you'd be interested in applying for and build my semesters that way. Do I need to have a full-course load to apply? What do they count as a full-course load? Are there any course requirements like minimum English courses taken? How will they evaluate my GPA? What is a realistic 'competitive' GPA / MCAT? These are some questions to think about while looking into these schools. You could also seek your academic advisors for assistance in meeting your med goals, and look into additional resources like student forums (e.g. Premed 101, though I wouldn't recommend always checking those out). Focus on you, you got this, future doctor!

I couldn’t schedule the courses I needed without that big space of nothing in the middle and I’m already cringing about the 6:00 pm course but there isn’t much I can do about it.
 
More about the scholarships: 
I was talking to my counsellor at my school’s awards night about my post secondary plans and such, the next day she calls me to her office, asks me if UNBC has offered me any money (they have not) and now she’s going to call UNBC and ask them to give me an entrance scholarship because “if UBC is giving me money (which they never do apparently), then UNBC should as well”. 
 
 Ok, Dr. Mentor!!! 👏👏👏 I definitely think you’d make a great doctor and I like that you know you have some work to do before you can go to med school. 
 
Since we’re continuing and I can’t think of any topics should we choose another topic?

Hi Mentee,
THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've been spending these last few days looking through the offer letter + onboarding documents while they process my background check. So while I'm not completely out of the woods yet (offer is conditional on passing the background + reference checks), I'm still so appreciative that I've gotten this far. So my job is to help support eHealth in rural and remote communities, mainly focusing on First Nations communities across BC. I'll be helping train health professionals at these sites with using systems like EMRs (electronic medical records), by creating how-to docs, training videos, and supporting them in person/remotely. That's why I asked you so many questions about rural living, as I'll be going to these communities with my team in the future, and I thought it would be a disservice to not educate myself about rural environments. To me, it was an opportunity to expand my knowledge about healthcare access in BC, primarily to our underserved communities, and it's almost like mentorship in a way! 
Sorry, Rach, did you send me two September sems by chance? But looking at them... Yikes, I do NOT miss those nearly 3 hour blocks. But what's nice is, I found that many professors take a 10 minute break in the middle to allow students to stretch their legs, get water, etc. I mean, it is a long time to be sitting and be focused in lecture so, I'm hopeful your profs will give y'all a break time too. :) There's nothing we can do about lab times tho LOL. They really do be like that. I know 5 classes seems overwhelming, but I totally believe in you + a full course load may be necessary for certain things down the road like scholarship renewals, professional studies, etc. I just want you to have as many doors open as possible! But if you're finding it's too much, I would recommend balancing your semesters so that you're not taking all of your ""heavy"" courses in one sem versus the other (dependent on your preferences and strengths). We can talk about it once you're more adjusted!
LOOK. AT. MY. MENTEE. GO!!! LET'S. GO!!!!! 5 SCHOLARSHIPS?! FOR REAL FOR REAL??!?! Omg if I could give you a ""Best Mentee Scholarship"", you could count that as your 6th. 😩❤️!!! You're incredible! Seriously, you deserve those awards! I can only imagine what UNBC has in store for you too!
Honestly, I was hoping you'd want to continue, because I'd love to too! 🥹 It was so bittersweet to think that I'll be sending my mentee off to post-secondary and I wouldn't know how she was doing, if I could help with any of the questions that come up after getting into university and settling down, etc. So of course, if you would allow me the privilege to continue being your mentor, I'd be ecstatic to, Mentee! And to answer your question, I likely won't be assigned another high school student as I've already graduated. This program is for current post-secondary students to support current high school students, and new mentors would have more up-to-date knowledge for their mentees. And truthfully, they made an exception for me to mentor last year as I had just graduated... Then they paired me with you and the rest is our history! 🥹 I totally feel the same way - I've never felt mentorship was a drag, or a bother, I truly look forward to messaging you and guiding you as best as I can! Your future is so bright, young star! Thank you for letting me do this. 🥰

I know I haven't mentioned this to you, and truthfully, I wanted to tell you at the ""end"" of our mentorship. However, since we're both hoping to continue, I thought I should tell you anyway! But I'm hoping to eventually apply to medical school sometime in the future. I have quite a ways to go before I'm ready, in terms of growth and comfort (especially with studying for the MCAT, which I'm finding difficult as a non-traditional student). But I hope we can both achieve our dreams! I'll be rooting for you forever, my mentee scientist! So please don't mind me if I ask you some beginner Chem/Bio/Biochem/Physics/Math questions. LOL.

Hello,
 
OMG! Congrats on the job offer!!! 🥳 Inspirational queen energy 👑 (I’m smiling typing this, hearing your news made me happy) What would you be doing in this position? 
 
Regarding the schedule, I did it all on Monday at 9:00 am. My chemistry teacher was happy to let me do it during class which was great. I’ll try and add pictures of my schedule but I have a full course load. 5 classes and 2 labs per semester and let me tell you I’m questioning how I’m going to balance it all. My residence application is due by July 1st,  so I’ll do it this weekend, I just wanted to register for all my courses before I did that. The notice for registering for courses was a little short but overall UNBC made the process very easy. I had an issue part way through so I emailed my advisor and she replied in 10 minutes which impressed me. 
I am happy with my first semester schedule more than my second semester but I have time to figure out what works for me once get started, and considering my experiences so far with UNBC I should be able to make changes.

Also, because we talked about scholarships, so far I’ve won 5! 
The one from the Vancouver Regional Science Fair (UBC Science Entrance Award), but since I’m not going to UBC I can’t use it.
The 2022 Lougheed Bursary (from Girl Guides). I also got  my Trailblazer Gold (the highest award you can get in the youth area of Guiding)
District/Authority Scholarship, I just had to prove I was involved in a specific area and I won it. I did french because I’ve been in French immersion since kindergarten, I’m in a French book club, I’ve done lots of french clubs, and I tutor one of my friends in french.
The PAC Exceptionality Award (one of the ones from my school)
The Kamyar Edonddin Hamidi Scholarship. I don’t know if you remember but there was a plan that was shot down at the start of 2020 on its way back from Iran. One of the people on that plane was a student at my school who was in my grade (he was also in french, which is a close community, so we knew each other well). Anyways everyone on the plane died and in honour of this student, a teacher and the student's grandfather collected money to create a scholarship in Kamyar’s name. And I was one of the winners. 
 
As far as continuing mentoring I would love to (if you want to as well). Would you still be able to help another high school student if we keep doing this? 
You have helped me so much this year. I don’t think I would have done so well this year and in general, survived this school year without you. You helped me so much with not only university stuff but everything else and I look(ed) so forward to your messages. To be honest I’m kinda doing a bad job expressing how much your being there for me has helped me this year. You made this school year so much better for me and every piece of advice and encouragement has helped me. 
So if we could keep doing this that would make me very happy.

Hi Mentee,
So I reached out to Juliet Oshiro, the project manager of ReMBC. She told me that for as long as we'd like to continue communicating with each other in our mentorship relationship, we are free to do so on the MentorCity platform! So, ""when does the program end"", exactly? I guess whenever we want it to. LOL. But with that being said, there is absolutely no pressure at all to continue - I already know you'll do so well at UNBC. As opposed to ReMBC's pre-post-secondary approach, we would likely just progress through post-secondary as you experience it, and I would support / mentor you that way. Anyways, I just thought to pass on that info to you as a possibility if you were interested. 🥹💕

Ps. I noticed that some UVic students had their course registration dates recently / coming up in the next few days. Have you registered for your courses yet? Or is UNBC still being whacky? I've also seen posts that some students have already been contacted regarding living on campus (room offers, payments, etc), so that's something to check your email for too!

Hi Mentee,
Well, here we are! The final Discussion on the wheel (well, until I figure out the details of when the program ends LOL). Isn't it wild to see how many Conversations we unlocked, discussed, and completed since last year? You've made so much progress, and I hope throughout this whole mentorship, you've gained even a little crumb of post-secondary knowledge! 
With that being said, anything you've been curious about that we can go over (that we hadn't had the chance to cover in other Conversations)? This is a broad topic, so anything goes!
Have a happy Monday, and an even happier rest of your week. 😊

Hi Mentee,
This conversation personally interested me, as the most memorable comment I’ve received from a past professor was having “grit”. So on this topic of mentors and grit, I’m gonna plug in my own short story below if you were interested in reading (and hopefully are able to pull some value from it):
One evening after class, I asked my professor if he could read over my paper to see if I was on the right track. The feedback was good, and if I were to submit it as it was, it would likely get me a B. A B? Not bad, I thought, but not quite there. That night, I made the changes my professor recommended and then some. Next evening’s class comes and goes, and I stay behind again to ask for a second read through on my paper. He commented something along the lines of that the paper was satisfactory already, and while I agreed, it was me who wasn’t satisfied… And that’s when he mentioned my quality of “grit”. That night, instead of working away at yet another revision of that assignment, I googled “grit”’s definition… And it’s been a word that I hold dear to my character ever since. :) And if you were curious, yes, I got an A on that assignment! 
---
After watching the video, here are my answers to the questions:
What are your experiences with feeling like an outcast?
Similar to you, while I've had unique experiences, I wasn't ostracized by my peers for them. For example, English is my second language, which meant I was taking ESL lessons throughout school. Did getting pulled out of class from time to time to study English make me an outcast? No. On the contrary, classmates would ask if they could come with me to ESL, and I was able to build a strong foundation in the language while making some long-time friends along the way.
How did or do you handle “outcast” feelings?
I think the closest to feeling outcast I've had has been those isolating moments during class where you don’t really know anyone. Though this wasn’t to blame on my peers, but more so was / is the consequence to being shy and introverted. While I’ve improved as I’ve gotten older, I’m still admittedly not the type to spark a conversation first (wow the irony of being a mentor in a conversation-based program LOL). So I guess I didn't / don’t ""handle"" being an outcast, it’s more so I’m trying to work at what causes these feelings so I can stop gatekeeping myself from making friends lol.
What is the relationship between “grit” and “agency”?
Grit is knowing how to do it, knowing you can do it, and doing it until you do it as how you’ve envisioned.
Agency is applying that drive in a direction.
What are some of the skills you already have that can help you move towards your goals?
Independence in knowing that at the end of the day, I'm the only one that can make them happen. Hard work, honesty, and a mindset that always grounds me.
What resources did the students in Anindyu’s stories have access to? Do you have access to similar resources?
They had mentors! And omg when you mentioned I was your mentor and that you had me, my heart just melted LOL! But mentors helped guide those students in directions that improved their lives - Everyone has access to mentors, it's just a matter of finding that fit.
How do you know when to ask for help? What are some of the obstacles we can face when asking for help? How might we overcome these obstacles?
Yikes. LOL. That's a trick question, because I am also guilty of not asking for help, but more so for emotional things. For things I don't know, I generally just ask. Having a heavily detailed answer doesn’t mean much if that answer isn't even in the ball-park of what they’re expecting right? Obstacles that exist when asking for help include: Introversion / shyness, self-consciousness in how one may be perceived asking ""dumb questions"", wanting an applied answer but receiving a ""theory-based"" one, self-expectations for one to be able to “just get it”, etc. We can overcome these obstacles by reframing our question to be more applicable to a wider set of scenarios thus limiting how many questions we ask (i.e. Instead of asking what Avogadro's number is, ask how Avogadro's number can be applied), asking experts and different people (getting a range of answers sometimes helps), researching on our own to fill our gaps in knowledge, and being confident in our own knowledge and expectations.
What are your mentor’s experiences of asking for help? How can their example help you?
While I don't have a mentor for myself (at the moment), I hope you will grow to become more comfortable with asking help academically. Of course I'm always happy to help you as best I can from here, but there are so many qualified, accessible, and willing TAs at UNBC, your professor has office hours and contact info for this reason, there are classrooms open for things like Math Help and Chem Help, and having a good study group will help you get far. Reach out, because you'd be surprised at how many hands are willing to pull you up. :)

Hi Mentee,
LOL you're too funny! I think being in your late teens - early/mid twenties is that transformative time of being able to make selfish decisions, but also having the forgiveness of youth and time, so if we need to backtrack or change our minds, we can do so with little risk to others. You just graduated high school (and I just graduated uni), so pensions and retirement aren't really in our cards yet. However, it's never too early to make meaningful decisions that could influence the course of our lives.
Have you figured out your living situation? Residence or renting? Something that I've been noticing lately on university forums have been students asking about what appliances they can bring into their dorms. If you're going to be living the dorm life, I would look into what is acceptable to have in your room (e.g. mini fridge with a freezer). UNBC actually has this neat list of recommended items that could apply for living either on res or renting: https://www2.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/sections/housing/moveinchecklistwinter2021.pdf. And can I just throw in noise-cancelling headphones? Because I think I use them more as a means to block out noise than to listen to music, honestly LOL. 
And from here, find where your bus loop is, where all of the parking lots you need are (those close to your classes and library), bike racks, however you're choosing to commute to school, find where you'll need to go. Not only will it help you, but it will also help future instances where someone may be picking you up or dropping you off and they've never been to UNBC before. In that latter case though, I would always have a set parking lot where I'd get picked up, as to make it easier for everyone to remember.
Picked up your student card yet? I'm not sure how they may be doing things ever since COVID, but getting your ID and U-Pass (which again, is literally your key to so many things!) set up early can be less stress on future-Mentee. When you pick up your student card, why not practice using it? Here are some things that you could try:
Try loading up your student card somewhere (e.g. cashier in the cafeteria)
Try buying something using your student card
Try printing something off in the library and releasing that print job* 
*It does cost a couple of cents to print, so be sure if you're printing that you have sufficient funds! But you can also cancel the print job if you're just practicing
If you've paid to have access to additional services (e.g. athletics centre), try swiping into the building
And I think I've said some of these things last year, but as a refresher:
Get your sleep schedule fixed if it's not already!
Time management / study management are key
Find your favorite study spot both quiet and loud
Don't worry about buying your textbooks right away - Your professor will tell you on the first day if it's truly mandatory or not. If it is mandatory, go ahead and buy a used one or find one using certain resources (nudge nudge wink wink lolol)
Have a good water bottle (and maybe find some of the water bottle fountains throughout campus)
Familiarize yourself with Gmail/Docs/Drive/Google Calendar/etc.
Introduce yourself and make friends! You're all on the same boat! It's going to be a ride for the next 4 years, so get to know your study buddies, your all-nighter buddies, and be yourself. :)
Similarly, get to know your professors! These are experts in their field, possible mentors for your research, references, and more. Stop by their office hours, ask questions, and put yourself out there as an aspiring scientist. You've got this!
Lastly, I'm sure you know this well already, but as your mentor, I want you to hear it from me: Life happens beyond school. That letter on your transcript, that exam, that test, or quiz is just one instance, one snapshot, of your knowledge on a specific topic from a specific timeframe. Don't let grades dictate your college experience, make the most of this time in your life! At the end of the day, all of us care about Mentee, not Mentee's grades - and that should include you.
I'll be answering the conversation in my next message!

Hello,
I watched the videos and here are my answers to the questions:
What are your experiences with feeling like an outcast? 
I don't like the word outcast, according to google it is a synonym for rejected. Some things have made me different than my peers but I haven't been an outcast/reject. As far as things that have set me apart, my mom died when I was seven (That doesn't mean I was rejected by my peers), people just saw me a little differently and they treated me a little differently. They would avoid mentioning mothers in general and would downplay things like their parents getting divorced because 'I have it worse (that's BS, my philosophy is we can't compare our problems because they all suck no matter what). Let's just say that I was immune to 'your mom' joke as a kid because people would make one of those jokes and I would just say ""My mom's dead""😐 and they would panic and apologize. Again, I haven't been an outcast.
The closest thing would probably be in the computer science-focused electives I've taken. The most amount of women in these classes (from my experience) was 3. I was dismissed more than the guys around me but I proved myself by the end and ended up getting better grades than the guys who dismissed me. 
How did or do you handle “outcast” feelings? 
I don't because I don't have them...
What is the relationship between “grit” and “agency”? 
Grit is an individual trait while the agency can apply to groups of people. Agency can be taught and encouraged.
What are some of the skills you already have that can help you move toward your goals? 
I don't need to rely on other people for motivation, encouragement, etc... I'm quite independent and I'm good at problem-solving.
What resources did the students in Anindyu’s stories have access to? Do you have access to similar resources?  
They had mentors and were mentors. I have you as a mentor. I haven't had the opportunity to mentor but I might end up helping some people from my high school in the future with their Capstone projects. 
Opportunities. There are lots of opportunities out there to improve yourself. I've found lots and I've had many people suggest some to me and help me find them. 
How do you know when to ask for help? What are some of the obstacles we can face when asking for help? How might we overcome these obstacles? 
I suck at asking for help academically. Everything else I can typically ask for help easily but I have trouble with asking for help when I'm struggling in school (it was constantly mentioned by my teachers that I needed to ask for help in school). Sometimes it can feel like you're a failure when you ask for help. I know there is nothing wrong with needing help but sometimes when I feel like something should be easy to learn or understand it makes asking for help hard. And when people act annoyed when you ask for help, or if they make you feel bad for asking for help it makes it more difficult in the future.

Hi Mentee,
Picked this new topic because it sounded like we could be secret agents in the world LOL. Messaging so you've got access!
Something that came to mind as I sent my last message (not related to this Convo though): I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but I think it would be super valuable for you to look at the bulletin boards at school. I believe most students pass by them or passively read them while waiting for their coffee order to be called (I know I did). But I remember seeing paper postings hiring students P/T for on-campus work, and some were for STEM related purposes like labs, research, etc. Sorry that I can't provide more specifics because it's been so long since I was on campus, but always keep your eyes open at those bulletin boards in your Student Union Building, the buildings where you primarily take your science and lab classes, and just generally around campus. You never know if these same positions would be posted in your student job board or where they could lead! 
Alright, have a go at our newest Convo, and I'll see you in our next message exchange. 💕

Hi Mentee,
Now it's my turn to apologize for taking a while to reply! I spent all of last and this week settling into my new career, which has taken a lot more time to adjust to than I anticipated for a remote job. Who would've thought? 😅 But... Surprise! Where I planted myself actually ended up not being with the rural opportunity I was talking so much about. Unfortunately, before I started, I was offered a different position I couldn't refuse - Permanent, F/T, with benefits and a pension. Gosh... Just going back and reading this again... but PENSION???? LOL. It's giving me ✨Retirement energy✨.
As I close my job hunt saga and start this new job chapter, and really, before we hop onto the new conversation (which I'll choose!), I spent this time also thinking about how I could produce some advice for you for when you go off and look for a part-time job, lab position, TA position, or other work commitments during uni:
1. Don't do what I did if you can help it. LOL. 
I mean, rescinding that offer before I even started was essentially severing those potential networks and blacklisting me from that workplace. Looks pretty unprofessional, unreliable, and just not a cute look. Ideally, you want to spend time in a field, taking that opportunity to learn new things, learn about yourself, and building those connections. However, that ties into my next point, being -
2. Do what you feel is best for yourself.
That sounds quite selfish, and really, I did make a selfish decision. However, I knew I made the right choice because it didn't keep me up at night. You'll know what works best for you, so trust your gut feeling! I want you to go forward with the same confidence in knowing your worth, knowing what you want, and knowing that even better opportunities are out there for you! Sometimes opportunities aren't always there when we look, but I want you to be the person who will create the opportunity!

I've been seeing a lot of news of emergency depts closing, call-outs for short staffing like nurses, and just an overall stress in the healthcare industry because resources have just been completely exhausted in these communities. Have you also heard of the lady who put an ad out in the newspaper, looking for a doctor to help renew her husband's prescription, because they haven't been able to find a new GP?

Hello!
Apologies for taking so long to reply but I was just in a rural community, so that fits with the conversation a bit.
I like your question, I have no clue how to answer it. 😁 I think the growth of the online world is helping with the situation. Being able to see doctors over something like Zoom has been helpful to a lot of people. Yet, at the same time, this past week some rural communities were without hospitals and ambulances. It was mentioned amongst the people I was staying with in the Cariboo this past week that the ambulances they have (there are very few) work for a HUGE area. Getting an ambulance can take a very long time and people suffer because of that. I think if young people were more aware of the need for rural doctors, nurses, vets, paramedics, etc... there may be more people being pulled to those jobs. Lots of the people who live in these rural communities are retired so encouraging younger people to move to these places could help. 
I think the city is seen as a glorified place of opportunity for young people (As seen in movies). I think there is a bit of a reputation that rural communities don't offer the opportunities that cities do. That could use a fix.
(I wrote the part above without reading the rest of what you wrote) I think sometimes in the chaos of everything it's easy to forget the rural communities. Sometimes because their populations are so small it's probably easy to prioritize larger populations (ie. It's better to make sure 1 million people have enough access to health care over 1 thousand).
I will absolutely be looking into that type of award. Thank you for doing some research too! What would I do without you?
I am ready to move on to the next topic.

Hi Mentee,
Loved your feedback to the questions!
I agree that it's easier to visualize yourself living in a city-setting when we've both primarily experienced living in one! While there are differences in both settings, there are factors that both draw us to and detract us from each. I, for one, love going back to the Philippines because there are qualities in life there that you just can't get in Canada, primarily with culture, food, and definitely the weather!
As we touched on in this conversation and earlier ones, resources, resource allocation, and retention are significant factors to living in rural areas. Being an aspiring scientist and researcher, how do you feel we can tackle resource/access issues with consideration to the biological, physical and socio-cultural components to living rurally?
Thinking about this question, I thought of how many students move from their small towns to study in bigger cities... And end up staying there for good. My brother actually did a poster presentation on this topic, being his research about youth migration in Japan. His study was about how young adults moving from the countryside to the city and deciding where they'll settle down can create demographic imbalances as populations begin to age. Which begs the question, how do we get students to study but come back to share their knowledge back in their hometowns? A very prevalent example of this is BC trying to incentivize students to study medicine in rural areas, such as UBC's Northern and Rural Pathway for streamlining students interested in practicing medicine outside metropolitan areas, the Rural Physician Retention Program, and more.
Actually I wanted to squeeze this in somewhere, but my brother's research was actually a paid opportunity through an award called the JCURA (I've mentioned this a couple of times!). You're mentored by a supervisor in your faculty during your 3rd or 4th year of full-time studies to conduct original research, and may even present it too! You do have to apply for these or be nominated, but what a combo: Research experience + building a network with your supervisor + presentation experience + $$$! Did a quick Google and saw that UNBC may be offering something similar once you're in those years of undergrad: https://www2.unbc.ca/events/51608/research-project-awards.
Let me know when you want to move onto the next Convo, whatever that one may be!

Hello,
 
Here are my answers to the questions:
What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? 
I agree with what you said about the background music! I also found the beat started to sound like a ticking clock.  It started following how the people lived off the land then moved on to making comparisons between the people living off the land and modern alternatives, then it switched to living in a city. I think the director was trying to communicate that though they are different, there are still some similarities. 
What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? 
I don't think I related to the images. Sure the city can be more intense and rural areas can be more relaxing but that's not exclusively true. 
How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? 
The music made me feel stressed. Was becoming more, and more intense as the video continued. It made the city
In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? 
​​​​​​​I mean I live in a city near Vancouver, and if anything the people are what you should be concerned about. The tall buildings, transportation, etc... just kinda leave you alone, but I've crossed paths with some...interesting people in the city and this video missed that in terms of what's intimidating. I've spent a good amount of time in both settings, and I can see myself living more in the city because of the fast-paced. For me, rural areas have been where I go to chill out a bit. So, the fast-paced city made sense to me.
I like the connection to Mean Girls 😁

Hi Mentee,
Opened up part 2 for us!
And to answer your jeepney concern, I actually asked the same thing to my cousins when I was last there: ""What if someone just pockets your change?"" To which they replied, they would have a hard time to, and culturally, it would be quite embarrassing. While jeepney's are similar to busses, they are a unique form of transportation in the Philippines, where you're actually seated in 2 rows sitting across and facing each other (one row on the left of the jeepney / one row on the right). Not only you, but everyone in the vehicle would watch the person pocket your change... omg. Imagine the audacity and awkwardness one would have to be able to steal the equivalent of bus fare in front of 15 other people?! 😩😭 Like... We're all just trying to get to our destinations here! LOL. 
Onto our conversation!
What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city?
Something quite prominent in the video was this almost ""walk, jog, sprint"" approach in the background music. As the movie begins, the music starts as a repetitive and calm beat, which I felt could draw from a more simplified, nature-approach to living in the country. As the movie progresses, the beat is joined with more vocal accompaniment, complementing the cross from country to city. Lastly, the movie ends with even stronger vocals, yet the beat is still faintly heard, to which I felt the director may have been drawing on how while country living and city living may be perceived as ""two different, detached worlds"", they are never completely detached from one another.
What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film?
As we've touched on in the previous part, while I grew up in Canada, I still have many roots back in the Philippines. In the part of the movie where the family seems to move to the city, I related to that ""shock"" one could receive from going from completely different cultures, climates, environments, etc. Like from my interpretation, the young lady in green seemed to be taking everything in around her as life continued moving with or without her.
How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you?
Hm... I would say the music impacted me more. I felt as though I was going through a movie's climax, with the build up in beat, vocal, volume. 
In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling?
I don't believe I'll be moving anytime soon, however, I believe the film shines light on a very honest, natural response to moving from rural to urban settings. This movie is actually almost 10 years old (2015), and is still relatable.
You know, thinking about my last sentence... Okay, not to compare with Mobilize, but for example, Mean Girls is nearly 20 years old and is still a cult classic. It pulls from stereotypes, memorable quotes, and is part of that coming-of-age genre where everyone can relate to something. I can't believe I'm talking about Mean Girls here but (LOL) what I was going off with this was, despite how much time can pass with a film, the feelings can still be applicable no matter when you watch it.
4 for you, Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco!

Hello,
Thank you for your advice on choosing electives, sadly I don't think I have room for electives until my third year but I'll keep your words of wisdom in mind. :)
The Jeepney sounds cool! I'd be concerned about someone stealing the money but I suppose in a community like that where handing money down a row of customers to the driver is a custom, people would trust each other not to steal.

Hi Mentee,

What an achievement! Not only did you study and graduate during a worldwide pandemic, you graduated with Honours with Great Distinction (what a story to tell in the future, eh?)! That was by no means an easy feat, and you've done exceptionally well! Congratulations again, my mentee! Your photos are soooo cute too, I love them! 😍 
While it can be easy to get caught up in your ""core courses"", I mean, you've applied as a STEM major not English major, there is so much knowledge and value to pull from those ""easier"" courses. Reflecting back on our old discussion on electives, back in university, I chose electives that I felt would not only be academically challenging, but also intellectually fulfilling. When you begin to choose your electives, keep in mind the things you've been interested in, how you may grow from this curiousity, and where that class can lead you! When you think about it, these professors are incredibly educated people who are teaching you in their expertise. You never know what new things you'll learn and be exposed to. (☆ω☆)
Please let your friend know that they're welcome. :) Thanks for letting me mentor through you a bit LOL.
So I've never lived rurally, but thank you for your answers, as you know I'll be working with rural / remote communities in the future! I do however, travel back to the Philippines every 5 years or so, and while our city is by no means small, I believe I could pull some rural community qualities to my answers:
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it.
1. Like you mentioned, community. We have this term in the Philippines called ""Bayanihan"", which can mean uniting together for the betterment of the community. It can be found in even the smallest interractions - When riding one of our local transports called a Jeepney, we hand our payment down to the hands of other customers until it reaches the driver. The driver, in turn, hands back your change, and it goes down the line hand to hand, until it comes back to you.
2. Similarly, nature! Although we're already so fortunate in BC to live surrounded by all this greenery, palm trees are literally in your backyard in the Philippines. There's just something about the fresh air, sunshine, and breeze combo! Nature is also incorporated in some beliefs, for example, the first rainfall of May is said to help heal your body - You may find people just standing in the rain like in those romance movies LOL.
3. Appreciation for different livelihoods. For example, what it means to harvest your food to eat and sell, and seeing the work that is put into businesses so that you may enjoy them. I believe there is more opportunity to be a small business in these areas, and with that, you are able to support these businesses to improve their livelihood and in turn, your own community.
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each.
1. There is so much overlap in our answers! Great minds think alike! But I would say, access to resources as well. While we have these small convenience stalls sporadically around town, to get to our closest grocery store, mall, movie theatre, you definitely have to commute. But luckily, there are markets if you'd be more interested in the fresh catches of the day and picked vegetables versus packaged goods.
2. And agreeing with you again, I do empathize with the efforts of what it means to live so far from these resources. While there is strength in having community, at the end of the day, you will have to figure out how to fix the wiring so your electricity is back up and running, making sure you have a consistent water source, and so forth.
One question you have about living or moving to the city
1. Again, I live in a city no matter if I'm in Canada or the Philippines. But I've always been interested in the more mountainous areas and the surrounding industries, as my family has properties in the mountains where there is a strong coconut harvesting presence. I'd love to go back home and see what they've seen and grown up with in terms of farming!

Hello!
Sorry for taking so long to reply. My last day of school was Friday and I had to work hard until the end. Also, commencement was Sunday at SFU (I'll include a pic). Let's just say those gowns,  33° weather, and no shade made the experience...uncomfortable. Still, I graduation with honours with great distinction. I have no clue what qualified me for that because my average is an A but not a high A, but I'll take the win.

Ok, I've been so focused on my science classes and the stuff that my degree focuses on that I haven't considered how things that I consider easy (such as English) will be and how I should learn from them. So, thank you for reminding me that I have other things besides science courses to think about 😬.
My friend said ""Aw that is so sweet! Tell your mentor I say thank you"". They really appreciate you advice and the little encouragement. 
I like the topic choice of from rural to urban. I guess I should take it and flip it because I think Prince George is more rual than Port Coquitlam. But I do have experience in rural areas.
Here are my answers to the questions (based on my experience with rural communities)
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. 
There is more sense of community: People tend to rely on eachother more. But since there are less people you have a greater opportunity to get to know your neighbors and help eachother out. People are (generally) more friendly in rural communities. They wave when you pass eachother and will quickly stop to help strangers.
They tend to be more connected to nature: from my experience people in rural communities spend more time outside and because they're rural there is more outside to spend time in. 
They're creative: at times, supplies can be limited, take time to arrive, be more expensive, etc... Peopel in rural communities tend to have neat ways of repairing things, decorating, and improving the community. There are kids who cross country ski to school, people who decorate their homes with old stuff they find on hikes, walls built out of pop bottles (they're used as bricks). I even know of a school that had so few students it go shut down (sadly) so the community turned it into a community center/thrift store (and place to donate stufff)/library/bookstore/computer access, etc... It's used for community meatings and a bunch of other things. 
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. 
resources are limited: things can be harder to get and they can cost more. Also, things like doctors, hospitals, dentist, vets, aren't super close. 
It can take a lot of work to live in rural areas: (this doesn't apply to all but many I know) it takes a lot of work to make sure you have enough wood to burn for the winter, they're aren't garbage trucks that comes to you house so you need to drive everything to the dump, eveything is farther, maintaining property throughout the various weather, keeping your property protected from forest fires, etc... People I know who live up there always seem to be working around their property.
One question you have about living or moving to the city 
I live in one so I have no questions.

Hi Mentee,
My 1:1 did go quite well... So much so, that it ended with a job offer! I know it sounds cheesy, but thank you for being a part of my journey! 🥹 I really appreciate your support and patience as I was navigating through that job hunt - I guess it's a bit of a sneak peak into what a future post-graduation will be like 😉. Something that really resonated with me throughout it all was ""growth exists outside of your comfort zone"", and I couldn't help but remember our conversations about challenging ourselves and self-improvement. I'm happy to have been offered a position that I feel will challenge me professionally, yet fulfill me personally, and I wish you the same for when you enter university. Don't be afraid to be curious, take pride in being a trailblazer, and continue on the path that you've set for yourself. I believe in you!
My #1 tip for meeting new people is to open yourself up to situations and environments which enable you to meet new people. Self-confessed shy introvert over here! But what worked for me was talking to my friends online versus face-to-face in the beginning - This helped me grow comfortable, so when we did talk in-person, it wasn't quite as quiet. LOL. 
Again, there will be plenty of opportunities like clubs, living on campus (residence), introducing yourself to your seatmates (in class and in labs), and more. It's also quite the digital age now, so I'm sure you could also have success on certain social media apps! 
I believe it might? I did get an email from the admins of ReMBC, but I hadn't had time to really look it over. I'll review it and we'll see how things go! For now, I'll unlock General Discussion for us and we can go over any odds and ends that we want to but didn't get to throughout the school year.

Hi Mentee,
Oh my goodness... Has it really been nearly a week since our last message? 🥺 I'm so sorry about that! Lots has been happening this past week, and while I kept mentoring in mind, I didn't think it was really a week since our last chat... 😭 OMG LOL. But in return, I'll give you an update on how the job hunt is going: 
So the 1:1 went absolutely splendid. I met the Director of the team I would be joining, who turned out to be an alumnus of my university program! My program is a bit of a smaller one, so finding fellow ""HINFers"" as we call ourselves, helps to build that connection before we even met. Actually, I did get a call today from her to see where my application is at, so I hope to call her back once I'm done work today (ya, currently mentoring on my break bc I didn't wanna wait until I got home hehe). But I ALSO got a reference to apply to a job at nearly the same time, so there's also that??? Times are pretty wild, but always grateful for what comes my way. 🥹
✨ Mentor's Advice Corner ✨ (I love it!)
Random advice for today: If I were to go back in time to 4 years ago, I would have definitely gotten more involved on campus! Not only does it help you network with likeminded peers, but I think it'll help enrich your university experience in its own unique way. There are clubs, research opportunities, career fairs, etc. Once you feel comfortable in your study / life system you've got going for you, try getting to know your classmates (possible study buddies / future group projects / assignment partner), your professors (for future research opportunities, volunteer opportunities, references, guidance with what was went over in class), and academic advisors (when you begin considering future careers and post-graduate studies, they will help you in making sure you're on the right path). Not just getting involved, but just exploring what your school has to offer too! Finding the best snacks on campus, favorite study spots, food that doesn't taste like cardboard... LOL. 
Hm... Us mentors did get a message that our mentees school year's are winding down, and I did want to leave some time in the remaining weeks if you wanted to ask any more questions under the General Discussions Conversation (which I can unlock). How does that sound?

So my weekend was pretty something ngl, so I apologize that it's taken me a couple more days than usual to get back to you! To explain myself (and spill the tea LOL), do you remember the rural job opportunity we talked about a few conversations back? Well, the director actually reached out to me last week to ask for a 1:1 meeting... Like... OMG? What is HAPPENING?! 🥲 I'll be having that 1:1 with her next week, so fingers crossed that this can lead to a new open door!
Oh! And before we move on from the topic of course selection, I thought to mention to you that a ""full course load"" in Canada is typically considered as 5 classes a semester. You might come across scholarships that require you to maintain a certain GPA while managing a full course load, or if you consider professional studies like medical school in the future, it's just something to keep in mind. A ""typical"" academic year will go from September - Apr/May and a full course load is 5 classes, so it'll look something like:
Fall semester: Sept - Dec (5 classes)
Winter semester: Jan - Apr (5 classes)
and your Summer semester can be full of research, co-op work terms, volunteering, traveling, etc as some courses aren't as available during that time/many programs operate on that timeframe. If you have any questions about that, just give me a shout!
Onto the convo:
What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What attitudes do you think he is hoping to change or challenge? Is he successful?
Watching the Tedx Talk, I believe Jeff was trying to help bring attention to Indigenous innovators, their voices, their ideas, and how we could incorporate Indigenous ingenuity with western culture as well.
Are there any inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovation.
The foundations of lacrosse being Indigenous! However, there aren't many sporty bones in my body, so I wasn't all too familiar with the sport in general 😅.
What do you think of Jeff’s intention to use The Seven Teachings to guide his business? How important are these values to how you might like to live your life? Which one seems the most difficult to live by, and why might that be the case?
I really respect his implementation of The Seven Teachings to guide his business. As Jeff mentioned as we move from product to knowledge-based systems, it's inspiring to know that some businesses still value values over dollars (as you mentioned also!). Without having heard of The Seven Teachings prior to this conversation, I suppose I've tried to live my life as well-roundedly as I could. I try to live as true to myself as I can, without compromising my morals or damaging my integrity, even if I have to swim upstream to do so. For myself... Hm... Perhaps wisdom might be difficult? But courage is so hard to muster up at times too! I think in order to gain wisdom, you need the courage to learn the lessons that come by you. So perhaps I struggle a bit with both haha.

Hello,

Thank you for your advice on course registration. This is all very new to ma and my school is useless. I would be lost without you. <3
What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What attitudes do you think he is hoping to change or challenge? Is he successful? 
I think Jeff is trying to teach non-indigenous people about how to incorporate indigenous customes into their lives. Jeff is trying to teach people that there is value to indigenous traditions and that people can benefit by using some of their techniques. 
Are there any inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovation. 
We've been learning about indigenous pepoples for years in school so I'd heard of everything before. No surprises for me. 
What do you think of Jeff’s intention to use The Seven Teachings to guide his business? How important are these values to how you might like to live your life? Which one seems the most difficult to live by, and why might that be the case? 
The Seven Teaching are a good idea. I think it's a nice simple way to keep some key values in mind. I think it's a good way to guide a business because there should be more to companies than just profits. They'd be good to keep in mind. The one that would be most difficult for me? I gotta agree with Jeff, courage is something that I rarely think of. Everything else I am fairly familiar with but courage just doesn't come up often.

Hi Mentee,
That is so odd that the link to Part 2 didn't show up for you! I thought to just reply on this thread instead so maybe it'll auto-direct you. :S Weird! But no sorries needed. :)
Anyways, from my experience, course selection starts in the Summer if you're starting in the Fall... While I don't remember off the top of my head, I think May-July you should receive something from UNBC. CHECK YOUR EMAIL (INCLUDING JUNK/SPAM)! Because typically your school will email you about your SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME you can start registering for courses. This date and time is usually dependent on the year you're going into and how early you declared that you'll be studying in that semester. Don't sweat it if you missed your date / time provided - This is just how early you can register for classes. You can always register after that date / time and even up until classes start, so long as the classes you're registering for have room (or have room on the waitlist). However, I would recommend you register as close to the date / time as possible or better yet, exactly on that date / time. Yes, sometimes the registration time is like 6:30am or something super early. But most of your classmates will have the same date and time, and when that's the case, it's really first come first serve when it comes to classes filling up. The site will be slow because a lot of students will be on there doing the exact same thing as you are, but so long as you're registered and (fingers crossed) not on the waitlist (but that's not too much of a biggie, don't worry if it happens!), that's what matters!

Hi Mentee,
Thank you so so so much for your in-depth insight on what rural community living is really about! As you know, I've been busy preparing for job interviews over the last month - One of the jobs involves travelling via sea plane or boat to help rural medical centres with their health information systems. I thought to myself that this is an incredible opportunity to be more exposed to the beauties and realities of living in B.C., in particular, with the factors like limited resources as you listed. I should know the outcomes of my interviews at the end of the month, so I hope to update you with good news!

Hello,
Tell your friend thank you for the advice! I appreciate it very much.
Rual communities are generally quite welcoming to new people (of course it depends on the individual some people aren't nice to anyone). For the communities being rual there tend to be lots of parties and community events so it's easy to meet people in your area. We have family friends who moved to Pressy lake a few years ago and everyone was very nice. In some of these areas there are people who only live there part time, so there is a good variety of people. For lots of these rual areas neighbors depend on eachother for a variety of things. So people are used to asking others in the community for help. Integrating into a tight-knit community is like integrating anywhere, talk to your neighbors, attend some events, etc... people tend to be more relaxed and friendly away from the city. When you pass people on the roads almost everyone waves. 
Charms of rual communities vary. It depends on where you go. It can be nice knowing your neighbors and lots of the places tend to be surrounded by nature. You see foxes, deer, bears, and more. The sense of community can be great and if you don't like the busyness of a city it's even better. Things tend to be slower too, which you don't really get living in the city. 
Limited resources are a problem. There is a huge demand for physicians and many people resort to returning to the lower mainland for doctor's appointments, dentists, eye doctors, etc... Another issue is that hospitals aren't always near by and if it is something serious chances are you will be air lifted to Vancouver. I know of a family friend who fell head first of his deck a while ago (really bad accident), they got an ambulance (wait time is long), the ambulance took him to the nearest hospital, they didn't have the resources to deal with that injury so he ended up being air lifted to Vancouver. People have a higher chance of dying from treatable accidents and health emergencies because it can take so long for help to arrive and some of the places are hard to find. Some medical conditions make living in rual communities not so accessible, lots of people end up needing to leave their homes as they age. 
Food and gas prices tend to be higher too because the stuff needs to be transported further. You will also need to drive further for those things. Where I live it's a five minute walk to a proper grocery store for some people it can be an hour drive or more. People tend to plan ahead a lot more and will do a big shop once a month or every couple weeks. A lot of the time if your neighbors are going grocery shopping they might ask if you need anything which is nice. People also harvest their own food more. In the summer and fall people go berry picking, mushroom picking, hunting and fishing is an all year round thing. Many freeze or preserve their food to make it last longer. 
Education is also an issue. Often it can take over an hour to get to school for some students. Some parents opt for home schooling while other students will live closer to the school during the week and only come home on long weekends. There was a kid that lived near one of our family friends, he would ski across the lake to where the school bus would pick him up in the winter because the back roads were too icy and not great for driving on. 
There are some places that are more rual than others. Chances are you won't be in the middle of the woods but communities can be easily found (at least from what I've seen). People tend to be brought together by a shared experience. In the BC interior forest fires are a big issue and people are quite united because of them. Neighboors who are staying in evacuated zones will keep the property of the neighboors wet to try and keep their homes from burning. People in not evacuated areas offer up their extra homes/bunk houses for people who are evacuated. It's heart warming to see.

Actually, during this time, I did ask my friend who moved from Duncan to Victoria on their experience with moving for uni, and this is what they said:
Q: ""Do you have any advice for high school students moving cities to attend university?""
A: If you're going to be living off-campus,
Get comfortable with your surroundings. Find your grocery stores, pharmacies, bus/transit routes for campus and for getting around, and their proximity from where you live. 
Secure your essentials like toilet paper first (LOL). Once you're more adjusted, you can begin incorporating things that will help you settle in better. But having food, necessities, and knowing how to get to school are the big three.
Get organized, but don't stress. One step at a time. If you use a planner, this could help with making sure you get everything you need to done.
A: If you're going to be living on res (residence/on-campus),
Get to know your neighbours / classmates.
Join clubs if you're into that.
Set up study groups (ideally with people that will help you successfully study)
Q: ""Do you have any tips on finding a landlord and roomies?""
A: Looking for places to stay can be hard. Checking Facebook group postings on rent/roomies, Craigslist, Kijiji, etc. Friends or family that can room with you could be fun.
Q: ""How would you recommend staying budget-conscious as a student?""
A: Give yourself a rough approximation on budgets for food, essentials, transit, and use the leftovers to treat yourself to some outings, coffees, etc. Be mindful of the budgets you set for yourself, and keep tabs each month on how much you went under/over and adjust where you need to.
Q: ""Any other advice you could pass on?""
A: Check out academic advising, undergraduate or student union buildings, and learn about their help resources early on. I like to go on campus before the first week of classes to find where all of my classes are and in what buildings. Get to know the campus a little before it goes into a flash mob mode. Find good study spots!
- - -
And there you have it! I can't stress how valuable the last bit of advice is, because I have literally called and messaged my friends because I got lost in a building trying to find my class LOL. But students are quite a friendly bunch - I've had an engineering student walk up to me and ask if they could help me find my building, and then they accompanied me because their class was there too. This came back around when I was in my 3rd year, with a student coming up to me and asking if I knew where their class's building was. In the end, having a tour of the campus will be good for you! If UNBC has freshman tours before classes, I think it'd be worthwhile to sign up and see how beautiful your campus is. :)
Thank you for your insight on rural communities too! I don't get off the island enough so I definitely had to Google where Port Coquitlam is but WOW I think you're closer to Vancouver than I am LOL. I love it! I guess I'd love to know how they take to newcomers moving in, as I've heard from other mentees that they know everyone who lives in their community. How do you integrate into a tight-knit community like that? What are the charms of rural community living? How do they manage with limited resources (e.g. physician shortage)? :) 
Have an awesome rest of your Spring Break! I'm so happy your dad's ex recommended our program to you, and that they paired you with me TT v TT.

Hi,
Ok, I know I replied to you eight days ago but I guess it didn't send. (I really love my school's wifi)
If you happen to hear any advice about moving away for university, it would be most welcome!
I've been okay, it's spring break (fianaly)!
So funny story... I don't live in a rual community. ヽ(´ー｀)┌ This mentoring program was suguested to me by my dad's ex and it seemed cool. I live in Port Coquitlam which is about a 40 minute drive from Vancouver (not supper rual). But, I'm not completely lacking in the rual community knowledge. My time is bassically divided between lovely Port Coquitlam (when I have work and school), the Cariboo, and the Sunshine Coast. We have lots of family friends who live in rual communites and I do spend a lot of my time with them. I can probably tell you most of what you want to know about life in a rual community from my experiences and stories I've been told. Something that might be worth checking out would be Facebook groups for rual regions. Rual communities survive off neighbours helping eachother so they share a lot on these Facebook groups. Try ""South Green Lake Community Group"" and ""Pressy Lake Strong"" (The whole area got burned by forest fires in 2017 and countless people lost their homes, hence the strong part), look for big lakes and smaller regions then their Facebook groups. As you probably know, older people post EVERYTHING!
If you have any specific questions about living in a rual community I can probably help you out.

Hello,
Congrats on the interviews! I hope they all give you job offers!
I think I've decided to go to UNBC in the fall, so that involves moving away from home. Now the majority of my thoughts are about how I'm gonna manage, what I'm gonna need and everyone and everything I'm going to miss. I think the change will be good though. It won't be easy but it will push me out of my comfort zone and no matter what happens I'll grow as a person. 
Thank you for the finding inspiration advice. It does help to look to others for inspiration and I should appreciate how far I've come more than I do.

Hi Mentee,
While our experiencees are unique, I think we're sharing the mutual emotions of uncertainty / slump-ness (most defs not a word LOL) at the moment! But we're reaching our breakthroughs, I just know it.
Like you mentioned in one of our earlier messages in this conversation: Sometimes, we need to get out of our comfort zones and take the chance. The structure of school as you've known it for the last 12 years will definitely change come this Fall... and it's going to be different each semester for the next 4+ years. I think coming in as a freshman, you really can't fully prepare for what's to come - With added freedom comes added responsibility. You're going to be in charge of your own learning for the first time and that's a big deal. But you've taken and are still taking the steps you need to put your best efforts forward. The first semester will be a learning curve, but you must've felt that way with something new, whether it's a new skill to learn, or a new concept in class. But you learn, adapt, and grow. No matter where you end up in September, you'll be surrounded by so much intelligent people and so many new opportunities. I know and you know that you've got what it takes to not only maintain, but to reach even higher standards of success and learning. Take it step by step and enjoy the journey, even if you're not sure of where you're headed!
Just as a note for the next couple of weeks: Right now, I'm in the middle of applying for and interviewing for new jobs, so that's been keeping me very on edge and busy - I apologize in advance if my responses take a bit longer than usual during this time!
Question: Where do I pull inspiration from, especially when nothing seems inspiring?
Answer: I genuinely look to the people that inspire me the most, and my own experiences. For example, seeing the efforts of strangers on the internet is something, but if you personally resonate with them and their story, you'll gain something more than someone else. But say you personally know that person, and this puts you in a position of truly knowing their story and why their success is extra meaningful. Additionally, although I like to plan and plan and plaaaaaaaaaan for the future, sometimes, we need to look back and see how far we've come. While we always move the goal post further, it's valuable to acknowledge our own efforts and achievements too. When I went through a rough first semester of university, I thought back to how hard I worked in high school, and how this wasn't the reflection of ""me"" that I wanted for myself. That time really inspired me to get my grades back up and go for what I knew I could achieve. I hope these words helped you out!

Hello,
It's nice to see that we had someone similar ideas about the quality of the video. XD
I have mixed feelings about the last few months of high school. I want to be done with my school, I'm honestly getting bored. At least my schedule is easy so I'm focusing a lot on scholarships...and trying to recover from last semester's burnout which may have been what put me into this slump. I am happy to say I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm getting close to being out of my slump (I hope). Even though I want to be done with school I'm also a little scared because there is so much uncertainty. I still don't know where I'll be in the fall but I do know I will be going to university. School has been a safety net for the past 12 years. I've been able to rely on it always being there, no matter what happened in life I would still be going to school in the fall. That's kinda gone now. At least it looks like I'll be having a proper grad! 
Question: Where do you get your inspiration? Especially where nothing is inspiring you. I need something other than Pinterest.

Hi Mentee,
I've also been in a slump myself (＞﹏＜). But I found working bit by bit, day by day, to change factors that contribute to the slump can help melt the layers that built the slump snowball in the first place. Whether it's making big strides or baby steps of change, as long as we're moving forward, getting up, and trying again. •́‿•̀｡
Also, keep that mindset of yours! Back in university, my friends would recommend me ""easy A"" / ""GPA boosting"" electives that, while nice for the grades, wouldn't be satisfying for my own learning. I opted to take courses in health research and ethics, which ended up being some of the classes that inspired me the most. Keep being purposeful with your choices, and know what you want for your own future!
With that being said...
Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words
What I interpreted from the video was that different scenarios, backgrounds, and experiences will influence how one will come up with their idea. While some may want genuiness in the form of related experiences, others will pull ideas from beyond that.
Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea
Ngl... The video was quite dry and the background music did not help LOL. But I thought that we could tie the theme of intention and spontaneity together when forming creative thoughts. While you can begin with the intention to plan, sometimes it's impossible to know further ahead than that. That's where a quote like Lea Pool's comes in: ""Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life.""
Questions you might have about the idea(s)
Tbh, none really. (._.)
How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future
It's really about knowing yourself, your situation, and how far you're willing to go to make that connection.
Thanks for asking about Atomic Habits! Truthfully, I haven't gotten too far in the past couple of weeks due to February being a jam packed month. But I'll definitely pass along my favorite / useful quotes to you when I come across them! <3 How about you? How are you feeling about these last few months of being in high school?

Hello,
I am in a little slump so this is a good topic for right now. :)
This is not what I was expecting for this topic. I watched the video about the creative process, interestingly enough we just finished focusing on the creative process in my creative writing class. (I only took the class because I needed to change my schedule and when my counsellor suggested it, I was scared she would suggest drawing or sculpting which isn't what I want to do).
To answer the questions:
Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words
Everyone will have their impressions of creative and non-creative works and our pasts will influence how we see the world and the creative stuff that comes with it.
Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea
I got a little bored. It didn't make me feel anything. '_'
How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future
Right now I want to go into science. I know there's a strong aspect of creativity in science. 
I didn’t notice the quotes until after I attempted to answer the questions. I would like to comment on Denys, I think you should also take chances and look at other experiences and leave your comfort zone sometimes.
Anyways, how is Atomic Habits going? Any good tips?

Hi Mentee,
I love that attitude! ... Probably because I share the same characteristic. LOL.
At the moment, I'm most inspired by ambition and motivated by my past. I mentioned this in my profile, but I went through a time of study defeat and redemption after a significant life event. I really lost my way when it came to academics, which reflected on my grades. But then I thought about if this was the type of student I wanted to be, if I was giving it my all... And then a switch got flipped. Got up and got those grades higher. I aimed for my best and for my own standard of excellence. Now I'm thinking of my next steps, which is where the ambition comes in! While I want to think practical, I'm also dreaming big... What are the steps I need to take in order to make leaps?
My brother also told me that we'll all be 40 eventually. Might as well be 40 and had given your dreams and goals your best shot!

Finding inspiration 👍
My future inspires me, thinking about everything I want in life is what keeps me going. I am also very motivated through spite, when people tell me that I can't do something, that I shouldn't do something, I want to prove them wrong and do it anyway. When I don't get up in the morning I think of everything I've put into what I have and everything I still need to do for what I want.

Before we get started on this new topic, I just wanted to give you suchhhhhhhh a big hug and high five on completing your Capstone Project! (つ≧▽≦)つ Reading your Capstone Project paper, your hard work and effort really shined through, and I couldn't be more proud of the work you've put in. Thinking back to when you first started MentorCity, you would mention your Capstone throughout our conversations, the research and hours that you were pouring into it, finding people to contact, and I just knew your efforts would pay off. You deserve that 100% and I hope you did a little happy dance getting that grade back, because the entire time reading I was like, ""OKAY THERE, MENTEE. YAS, TELL ME MORE ABOUT CRISPR AND EBOLA."" (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ I felt the education running through my veins- LOL. Alright, now that your mentor is done gushing about how proud she is of you, we can look into this new topic that we just unlocked (lolol).
So... Finding Inspiration. Before reviewing the contents of this conversation, I wanted to start by asking ourselves, ""From where do we derive our inspiration from""? So, Mentee, what inspires you to pursue what you do, and where do you find those ""sparks"" of inspiration in your day-to-day?

I thought I replied but I guess not. 🤷‍♀️
I doubt they would stop an entire grad year from getting their dual dogwoods, there are other requirements (a certain number of French classes for example). It's not in our control and we might still do them it's just because of staffing shortages. 
 
I don't see the Finding Inspiration option yet.
 
I completed my Capstone and presented it Tuesday, I got 100%!!! It's worth 50% of my grade for the class and I worked so hard. I'll attach the link to the research paper I wrote.

Hi Mentee,
Welcome back! I had a feeling you had a lot going on in terms of school (and let's be real, everything else LOL), but I just knew we'd get back into mentoring when we got to it. Honestly though, what is in the 2022 air recently? The days feel extra long even when packed with so many things to do. I hope you're managing it all well, which I know you are! :D
Hm... I just checked the gov's website and that's a tricky one. Is there anything your school could arrange for students wanting to graduate with dual Dogwoods for the 2021/2022 school year? Maybe getting a dual Dogwood post-graduation could be a possibility? But I guess with the cancellation of all provincial assessments, it's more so a waiting game to see when they'd resume them... Whatever the case may be, fingers-crossed that they resume soon so you can get that on your graduation!
Speaking of graduation, congratulations on your DELF B2 score! Having another language you can speak and operate confidently with is such an asset and is just so neat to have. I know there are some university professional programs that offer seats exclusively for their French-speaking streams (off the top of my head, UOttawa's MD Program), and certain government positions you can only qualify for as a bilingual candidate - These are just more doors open for you in the future!
Finding Inspiration coming right up! (Sorry if this convo is a bit on the shorter side, just gotta get ready for work! Lol! Will get more into it for our next one. ^__^)

Hello,
I just realized that it's been 8 days since you sent that last message. Finals weeks is so much fun 🥲! Anyways, hectic two weeks since returning to school and I am grateful that I don't need to go back to school until next Tuesday...I still have work to do though for my Capstone and chemistry. My French Immersion Literacy 12 Assessment was supposed to be today but the government cancelled all the provincial assessments until further notice, considering I need to pass the French Literacy to get my dual Dogwood, I am not sure how that's going to work. Though on a postive note, I got my DELF B2 exam marks back and I passed (one of the top students in my class!), so now I am officially considered bilingual on an international level. (Just means I can study and work in a french speaking country) 
Firstly, maps on the inside of books are great, especially when they're super detailed. 🗺 I've seen Eragon before,I haven't read it though. Is it any good?
""be 1% better every day"" is a quote I'm fairly sure I have heard before. I aim to be better than the day before and if I'm feeling down I try and figure out how I can be better than the day before and it's not that difficult to do. There is no way you can be 100% better overnight but after a few months of improving 1% every day, 100% better than when you started seems much more attainable. Good things take time. 
I can't think of anything else as far as the paying for school topic for now. What about Finding Inspiration next?

Hi Mentee,
Not me reading a book on building good habits and posting this at 2AM...🤦‍♀️ (Testing these copy and paste text emojis too! Yours work!).
Okay, that's what I was also thinking. Thanks for the encouragement! I'll give reading two books at the same time a shot this week, with my combo likely being Eragon for fiction and Atomic Habits for self-help. I bought the Eragon series back in the Summer time as it was my best friend's favorite series growing up and I was intrigued as to why that was. I'm also a sucker for books that have maps of the land on the inside. x) As for Atomic Habits, I've only read maybe a fourth of the way, but so far so good. I haven't actually gotten to the ""building habits"" part yet, so I can't attest to the hype, but I definitely recognize some of these quotes as posts I've seen on social media. What I've kept in mind from what I've read so far though is ""be 1% better everyday"" - Without having read the book, what do you take from that quote? Do you apply similar methodologies to your own life?
Omg it sounds like we have a mini book club in our convos! So cute! LOL. (´꒳`)♡ Speaking of convos, was there anything else you'd like to talk about in the topic of Paying for School? Wanna complete it and open another?

Hello,
I made note of this conversation and I hope to refer back to it in a few months once I am starting my post-secondary education.
Reading multiple books at once is something I highly recommend! I am usually reading at least two books at the same time. I like to have non-fiction and fiction but sometimes if the fiction is dragging I will read a book I know I can get through super fast, I'll even have an audiobook going at times if I know I will be doing something where I can listen. At the moment I am reading Astrophysics For People In A Hurry by Neil DeGrasse Tyson (non-fiction) and Girl, Serpent, Thorn by Melissa Bashardoust (Fantasy). It's great because you feel like different types of books at different times and sometimes I want to learn, other times I want to escape life, having multiple books going means there is always something I can be reading which makes it easier to read more. 
People tend to question why would I read multiple books at once, saying I will get mixed up but if you think about it, it's kinda difficult to get mixed up between a fantasy novel and a non-fiction book about the creating of the universe. 
Is Atomic Habits good? I keep hearing about it, is it worth the hype? ~(˘▾˘~)

Hi Mentee,
Totally agree! I tried to get into research a bit too late in my degree and it unfortunately didn't work out. But, that's why I'm here - To help pass on what I learned from my experiences to help make yours even more stellar (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ ｡･:*:･ﾟ’☆. To branch off the advice you were given, I'll give you the advice that my research professor told me: You should have interest in the research you're doing. I know that sounds really simple and well, obvious, but interest will help you keep pushing through the more mundane parts of research.
What I personally learned in my short-span of research was:
While finding a professor who is actively researching, also look into their work. What fields of research do they specialize in? Is that something that would align with your interests? Keeping in mind that some professors may have past published work that isn't reflective of their current research today. And as you mentioned, even if their research isn't directly related to your studies, this could be a great opportunity to learn a different specialization / field of STEM you weren't exposed to before.
When you meet up with that professor, have an idea of the kinds of research you're interested in, the skills you can offer, and more. Just like a job interview, you should be prepared to answer their questions too!
Some professors might not have any positions available, some may lose their funding, and some might not even get back to you - and that's more than alright! It's still worth it to get your name and interest out there, because they'll be able to keep you in mind for future opportunities.  
Personal example 1: When I talked to a professor, while he wasn't researching at that moment, he was willing to network me with a doctor he knew who was.
Personal example 2: A professor emailed me months later about an upcoming grant they had, which also meant funding for a research student!
Looking back, while it was unfortunate that the pandemic affected this opportunity, it's neat how I can still somehow pass my knowledge onto someone (my mentee)!
I've been recently reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, and had a thought to start one of the books you recommend at the same time. Have you had success reading multiple books at once? Or just finish them one at a time?

Hello,
Research and even working in a science lab seems like a really go idea. For my Capstone project I talked to a few professor's about their research, as well as some grad students and the general two peices of advice I got were to network with professors and other people working in labs and to get working in science as soon as possible even if it's not directly related to your studies.

Hi Mentee,
ASDFGHJKL I am SCREAMING. As your post-secondary mentor trying to set an example, I can't say I encourage illegal content, and I can't say that I may or may not know of that site or similar ones on this platform. But... being a post-secondary graduate, and with you being an incoming post-secondary student, I think we have an unspoken, mutual understanding LOLLLL (☞°ヮ°)☞ ☜(°ヮ°☜).
Truthfully, I think I've given you all of the limited tips that I do have for scholarships, so I did a bit of exploring inside and outside of the box:
Inside the Box:
https://mentorcity.com/en/mentoring_resources/1845
These were the scholarship sources found under the Resources section of the ReMBC platform. Let me know if you can't access it / if there are any scholarship sources that you wanted to look at together!
Outside of the Box:
https://students.ubc.ca/career/ubc-experiences/nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards
https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/students/student-awards/jcura/index.php
I was thinking, especially with the direction of your studies, that you would get a lot of value out of conducting research during your undergraduate degree. Funding and payments for these opportunities could be found via grants, awards like NSERCs and the JCURA, as well as networking through your faculty / labs / professors. You have to apply for these awards and meet the mininum criteria (usually high academic standing), but although they're not explicitly stated to be scholarships, successful applicants do get financial payment in some form. I've also heard of students publishing their work in an academic research paper as a first, second, etc. author, which is such a cool opportunity as an undergrad! If you plan to do grad studies, apply to professional programs (like med school), or would like to contribute to research, I'd highly encourage you to check opportunities like these out at your chosen school(s) to see what they're about. ⁽⁽◝( • ω • )◜⁾⁾
Hm... On that note, I think you could also look into some on-campus work-study opportunities, like a professor needing a lab assistant. Or posting on your school's job board that you're available for tutoring for certain classes and for your chosen rates. Just thinking of some side hustles that I saw while I was a student! 
I'll think of some more money-saving and lifestyle tips throughout the week as we message! Have an awesome rest of your week!

Hi,
I know a website, you may know it too, https://z-lib.org/ it has digital versions of every book for free. Is it legal? Probably not, but it saves money. I have found my school textbooks that they give us in class on it simply because I also didn't want to carry mine around. It's also good for novels and reading for pleasure if you don't want to spend money on a certain book. 
(From my understanding it is illegal to upload pirated content but it is legal to download it.)

I'm finding it hard to find scholarships in the first place and sometimes it feels pointless to apply to some of them.

Hi Mentee,
Not the both of us being Friend 4's... (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞. Getting asked about plans 4 months in advance and we're still booked and busy?! I mean *shrug*. WE GOTTA DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO LOL. 
So I've moved onto page 2 of Paying for School, and it seems like this is what we were looking for on page 1! Looks to have a lot of scholarship, bursary, grant, and loan information that we can go through together, and even some money saving tips for post-secondary. Which reminds me about their point 2, Textbooks and Materials: 
I'd encourage you to try not to buy your textbooks ahead of time, or at least wait until your first day to see if you really need them (though most STEM classes I've needed my textbooks). I used to buy my textbooks as soon as the list came out, trying to beat the rush and get ahead with my coursework and readings. But come first day, the professor is going over the syllabus and drops, ""Everything testable will be on my slides, the textbook is just for optional, additional readings"". I wish I knew that during my first year before I was lugging my body weight in books! I also opted for digital versions of my textbooks if available, but always bought used texts if I could (seriously, the used ones go so quickly because they're typically in such good shape!). Lockers do exist on campus, but I found they'd be so far out of the way from my buildings, that it'd be much more convenient to just carry everything in my backpack like a turtle. 
It's probably too early to see Fall 2022's textbook list, but if you wanted to see Spring 2022's list and get a feel for looking up what books/materials you'll need in the Fall, you can try clicking through SFU's Bookstore.
You'll first select which campus you'll be attending, then the courses you'll be taking the first semester. Say, Chem 110, Math 100, Phys 101. Once you've got all your classes in, you'll then be able to see what new and used materials are available in the bookstore! And note: Some classes don't have a textbook, so that's why it might be blank. This process should be the same if you wanted to explore UBC's Bookstore as well as your other schools of choice.
Happy weekend!

Hi,
That meme is very relatable :). Now that everyone has clubs, jobs, classes outside the timetable, homework/studying, sports and more it is so hard to find a time where all my friends can be together. We've been so busy this year that we've gone weeks without eating lunch together at school, which seems like the easiest time to meet up but I don't think there is the easiest time anymore. I've been friend 4 too, my friends learned that if they wanted me to attend something I need at least 2-3 weeks notice and even that wasn't always enough.

Thank you SO much for your recommendations! (*＾ω＾)人(＾ω＾*) Omg, The Night Circus cover art caught my eye already... And the ratings are so promising (´♡‿♡`). I'll be taking your list with me when I next go to the used bookstore, so I can't wait to pick some of these up! 
I really love how you phrased the goal: ""Honoring commitments and promises to myself"". You're so right - Why is it that we uphold our end of pinky swears for others, but when making pinky swears to ourselves, we're more easy to let those slide? Not on our watch for 2022! And yes, please make time for friends and family regularly! They will help you recharge in ways that only they can do.
There's this meme of making plans as an adult that goes something like:
Group: Let's catch up! When are you all free?
Friend 1: Yay! I'm free on Fridays!
Friend 2: I can only meet up on weekends
Friend 3: I'm free on Mondays - Wednesdays only
Friend 3: I can meet on the next full moon
Friend 4: I'm free in 2023

I was literally Friend 4 at one point LOL. I was booking hangouts like a month in advance... it was so sad and not cute!!! So yeah, if you've got a free afternoon, take advantage of it!
I'll see you on the next page of Paying for School!

Hi,
Book recs! I've got so many, I am just going to list all the books I gave 5 stars to in 2021 to keep the list short.
The Hill We Climb - Amanda Gorman (it's the book version of her Inaugural Poem)
The House in the Cerulean Sea - T.J. Klune (Adult fantasy+Found family+good plot+good characters+ Queer representation+good ending)
When God was a Rabbit - Sarah Winman
The Sun and Her Flowers / Milk and Honey - Rupi Kaur (as a woman I related to a lot of this)
Peace and Good Order: The Case for Indigenous Justice in Canada - Harold R. Johnson (I read it in 2019 and I read it again this year because of how relevant it is)
The Book of Two Ways - Jodi Picoult 
The Night Circus - Erin Morgenstern (One of my favourite books, to describe this book in one word it would be ✿magical ✿) 
Night - Elie Wiesel (short, about his experience in the Nazi concentration camps)
The Midnight Library - Matt Haig (It's supper popular but I liked the concept and way the story was told)
5 stars for me means best or the best, to think I only gave 9/86 books 5 starts this year... shows the high standard I suppose. 
I like the idea of being more committed! I try to be in a continuous state of improving myself and moving forward while also going easy on myself. I'm starting to realize that something as small as watching an episode of a series can have positive benefits for me, and it's okay to binge watch an entire series in a day every once in a while if I need a break from life. 
My (very rough) goals for 2022:
Do something (ex. Coffee, walk, dinner) with at least one friend and family member each month.
Take a propper break daily (even if it's only 15 minutes)
Honour my comittments and promisses to myself. I'm good at keeping them with other people but not myself. 
Lastly, trying to be more productive and doing more ahead of time. (We shall se how that goes ┐('～`)┌) 
I'm ready to move onto the second part of paying for school!

Hi Mentee,
86 books?! That's amazing! Could you recommend me some of your favorites? I used to read quite a bit when I was younger, but as bigger responsibilities began taking more and more time, books were sadly pushed further and further down my priority list. I did *try* getting back into reading last year as a means to ""unplug"" from electronics (literally read 1 book LOL), but you made a great point of maturing with your reading. I'll have to check out books that are more aligned with my interests now that I'm older. ( o˘◡˘o) ┌iii┐
I totally feel the same! Someone asked me how my 2022 was going... And I just responded with, ""It feels like 2021 but in January"" LOL. I usually give myself a to-do list everyday and that'll carry through throughout the week, but having January 1st as a starting point doesn't feel all too different than having January 3rd, March 4th, etc. But giving it a thought, I told myself I wanted to be more committed this year. Committed to even minute changes that help improve the Mentor now and tomorrow. It's not a firm resolution like ""give up junk food!"" (as if I could give up french fries!!!), but I'd love to meet my goals through conscious efforts of discipline and a commitment to be better.
Let me know what your 2022 goals are when you've got them! And when you want to move onto the second part of Paying for School, let me know that too!

HAPPY NEW YEAR! ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
Winter break is extended because of COVID, we're supposed to be going back on the 10th but they might make us go online (・へ・).
Mentor's Advice Corner (I like it!), good advice! It got me thinking about what I used to do for pastimes that I don't do anymore. I've been consistent with lots of mine, reading is one of the bigger ones (I read 86 books in 2021). I noticed lots of my pastimes, like reading, have been maturing with me which is interesting. I think the only big pastime I had when I was younger that I don't do anymore is art. I used to draw and paint all the time now I find I need to be encouraged to do it. I'll do the odd artistic thing but nothing as elaborate or time consuming as I used to. 
As far as new year's resolutions... elementary and middle school kinda wreaked them for me, we would always spend so much time on them and I never really saw the point. Personally I noticed that I never really feel a big change between December 31st and January 1st, which makes it hard to find goals and resolutions to start the year off with. I try and set new goals all the time, so I haven't been able to think up anything, I've tried though! Of course, I want to do better than the year before but I know that in September lots is going to change and I am trying to be as realistic as possible. What are your resolutions? I should spend some time thinking about what I want from 2022 during my extended winter break. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Also, I don't know where you've been getting the emojis from (I still don't get why mentorcity got rid of them) but I've just been copying them from a Wikipedia page but some of them are so elaborate! This is one is someone flipping a table -> (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ I wonder who came up with that?

Hi Mentee,
OMG... Not me thinking that Google's ""Year in Search"" was a yearly recap of everything I've Googled over the year... I was about to cringe until 2022. LOL. But I've actually never seen these videos before, so this was so neat! Thanks for sharing! When I come across something not so meme-y and more inspire-y, I'll send it along your way ٩(๑･ิᴗ･ิ)۶٩(･ิᴗ･ิ๑)۶.
Extended winter break because of all the snow we've been having? Because what the h e c k a r o o is going on like weather pls... T__T. But also with all these illnesses going around, please be safe! We'll make it through this!
Yeah! I'm not sure about other schools so you'll have to check their FAQs, but I used my student card for everything. Loading your card with money and spending it that way offered discounts when buying food, textbooks, etc. I totally recommend it if you're going to be buying a muffin on campus anyway, might as well save $ where you can. And nice, there's nothing like a sprinkle of worry to top off an already stressful time (ノ°∀°)ノ⌒･*:.｡. .｡.:*･゜ﾟ･*☆. But seriously! Trust in yourself more! You know what you're doing, you know the direction you're going, and while you may make mistakes and life will throw some spicy days at you, you've gotten up stronger each and every time.
I guess we can use that as a segway to Mentor's Advice Corner! 乁( • ω •乁) Hm... Something that I've been thinking about recently is how we're at this prime age of discovering who we are and learning more about the world. So while we give love to the planet in the ways we already do, we shouldn't forget to give love to ourselves. This naturally comes in the forms of self-care (physical, emotional), but it's also present in trying new hobbies, re-visiting old pastimes, and my personal favorite, really going for our goals and dreams. So, let's ring 2022 with the mindset that while there are only a finite number of choices we can make every moment, we've still got unlimited possibilities everyday! 
Any new years resolutions for you, my mentee? I've got 24 hours to come up with mine still! Lol!

Hi,
Happy holiday season to you too! At this point it look like I'm getting an extended winter break which has its pros and cons. ;-;
Thank you for you tips regarding paying for school and saving money. I didn't know that your student ID card does so much. They really don't tell you how much you need to be considering in your grade 12 year... even for post secondary school wether moving away or staying home I've started having these moments where when I'm doing something I think about how it might be affected next school year. Fun times ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
So, almost the New Year! Do you have any random advice I can start 2022 with? ヽ(^o^)丿

Hi Mentee,
Wishing you, your family, and friends a happy holiday season! Hope you get some time to relax and the opportunity to do the things you love during your Winter break (besides the ever present Capstone project). ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆
So, paying for school. I totally had the same mindset as you when I first started post-secondary: Avoid student loans at all costs (if I could help it)! Ideally, you'd want to hit the ground running upon graduating... Not struggling to stay afloat after being buried in student debt. I paid my way through school completely on my own and that's something I've been very proud of. I hope by sharing my experiences that you'll get inspiration on how to do so too! I'd be happy to share with you how I did it on the caveat that our experiences will be different. You can get an idea of how I was able to fund my education, and see how you could fit the structures that apply to you for your own schooling. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) Now, onto...
""How did you pay for school?""
I took a gap year. I worked nearly full-time / studied part-time after graduating high school and while I was in my University Transfer program at college. This was done because at the time, my mother was quite ill, we had lost a stream of income, and I helped care for her after class. While I used part of my income for household bills, I saved everything else for future full-time studies.
After transferring to university, I switched to full-time studies / part-time work. I would work at my local grocery store on the weekends to earn tuition money!
I did this for 2 years, until the Summer of my 2nd year at uni, where I went on my first paid co-op work term. I would do this every other semester as per our program's model, but typically, you'd find Summers are the best time to work (usually no classes). I earned enough at the end of each work term (3-4 months) to finance my next semester of study. 
Co-ops can be a minimum of 12 weeks to a year, depending on the position. Not to be confused with unpaid internships, co-op positions are paid work placements where students can get experience with real employers! Yes, you can even work for your uni (I did hahaha)!
Schools typically post co-op positions, student work/study positions, on-campus positions, etc. on their job board. Students can also find positions themselves and work with their co-op coordinators to see how it fits in their curriculum. Just like ""real"" jobs, some of these positions will be looking for students from certain fields of study (e.g. Lab assistant / research assistant postings may be looking for STEM majors with lab experience). Find what you're interested in, see if you can realistically incorporate it into your schedule (without jeopardizing your studies), and build meaningful networks while also feeding your bank account!
I had a bit of money from scholarships (i.e. BC Passport to Education) and winning an award from university. Although my winnings were modest, it was still appreciated. Think about it, you're getting paid because you're doing well in school! How neat because you were gonna do well anyway. 8)
""Scholarship application tips?""
Similar to what was mentioned in the articles, you should try to shoot your shot to the scholarships that you qualify for. Although I didn't apply to scholarships I didn't qualify for (and frankly, didn't apply to as many as I should have), I'm not sure if I could recommend it. The worst outcome is you not getting chosen, but the best outcome is winning it! Where's the loss in that? :)
You also have the right idea to apply to your local/personalized scholarships from your school. Look into grants and other funding that you don't have to pay back!
Just did a quick Google (literally ""bc scholarships"" LOL) but maybe exploring pages like these and seeing if you qualify? BC Excellence Scholarship.
As we talked about before too, some scholarships you don't even have to apply for, as your school will notify you if you've gotten one! Typically these are renewable so long as you maintain a minimum grade point average per semester (For example, my friend had to maintain a 3.7+ / 4.0 for her scholarship).
""Do you have any money-saving tips for University / College?""
I lived at home. I know this may not be possible or applicable for every student's case, but this was the most substantial way I've saved money, as the money that would've otherwise gone to rent, went into tuition. 
I did not use private transport. As mentioned in our Post-Secondary Considerations chat, bus passes were incorporated into our tuition payments. While I could have used a car and paid for parking, I thought to make the most out of what I was already paying for and commute to school via transit everyday.
I tried to pack my own food. Emphasis on tried. Campus food is expensive. I repeat: Campus food is expensive! LOL. No, you won't go broke getting a $5 coffee everyday, but it does add up. You can probably pack more nutritious, cheaper in the long run meals, but do keep your account topped up in case you get hungry in between study sessions (by account I mean your school ID card, which also serves as your bus pass, school ID, library card, form of payment, etc). 
I personally wish I did this, but I found out my friend was working part-time on campus in a computer lab. He was a computer science major, which made this experience applicable to his field of study. But during times when the labs were quiet, he was able to work on his homework, assignments, labs, etc. Literally getting paid experience that's relevant to his degree while being able to study at the same time! Triple KO! 
Your SFU essay was so cute! I love the part of the Little Library, because honestly, some of the best childhood moments are made from reading words on a page. I did notice some elements of your UBC app in there too! What your strength is in answering these questions is your forward-thinking: You answer their question, but you round it out by explaining what you're doing now, and how it'll shape your future. Let me know if you want another pair of eyes (or rather, four-eyes since I'm a glasses wearer lolol 8) ) to look anything over! 
Happy holidays again, my mentee! Sending you a virtual hot chocolate on my side of BC. :)

The topic: What personal experiences and events have shaped your outlook on life and how do you feel this will contribute to you being a positive member of the SFU community? Why do you feel this makes you an excellent candidate for your chosen area of study at SFU?
 
my response: I cut oranges like my grandmother. I still tell the joke one of my childhood friends declared to me in second-grade math class. I remind myself of advice that my teacher whispered to me because I struggled to believe in myself. Many big moments shaped my life. On my first day of kindergarten, my world opened up. My life has never been the same since the day my mom died. And the pandemic has made me want to pursue a career in infectious disease research. Were it not for those events I would be a completely different person. But it's the small skills and experiences that I have gathered from other people that formed who I am. People change. Every new experience, every new piece of advice, every new day and every new person shape who we become. We are all exceedingly unaware of the impact we have on each other. I started learning Latin during the summer, now one of my friends randomly says Latin words and phrases in conversations, like me. My coworker washes towels using the trick I taught him to get even more dirt out. My french teacher still references the inside joke I started in September. I have changed them. I care about the people and the world around me. I have learned that the world does not change with one person working their own. Nor does it change with one big move. Tiny changes, millions of good ideas and teams of people with a common goal change the world. One step forward is better than standing still. So every day, I take small steps forward. 
At school, I run the Model United Nations Club. I see how a little encouragement and teamwork can provide people with more confidence and less nervousness when speaking before a group. Maybe they're not ready to speak in front of a massive audience, but they are more confident than they were before. I maintain my Ranger Unit's Little Library. I never imagined how important it could be to people. A few weeks ago, I stopped by to add more books in time to overhear a young boy excitably saying to his mother ""I want to stop and get a book!"", his mother told him that he could grab one after his swimming lesson. I smiled, knowing that he might get to read one of my favourite books from when I was a child that I had added. Soon, I will pass on the Little Library to one of the younger members of my unit. I am sad to let it go; but happy that someone else will get to impact Port Coquitlam the way I have. I care about others. I am a passionate, critical thinker and long-term thinker. Small steps change the world, and I've already started walking. 
 
I wrote it in two hours including all the time I spent making changes and prooof reading. So now I wait to see if I get anything... You may notice some repetition from my UBC stuff ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ",8:54PM December 21

Hi,
I have been accepted to the University of Northern British Columbia (Bachelors of Health Sciences - Biomedical Major). So that's cool.
Winter break is finally here - not that school is over (I just spent three hours working on my Capstone project),
So, paying for school! The Maclean's video was interesting and I read the article that went with it. I skimmed the MyBluePrint one, it was super long and I am tired. We use MyBluePrint in school and it's not bad so I might take a deeper look at it later. 
I expected it to help a little with finding scholarships and all that. To be honest student loans seem like a bad idea and they are something I want to avoid. 
I applied for the SFU entrance scholarships yesterday (I will include my essay down below) and I am hoping to apply for a scholarship that is supper specific and only for students at my school in the spring. 
Other than the questions above: How did you pay for school? Scholarship application tips? Do you have any money-saving tips for university/college?

Hi Mentee,
(つ✧ω✧)つ Okay, we stan a STEM variety queen! Infectious disease sounds SO cool!!!
I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I did a university transfer program from college to uni, and a few of my friends did also. What I found was that university transferrable courses were offered at much more affordable prices at college compared to if you took those courses at university -- Why? Idk. LOL. But that can save you mad $$$, which will somehow end up being invested back into school anyway (sigh) hahaha. 
But personally, I found I preferred and thrived in the large class sizes at university compared to the small class sizes of college. My friend preferred the opposite. If used as a stepping stone, college can be a smart way to kinda ""dip your toes"" into post-secondary before wading into the university pool, while saving hundreds of dollars. Otherwise, both institutions provide quality education and it's really all about what you're looking to get out of school.
With all this said, let's start this topic!

Hi,
For Douglas, I applied for the science program. I can't remember if I mentioned this but, my plan (if I end up going there) is to transfer to a university after 2 years. For the other schools, it was a variety of microbiology, immunology, health sciences, (might have been an infectious disease in there), I gave myself options based on what the school offered.

Hi Mentee,
Congratulations! °˖✧◝(˃ᴗ˂)◜✧˖° (If MentorCity removes emojis, we're just gonna have to improvise LOL).
While Douglas College may not be your first choice, it's still an acceptance nonetheless! Do you mind me asking what program(s) you've decided to apply for?
The reason I ask is because my friend actually entered university as a General Science major, or something along those lines. They didn't know what they wanted to go into right at the jump, and waited before declaring their major - Now they're in Biomedical Engineering and loving it! Although you sound like you've got your plan down pat, I thought it'd be worthwhile to mention that it's alright to explore your options before committing to a degree. Taking courses that can apply to others (e.g. Math 100, Chem 121) can give you that flexibility should you be interested in finding out what sciences have to offer first, before deciding which you'll graduate with.
I guess talking about scholarships was a great segway into opening the next Convo... Onto Paying for School we go!

Hi,
I got accepted to Douglas College yesterday, it's conditional but the only thing that would get my acceptance taken back is if i get lower than a C in english 12 and considering for the past 3 years I've had over 90%...I think I'll be fine. Douglas isn't my first choice but it's comforting to have that option if my other four options don't work out. 
I did not know about the ""in-course scholarships"" or department nominations, so that is very good to know!
I guess Paying for School would be a good next category.

Hi Mentee,
Woo-hoo! One application down, more scholarship applications to go! :D I know it probably feels like a marathon, but it'll be so worth it - Keep it up! You're doing great, and you're almost there!
On the topic of scholarships, I will mention that while there are scholarships you can apply for once you're in uni, there are also some that you don't have to. The one's you don't have to apply for are mainly merit-based, most commonly in the form of scholarships you receive if you achieve a certain GPA per semester or higher (I believe they're called ""in-course scholarships""). Basically, the university lets you know that you've qualified, and some of these in-course scholarships are actually renewable (even better)! You can also come across some money through department nomination, as I personally have upon winning an award within my program. Post-secondary is expensive, so if you can find ways to supplement funding your education (e.g. Co-ops, working on campus, side hustle), it'll definitely help with the financial stressors of school.
On this topic of self-care, however, I think we've covered what we needed to! We just need to apply self-care now. LOL. But actually, on my end, I'm able to complete the Convo, so we're actually done here. You ready to pick out our next move on the Conversation Wheel? :)

THANK YOU!!! Your suggestions were super helpful, I submitted my application Sunday and I am happy to be done with it. On to scholarship applications now I guess. 
I like what you said on the topic of self-care with getting regular sleep and all that. It's almost like a habit and I find that when things get more busy, stressful and tiring, it's habits that help keep me going,

3 / 3 - Academic Explanation Essay
I am not going to waste time pretending I have the best grades. (Good, but you are coming in strong! LOL)
It is obvious math is not my best class, that french is not my best language or that I found chemistry 11 easy. (Although they have your transcript in front of them, I feel like saying ""It's obvious"" will draw even more attention to lower grades. While it might have not been obvious then, it's for sure obvious now!)
Suggestion(s): Maybe a less direct approach than ""It is obvious"". When explaining lower academic performance, always shine light on your improvements and how you've overcome your hardships (as you've done below).
Despite all this, I work hard, and I care about what I do. (Good.)
I have spent years working to improve my grades, and I am proud of how far I have come. (Good.)
I am not going to let my grades stand in the way of my goals. (While true, keep in mind that you're applying to a university, where they very much care about your grades. Though I know you as my mentee, how do you think a file reviewer might interpret this?)
Suggestion(s): While I understand your intention with this sentence, I think we can improve its wording and delivery: There is value in aptitude, but also in attitude. That is what you're centralizing your essay on, and if you can deliver this sentiment effectively, I think it'll be really impactful.
I've wanted to be a scientist since I was in the third grade. I've always jumped at science classes, camps and science shows. (Both sentences feel a bit out of place... Is this the best place to bring this up? If you need an extra sentence or two, I would replace these sentences with those. Maybe talk about the trends in your grades (i.e. Upward trend as you changed your mindset).)
So, maybe my grades aren't the best, but I am much more than my grades. (Good. Ties everything together.)
Alright, I think we've reviewed all of your questions so far! Thank you for letting me help you, and I hope these reviews were of help to you. As we've also reached the end of this Conversation, do you have any other questions before we complete it? What Conversation would you like me to unlock next?
I know we just talked about self-care here... But imma head to sleep now. LOL. Remember... We're always on a self-care journey.

My mother registered me for Girl Guides when I was four years old. (Good.)
She had been a Girl Guide when she was younger, as had my grandma, and she wanted me to do it too. (Good.)
Thirteen years have passed (and) I am still a Girl Guide.
Girl Guides has given me countless opportunities; I've gone ziplining in Whistler, river rafting in Chilliwack, and snow camping in Manning Park. (Good.)
I've met with girls and women from across Canada and around the world. (Good.)
I've seen how Guiding, and by extension (comma?) feminism, is around the world. (Good.)
Girl Guides has challenged me, pushed me, and given me experiences that many in my peer group have not had. (Good.)
People have an idea of what a Girl Guide is. (Good.)
Yes, we camp, tie knots, and sing songs around campfires. (Good.)
Yet, I've also had hands-on experiences with; (You don't need a semi-colon here) travelling, serving my community and building new skills.
Through Girl Guides, I've also joined the Girl Guide Youth Leaders, where I regularly represent youth in Guiding. (Good.)
I've helped make Guiding in Canada more accessible and welcoming by helping to change policies and customs that exclude certain groups. (Good.)
 
At the end of grade 10, my math teacher suggested I join my school's Model United Nations club. (Good, so idk what Grammarly is seeing.)
I was hesitant. (Good.)
Almost two years later, I am now leading the club. (Good.)
Being in the club has allowed me to improve my debate skills, consider other perspectives and be more aware of the logistics regarding world politics. (Good.)
Leading the club has been a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. (Good.)

Most impressive is how my fellow Head Delegates and I have successfully increased the number of club members from five to twenty-eight in less than three months. (Good, though I would maybe reconsider starting the sentence with ""Most impressive"".)

1/3 - Father, Future
Hi Mentee,
Working on your UBC application - We love to see it! This is review 1 of 3 for the app questions you've sent, and I'll be leaving # / 3 at the beginning of my posts so you know which of my messages correspond to which question + so it'll be easier for you to find.
Below is a sentence by sentence analysis of your answer, as our goal is to optimize the word count and really be purposeful with each word we choose. While reviewing the question again, I'd recommend copying + pasting everything into Google Docs and comparing it to your original answer, so you can follow along and make the edits you like - Keeping in mind that each sentence should contribute towards fully answering the question!
Again, I'm here to help you review and raise that Grammarly score! Your story is your best asset to your application, and to keep the integrity of the application process, I really want to keep your answers as original as we can (AKA I kept as much of your words as possible and only made very minimal changes to improve flow + grammar)!  With that being said, let's get started:
Growing up, my father taught me to be a leader. (Good.)
To be confident and to make my own choices are ideals I have been raised with. (This sentence sounds incomplete, which could be fixed by simply rearranging it.)
Suggestion(s): He raised me to have confidence in myself and in the choices I make.
For years, he has been encouraging me to pursue my interests, even if I don't have others to join me. (I'm not sure why Grammarly isn't a fan of this sentence, to be honest.)
Suggestion(s): Maybe remove the 'been' and see if that improves the score.
I've learnt (Not a correction, but I personally prefer 'learned' over 'learnt', though both should be correct. Whichever you choose, just stay consistent)
to be independent and, (You shouldn't need a comma here)
to care about what I am doing and where I going. (Where I am going.)
Many things are important to me, yet they can all fit under the umbrella of my future. (Good.)
I've learnt to work for what I want (Comma) whether, (Remove comma) it's improving my grades, exercising or pursuing my interests.
Suggestion(s): I've learnt to work for what I want, whether it's improving my grades, exercising or pursuing my interests.
When I think about my reason for living, I see my future, I see an independent woman who is well educated and who cares about the world and people around her. (I think Grammarly is catching this because it's a run-on sentence.)
Suggestion(s): Separate your ideas with a period.
When I think about my reason for living, I imagine my future. I imagine a well-educated, independent woman who cares about the world and the people around her.
I strive every day to become better. (Good.)
Meaning (You don't need 'Meaning' here) I focus on my education, take care of myself and work to improve relationships with people who help me as much as I help them. 
My future is one of the few things I have truly sacrificed to have. (Again, Grammarly, why? It sounds fine to me.)
I've become good at considering the long-term effects of my actions and choices. (Good.)
I plan according to what I want in the long term, I don't mind studying late on a Saturday after work instead of watching a movie. (A run-on. Separate your sentences with a period, or use a conjunction to combine your ideas together.)
I am happy to exercise, (You shouldn't need a comma here) instead of scrolling through my phone.
It's empowering to imagine and plan for everything I can accomplish. (Good.)
Learning, that being independent does not mean forgoing asking for help, and leaving everyone behind. (I think you could look into this sentence more by playing around with the word order and see if your score improves. If being independent doesn't mean forgoing help and leaving everyone behind, what does it mean then?)
My future inspires me. (Good.)
It's the reason I wake up every morning and try. (Good.)
Overall, very minimal tweaks needed but a solid answer (though I'm not sure what the exact question is haha). Lastly, please just take my suggestions as they are meant to be... suggestions. :) When you revise your answers, while it's important to consider what what the file reviewer would think, at the end of the day, it's whether we are happy to send off that answer as our most honest selves (no regrets!)

Hi Mentee,
I love that journal snippet you included, because until now, I hadn't given it much thought on how self-empathy could be more what our bodies and souls need instead of (what is traditionally thought of as) self-care (e.g. ""Treat yo self"" moments, retail therapy, indulging in chocolates, etc). Like... We really out here staying hydrated to make up for those cry sessions. LOL.
But on this topic, I also wanted to bring up the differences of how self-care can leave us feeling, particularly, with the feeling of fulfillment. I used to be someone who could and would shop for clothes nearly weekly (insane, I know). And while I still love to shop from time to time, I grew to realize that it wasn't having the clothes in my closet that I enjoyed, but more so the shopping experience. As we grow and change, how we care for ourselves will change too. Now, what helps keep my burnouts at bay is having a skin routine that helps me feel and look my best, trying out new recipes and restaurants, and making memories I can fondly look back on! 
Overall, I think the direction we're going is: Catching up on sleep that we've missed shouldn't be classified as self-care, but regularly getting a goodnight's rest is the standard of care we should uphold ourselves to (omg... not me saying this but literally sleeping in like crazy this morning because I sleep D E P R I V E D alllll week hahahaha).
As days seem to blur together with studying/work taking up a majority of our 24 hours, I hope we can reach our goals in a mindful and healthy way - Whether they be academic, career, relationship, personal, etc. But for now, I'll let it pass that you only had 6.5 hours of sleep the other night... Though imma advocate for your brain and say pls sleep more!!!

Hi Mentee,
First off, please never feel bad! Legit. I love what I do as a mentor, and seeing how engaged you are hypes me up too. How I see it is, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing as a mentee... Which is asking for mentorship LOL. So thank you for that cute bear, thank you for your response to the Self Care convo, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of your application process! I'm going to happily do my best and you keep it up (No but seriously, I dunno if I mentioned this, but English is my favorite subject and I actually like proofreading and editing stuff lolol). 
This isn't actually my reply to everything tho: I'm just popping in to say that I'll be answering all of your messages this weekend, so I hope you don't mind the extra wait! Just got that killer combo of work kicking my butt + applying for more work/research/volunteer positions + trying to make life happen all at the same time. You know the drill all too well! 
But ya, I see your messages, and no worries - we'll get this UBC app up and rolling. We aiming for first-round offers, ya? 
Thank you and talk to you soon.

Hi,
I am starting to feel bad about doing this. Here is a bear ʕ ·(エ)· ʔ 
More short essays:
I am not going to waste time pretending I have the best grades. It is obvious math is not my best class, that french is not my best language or that I found chemistry 11 easy. Despite all this, I work hard, and I care about what I do. I have spent years working to improve my grades, and I am proud of how far I have come. I am not going to let my grades stand in the way of my goals. I've wanted to be a scientist since I was in the third grade. I've always jumped at science classes, camps and science shows. So, maybe my grades aren't the best, but I am much more than my grades. 
This one is the Additional Information, where you can explaine bad grades and all that. Max 600 characters which was challenging. (99% Grammarly score though)
Thank you,

Hi,
I've got more. This one is even longer then the last, it's about 2 of my Ecs.
My mother registered me for Girl Guides when I was four years old. She had been a Girl Guide when she was younger, as had my grandma, and she wanted me to do it too. Thirteen years have passed I am still a Girl Guide. Girl Guides has given me countless opportunities; I've gone ziplining in Whistler, river rafting in Chilliwack, and snow camping in Manning Park. I've met with girls and women from across Canada and around the world. I've seen how Guiding, and by extension feminism, is around the world. Girl Guides has challenged me, pushed me, and given me experiences that many in my peer group have not had. People have an idea of what a Girl Guide is. Yes, we camp, tie knots, and sing songs around campfires. Yet, I've also had hands-on experiences with; travelling, serving my community and building new skills. Through Girl Guides, I've also joined the Girl Guide Youth Leaders, where I regularly represent youth in Guiding. I've helped make Guiding in Canada more accessible and welcoming by helping to change policies and customs that exclude certain groups.
 
At the end of grade 10, my math teacher suggested I join my school's Model United Nations club. I was hesitant. Almost two years later, I am now leading the club. Being in the club has allowed me to improve my debate skills, consider other perspectives and be more aware of the logistics regarding world politics. Leading the club has been a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. We are in the process of planning a mock conference, so club members attending VMUN in the new year can gain some practice with how a conference works. I've made presentations, taught club members about decorum, committees and western business attire. Most impressive is how my fellow Head Delegates and I have successfully increased the number of club members from five to twenty-eight in less than three months. One of my basic jobs is running the Instagram page, where we have increased the following from 30 people to over 160. I enjoy leading the Model United Nations club and, I like the impact it has on my school. 
 
It got a 99% Grammarly score!  Grammarly doesn't like 'I join', I don't know how to change that one. It also doesn't like the work choice for conference...but that's what they're called so I can't change that.
So, I know this is a lot, but what are your thoughts?

Hello again!
I have mostly finished another UBC aplication question and was hoping you can help me improve my 84% Grammarly score. 
I bolded the parts that Grammarly does not like. It says my delivery is slightly off and it's 'very engaging' but not perfect. What are your thoughts? 
Growing up, my father taught me to be a leader. To be confident and to make my own choices are ideals I have been raised with. For years, he has been encouraging me to pursue my interests, even if I don't have others to join me. I've learnt to be independent and, to care about what I am doing and where I going.

Hi,
Self care is such an interesting topic because in the media and all that it’s portrayed as bubble baths and scented candles and I have learnt to not see it that way. For me, self care means being a little easier on myself, it’s not beating myself up when I do less homework one night compared to what I was planning to do because I was tired and couldn’t focus, it’s getting myself a glass of ice water after I’ve bawled my eyes out over who knows what (Ice water after you have a total meltdown is a solid 10/10), it’s exercising even why I’m lacking motivation because it’s what my body needs. I was thinking about this in July and this topic reminded me about something I typed in one of my journals “Self-care is over-glorified in the media and has so many different meanings. From what I see practicing this ‘self-care is not the point, practicing self-empathy is more often than not what you need. It’s taking care of yourself like you are taking care of someone else. Sure sometimes that’s a warm bath with candles around the edge but more often than not, it’s drying your tears, eating food that is good for your body, and doing your homework, it’s reminding yourself to breathe when you forget and going to bed at a reasonable time. It’s not as big and beautiful as people say it is. “
 
Anyways, I’ll include my answers below: 
How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important? It’s easy to accept that self care is important, but do I prioritize it?…. This is such a bad thought but I would rather cry myself to sleep and ace a test the next day, vs. going to sleep happy and geting a C+. I know it’s important I just have other things I care about a bit more, which isn’t good, and I know that but still.  
What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? I don’t plan for self care, it just kinda fits into when I have time. Knowing that I’ll have X amount of minutes to do something is great and I try to make the most of even the little amount of time I have. 
Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life?  My answer is the same as yours. No one I can think of. Some things I am working on for myself though: keeping promises to myself. It’s super easy to say ‘i’ll turn off my phone and go fold my laundry at 6:30’, then at 6:32 you’re like ‘welp I missed it I guess I gotta wait until 6:45’. So working to keep even little promises and deadlines I make with myself has been a big one. I’m genuinely trying to be nice to myself, working to understand how my productivity levels change too has made it easier. 
What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself? At certain points I notice myself slipping and being meaner to myself. So when that happens know I need to work harder to be easier on myself. 
How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? I don’t know, I like what you wrote. 
How good are you at taking care of the basics of self-care:  wish me luck for this next part… 
Getting adequate sleep? Let ignore that according to my Fitbit I got 6.5 hours of sleep last night. On a side note, I discovered something this summer that has helped me so much since I have always had problems falling asleep. On Spotify, there is this podcast called ‘The Get Sleepy Podcast’ and a subsection of that called ‘The Get Sleepy Bookshelf’ REVOLUTIONARY! They’re stories designed to help you fall asleep, I connect my wireless earbuds to my phone and hit play (make sure to click the moon so it stops at the end of the episode), and I fall asleep so fast and it makes going to bed so much less frustrating. 
Eating healthy food? this is something I’ve gotten better at since COVID started. 
Drinking water? I am the poster girl for water drinking. My friends and family have always been amazed at how much water I drink. I’ve counted and it’s over 90 oz a day. 
Regular physical activity? my schedule this year has caused this to take such a hit but I still try to fit it in. Last year school ended at 2:00 (changed schedule for COVID) so I would come home lift weights for an half hout then skip rope for a half hour. It was great. For a workout I highly recommend skipping rope, it's cardio, it’s like running but has lower impact, works balance and agility, and I’ve reached a point when I can do a lot of cool moves. It’s also easy to do in little time and you can take it places.
Taking breaks from work? I try to take the five-minute Pomodoro breaks and not work through them. But if I don’t or I forget about my timer I will not stop working and it’s concerning. 
I agree with you, it was interesting answering the questions. They made me think about where I’m lacking and where I need to put in more effort.

Hi Mentee,
I'm so happy that you chose this one next, because I dunno what it is about gloomy weather, but I find our moods can dip easier when the skies are grey. Let's do our best to keep our self-care up, our relationships up, our grades up, and just overall - up up here we go!
I wanted to answer the questions as a check-in for myself too, aside from providing a post-secondary perspective. You'll find them below :
How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important?
Honestly speaking, I think it's easy to think about the importance of self-care, but it's another thing to implement such care. I'm still on a self-care journey myself, trying to find that sweet spot of work-life balance. 
What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself?
Throughout high school and university, there won't be a shortage of other priorities that could jump ahead of self-care on your queue, but that's where time management comes in! Just as important as it is to set a time for studying and working out, I like to play a little Animal Crossing after dinner and my shower for some fun time.
Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life?
Frankly, nobody comes to mind. LOL. But the cycle can always start with us, right? I've been trying to find more activities that bring me joy but also help with personal development. For example, while I enjoy looking at memes, eventually I find myself mindlessly scrolling and it's such a time sponge. So, I've switched to logic puzzles - While I'm still playing on my phone, it has more mind engagement than just double-tapping a post.
What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself?
My most recent sign has been feeling sluggish due to too much sugar! My dad recently bought these boxes of fruit punch that I was downing like I was in the desert. Even though I'd take them 1 water : 1 juice, over the next week, I began feeling not the best despite no significant changes in my diet. Tried to backtrack to see what was causing it and saw the sugar content of my juice... Now I'm back on just water and feel so much better!
How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? Your mentor may have some insight into this!
The transition into post-secondary is a big step that you can't really be 100% prepared for. As you're suddenly handed so much responsibility over your own learning, like building your schedule and choosing your classes, you might also have to navigate living on your own for the first time and balance that with taking care of yourself. I think the best way forward is to allow yourself the time to adjust, make changes as you change, and not spread yourself out too thin. Just as you're learning in school, this is a time for you to learn about yourself.
How good are you at taking care of the basics of self care: 
Getting adequate sleep?
YIKES. Right off the bat?! LOL. In my defense, I've always preferred being a night owl, but... No... I don't typically get enough sleep, and try to make this up on my days off. This is definitely my achilles heel of self-care, but I'll work on it - Promise!

Eating healthy food?
I would say I have a fair balance between healthy and not.  It's typically every other weekend that I go out to eat, but throughout my work week, I pack my lunches with fruits, water, and a filling meal with vegetables.

Drinking water?
Always! Stay hydrated, friend!

Regular physical activity?
I've been trying to find a good workout routine to get into every morning... If you have any suggestions, or any go-to exercises you do, let me know! While I work on the computer a lot, I find ways to get up and move, and aim to hit my Apple Watch goals throughout the week  (Why, yes... I did wait until the office was empty to run around to close one of my rings before HAHA).

Taking breaks from work?
I am getting called OUT and I don't like it!!! LOL. When I start something, I like to finish it, no matter how late I stay up. I think it's just a characteristic of mine to just go all in, but yeah... Maybe I'll take a self-care break once I wrap my message up!
I actually found answering these questions quite funny, but enlightening. Looks like your mentor still has a lot of work to do when it comes to self-care management! I'm looking forward to reading your answers and we can even exchange our self-care tactics!
Take care of yourself always. <3

Hi,
Thank you for liking and hyping up my answer, it made me smile when saw the message in the morning! I did what you suggested and added the conjunction and I changed 'been able to talk on' to 'taken on' and I went from a 96% Grammarly rating to a 98% Grammarly rating, I think that's fairly good. so thank you for that correction.
I'm happy to move on to the next convo, I can keep asking questions about my application as they arise, and we can work through some of the conversation topics in the meantime. 
Maybe we could do 'Well Being and Self Care' next, that's something I'm trying not to slack on it year.
Thank you for all your help,

Hi Mentee,
OH. MY. GOODNESS! YES, SIS! LOOK AT THAT ANSWER! Hang on, let me read it again (while you pay attention in class!) LOL. 
-- 
First off, thank you so much for allowing me the privilege to read that! It was a very personal, yet powerful work of writing. I'm very proud of your answer and I hope you are too. Frankly, I don't think I could add or edit anything that would improve it further - You answered the question honestly, thoroughly, and it was engaging all the way through. I think if you were bored and after you had finished all of the other questions on your application, you could try and go back and find whatever 4% was missing from Grammarly (but hey! A 96% is an A+ in uni! ). I think if I had to guess, maybe it's catching this sentence? ""I have been able to take on more challenges with the mindset that I can learn and do anything, certain things take time.""  You might need a conjunction in front of ""certain things take time"" (e.g. but/and/yet certain things take time) or you could make it a quote as well... Or... Imagine your Grammarly score goes DOWN after my suggestions and you could just ignore that I even said anything because your writing is just excellent as it is (Ahhhh that'd be so embarrassing hahahah).
So we're actually at the end of this conversation, but I'd be totally fine with keeping it open (i.e. not completing it yet) if you wanted to go over other aspects of your UBC app first? It's still relevant to the ""Post-Secondary Considerations"" topic! But if you had another Convo you had your sights on after this one, we could complete this + in the next Convo, you can bring up questions about your application at any time there too.
Seriously tho... UBC would be lucky to have you. Such a well-written answer!

Hello,
It took me a long time to reply, sorry about that (I may or may not be writing this in french class ) but I think I've finally finished the 'Who am I?' Portion of my Personal Profile, not I need to answer what is important to me and write a bit about my ECs, which I think will be easier. 
Bellow is what I wrote for who I am:
I may not know who I am but, I am proud of the person I am becoming, even if I'm not her yet. I am self-driven, confident, and focused which, I haven't always been. Looking back, I don't know how I've managed to become someone with the goals, dreams and abilities that I have today. Seven-year-old me would have never imagined having the goal of becoming a scientist, eleven-year-old me could never have imagined believing that I could attend university and thirteen-year-old me could never have imagined being as bold as I am today. In elementary school and early middle school, I had a C average, I was bombing spelling tests, dictées, and math tests, I was unmotivated and frankly a mean person. I now realize I was going through a lot and my lashing out and not leaving my comfort zone was a response to the stress and trauma associated with my mother's death. At some point, I had a moment of self-discovery, and my mindset changed. I am proud of myself, for working to raise my academic average, become more involved and build better relationships with my family, friends, teachers and classmates. I have been able to take on more challenges with the mindset that I can learn and do anything, certain things take time. I work every day to move farther from the person I was by taking a more active effort in my mental and physical health, academics, and life outside of school. I am strong, resilient, and confident, and others would describe me as such. 
Grammarly gave it 96% which isn't bad in my books. I would like a better concluding sentance but at this point I am only about characters away from the limit. What are your thoughts on what I wrote? The mind map idea helped so much for this, so thank you for that idea!

Alright, the last of my message trio!
I took some time to watch some UBC application videos on YouTube to make sure I was up to date with the application process (as it's been a while!). Sounds like it's still as 'fun' as I remember... LOL.  Anyways, questions that ask you about yourself can be a bit tricky, so if I could give you some tips on how to start to tackle that question...
Why not try a mind map with you at the centre? 
It must be so nerve-wracking to write such an important part of your application while you're still figuring everything out! But you've mentioned how mind maps have worked for you, and I saw this used in one of the videos I've watched (Starting at 4:50). I thought it was a cool way to start listing what ECs, hobbies, and experiences have been significant for you, and really start expanding on not only what those activites are, but what they've contributed to you as a person. I think especially applying as a rural student, you have such a unique perspective, and if applicable, tying community in with your personal statement could be a key point.
Once you've got a decent list going and want to start writing, I'd say you'd want to keep your answer as interesting, as concise, but accurate as possible.
If you want to start this question off with a hook, some ideas could be: the words you live by, like the Marie Curie quote from our first convo , a powerful statement, or even a fact about you - just anything to start your personal profile strong, like setting yourself up for a good first impression. But once you've got a hook, you'll want to reel them in! UBC can be quite competitive, and I'm sure they've got thousands of applications coming in from all around the country and world. Be honest while making your words count!
Read, review, revise, repeat!
Just as with any assignment you're about to submit:
Always work on another doc (and save often!)
Read the questions again to ensure you're answering them correctly
Review your answers (maybe even have another pair of eyes read them!)
Revise what you've written to be concise but as accurate as possible
Repeat until you're happy (or until it's due LOL)
What UBC is looking for is what has made you, you. Take this time to really reflect on yourself and your story, and if you're still having a hard time, why not ask friends and family what they would say about you? For example, from my perspective as your mentor, you are a very hardworking and self-driven person, which reflects on your aspirations for post-secondary. 
Good luck!
Your mentor,
Mentor

Hi Mentee,
So... I just spent an embarrasing amount of time making my own syllabus so I could show you what one looks like (since I've packed most of my university things away), but then I realized I have no idea how to paste it as a PDF on here LOL. ASJKDLF. If you know how to get around that, I'd love to show you what my ""class"" syllabus looks like !
Anyways, I didn't want to leave you empty-handed, so I did a bit of Googling and found a quite dated syllabus online: HINF 140 Course Outline
Onto your UBC app! Next message, please!

Hi Mentee,
I guess it's my turn to take the wheel on this convo! As we've already gone over studying quite in-depth, this time, I'll share 1 ""tip"" and 1 ""trap"" based on my experiences of trying to achieve post-secondary academic success.
As these articles are seriously putting me outta business as a mentor (LOL jk), I guess I'll just reiterate the importance of perspective.
Mentor's trap: When I first began university, I figuratively and literally felt lost... No, but seriously, I had to call my friends like it was Who Wants to Be A Millionaire because I didn't know how to get to my class . Going into university with the wrong mindset didn't help me with enjoying my experience, and it for sure didn't help me with my grades. It was when I changed my perspective that I really felt empowered, and almost as quickly as I saw school in a different light, that simple change brought my grades up immensely. 
It's easy to get caught up in the daily mundane: How long until that midterm? Am I going to order food off Skip or cook? Why is tuition so expensive?! But when you think about it...
Mentor's tip: You're there because you have this amazing privilege to learn about what you're interested in, on a beautiful campus, with like-minded individuals and professors who will be a part of that academic journey. You'll learn so much about certain topics, develop your skills, make friends, and really grow into your own person. Like... Heck ya, I'm really out here, getting educated and getting one more degree hotter .
I hope this ""tip"" and ""trap"" will be helpful for you in the future, especially when school gets tough! I'll talk about the syllabus and my advice for your UBC app in my next message!

Hello,
 
I liked the UBC article, I’m writing this after I have been studying and writing and my desk for a couple of hours so the Active Study Tips video got me moving which felt good. 
My answers to the questions:
Which of the strategies described in the article will you try? Which can you implement in your life now?
Well, as I mentioned above, I did most of the exercises. I use the Pomodoro technique when studying, which means that I get a five-minute break every twenty-five minutes, I try and make myself step away from my desk for that time, walk around my house, stretch, get water, use the washroom, etc… I like to avoid checking my phone during that time but it’s good to move every so often. Other than that one, there are a few that I use to some degree, I have a routine that I follow (roughly), it makes a difference because it’s easier for me to get the things done but also because other people start to learn that routine too and they can then know when not to bother me. We kinda talked about the notes when we talked about studying. To be fair I do a lot of these already and the tips were some things that I hadn’t considered. The Cold Turkey Writer app seems interesting and its name describes it well. That’s a bold approach to staying focused. 
 
I think the rest is up to you…I am curious to see what one of your syllabuses looks like.
 
Something else, I am going through the fun process of post-secondary applications. One of the UBC personal profile questions is ‘Tell us about who you are. How would your family, friends and/or members of your community describe you? If possible, please include something about yourself that you are most proud of and why?’ I am lost on how to start this question. Describing what is important to me and the extracurriculars I am doing, it’s a challenge but I’m still trying to figure out who I am and I don’t know how to answer this question. Do you have any tips?

Hi Mentee,
It's all A-OK!  I'm also on the same boat of balancing work, play, and ECs, so let's just try our best and message when we can <3. Hopefully the extra hour we got from Daylight Savings helps - extra hour for sleep and studying, here we come!
Question 11: So I mentioned in my last message how I found the Dal article quite accurate, and that does include what they describe for grades. But as you'll find out in post-secondary, it really does depend on the class, with factors like how the prof grades, their expectations, etc.
For example, I think it'd be difficult to go ""above and beyond"" for more formula-based courses. Like... how do you apply derivatives in a new way? Does the +C mean ""+ new concepts"" for integrals? LOL. From my experience, getting an ""A"" in these courses is equal parts getting the right answer and showing the proper proof on how you arrived there.
What I believe they were getting at was more so with theory-based courses, where getting an ""A"" can be more complex. It's not just about memorizing what the teacher said, but being able to take that, make connections both in and out of the material, and apply the theory to real examples. Ideally in your research, you'll be able to bring in new information to the conversation, and on top of also meeting every other criteria, that exceeds the expectations = A! I hope this makes sense .
Question 13: So... GPA. While you do get a form of a ""report card"" every semester, you'll notice how it's more so given in percentages that equate to a letter grade, as opposed to just A/B/C/D/F.
The GPA given from your class is your class GPA > 
When all your class GPAs are bunched together at the end of your semester, that's your (semester) term GPA > 
When you've completed a couple of semesters, all of your term GPAs get added together as your cumulative GPA.
What becomes especially important with the GPA system is meeting the percentage cut-offs for the letter grades you want. For example, my school would round a 79.5% up to an 80%, which is an A-. But a 79.4% would get rounded down to a B+. While on the smaller scale, both are great grades and the difference is just 1%... But on the bigger scale, it is a letter grade difference, which could change your cumulative average GPA. Just something to keep in mind, as certain scholarships require a certain GPA to maintain, masters programs may look at your 3rd/4th year grades, and more.
Intensity is the right word for sure!  I think the biggest ""shock factor"" of going from high school to university isn't the self-responsibility, but just how quickly things can add up. I was in quite a small program, so our professors were close enough to collaborate with each other to avoid conflicting due dates/exam days. However, this is definitely a limited case, and I expect larger science programs will have many things going on at the same time. Best answer? Time management, time management, time management!
I second ya - Syllabuses are the best!
You down to tackle the UBC article next?

Hello,
Sorry, it is taking me so long to reply to the messages, I feel like I am even busier even after changing my work situation! 
Here are my replies to the questions:
What surprised you: Question 11 was a little surprising. In high school getting an A means doing mostly everything correct for assignments and tests, the way the article describes it does not seem to be the case. 
    Question 13 also was new information to me, I knew that there is more focus on GPA in university than high school but I did not know that’s the main source to see how you’re doing you get. Compared to the A/B/C/etc… we get in high school.
Which of these differences will affect you most? I think that it is much faster and more intense will affect me. We had the quarter system in school last year because of COVID, our semesters were split in two, so we had 2 classes for 2 hours a day for about 9 weeks and that was rushed and I didn’t like the ‘lack of academic diversity as I call it. For example, I had math and Chemistry in one quarter and that meant that for about 9 weeks I was just doing math and it got very tiring very fast. We also needed to learn so much faster and it was easier to fall behind. 
How do you feel about some of these changes? I am looking forward to my post-secondary education, I know it’s not going to be easy but I don’t see that as a bad thing. I like that I will have more of a choice over my academics and my schedule. I 
I also like the idea of a syllabus, since I like to know what’s going on long before it happens. I like being prepared.

Hi Mentee,
YAY! I'm soooooo happy for you!!  Congrats on getting that 4-hour work week and I hope this really frees up some time for you (although you said it's against company policy??? but oh well LOL).
Alright, so how I thought about tackling this page of the Conversation was to maybe divide it into 2 discussions: We can talk about the Dal article first and exchange some questions/advice, and once we complete that, we can discuss the UBC article and do the same thing! Hope that sounds good .
To be honest, I thought every point the Dalhousie article made was accurate, so I thought to focus on the one that I didn't really pay attention to until my 3rd year, which was: 7. There's always an event to attend or something to do.
At my university, there would always be flyers posted, signs on the grass, emails sent out, and sometimes students would speak up before class to bring attention to an upcoming event. Up until 3rd year, I was tuning most of that out, as I was always just thinking of what was next to come - What's due this week? When's that midterm? What time was our group meeting? I never really stopped to look at what those signs said, until one of my co-op's stationed me at a table for one of those said events - A career fair. I would've loved to have attended more events like these because not only were they fun (and had loads of freebies!! LOL), they're a great way to see different companies, career avenues, network, and even learn more about what your university has to offer, like going on international co-ops work terms, studying and completing a semester abroad, and more. Though not just limited to career fairs, attending speaker events, and events hosted by your school can be a treasure of information.. It's just a matter of knowing when they are! Just like the article said, on the first day of classes, you're given a syllabus of what to expect for that semester. But I'd also highly encourage you to discover what's going on on campus during the semester too!
Happy Halloween!

Hello,
I didn't consider talking with medical ethicists, to be honest I didn't know they existed, but reaching out to some is a very good idea so thank you for that! Thank you also for the links they worked the second time and I will look into them. 
I kinda figured out my job situation, I went in and asked them to cut my hours down to four hours a week and they said they couldn't do that because of company policy (which I can understand). I said at one point 'this is kinda my only option, it this or I quit' and my manager paused for a second and said that I could take a break from work (leave of absence). Which I agreed to unless they could cut my hours. I guess they still want me around, which is nice. But now, they changed my schedule so I am only working for four hours on Saturdays. Tomorrow is my last 8h shift and then I switch to just working the four hours once a week. It's against company policy and what is written in the company policy book so I am a little confused but I got what I wanted, so I am not complaining. 
I am happy to move on to the next page too! 
Thank you for your support,

Hi Mentee,
OMG, just *reading* that has me overwhelmed LOL. You do what you need to do and I'll be here for you at anytime! If I could give some advice from when I was working part-time in high school, it would definitely be what you're already doing, which is reducing your hours during the week (and resigning when it's just too much!). Especially when it comes crunch time for assignments before winter break but everyone and their mom is also shopping for the holidays, you wanna make sure you make enough time for yourself, school, activities, and friends/family. Again, just keep in mind that your supervisor could serve as one of your references should you apply for things in the future like scholarships, co-ops, other jobs, etc., so it's always good to leave on the best note you can!
And you're right ! While I didn't have a Capstone project during high school, I am aware that some graduate programs will have a Capstone project versus having students write a thesis... So I think that's really cool they're implementing these early on in BC high school curriculums now, so you know a bit of what to expect if you pursue a masters degree that has this option.
Okay, I don't know how they do this mentor-mentee matching system, but I'm so happy we got paired together! I took Biomedical Ethics at UVic, which was a course that analyzed Canadian case studies against the IMIA's Fundamental Ethical Principles (just scroll a bit to Part I. A. Fundamental Ethical Principles (https://imia-medinfo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMIA-Code-of-Ethics-2016.pdf)). The reason I'm bringing this up is because if you were looking for additional resources to reach out to, you could also consider chatting with medical ethicists, who might have valuable answers to your questions from an ethical/law perspective. Additionally, feel free to reach out to University of Victoria labs and professors to cast your net wider for a response! 
While I didn't study Biology, I hope some of these links help you out  :

Hello,
It's taken me a while to reply, things have been hectic in my life. I feel like I have so little time to sit down and when I do sit down I feel like there are millions of things I should be doing instead. I am planning on going into work tomorrow after school and asking them to cut my hours so I'm not working 16 hours a week and if they are not willing to cut my hours, I am going to hand in my resignation letter (that's the plan at least), so that has been stressing me out a lot!
I like what you mentioned for the third discussion question about contacting people in feilds I am interested in pursuing. I'm working on my Capstone project (I don't think Capstone existed when you were in high school because it is only a couple years old, it's basically a huge passion project that you need to complete to graduate). My Capstone question is 'How can CRISPR gene-editing technology be used to eradicate Ebola?', it's a huge question and I have 3 months to figure it out (part of why I am so busy), a key aspect of the Capstone project is reaching out to people, getting mentors who are experts in the feild of your Capstone and networking in areas that may be specific to you future. Ironically enough, I just finished emailing a bunch of people from a couple labs at UBC seeing if I could ask them questions and learn about their experiences with CRISPR teachnology. I've emailed 11 people over the past two weeks and one only one person has replied but I have many more people I am going to email before the month is over. 
Thank you for your advice on post-secondary applications! The tip about quality over quanty for ECs and volunteer postitions is very relatable! We're told to 'get involved' that 'universities love when you do lots besides school'. I'm really seeing that that's not realistic and you don't gain as much when you have a high quantity of things with low quality.
What's next? Have we completed the disscusion topic?
your mentee,
Mentee",9:12PM October 20
Mentor commented at,"5:44PM October 16 
It's me again!
Now let's talk... Post-secondary applications!
Have you ever watched some of those ""College Decision Reaction"" videos on YouTube? Although most of them are for American schools (though you can find some Canadian videos too), I still find them so wholesome since we can understand how stressful the college application process can be and the relief once it's over. However, what can be especially valuable about these videos are what comes after the reaction - Sometimes, successful applicants will make a ""stats"" video on what grades, extra curriculars (ECs), essays, and other aspects of their application that helped them stand out and make the cut.
As I'm also considering pursuring additional studies, if I could offer you some advice and tips regarding making a competitive applicaiton, it'd be what I've also researched and am trying to apply too!:
1. Highlight your story and what makes you ""you""
Like I mentioned in my earlier post, you know yourself best. File reviewers will see thousands of applications come every school year, and while grades are significant, your own experiences and the perspective you bring is valuable in distinguishing you from the crowd.
For example, how could you tie living in a rural community and the experiences that come with it, into your essay? How have your life experiences shaped you to the student and person you are today, and how can you effectively convey this in your application?
2. Personalize your application to each college and program of interest
Similar to how you send a customized cover letter to each job, take the time to learn about the school(s) and program(s) you're interested in, and how you could tailor your application to fit as a prospective student there. As you're interested in the health sciences, I believe it would be helpful to especially highlight the ECs, volunteering, and hobbies that best showcase your forward-thinking approach to a career in health care/science.
3. Have strong references
This is not only applicable for applying to university, but for applications once you're already in, such as applying for co-op placements, scholarships, internships, research positions, and more. Having someone who knows you well and can speak well on your behalf is incredibly beneficial - My past co-op supervisors have told me that my references were what helped them in making their final decision to make me their co-op student. So it's never too early to start networking and building those bridges!
Some references you could seek could be: Your part-time job supervisor, volunteer coordinator, a teacher who knows you well, etc.
4. Take part in ECs and volunteer positions that make your soul smile :)
I was initially guilty of going about volunteerism and ECs for the wrong reasons. I was too focused on quantity versus quality, trying to fill in all of the gaps in my application that I felt that I was weak in. But now, I'm much happier with how I'm spending my time and efforts... All the while still building a portfolio I can be proud of! Pursuing the hobbies and volunteer positions that you can speak genuinely about come across much more authentic, and of course, are much more fun to take part in, versus those that are more for CV padding. Don't spread yourself out too thin, and take the time to find out what initiatives are really meaningful to you, and seek the positions from there. I only found ReMBC during my last year of university, but it's been my favorite volunteer position by far, as mentorship and youth initatives are two things I am passionate about. If you were looking for a virtual volunteer position in the future, I'd highly recommend coming back to ReMBC as a mentor! You definitely have what it takes!
 
Unfortunately, I don't have much advice for reducing the anxiety that comes with post-secondary applications, as I too, was scrambling on hours of sleep to send those transcripts, essays, getting my references ready, etc. We can only do our part by applying early, giving ourselves and our references enough time to respond, and putting our best efforts forward. 4 years seems like a long time in university, but 4 years also seemed like a long time going from grade 9 to grade 12, right? Time will pass you by no matter what, so you might as well be present in the moment and (try) to enjoy the process as much as you can! You're going to achieve amazing things, Mentee! ​​​​​​​ I believe in you!

Hi Mentee,
Whistler! How fun! I hope there will be more opportunities during winter break to have more trips like that . My answers did get quite lengthy for this conversation, so I've split them into two posts: (1) Answering all of the Conversation questions and (2) answering your personal questions you left for me!
Please find the Post-Secondary Considerations Conversation questions and my answers below: 
Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? 
Like you, I explored all of these resources prior to this Conversation. :) And like you said, there are so many careers that don't get much exposure, and thus, aren't readily considered as career options. I'd say that there are also opportunities to apply the skills you learned in your degree into a different field. For example, I know of a Health Information Science alumni who went into the field of finance, my friend who graduated with me went into government work... There are always opportunities to apply your skills into different areas, so long as they are transferable. Say you were interested in taking a research internship for instance, you could describe how the skills your learned from your Business Communications course could be beneficial for the team during the interview (e.g. You could act as a scribe for meetings), which helps you stand out from other students applying to the same internship.
How important is the expected salary to the career path you choose?
Insightful answer! Likewise, I don't believe you could pay me any amount of money to work 8+ hours of my day unhappy and unsatisifed. I am, however, mindful of job satisfaction and its relation to salary, location, job prospects, and stability though. While having a stable, comfortable salary is beneficial, is there room for advancement in this career/field? If promoted, are the additional responsibilities scaled to a higher wage? Workplace culture, learning opportunities, and growth are important factors to me and are what I especially look for in future opportunites - Do you have certain factors you look for in a prospective career?
If the career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option? 
While I haven't had the opportunity to study microbiology yet, I have had the pleasure of taking an epidemiology course, and I'm happy you're looking into a possible career in it! Using this as an example, additional ways you could explore this option and learn more about what a career in epidemiology entails could mean networking with epidemiologists, or getting in contact with graduate schools or graduate students taking their Masters in epidemiology. While I'm sure many of these people are quite busy right now during the pandemic, it never hurts to ask (and often, they are happy to guide you to the answers and resources you're looking for). Additionally, reaching out to those who have already taken epidemiology or microbiology courses is a quick way to get a student perspective on courses of interest. Like I mentioned earlier, I took a course called Epidemiology, Population Health, and Public Health. It was such a cool mix of using statistics to determine disease occurrence and learning how study designs can be effective in disease prevention and health promotion! Paired with this course was also a computer lab, where we used programs like SAS to visualize and analyze statistical data - If you take such a course in the future, I hope you like it too!
How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Ask your mentor to share their experience with how to handle difficult school subjects. 
Again, I loved your answer to this! While it's not necessarily important to be immediately ""good"" at a subject, I believe these subjects are associated with that career path for a reason. Taking the example above: 
You do not need to take a STEM undergraduate program to get into medical school (e.g. ViolinMD on YouTube is a Canadian medical resident who majored in music before pursuing medicine!). However biology in on the MCAT, a test that is largely used by many medical schools in establishing cut-off scores for successful matriculants. So while struggling in Biology now doesn't mean to count medical school out entirely in the future, it's important to consider that: In the short term, biology will be an expected outcome within your 3-4 years of medical school, and in the long term, the life-long learning aspect of medicine will include biology.
Also, as you thoughtfully mentioned, everyone is capable of learning. We will all come across subjects that don't come to us as innately as others; What is important is how we process these hardships. How I could recommend handling difficult school subjects is to balance your workload to how much you can handle. You know yourself best, and what's awesome about university is that semesters are customizable and flexible (so long as the course you're interested in taking is offered during the times you intend to take it). If you recognize ahead of time that a notoriously difficult course is coming up in your first semester, stacked with all of your core sciences, it wouldn't be a bad idea to move that difficult course to your less ""heavy"" second semester for more balance.
More to come shortly!

Hello,
I hope you had a good long weekend! Mine was super busy (I went to Whistler) and I’m just getting back into the rhythm of things. 
I read through the text and looked at the different websites. Nothing was super new to me since I’ve already used some of the programs (such as BC Education Planner) or alternative programs.
To answer the questions:
Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? 
I did not. There wasn’t any new information since we learned about all this at school. The work we did with the program MyBluePrint introduced me to more career options (this was in grade 10). My interest was sparked when I discovered that there are possible careers for things that I've found interesting, I just didn't know they existed before.
How important is the expected salary to the career path you choose? 
I don’t want to constantly stress about money, I want to be financially stable and comfortable but I don’t need to be extremely wealthy. I also don’t want to do a job that makes me miserable just for the money. It’s not worth it to be paid very well just to be miserable every day.
If the career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option? 
I am interested in the health sciences (microbiology/epidemiology/virology/immunology/infectious disease). At my school, we used MyBluePrint for planning out what we wanted to do (as mentioned above). It was a good way to get reliable information including if it is/will be in demand, education required,  salary, and what schools/institutions offered the education needed. It’s how I found out about epidemiology and learnt that there is a possible future for me in the health sciences. I had a 94% match with a microbiologist and a 91% match with an epidemiologist.
How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Ask your mentor to share their experience with how to handle difficult school subjects. 
I am interested in pursuing an academic career. Being good at maths, sciences, etc… are important to be successful. I do believe that it matters more if you enjoy the class more than your academic success. For example, last school year I took Business Communications (Keyboarding), I gained good skills, I can type fast, and I got a good grade, but the careers involving that include things like a secretary. Just because I was good at the class does not mean it’s something a want or should be doing. I liked it because it was easy, but it was also boring a lot of the time. I firmly believe you can learn anything, some things just take more time and I’m not going to give up on something just because it’s difficult and I’m struggling.
what are your experiences with this?
 
I am getting started on my applications for post-secondary schools, it’s kinda overwhelming, do you have any advice and tips for perfecting my applications and increasing my chances of getting into my choice of schools? The resources provided by my school are lacking so I’m figuring out a lot of this on my own (and with Google!). Do you have any advice to make this experience less stressful too?
 
Enjoy the rest of your week, 
Mentee",7:45PM October 13

Hi Mentee,
I hope this long weekend has given you much needed time with your family and friends, ample rest, and plenty of food!  Thank you for your patience as I got Post-Secondary Considerations opened for us.
While all of the conversations we'll discuss on this platform are meant to be an encompassing guide to your post-secondary journey, I believe the one we're about to start on this page may be one of the most (if not the most) significant. I hope you'll get a lot of value from it!
Before diving into the anchor text, I'd love to give you a bit of background of my own experience with choosing post-secondary schools. Then, as we get into the nitty gritty of exploring institutions and career options, you'll have a better idea of how I got to where I am today. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to message them below!:
Upon reaching high school graduation, while I knew I wanted to go into the sciences (STEM), I just wasn't certain on a particular stream of STEM that would lead me to my educational (and eventual career) goals. This, on top of financial and personal considerations, I ultimately decided taking a gap year was for my best interests. 
During this gap year, I explored the exact resources provided on this page, as well as looked at the websites of the post-secondary programs I was interested in - Even out of province ones. While many schools offer the same programs, there are also factors to consider like location, cost, program competitiveness, pre-requisites, campus, environment, etc. 
While I initially had thoughts of studying in an institution (BCIT), ultimately, my post-secondary journey led me to my local college taking university-transferrable courses in a ""University Transfer"" program. After accumulating enough credits to transfer out, I landed at the University of Victoria's Health Information Science program, and the rest is history LOL.
While that was a very brief overview, again, as we explore the anchor text more, I'll be happy to go into more details as applicable to any questions you may have! 
Let's get to post-secondary considering! (Does this even make sense?! Hahaha)
