project, but don't let that deter you. Hopefully this turns into something cool, and if not, then
its still counted as school work (awesome). Oop my name is Evan by the way, probably should have
lead with that, but you probably know that anyways what with the email system. Anywho, I suppose we
have to do some convo starters. It's saying that I get to choose, so here we go. Food for thought
sounds good. I'm actually just about to start making some kickass brownies right now, but I figured
homework would probably be the best way to start things out. I'm not actually a fan of chocolate,
but I figured I'd give the brownies a go. Fingers crossed. For my favorite song/artist I would have
to go with vivaldi's ""les quatres saisons: L'hiver."" Vivaldi is an amazing composer. Well that was a
super basic convo starter, but it'll do. Hope you enjoy brownies, cause I'll probably end up sending
you some pics. Have a good weekend, and bye. I really hope this isn't going to be marked. ... Bye

you can call me Stasia if you'd like. It's all good that you're mostly just doing this because it
counts as school - I'd honestly do the same thing lol! This is my first time being an Ementor so I'm
a little nervous but also excited, I'll try to do the best I can. :) That's cool you're making
brownies! Do you often like to bake? It's funny, I'm sort of the opposite of you, I love chocolate
but brownies are my least favourite among the chocolate family. But I'd love to see a pic of your
finished brownies! I haven't heard of Vivaldi before but I'll definitely give them a listen. :) I
currently am eating some instant ramen, because uni life. But I'm going to try to actually cook
something for dinner tonight, probably jambalaya - I make it with lentils, tomatoes, and rice.
Sounds kinda boring but I promise it tastes good. Especially with a lot of spice added. As for a
song I really enjoy, lately I've had ""Cradles"" by Sub Urban on repeat. I saw in your bio that you
love writing too! What kind of stuff do you like to write? (If you feel like sharing). You probably
already looked at my bio too, but I'm also a writer - I really like writing poetry but I'm also
working on a novel in the modern fantasy genre. In my handy dandy little Ementor guide, it told me
know I should let you know when I can respond to messages. I check my email pretty regularly so I
should be able to respond within a few hours most of the time; but I do generally work friday,
saturday, and sunday so on those days I might take a little longer to respond if you happen to
message me. Okay, that's probably enough for now lol. I hope you enjoy your brownies &amp; have a
good rest of your day!",Mentor,"Posts in {""en""=>""Program

books, but I've never met anyone IRL who has it. Although I suppose I still haven't met anyone IRL
that has it. Hmm. I could count you as half an IRL Anastasia how about that. Are you doing this for
school as well, or just free time? If it's just in your free time then thats pretty awesome of you.
I don't think I would volenteer my time to an indolent rapscallion such as myself in your shoes.
Alright I got to tell you, I've never had brownies before. But (yes there is a but) I plan to fix
that. Most people get mad at me when I say that, so it's a relief to hear you don't like them haha.
I don't bake much at all, so it could get messy. Hope it's not too bad, although nobody is home rn
so there will be no witnesses. ... Except my dog. Anyways, cradle is a pretty great song. I listen
to it too:) My tastes are pretty eclectic, so I have everything from pop to jazz to rock to
classical. Everything except counrty tbh. *Shivers in disgust* Vivaldi was a pretty popular
classical composer way back in the day, so I'm not surprised you don't know him. Not too many people
do. Nice on the writing! I don't do poetry too much unless its a assignment, in which case I pull
out liberal amounts of BS from my back pocket. That, along with a splash of cool vocabulary tends to
get the job done. I finished editing my book a month or so ago, and am awaiting my faithful servants
(parents, teachers, and friends) to finish proof reading it. They aren't very fast I gotta say. They
finish it and then remember they have to edit. Pretty frusterating, cause I was hoping to send it in
a while ago. But you know, its just time to relax I suppose. I don't do much creative writing to be
honest. I just kind of jumped straight into a book from nothing, which was a very very very steep
learning curve. Re-reading the first few chapters after I finished was agony. This has gotten a bit
long, so I'll end it here. Two quick questions before I leave though, I read she/her on you profile
but just figured I'd confirm it before messing it up. After reading that sentance I realise that
wasn't worded as a question, but I don't want to delete my beautiful creation, so I'm just putting a
question mark here and calling the last sentance a question? Next up is are you alright with
profanity? You're like 24 so I hope so, but it never hurts to confirm. Your ever faithful web

either, we seem to be a rare species. And I'm just doing this as a volunteer, but it seemed like a
fun opportunity. ""Indolent rapscallion"" I quite like that haha. I definitely see why you're also a
writer! Aweee you have a doggo!! Name?? I have two cats, their names are Misha and Sochi. Misha is a
diabetic princess while Sochi is a cuddly goofball. I don't think brownies can be too messed up -
worst comes to worse, you have some mushy warm chocolate. Okay that actually sounds kinda weird, so
nevermind. Eyyy it's cool that you know cradles too!! I feel the exact same about music; I just
don't understand how people like country music lmao. Lately I've been listening to more alt rock
music, but I really enjoy a wide variety as well. It's insanely cool that you've finished a novel
already!! That takes sooo much work. Mine is... a mess. I have everything planned out for it, but
it's hard for me to find time for the actual writing. I hope your fam and friends will get their
edits done soon and you can start sending it in!! That's so exciting. And I know exactly what you
mean about rereading old stuff. It's like, oof, I really did that?? Haha, it's all apart of the
process though. Thank you for checking! I go by both she/her and they/them. Either is fine with me.
Just to check, yours are he/him? :) And yes! Profanity is okay with me - Admittedly, I curse far too
much in my daily life. I spent longer than I care to admit trying to think of a cool sign off but

Twangy twangy please kill my ears already. I have a bunch of friends who are in the exact same boat
as you are: all the planning done without the bulk of the manual labour. I completely bypassed that

to edit, but I didn't get stuck in that quasi state. Win some lose some. Excellent on the swearing

What a dope character to be named after. I hope he appreciates it. Damn, I really admire your drive
when it comes to writing! Back when I was still a teenager I could run off 3 hours of sleep and be
fine but now if I do that I become a literal walking zombie who can't function at all, so I usually
try to get as much sleep as possible lol. I actually just made the recent decison to quit my job
though so I have more time to focus on writing - and school too of course. Lmao I'm really not the
party type - I've always been more of an introvert and into the staying home and spending time with
my cats kind of life. Buuuut I do have some friends from work and we'll all go out for dinner or a
movie night together when we can find time! I gotta go out at least some times and remind myself
there's a whole world out there. I'm one of those weirdos who actually likes school, so I'm really
enjoying university! Plus it helps to be in a program that I love. It's soooooo nice to be on campus
again too - last year was pretty tough with it all being online. Being in English classes, though,
is a shit ton of reading and writing. Luckily there hasn't been anything major due yet though, so
I'm staying pretty on top of things. For now. Ask me in a few weeks and I might be drowning. I have
4 classes right now; two of them I really enjoy because the professors are really into hearing what
us students think about the texts, like what stood out to us or seems important, because I like
being able to share what I connected to in the text. In one of my other classes though, the prof
just lectures and asks very direct questions - more of like yes/no answers - and it's just kinda
annoying because I want to share my own opinion, not just listen to hers. How's school going for
you? Are you in your last year? :) Also - if you want to, we can hit the ""Working through this

ready if you're ready :) Okay, I think I got a cool sign off figured out: Ba la la la ~ ~ *

boy so it doesn't bother me. Quitting your job sounds like quite the investement into writing, hope
it works out! And honestly for me it was more about perseverance than anything skill related, so
more time should hopefully help. What do I know though, college sounds busy. You totally radiate
party vibes, you can't hide the truth from me. Jk, being an introvert is pretty nice. I count myself
among their number. You don't have to to much, and it just makes life easier haha. Since I want to
keep talking to you, I'm going to ignore what you just said about enjoying school. Otherwise I would
be duty bound to exit this website, stop talking to you, and probably fail this assignment. School
is super chill for me right now, last year alright. Classes are easy, people don't bug me, and now
if anyone gets in my way in the hallways they move around me instead of the other way around. Small
miracles I guess. I am unsure what we actually have to do for the working through the program stuff.

centralized communication system is there. I guess We talk about this subject here and others in
other places. Fragmented, but who cares. Anyways. Hello! Been a while. Not really, but a while. Yup.
Anywho, we get to discuss the topic with the prompts provided I suppose. I really wasn't expecting
agency in the world to be turned into a feel-good lesson about how being an outcast is okay. That
threw me off a bit, but otherwise I thought it was a good ted talk. I personally don't struggle with
looking at myself as an outcast, one of the many many priviledges and responsabilities of a
proffesional introvert. Sometimes at lunch I used to sneak into the library and write away, which
help the overarching goal of that time to finish the book. I handle the ""outcast feelings"" as they
were by not thinking about, or having them. It's a simple solution, yet quite effective. The
relationship between grit and agency is quite important imo. How can you accomplish things or have
liberty to do what you want without having the determination and results to back it up? Although,
grit really does apply to pretty much everything if you want to do it well. It does, however, apply
quite nicely to agency in that regard. Hope thats enough for now, see you when I see you Ba la la

so we talk about one subject at a time without getting too off track. I also agree that that Ted
talk wasn't what I was expecting, but I really liked it - I hadn't really thought about how
important having a community or connections are to your own success. Ahahah as a fellow introvert, I
relate. I don't necessarily think of myself as a social outcast - I am part of the LGBTQ+ community,
but since I am white and present fem I've never experienced any kind of discrimination that I know
many others of more marginalized groups experience. I am privileged in that way. And 100% I agree
you gotta have grit in order to accomplish things. I think it's so important to not only have the
passion for something but also the determination to see it through. I like how he mentioned that
asking for help is a part of grit too. I think too often the narrative is pushed that asking for
help is weak, but how the heck are you supposed to get anywhere without at least some help? I think
recognizing that others - especially friends and family, and even teachers - WANT to help (at least
the good ones). Like when you mentioned your friends and fam are helping edit your book - editing by
yourself would be a lot harder. I'm always sending my writing to my friends for critiques too.
Sometimes having that fresh perspective is just exactly what you need. And someone else might be
able to open a door for you for publication that you wouldn't have been able to open by yourself.
Okay, I'll stop rambling for now lol. I hope my thoughts don't come across too sporadic, I've had

us to really understand everyones position on stuff like this, which is one of the points of the
video. And true, what would we do without a support to back us up. I wouldn't be anything like I am
now without my parents. I can't even imagine what life would be like if I had nobody to rely on.
Which is kind of the point of agency in the world, you have more freedom but less support. As a
white male, there's really only a very low lying sort of discrimination thats hard to push back
against. It's nowhere near what others experience though, so I'm grateful for that. Ikr! Grit is the
mango to life's milkshake. Essential, flavourful, and orange. Before you ask, the analysis is
completely accurate. On a side note, I've only ever had coffee once or twice, and both times it
sucked. I'm more of a kombucha guy myself; a preference that everone around me despises. Do you have
insta? It's a platform that I certainly check more often than this, if you want to chat on there. Ba

only who I am now because of people who have helped me. Although, I do think it's still up to us to
have the determination to grow and change, even with others' help. There are some people who get all
the help in the world, but they don't have any determination for themselves, so they never really
get anywhere. I think that's the grit part again. You gotta have the mango-y, gritty goodness if you
want a good ass milkshake of life. Oooo kombucha! A man of culture I see. And no, I shall not
apologize for that pun. I've tried kombucha but it really isn't my thing. Is there a specific brand
you like? Maybe I'll try it again. I tend to be more of a tea person, but now with school started
again and more early mornings I've unfortunately gotten back into more heavily caffeinated drinks.

how everyone had such different responses and ideas is so cool too. I could see teachers doing this
in a creative writing class - and I'd be one of the students all over it haha. I really like what
the first speaker said - about if you are partaking in creation, you have intention. Sometimes when
I go to write - especially poetry - I don't necessarily have an intention I can put into words, but
I just feel like I NEED to write. And then after some playing around with words, something will
emerge that I latch onto and can write an entire poem from. I think it's interesting how you can
have that intention without even knowing exactly what it is, it might just be a fleeting feeling,
but something in you is like I GOTTA GET THIS OUT and create something. I love the process of
creation - I like losing track of time because I'm so focused on creating. At times like that it
really makes me feel like this is what I'm MEANT to be doing. Do you ever feel like that with
writing too? Or is your process different when deciding to write? :) Ba la la, Stasia",Mentor,"Posts in {""en""=>""Finding

But don't worry, I didn't just do it to you. Sometimes I just fall out of contact with people for a
couple of weeks at a time. I really do enjoy our talks, I just messed this one up. I'm typing this
out right now with my dog going nuts beside me hoping for food, and I can't feel my mouth. Man does
getting wisdom teeth taken out suck or what. Anywho, I don't neccesarily agree with the idea that
intention MUST be a key component of creation. Creation, at it's most base form, is giving life to
something, putting a piece of yourself into it. That doesn't translate into needing a specific
intention. Take a doodle for example. It's a creation, yet you likely had no intention behind it
when you started. This example could be called the lazy method. It's so small and inconsequential,
that intention is not needed. Makes sense. You don't have to put effort into it, so there's no
investment. I would argue that larger projects like books could be created without intention as
well. Personally I just let it go. (Yes I'm legally intoxicated from getting the teeth done and am
watching Frozen.) While I had the intention to finish the project, I would discount that as
irrelevant to our point. I felt the need to write consistently almost to the point where it ached,
so I did. Mostly on a paragraph by paragraph basis, without an overall driving goal or desire. (That
came back to bite me in the ass on the editing stage.) It is a bit tricky to continue a cohesive
large scale project without intention, but is by no means impossible. Now my teeth hurt, I have ice
cream to eat, and I must unpause Frozen. As much as I love our scintilating conversations, I must
depart to better things. Onwards and upwards as they say. Don't feel bad. It's hard to compete with

appreciate your point of view! Creating soemthing is like gicing life to it and giving it a little
piece of yourself. In one of my classes today the professor talked about how what you create/your
content is like a representation of you. You created it and it is like an extension of yourself. And
because you're alive, it becomes alive in a way too. Also, I like what you said about feeling the
need to write until it ached. It's really cool to talk to another writer, because I feel like you

done all I can for the day so Imma table it for tomorrow. Oof, that sounds painful! I'll really try
not to do the same, but if I do at least I know I'll have someone to talk to who understands the
pain. I hope you're feeling better now! I know what you mean about trying to finish one thing before
starting another! Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to stop my brain from attempting it anyway. I
have way too many projects on the go, but I'm going to try to focus on the one I'm most excited
about once I'm done my last shift at work. Nice!! Do you have a notebook specifically for notes? I
use a notebook to record little thoughts, observations, drafts, quotes, really anything that
inspires me or even if I just feel like writing about my day. I find it really handy to have
something to go back to to revisit old ideas or a promising draft. Hahaha your friends sound like a
lot of fun. And I mean, sometimes it's entertaining to be around people like that - or be a person
like that yourself - and just have a break from life. :) Ba la la, Stasia",Mentor,"Posts in {""en""=>""Finding

it. Unfortunately it's full of writing now, so when I recieved a notebook as a gift, I thought to
use that instead. Mostly though I just log onto the docs for the next novel and put stuff on that. I
have a friend who has too many projects on the go right now, and she's never going to finish any of

good grades, so this is such a great choice. I thought the idea of splitting up the time that you
use for studying into blocks and jumping between subjects were two particularly cool concepts.
Hopefully I'll be able to employ them in the future. Fingers crossed. Hows life treating you? I feel
like we've been talking about the modules and stuff so much that we haven't really had a

feel like so mnay kids would do much better in school if they were told about these things earlier!
I agree, switching up the subjects and taking breaks is really important! I sometimes try to go for
a little walk outside in between studying and it really helps just to get some fresh air and let
your brain chill for a few minutes. Life's going alright!! Misha has been doing okay, she's a pretty
stubborn cat lmao and I've just been doing everything I can to keep her comfy and happy. As for new
music, I've mostly just been listening to halsey's new album, I particularily like ""bells in santa

of haunting vibe to it that I enjoy. How about you? Any new tunes? Are you doing anything for
Halloween? I'm just spending the night in with my aunt and uncle and probably going to eat pizza and

again while trying to avoid studying. I feel like if I went on walks while studying I would probably
forget to finish tbh. Good to hear about Misha! Stubborn pets are adorable. For Halloween I really
just stayed at a friends place and handed out candy as his mom got wasted with the rest of the

included this here and you guys at the high school level get to learn about this stuff. I don't
think I knew what ""self-care"" even was during my high school years, especially Grade 12. Everyone I
knew was in the mindset of being as productive as possible and getting 3, 4 hours of sleep was
normal, something to brag about even. And at that age, to me ""self-care"" was seen as self-indulgence
and selflish. Which it obviosuly isn't, but it took me a few years to let go of that negative
mindset and realize self care is a priority and knowing that yourself first isn't selfish. I really
liked, ""Self care is basic to your well-being. It is not an “extra” or a special treat that you give
yourself only after all of your work is done."" That really just changed how I look at self care. I
still often fall into the habit of making self care a reward for getting work done versus it being a
priority and I want to change. When it comes to self-care for me, I feel like sometimes each day has
different self care needs. Somedays yes, it's self care to makie sure you get up on time and eat a
healthy breakfast and do some exercise. But I think that self care is also giving yourself an extra
hour to sleep when you need it. Or once in a while going to get that greasy hashbrown for breakfast
because it's your favourite and it brings you joy. I think self care is listening to your body and
your mind's intuition and getting more in touch with what you personally need on that day. You know
- balance haha. What about you? Do you already practice some self care, or is this a new concept?
I'm also curious if your friends in Grade 12 ever talk about this stuff! Hope you're having a good
day! Also - your birthday sounded super fun and chill, as birthdays should be. :) Ba la la,

difference between self-care and being lazy. Cause being productive is super important, but it
shouldn't be detracting from your overall health. Self care is trying to maintain that balance
between the two I feel, while lazyness could be detracting from both. As such, self-care should
definitely be looked at as a positive thing instead of mispercieved as lazyness. Making that
difference clear should be a priority. YES Self care shouldn't be a reward. Unless it is. Huh. How
do you decide whether it's a reward or if it's just caring about yourself? Cause like you accomplish
something and want to reward yourself with a snacky snak, then that could just be a reward instead
of self care. Self care I feel is all about maintaining your state of being, while a reward might be
that little extra that makes you that little extra happy. *Looks at greasy hashbrown aggresively*
I'll admit right now that I'm really really bad at this. Self care and studying are probably my two
worst things in my life haha. A lot of the time I don't feel like I deserve self care, which can get
a bit sketchy when I'm spiralling into a not-so-greasy-hashbrown place. ... Anywho! It was certainly

sorry for my later than normal response, been a few pretty packed days! Absolutely agreed! some
people view taking care of themself as selfish or lazy, when true self care is neither of those
things. And those people probably need self care the most lol. Hmmm that's a good point. I think
rewards can be a part of self care, as long as they're not detracting from your overall health, like
the point you made. If you're rewarding yourself for studying every hour with a handful of candy,
for example, that isn't going to be good for your overall health and care, even if it makes you
happy in the moment. I totally think once in a while is okay though because let's face it, candy is
delicious and can give a sweet serotonin rush. Unless you don't like candy, and in that instance:
[insert treat you like here]. I think figuring out how to balance things and have things in
moderation is a part of self care. I think another part of it is making the time to rest or do the
things you love without feeling bad or like you should be ""productive"" instead. Adequate rest and
relaxation time is key to overall health as well. I'm really trying to get better at this myself,
and not get mad at myself when I need a rest and just want to watch a show or something. Because
sometimes your brain needs that no thinking time to then be able to think properly again. I know
what you mean about feeling like you don't deserve it. It's so maddening how our brains do this to
us. Like no shut up you clump of cells I AM deserving of self care, whether I feel like I am or not.
Something that's helped me get through days like that is making sure to do basic self care anyway,
like making sure to shower and eat, because sometimes just doing things like that for yourself can
help you break out of the I-don't-deserve-this mentality. or even just telling yourself things like
""*I am worthy"" even if you don't believe it yet. It might sound cheesy but I swear it can help. My

Seriously, shout out to that teacher for getting your project in! And just think... This is just the beginning with your Capstone. Imagine when you do future research projects, presentations, etc. I can't wait to read your future publications one day. ;)) Speaking of practicing presenting, while I'm not sure how prevalent presentations are in more STEM based courses, I had a professor who made sure to have final presentations in every one of her class. There was a dress code (business casual), time limit (&lt;10 minutes), slide limit, and besides her own marking, she would have random peers in our class evaluate our presentation skills. While this was absolutely nervewracking, she made a point that she wanted to prepare us for the future when we would have to stand in front of professionals and present our work - better to gain experience practicing with our peers as students.

Sorry about your old laptop though :( Updates from the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair: 1) there was HUGE student interest in my project, there was over 200 project and so many people were talking about mine. When I would meet new people, they would ask what my project was and I would tell them and they would say things like ""oh you're the one who did that? People are talking about it on the other side of the room!"" ""Oh, I heard about your project."" Etc... 2) I won bronze! I liked that I gained respect for my ideas from people who understood my ideas. I also enjoyed proving myself, people realized that they shouldn't underestimate me or my idea just because I don't go to a private school or I haven't done IB/AP (my school doesn't offer it). I like the idea of a presentation final project but it depends on the class. I can imagine some of the presentations would be boring. It would be great practice though. Ways of Knowing This is not what I was expeting for this topic. What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? You can study something as much as you want, but living the experience/living in the place is completely different. You could read everything about a place but when you live there for a bit you learn about the people, the customs, the hidden places, where to go/where to avoid. I think when you live somewhere you can understand it on a much deeper level. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor No? How might know the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? It might encourage us to be more thoughtful about how we use it. From my understanding, indigenous people were very good at running the land they lived on and the habitats around it, perhaps we would benefit from incorporating some of those into our lives. Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Scientific knowledge is viewed as better and more advanced but I think that they can often be viewed together. One type of knowledge isnt better than the other, both have pros and cons and they can be better when combined. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledge working together? They conflict with each other because people think science has no traditional knowledge. People like to reject the past when thinking of science, yet traditional knowledge tends to contain science without clearly stating the science behind it. ( I heard this somewhere, Im going off memory, might not be 100% accurate) Indigenous people would/will only peel the bark off certain sides of the trees because certain sides (i forget which) are needed more to protect the tree and if you damage the tree on those sides it will have a higher chance of dying. The reason some sides are more susceptible is that weather is harsher from certain directions, the sun shines from east to west (more growth where the sun shines), etc Where does this program find these videos? These past few have been very niche. Your mentee, Rachel",Mentee,Posts in Ways of Knowing

Congratulations on your bronze, and again, this is just the beginning! If you recall a few conversations ago, we talked about getting into research at the start of undergrad: Certain schools distribute research awards across their faculties, where students receive a stipend to conduct research with their professor(s) and a chance to present their findings (Like UVic's JCURA). There are also awards like the NSERC / USRA that are nationally awarded in Canada, which can help fund your research as an undergraduate student too. As you start your studies and begin reaching out to potential professors / P.I.'s, keep awards and grants like these in mind! Not only do I think you'd be a strong candidate to win these research awards, but having formal presentation experience + an established interest in research can help you stand out as a prospective research assistant to your future professors. Just keep your head up and keep trying (as securing funding for anything can be so iffy)! I think no matter where we go, we always run the chance of meeting those who undermine others. But you've got a strong foundation and you've got something to prove! You just keep doing what's important to you, and I know it'll pay off. :) Haters can just stay in their lane lol. - - What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? I totally agree with your answer on this one. I said this during one of my interviews - It's one thing to study a patient's chart, but it's another to actually handle it. Living on the land exposes you to lived experiences, whereas studying the land can only immerse you so much. However, there is value in both experiences, it's just a matter on what you are trying to achieve. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor. ""No?"" LOL. Your answer cracked me up, but honestly, I don't think I have any stories either. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? Totally with you on this one! When I visited Halifax a few years ago, I noticed their trees were so much smaller than on the westcoast. While I'm not entirely certain on the history behind the reason, it would definitely make me think twice before cutting one down for resources (From memory, I remember being told it was due to logging / an accident that affected the trees? Correct me if I'm wrong tho.) Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I think ""scientific"" knowledge is more accepted than ""traditional"" knowledge when it comes to standard science / studies. I think there is more openness to different types of knowledge, and with that comes more opportunities to collaborate with others and advance our studies together. There doesn't have to be a divide between ""science"" and ""tradition"", when we can start building a history utilizing both. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledges working together? When you think of scientific knowledge, you think objectivity, you think quantitative, and you think replicable. You can't express sig figs differently from one person to the next, because no matter how you experience science, it's typically stable. I hope that makes sense. However, with traditional knowledge, this comes with experience. This comes with stories, with trials and errors, and the feelings that take part in that. I feel there is a conflict between the two, because as you said, people may reject one in favour of the other - In reality, there is truth behind both and nobody is necessarily in the right or in the wrong. In the video, they often expressed ""living"" and ""being"" as themselves in that land. I thought that was very insightful. You can live anywhere you wish in the world, but could you ""be"" yourself? ... Maybe these videos are getting to me hahahaha. Happy pre-Friday! ;) Your mentor, Mary",Mentor,Posts in Ways of Knowing

While I've done it before pre-pandemic, some countries having restrictions and certain requirements (i.e. uploading time-sensitive information onto country travel databases) makes it a different process! Just something to keep in mind if you or someone you know plans to travel soon! Hm... I'm not sure how available stipends or grants may be for freshmen (that's something you'll have to explore within your uni and discuss with your undergraduate counsellor), but if I were in your shoes, I would first look into building familiarity and rapport with a professor. For example, this is how I approached my professor for research: While in their class, they had mentioned to everyone that if any student was interested in... Say, social determinants of health, to speak with them personally. I sent them an email, introducing myself as a student in their class, who was interested in their lecture regarding the social determinants of health, and if there was any possibility of volunteering with them during their research. During these emails, my professor asked what research I was interested in, my research experience, etc. When I met them in person in their office, I presented them with my resume / CV, and explained further in detail what I was looking for, what I could contribute, and if there was a position that could possibly be a good fit for me. While you know the end to this story (unfortunately COVID disrupted the research!), I definitely think establishing that network early on for potential continuity would be highly beneficial. In other words, being able to conduct and continue your research every Summer throughout the course of 1-4 years would be neat, wouldn't it? It could possibly open doors for publications, presentations, and build that experience needed for a career in research and academia. I guess to summarize, while I don't think it would necessarily hurt to ""cold email"" professors regarding working with them, it would be advantageous to have that familiarity of being their student, and definitely having that awareness of going into research that you're truly interested and passionate about. But if you're just keen to get started, maybe we could look into UNBC's research faculty and see professors whose research interests align with yours? :D -- Thanks for asking about my job updates! So unfortunately, for the job that I was asking you many questions about (the rural opportunity), they weren't able to process my application any further past the interview. While I was super excited about it, there were certain factors that were included in the work that I wasn't ready to commit to yet (for example, having to drive solo for 2+ hours on the mainland when I've only ever driven on the Island!). As they say, when one door closes, another opens. Just hoping this next door is the right fit! I'm down to move on to Part 2! I'll see you there, my mentee!

This includes taking notes and reading the next lessons beforehand, in addition to doing the homework you already have assigned. It's really helpful because you come to class prepared and ready to ask insightful questions that aren't just basic knowledge, but once again, it is a lot of work and requires strict time management. I always try to do this at the beginning of the year but I find myself struggling to keep up after a while. Doing practice questions: I definitely agree with you that spaced practice is super helpful, espeically when you make sure to really identify what you don't understand and work it out with your teacher or a friend. Understanding the answer: this is kinda related to the point I made above, as sometimes you can get the right answer without truly understanding the reasoning behind it. In cases such as these, as soon as the question gets harder, it gets a lot more difficult to solve things. This is especially true for math and physics, where understanding every step to solving a simple problem is imperative to doing well on harder questions. Asking for help: I cannot stress this one enough. It is probably the most useful way to improve your skills, and learning it from someone who already has mastered the skill can improve your own understanding by leaps and bounds.

To answer your question, I think as a postsecondary student I have been exposed to a lot of Indigenous culture and business around the university, especially as British Columbia is much better at acknowledging Indigenous people than other provinces. Some examples include the MOA, a museum on UBC campus with a special emphasis on the First Nations peoples and other cultural communities of British Columbia. Additionally, I have also tried some Indigenous restaurants and coffee places across Vancouver, which really differ from the usual cuisine I am used to (still really tasty though haha)!

I live in a small town that kinda sucks, theres next to nothing to do so i play basketball. i currently play for both Sr and Jr girl ball but ive slowiy been detaching from the Sr girls because our time tables match almost perfectly so i cant play for both, but i play for an all native team called Tseashaht Pride we play in a huge tournament in March, kinda nervous but mostly excited. Before my tourny i have a provincial team tryout with my friend and when we make the team were going to Halifax Nova Scotia in the summer. After my tourny my basketball season is pretty much over tell september, so i plan on getting a job to fill my free time, im getting my first aid and food safe so hopfully that will help. I dont do much outside of my basketball, i tried hockey but it just wasnt for me, i did kickboxing i liked that a lot but basketball got in the way. i used to paint and draw a lot but now ive stopped because i dont have a lot of time outside of basketball and school life. i want to go to UBC and live with 1-2 friends to help financually and so i dont go crazy, i want to become a child and youth care lawyer or a real estate agent. ive ran out of time and sorry for all the spelling mistakes :) Jaidin",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I remember taking physics, chem, and bio during my high school years as well, and I enjoyed them a lot. In terms of science in post-secondary, I'll offer some brief insights. If we have more time to chat about it down the line, I'm open to any questions you might have! Post-secondary is definitely more difficult than what we're taught in high school, but that goes true for most subjects at this level. However, this should not scare you! The learning here goes more in depth and is less focused on pure memorization, but rather the application of concepts. You'll get a lot of hands-on experience with science in labs, and it's great if you're highly curious about the field in general. In other words, there are a lot of opportunities if you look for them. You can think of it as a create your own story kind of situation. You'll find that Post-secondary offers a lot (relative to high school at least) of course choices that allow you to diversify your interests, or pick paths suited to your current ones. Not only that, but research and other experiences are available too. I do play sports as well (namely golf, table tennis, and volleyball), but I've never actually tried out rugby. I think that's super cool! I believe I mentioned in my earlier message that we have DND and games in common as well. It was great getting to know you a bit more, and we'll definitely continue doing so throughout this program.

There's intramural teams at UBC you can sign up for, mine has games every Saturday. I'm not that good haha especially not at dribbling, but it's fun! I think it's impressive that you are on the junior and senior team at the same time while in grade 10! Good luck on your tournament in March! First aid and food safe are very useful to have and provide good information. It taught me about how to defrotst meat properly and how long you can leave certain foods at room temperature. Maybe you could coach basketball in the Summer if you like working with kids. Working for a city/town owned facility I believe pays more than other recreation facilities, I would try applying there if that's an option. It's a good idea to have roommates, just be careful about who you choose to live with! Sometimes it's not the best for friendships, but sometimes it is, it depends. Me and my roommates didn't know each other before living together. We have a cleaning schedule that works pretty well. We all do one chore a week and everyone has to finish their chore by Sunday. It helps to keep the place clean. One of my roomates just prints a chore list and then we all put a checkmark beside our task when it's done.

You save a lot of time not having to commute. There's a new grocery store called the food hub on campus, it's not only the chepest place for food on campus but probably most of Vancouver as well. It's really small but still has a lot. I think you should apply for both jobs, but a restaurant would pay more because of tips. If you memorize the menu in advance, they'll really like that. For real estate, you don't need to go to university, you can if you want though and it would probably be better for you because it would likely be funded, but they also offer licences outside of university. For law, it doesn't matter what undergraduate degree you have, just try to get the best grades you can and then you apply to law school usually after third year and that's also the year you take the LSAT. I'm going to take my LSAT in August and start studying soon. I'm gonna study all Summer. I'm studying Psychology and French Literature right now because PSYC interests me and French is useful/I like the language. Check out this page: https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea I looked at every single thing on this list and every single course under each item.

She tried to reach out but ran into some technical difficulties. So, I am delivering the message on her behalf: ______________________________ Exciting to hear about a new team being made! What do you mean, ""for us?"" For jobs, check out this link: https://www.careertrekbc.ca/episodes#tab=view-list&amp;sort=alphabetical It has a list of jobs, videos about a day in the life, and average salary information. I'm from AB and they have a similar website I've looked at, so I haven't specifically looked at this one. I'm pursuing the law path because I like the average salary I found. Just find whatever is most important to you, whether that's travelling, helping people or living comfortably. Remember, there's some things no one's going to do for you and you have to do for yourself. Career research is probably one of them. My sixth grade teacher told me something that stuck with me, he said, ""successful people do the things others don't want to do."" Career researching now is a really good idea, you should write down a list of potential careers that interest you. Try to look at all 165 careers on the website. Just keep working hard, and you're already ahead of other people that say, ""ah I still have time to figure it out later,"" if you're doing university and career research now! You're doing great :) Maybe talk to someone as well (like a guidance counselor or something) about scholarships you can get straight out of highschool. I got the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship when I graduated, and that extra two thousand five hundred dollars from getting good grades was pretty nice. If you can't find anyone at your school to help you, let me know, I'll see what I can do to look into it, but I'm not as familiar with it because I didn't grow up in BC. Applying to scholarships can take a lot of time but it's worth it!!! Especially if you make that much money from only a day's worth of work.

You'll be doing a lot of typing if you continue your education. https://www.dancemattypingguide.com/dance-mat-typing-level-1/stage-1/ (Try to complete all the levels) Or maybe you're a really fast typer already and you don't need the levels, in which case, try to beat me on this website. https://play.typeracer.com/ (I just did one go just now, my score was 86 words per minute.) Being able to type fast is a really good skill to have not only in school but in life in general. Saves you time and your time is valuable. Plus it gives you an academic advantage if you're faster at typing. Let me know if you beat my score. Also...something coming up in my life is that I got approved to go on two exchanges this year, one in France for three weeks and one in Hawaii for four months. It's a good idea to go on exchange if you don't know where you want to settle down yet. (I don't yet.)

A couple things to note: I would watch out for capitalization such as ""school diploma"". This should be capitalized as it looks more professional. You should list the full name of your school, some might not know what ADSS stands for. In terms of the amount of bullet points required for each entry, 3 is usually the goal. Your work experience currently only has one (and the first letter should also be capitalized!), can you think of anything else that might demonstrate your skills that you gained from that experience? Principal's Role should be capitalized You usually don't need ""references available upon request"" on the resume. If they require references they normally let you know and have you fill out an additional form. I love how you included your interests into your resume. Occasionally, they might ask you about what you're interested in during the interview as a way to get to know you better. I would definitely add in more if you have any! When writing bullet points for your entries, a good tip is to follow a STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Results). For instance, your first bullet point for your work experience could be reworded to something like: Managed box inventory and recorded counts, ensuring a well organized work environment. This goes for your extracurriculars as well. Rather than saying ""I've learned valuable teamwork skills"", can you think of a situation where you demonstrated that? You could probably put that down in a sentence! One final thing that is very important when starting out. Don't hesitate to put things on your resume, even if it seems like it shouldn't belong there. Of course, you can't put anything you want on there, but if you've learned a lot from that experience and you are hesitating to write it down, put it down!",Mentor,Posts in Getting Hired

I'll admit, during my very first interview, I was incredibly nervous, almost to the point where I wanted to faint hahaha. It is completely normal but is a skill you can improve over time. Know that it's not just a one-sided conversation, while the interviewer is trying to gauge how good of a candidate you are, you are also gauging how much you wanna work there! Never feel too pressured to perform your best! Prepare as best you can and maybe even practice with a friend. A good piece of advice is to have questions (not too many, maybe 1 or 2) about the job you're applying for, so you can ask them after they've finished asking their questions. In addition, you should always do a bit of background research on their company and their values, it may be brought up during the interview and you want to seem interested and prepared! I definitely could have prepared more and perhaps practiced. I belive that was the source of my nervousness, aside from it being my first time.

Luckily this semester all my classes start at 11am. I ended up waking up at 9:45, snoozing my alarm multiple times then getting out of bed at 10:35, brushed my teeth, hair, washed my face and left my house at 10:48 and jogging a bit/speed walking to class. I'm glad I live on campus so I don't have to waste time commuting and can sleep in more. I just packed a protein bar and a fruit snack to eat in class. It's important to eat breakfast, and the types of food you eat are important too. Check out https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/. It's interesting that the old food guide was made to serve the food industry. This new food guide says half your plate should be fruits and vegetables. Food can impact your mood. Many studies have found a link between diets high in sugar and depression. Let me know if you want to know more about food, I took a class on health psychology and learned a few interesting things. I'm not naturally good at math either. To be honest, I barely passed grade twelve pre-calculus. I can tell you why that was though. I skipped a lot of classes. Our teacher had surgery so we got a sub who was very difficult to understand. The class was already harder for me to udnerstand because it was in French and I hadn't become fluent yet, but because of his thick accent I decided it wasn't worth my time to go. I also didn't do most of the homework. I think one time I received a grade of 0/8. However, in grade 10, I did very well. I completed all the homework or almost all the homework. I asked my teacher questions often. Very often. In fact one time, she told me during student hours, ""Kineena, you can't just ask me for every question."" Yes, I was asking her a question about many of the homework questions, but I was also the only student during student hours at the time, and it was helping me learn. She was just playing solitare, maybe she said that because she didn't want to do too much work. When I received tests back, they were often 100%. I finished the class with a high grade. Later though, what she said stuck with me and I started asking less questions to teachers. So in summary, if you want to do well in math, do practice questions! There is no better way to study for math. Complete all your homework! Ask questions whenever you are unsure about something! It's their job to help you. Now, I study using quizlet. I copy and paste the powerpoint slides onto quizlets and then I quiz myself. Whatever I don't know I mark for later to quiz myself again and again until I know it. Making them on your computer and then using the mobile app works really well. My highschool grades were a mix between very good and average (except for grade 12 math, although I was still able to get a highschool scholarship from AB and you should also ask your guidance counsellor about scholarships offered by the province of BC.) When I started my first year at UofC, I did well in chemistry. Now at UBC, my grades are well above average. I've received a lot of scholarships. I finished one class with 100%. I took six classes last semester, (most people take four or five) and I got straight As. I got an award for being in the top 10% of undergraduate First Nations, Inuit, or Metis students of Canada at UBC Vancouver. Let me know if you want to talk more about what I do to learn in class and to study. It's not necessarily about being smarter, it's about having the right study habits/strategies.",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

Today I woke up at 7:35 ish then double checked if I had everything for today, I needed my Binder, Texbook, Basketball Shoes and Shorts and I have to hand in my jerseys from this year. :( after i had everything it was quarter to 8 so i got a ride from my Grandma, she dropped me off a few blocks away from school because its hard to get in and out of the high-school traffic, so i walk a few extra blocks every day. On my way to school today I grabbed an energy drink for my morning. My coach is pushing us to the limit, were running like theres no tomorrow and my legs are dying, we ru 20 laps do 2 sets of 3 sprints, first set we face the wall jump for 30 sec, baskwards run to the free throw forwards to the wall backwards to center line running on the spot for 30 sec forward to the wall full sprint to the other end of the gym and back, 15 secound rest then we do it again. Secound set we do 10 burpees forward to free throw line backwards back, forward to center line 30 jumping jacks run to the other end of the gym full sprint there and back. Then after our running we shoot 50 free throws, I avrage 25-30 but I still need to work on making a routine for muscle memorie. after we either do a 3v3 or do other exersices. For school I study the easiy things days before so that im confident i know it, and for the harder things i go to my teacher at lunch or before school the day of the test to try get a better understanding of the harder things, if I still don't understand i will look over my notes and see if breaking it down makes it easier .

For studying, making quizlets or flashcards or some other way to test yourself is really the best way to study instead of just reading your notes a few times. Active studying is the best kind of studying. You know how when you take a test you have to get 100% on that you are allowed multiple attempts? You are able to get it because you remember making the wrong answer in the past and now know all the answers you need. Testing yourself before a test can work the same way.

I remember when I was preparing for my first interview, I had also felt that way about it. When applying for these entry level jobs, its important to remember that the employers aren't expecting a fully written resume filled with diverse experiences and skills. They know you're just starting out, and they were once there as well. Take on experiences you enjoy, and soon you'll find that your resume is filling up faster than you thought it would! As for freezing under pressure, this has actually happened to me during my first interview. My best advice on this is actually to treat the interview like a conversation (in some ways it pretty much is a conversation). Pretend a friend or family member is asking you these questions and respond accordingly. Make sure to try and highlight your skills along the way. Alternatively, you could always practice with your friends, family, or with yourself! Find some common interview questions online or ask your parents perhaps, and use those to generate some guidelines towards how you would answer during the real one.",Mentor,Posts in Getting Hired

The other career that i researched in pharmacy, although i don't really want to do this i thought it would be cool. In order to become a pharmacist you need to have completed a bachelor's degree in pharmacyand pass a board examination administered by the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada.To practise in B.C, you must also pass an English Language Fluency exam and have 1,000 hours of internship.

I'm sure you will get into your program of choice if you keep things up. Good question about the length of the career path. I am about to graduate from my undergrad degree this year and that is still something I worry about sometimes haha. It is something that is more of a personal thing and I guess that worry comes from a lot of external influences in my experience. I want to go to medical school and that is a very long career path. I have always wanted to be a physician, so I didn't really worry about the length of my education requirements when I was first choosing my career path. But now some of my friends are finishing their undergraduate degrees and moving on to more permanent jobs and beginning to settle down with families and I sometimes feel behind when it in a way, if that makes sense. But I have done a lot of self-reflection on this and going to medical school is something I really want. I have worked very hard in order to apply and I know I will be much happier in the future knowing that I worked towards my goals and didn't let societal expectations get to me. So to answer your question the length of the course didn't impact my decision but it was something I considered. And I weighed out the pros and cons for myself and what that would mean for me in order to make that decision. I would recommend that you do some journalling or some reflection on your long term goals when applying to schools in the future. It sounds like you want to become a elementary school teacher and if that is something you really want, then I would say go for it! I wouldn't let the fear of course length impact your decisions. One piece of advice I received was that we are all going to get older. In the grand scheme of things when you are in your late 60s or 70s or 80s, it won't matter if you took a few more years to graduate more university. What will matter will be the life you lived and whether you lived it on your own terms and doing something you loved. I hope that helps.

I think that also you can think about how doing your best at school is one way you can keep as many doors open as possible (not limiting your opportunities.) Good luck, I hope you make it into your tournament! If you're asking what kept me motivated in highschool, I would say that getting good enough grades to get into university was a bit of a motivator for me, and the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship motivated me too (money for maintaining a certain GPA throughout high school.) My mom always told me I should get good grades, that kind of motivated me too. I didn't try as hard as I could with high school but still tried a lot. Even now I could be trying harder, I could be reviewing lecture notes after every class, studying ever day but I don't always do that. Unrelated general advice, when you get to university, you should keep a separate word document for everything you learn that you think will be useful to remember later in life. I can think of one thing from my adulthood and aging class this semester: there are these little pill bottles that have timers that only unlock at certain times or they can connect to an app on your phone so that you can't take them more than once a day by accident. This can help old people if they're forgetful or if they have some sort of cognitive decline. This may be useful for me to know in the future if I want to make sure my mom stays healthy. New things excite me, I think that's what gets me out of bed the quickest. Whether it's the excitement of starting a new job or school, I am more likely to spend extra time getting ready in the morning. As time passes, it seems I find it harder to get up and spend less and less time getting ready. I'm passionate about painting although I don't make time for it now and I wish I did. In the Summer I'll be able to! I also set a realistic goal about working out (5 exercises a day, each 4 sets of 10.) I think that's the kind of thing the second video was talking about. I find a lot of inspiration from assignments from researching online, a lot of different types of searches I can talk more about if you'd like. Motivation to complete the assignments comes from reminding myself what kind of life I want to live (a pretty expensive one with a comfortable home and frequent vacations.) Although that being said I like to think I wouldn't waste money on a bunch of designer things. You could just be using that money to help other people instead. Motivation is such a challenging thing because it's a feeling. Self-discipline is the real test of success. How's school going for you? Do you have a lot of friends? Any classes particularly challenging? Also, if you would like to video call and ask me any questions/meet face to face since I missed the meet your mentor event, I am free in May to do that, just let me know which day is best for you (before May 7th.)

I did before, I worked two jobs and was taking Summer school at the same time and it was too much for me at the time. To be honest, I think it was mostly because I had a problem with showing up on time. One time my phone died so my alarm never went off and other times I was just slow at getting ready in the morning. I had one boss tell me she expected me to show up 15 minutes early every time and I didn't know that until later. These are the important years, your brain is still developing until you are 25 and according to some studies, your most vivid memories are between the ages of 15 and 30. I don't think that basketball is a bad habit at all! Exercise is very beneficial to your health, so are social relationships. Exercise has been shown to prevent telemore shortening associated with high stress. This means that normally, if you have a high stress job, you'll age faster, but exercising can counteract these effects. I met a girl on the UBC basketball team, she trains 10 hours a week. It all depends on what you want to do. What are your priorities? If you are passionate about basketball and you believe you could make it onto a university team, you should go for it! One bad habit I broke is vaping. I used to be terribly addicted. I started when I was 16 because I wanted to look cool in front of some new friends who were all doing it. I was vaping 5% nicotine which is way too much, only 20% is legal now. I'd say it got bad from 17-20. (I'm 20 now.) Honestly, it was like every breath I took, I vaped in class, and I even took it with me so I could vape while I wrote exams, hiding it under my sleeve. In highschool and when I got to university, I thoguht I couldn't do well without it. I thought if I stopped vaping, I would do bad on my exams because I would be so distracted by thinking about wanting to do it. Two things helped me to break that habit. 1) I made the conscious decison that my health was more important than school. I decided that even if I did bad on my exams because I was distracting by nicotine cravings, what was more important was my health. I ended up doing amazing in school anyways, and this month, April 15th, I reached 8 months! 2) The people around me. I slowly hung out with friends that vaped less until it didn't affect me to be around them when they had vapes anymore. But mostly, the person I hang out with the most in my life does not vape. I think that's also had a pretty big impact. So in summary, I'd say you have to start with a conscious decison about what exactly it is that you want, and then surround yourself with likeminded people. Find people that are at the same level or above your level. I have a friend whose GPA is higher than mine, and I really respect her study habits, she is so dedicated and disciplined. She will wake up early to study and almost ALWAYS goes to bed at a reaonsable hour (around 12 or 12:30.) Ultimately, you need to keep showing up for yourself. Most likely no one is going to brush your teeth for you, no one is going to manage your time for you either. Get an agenda, (that's what I do) and write daily to do lists, or use the google calendar app. Organize your schedule so you know when all your deadlines are. Give yourself ideally 2 weeks to study for every exam, find ways to ACTIVELY study. It can be hard, but it will pass. I remember a quote I heard, ""this too shall pass."" And it will. Every moment will pass. Every good moment, every bad. Work towards what you want your life to look like! Me personally I'm scared of MEDIOCRICITY. That's why I'm about to head to the library right now to study with my friend after I finish typing this. How do you want to pass your days? What do you want for your future? I really hope you did the career research I told you to do. And I hope that you look at EVERY. SINGLE. COURSE. that UBC offers on their website and read the descriptions and makes a list of what interests you. That's the best thing you could do for your future, and NO ONE else is going to do that stuff for you. No one else can. They always say, ""oh you're young, you have time to figure it out later,"" but now that I'm older I hate that they say that and that that's the norm. You do have time of course. But the time to start? That's now. Because what if you decide to look at all the careers finally at 18 right before university, and you don't like any of them? Then suddenly you're stuck. And if you'd just found that out earlier, you could have already began researching about the MANY alternative ways you can make money to survive/live/thrive (whatever you choose) And if you do these little (although they are time consuming) things, you're really setting yourself up for success.",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I'll speak specifically about Vancouver: Many people appreciate living in Vancouver for its vibrant culture, diverse population, and beautiful natural surroundings, including mountains, beaches, and parks. The city also offers excellent public transportation, outdoor activities, entertainment options, and a thriving food scene. However, there are also some downsides to living in Vancouver, including the high cost of living, frequent rain and overcast weather, traffic congestion, high population density, limited space in some areas, and social issues such as homelessness. Additionally, some people may find the noise pollution and busy city life overwhelming, and there may be limited job opportunities in certain fields compared to other major cities.

You can only obtain a bachelor of science with a major in psychology or a bachelor of arts with a major in psychology. Both of these are four year full-time programs in which you would need to take ten classes per year. To become a licensed forensic psychologist, you must earn a doctorate. This can take 7-10 years. However, you can study forensic psychology at the master's level and work in another field. Again to be a lawyer you need a four year bachelors in anything, your major does not matter. Most master programs require 2 years of study and PhD programs usually require between 5-7 years of study. To become a forensic psychologist you need a Doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology (PhD/PsyD) with minimum 2 years' experience in a forensic mental health context. There is a blocked registration for almost all courses related to forensics at the bachelors level. I found three types of courses. The first type of course code: Blocked registration for the introduction to forensic science course taken in the Joint BCIT/UBC Degree in Biochemistry and Forensic Science. Registration is limited to students in the Joint Degree Program. You cannot take this course code at any level. The second course is restricted to UBC's Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLSc) The following course is likely the ONLY course you can take related to anything forensics during your bachelors degree: ARCL 228 001 (Lecture) Forensic Anthropology The application of methods from biological anthropology and archaeology to the identification, recovery, and analysis of skeletal remains from crime scenes, mass disasters, and unexplained deaths.

Some feedback I received when I was in high school was to try to use action verbs to highlight what you have done and your skills. Here is an article that describes what I mean in more depth https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-action-words. For instance, for the first entry, it could be editted to include some of the following bullet points: Provide childcare services for families with children ages 1-10, ensuring their safety and well-being while under my care. Provide regular updates and communication to parents regarding their child's behavior, accomplishments, and any concerns that may arise. Engage children in fun and educational games, activities and crafts to stimulate their learning and creativity. Prepare and serve nutritious meals and snacks for children, taking into consideration their dietary restrictions and preferences. Foster positive relationships with children, building trust and rapport through effective communication and active listening. I think it is great that you are working a summer job at your mom's school. It is totally okay to find experiences that are not directly through job listings. In fact, networking and find jobs through word of mouth is often referred to as the ""hidden job market"". Universities encourage students to network to tap into these opportunities that you might not come across through a job posting board.

That means you need to take 10 classes each year. What do you mean ""how to get to it?"" The first year is 100 level courses, sometimes you need to take that as a prereq to take a higher level course. Courses in upper levels can have pre reqs or be restricted to certain students in certain majors or departments but otherwise a lot of them are open. I think that it's a good idea to spend your first year taking whatever courses interest you. That's what I did. UBC only considers your first choice so if you apply and put first choice arts and get in, they won't give u the option of science too if that was your second choice. But if you choose science as your first choice and don't get in, they may still offer you arts if that was your second choice. For science, I think the paths are like health and safety, doctor, teacher, researcher. For law school, science wouldn't look better. What looks best for law school is good grades so you could also just spend your time choosing the easiest major and the easiest possible courses by checking rate my prof for each course first.

In the world, it's pretty much everywhere. A lot of topics, depending on whose talking about them, have inherent biases (as we are all human) and can become opinionated. A good habit to develop is doing your own research and forming your own opinion on things, and comparing them to what you see online, what your friends think, etc. Any controversial topic nowadays have misinformation, and it's our job to determine which sources to trust.

I have also worked throughout university on a part-time basis to fund my studies. I won some merit based scholarships while in school at UBC as well. I would recommend starting to apply for scholarships as early as possible. Also be sure to have a set of 2-3 solid reference letters from teachers/coaches/supervisors ready to go for your applications in grade 12 or earlier so that you can apply to as many scholarships as possible. Increasing the number you apply to increases the chances of you winning. You can find many other scholarships online such as on https://www.scholarshipscanada.com/. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Jasleen",Mentor,Posts in Paying for school

From the poem you sent, I can see you enjoy time at the pool and salmon. I too also enjoy swimming and eating salmon espcially when it is in poke bowls. I can also tell you have some interesting stories about the times your dad failed gym class and your mom's life in Japan. We can explore these topics/stories if you feel comfortable sharing them. A little bit about me, is that my favorite food is lasagna and my hobbies include swimming, kayaking and cooking new recipies. My dream place to be would be Cannon Beach in Oregon.

Sometimes i would feel lonely so cause of that i just look up and see the moon, and whenever i look at it i feel less lonely, because i feel like as if someone else is looking at the moon somewhere, and cause of that i feel less lonely at night. Anyhow, i like your photo you took at Niagara falls, and i do agree with you that water calms the nerves, i think its more because of the sound and color of it, the color being blue a calm and relaxing color, and the sound of gushing water can be both calm and wild, and i tend to connect that with human emotions. Speaking of human emotions ive always had an interest in human emotions, ive studied it abit on my own time for 2 years when i was 11~13 i got a bit of information on it, but not much, but i did enjoy it however. And cause of me studying some human emotions i tend to put myself in peoples shoes and feel what they feel, and i tend to get hurt cause of that, i experience they're pain as if it is mine, and cause of that ive become a very logical and understanding person. And me wanting to be a better version of this ""Logican and understanding"" person i want to be, i studied stoicism, rn im listening to a spotify podcast about stoicism and it has taught me alot of stuff, on how to be nice and strong, and caring for people no matter how mean or weird they are.",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I also really enjoy the blueness of water, and something about it flowing and even crashing can be quite calming. I too have a fascination with emotion. I'm actually looking into grad schools and I am searching for a professor who does research on emotion, specifically emotion regulation.

I was just informed that your class is wrapping up the Rural to Urban unit, which means we probably should be wrapping up the Adulting unit. They are starting the Adulting unit now, so I believe we should be starting the Rural to Urban unit. Sorry for the confusion there, but I think we're just doing the opposite of your class. But in short, we should be wrapping up the first unit and starting the next. They did say that we can work on both at the same time. Since we should be starting the 2nd unit, I thought I should pop in here and get us going. Again up to you if you want to do the warm up, but wanted to quickly share some of my thoughts. I think living in rural and urban both have their pros and cons. For example, a pro for rural is that it can be peaceful and quiet, which can be a con for urban areas as it is the opposite. On the other hand, urban area have more amenities, aka more things to do, while rural areas have less amenities and even not many stores. In terms of the discussion questions, I think one strength about rural areas is the connections you get to make and the network that you can build that can help you in your future career. Also living in a rural area provides unique experiences, and not sure if you are interested in research but that is something in psychology that people consider, like how your environment affects you. So having that lived experience helps in terms of being able to contribute in research.

Just to get the conversation going here, I think adulting can be exciting and daunting at the same time. For my own experience, I think you don't really have to know everything about everything once you're kinda on your own. You do learn as you go and I think one piece of advice I would say is don't be afraid to ask for help or to ask questions. It can seem intimidating or that people may be judging you but I'm a big advocate of making a phone call or sending an email if you don't know what you need to do. For example, this year I had to learn how to pay taxes and I just called CRA and they guided me through it and I was able to pay it on time. I also asked my mom for guidance, so if you have relatives or friends you can ask or double check with, that's always helpful!",Mentor,"Posts in ""Adulting"""

1047549501,1047627563,2023-09-21 14:26:00,2023-10-29 19:57:00,"Hey Iona! It is great to hear from you again! We can start with the adulting unit since picked that one first. Awesome work on the identifying what skills and responsiblitles you are confident and not confident for adulting. I see you have confidence in grocery shopping, cleaning and finding a doctor. Those skills/responsiblitiles are absolutely crucial in having a healthy lifestyle and gaining independence on your own so that is amazing to see. In terms of things I see you are not that confidence such as bill, household repairs and banking, I can offer my 2 cents on some of this because I have had direct experience. For bills (theres going to be a lot lol) whether that be credit cards, phone bills, internet bills, electricity bills or water bills, the single most important thing is to pay as soon as possible. The reason for this is that if you dont pay the bills and you miss the deadline, interest (punishment for missing the payment on time) is added on to your bill making it even more expensive. So as soon as you get an email saying your monthly bill has arrived, make sure you pay it off. For household repairs, I have found that most of the time Youtube or the internet is your best friend as long as you have the right tools accessible. However, if something feels dangerous or you do not have the right equipment, it is best to call the professionals. In banking, theres many different aspects and all can be confusing so it is best to set up an appointment with an advisor to go over certain details. For me, a big mistake I made was not knowing the difference between a chequing account and savings account when purchasing groceries. If you use a debit card when purchasing, it will ask between choosing your chequing account and savings account. A chequing account will not punish you for using/withdrawing money. A savings account on the otherhand will charge a fee (say $5 dollars) for every withdraw you make. So as a tip of advice, make sure to always choose chequing account if you are purchasing something at a store. Awesome work once again on your worksheet. Feel free to ask any questions you have about adulting that are on your mind. If you dont have any feel free to move on to Lesson 2: on creating a budget.

I found that for some of the expenses it was asking for did not apply to me yet so I just lableled them TBA for now. I also was not sure if I would really spend that much on entertainment and clothing so I was wondering it was a reasonable price limit.

1047549501,1047627563,2023-09-21 14:26:00,2023-11-01 10:23:00,"Hi Iona, Great work once again on your budgeting worksheet! Just a few things I would like to point out: Rent prices can vary greatly depending on where and how you live. For example, when I was at university, I chose to live very close to the school and this meant the rent prices were much more expensive than if I lived further away. Additionally, I also lived downtown and this also had an impact on raising the price of the apartment. A good possible way to offset if the housing is expensive, is finding roomates. I will say however, make sure you are comfortable and understand who you will be living with in the event that conflicts arise. In terms of cellphone, while there are affordable options that cover unlimited call and texting, consider the location you will be in as certain places may not have easily accessible wifi. This means data may be a requirment and may be of additional cost. As a final point, groceries similar to rent may have differences depending on location. As such it is important to have the thought that you may need to spend more on groceries than anticipated. This probably was my most difficult aspect in terms of budgeting.

From the video, I recognize the city is actually Montreal because of the blue subway trains they show. I know this because I lived in Montreal as a unversity for 5 years there as a student. Prior to that I grew up in urban setting. However, my grandparents live in a very rural part and I would spend my summers there. I think the best part of living in a city as you already mentioned is the opportunity. Opportunity can quite literally mean in anything such as finding a new job, making friends, trying new food, doing fun activities and unique and interesting events. At the same time, opportunity also draws a lot of people and this can mean a lot of competition, crowds and noise. I think if you were to move to an urban area, the most important thing and tip I would provide would be to get out there and explore to see what it offers. This can be very difficult at first, but i think it is important to see, feel and understand the differences between rural and urban.

I don't know if this is just my own bias but I feel like coming from a small town there is always that feeling of wanting to leave that small town for somewhere bigger, but it's good to remember that there are always great things that make our hometown special. For myself, when my family immigrated to Canada, we went to a small town, similar size as yours it sounds. But before coming here until I was 12, I lived in Manila which you probably know is a big city. So I had this opposite culture shock of going from somewhere big to somewhere small. And I think part of my bias may come from living in a big city once. But then I moved to a bigger city for university. However, in my personal opinion, since I'm still in northern BC, the energy or feel of the city I'm in doesn't seem like other cities like Vancouver or like Calgary . Aside from more amenities, the city I'm in right now feels like my small town. I'm not sure if that makes sense or if it answers your question but it's just my point of view. I do feel that there is a sense of ease with bigger cities since you don't have to go to the next biggest city to get stuff or do things or get stuff fixed. At least that was my experience, when I was in my hometown. We had to go 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to another town to access more stores and such. Honestly, though I'm a bit unsure right now of what I prefer, there's definitely pros and cons to either type of place and maybe the preference will depend on what a person needs in their life at that moment.

I think the big question going forward is what kind of environment do you want to be helping people in? Inside a clinic? More behind the scences? your own independent practice? Within a large company? I think these questions can only be answerd through experience to find out what you like and dont like. As I have a listed a few things here, take a look at the videos from rural doctor, medical officer and nurse in lesson 1. These professions are all involved in helping people but there are quite a few differences. What do you notice about the way they go about their job? What values do you think they have beyond just helping people? What things do you like and dont like about each profession? Looking forward to hearing your answers about the videos soon!",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

You raised very good and valid points with respect to both careers and it is amazing to see you have already thought out about what you want your future to look like following graduation at university! I agree you with you that leaving for university might help inspire you or show you another path you have never previously thought about in pursing. In terms of your question about my interests in science, I am currently wokring towards that and I am very close to landing a position with that profession. I currently have a background knowledge in pharmacy and I close to landing a position within the pharmaceutical industry. I will say that, with pursuing a career in the sciences, it is important to also be able to combine it with with another aspect such as business so that you are able to communicate your ideas and knowledge to someone who may not have that background. If it is of interest to you, I would be happy to go more in-depth to different career routes you can pursue with research and experimenting. If not, feel free to move on to career exploration lesson 2, and take one of the WorkBC Career discovery quizzes.

As usual, please check out the background videos for lesson 1 and the discussion questions. I found the videos to be interesting and its focus on working within rural communities which is totally in line with the conversation we are having in the Rural to Urban unit! To get us started, I'll share how I figured out what I wanted to do. I was living in the Philippines until I was 12, and at least in the school I went to, even as young as elementary school, we were all exposed to thinking about what major you would pursue in university. There were entrance exams to get into universities back home and they would post the results in big tarpoulines at the school. So being exposed to that, I just grew up with the idea that I would go to university plus almost everyone in family did. In turn, it was a question of what major will I choose and not necessarily if I should go to unversity/college or not. But I never felt forced to go to university. And so the class like the one you're in now Career Life Connections (we called it Planning then) actually helped think about my interests and I realized that as early as grade 8 I was interested in psychopathologies and mental health, so I decided to take psychology and I feel really lucky that the interest persisted. But honestly, I feel like I am a rare case where I knew what I wanted to do early on, I think it's actually more normal to be unsure or to not know at all.",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

What were you feelings overall on being provided as chemists, meteorologist and information systems analysts as your top three results? I think in choosing my career, I based it on a combination of things that I was good at (chemistry, communication skills) and the environment I wanted to be in (fast paced, always new). If I were to say something I wish I knew from high school, I would say don't get fixated on one job/career. Often times there's multiple different options open and by fixating on one career, you miss a lot of opportunities that could have been had. So while it is very important to have a goal/destination in mind, don't be afraid to explore different options and career paths. As we have completed this unit, do you have any questions regarding career choice?

For my physical health I am definitely doing enough. I train in the pool 9 times a week and go to the gym 4 times a week for my training. Even though all of the physical activity is good for my health, overdoing it has caused me some shoulder injuries which I am trying to fix with exercises given by my physiotherapist. Eating a healthy balanced diet is something I also practice which I really enjoy. I also give my self days off to give myself a break from swimming. On these days I like to relax with a hot drink and a book or show. Something to get my mind off things. I am ok mentally and emotionally. I sometimes get super overwhelmed with school, relationships and swimming that I knew I needed to find some kind of outlet. I started journaling and practicing gratitude which has helped. Finding even a single good thing in my day has made me feel grateful for where I am. Once a week I practice meditation in class and I have found that this has also made me feel much calmer. I want to continue it in the future. Being around the right people can also affect how I feel and deal with things. I know by now who can support me through bad moments and who can't. Surrounding myself with positive people has definitely helped how I think as well. I wasn't quite sure what the difference between mental and emotional well being was but I hope I covered them.

I too was a competitive summwer and can relate to the morning and night workouts. Do you have a favourite event you like to swim? My favourite was the 100 free as I really struggled with distance events. Mental wellness has more to deal with your thoughts. For example are you always thinking about exams or homework and that keeps you stressed? Emotional wellness has more to deal with your feelings. For example if you wake up and you feel sad, why is it that you feel sad? It is awesome to hear you journal and practice gratitude. This is very important as you mature as you start to recognize how fortunate you are and shouldnt compare yourself to someone else who may seem as they have more benefits in life. As we dive into the unit, take a look at the youtube video associated with Lesson 1. it discusses ways to recognize when we need a self-care break.

My goal is to go under a minute this year but it's going to be hard. My favourite events are 50 fly and 100 breast. My best event is 200 fly which is brutal but oh well. I am also not a distance swimmer. When you were in highschool and early university how did you deal with your mental health? As a swimmer how did you deal with doing bad in a race or not making a time standard you were aiming for? What did you do when you were missing home or got stressed out with school work?

Believe it or not, 200 fly is the only event I never attempted to swim in my entire career (I swam competitively for 12 years). I do believe that 400IM is better than 200 fly but both I would say are quite brutal. I will be honest that early on in my highschool and early university, I did not have healthy coping habits for mental health. I would often eat a bunch of junk food or candy because I thought that even after I stopped swimming, my body would would still be healthy and fit. As I got later into my university life, I realized it was important to keep up with exercise even if it was only for 15 minutes. This can be really hard for swimmers espcially since we are used to long workouts and dry land but consistency even if its short time is really important to staying physically fit and having good mental health. As a swimmer in terms of a bad race, I have actually had a lot of time to think about this one. When I swam, I used to get so stressed out with trying to make a certain time to either qualify for nationals or certain swim meets and I would be devastated when I did not get those times because I thought it eliminated all chances of swimming competitively in university. In the end, I did not end up swimming at University and I am kinda glad that I didnt since the school workload was quite heavy. If I were to tell my younger self anything about competitive swimming, I would say there is a beginning and an ending where you will no longer swim and after years have gone by, you wont think and have memories about the time you didnt get a best time or you didnt finish as well as you wanted to. Rather you will remember your teammates, the fun of actually racing and random things that made you laugh while you swam. Based on that, to answer your question, I would tell you to try and live in the moment when you swim and think about good things and why you keep swimming because those are the true memories you will still have rather than the bad race you had. My last answer sort of answers your next question. When I moved to Montreal for school, I found my times often hating being there due to different culutre and environment. However, years later I have learned to appreciate how unique of an experience it was to live in a new town across the country. I think when you are missing home and being stressed with school work try and live in the moment and recognize these troubles wont last forever. For example, go out for walks and experience the new environment you are in and remember you may never experience this again. Also remember university is a unique place and time where it is really easy to reach out to peers/professors around you for help. Great work on your self investigation.

In terms of breaking bad habits, I think over time i recognized the importance of self care. I think i already mentioned this, but as competitive athletes we are so used to training for long sessions and having additional activities such as dryland. Moving into university, you will find yourself a lot busier and you can still prioritize your self care by setting aside exercise. The challenge in this will be it wont be as long or as vigourous and that is ok. The key to self care throughout university is small consistent amounts of self care whether that be through the food you eat, how much you exercise and how much you sleep. Great work on this unit!

Like if a specific person had done something similar to what was being said about them then I believed that it must be true. I also believed the stories if I heard many people say the same thing or something close to the original story. I know that I should never assume and I was probably not helping the rumors by listening and talking about them. It is even harder in a really small town where everyone knows everybody.

The values you shared are simple but can also have a huge impact which aligns with your career aspiratioins relating to art and/or supporting the next generation. Are you leaning towards one of those careers more than the other? To be honest, I haven't really thought about my values in relation to my career goals as much.

December was busy with application deadlines and tests. I thought about how emotions play into what I choose to click on and share on social media and I would say I do not think about it too much. I normally end up sharing videos of my interests with friends and I have never really thought about the consequences just because they did not seem harmful to anyone. I am careful with what I post. I grew up without social media until grade 10 so I was already semi knowledgeable about the danger of mis and dis information. Even though most of the students think they know everything about social media, it really did help to have presentations throughout our school life to help us become more aware fo the situation of mis and dis information. It is a skill to have especially with newer technology making it harder to spot fake sites and videos on the internet. What habits have you developed to avoid mis and dis information?

It is good to hear that you are aware and are careful of what you post to social media, since everyone's digital footprint can always be traced no matter even if the content is deleted. I think for me to avoid mis and dis information, I try and read multiple news sources and try to find the middle ground between the 2. I have found that the truth is always in the middle or where the content being discussed is the same. Like you, I too am very careful with what I share to avoid spreading misinformation. I think it importnat you find and detemine the relevent facts before sharing the content you have in mind. I believe this wraps up the unit for mis and disinformation and concludes all the required course work to finish this portion of the program. Congrats Iona!

That makes sense about being unsure, it is a big decision. Are you ready to move on to Lesson 2: Career Discovery. I believe you have to take the Work BC Career Discovery Quiz then we can discuss your results. To get us going on that part, as I mentioned, I've always been interested in Psychology so I didn't really think of other career paths. I did learn about specific careers during my undergrad. And I think one thing I wish I knew in high school is that many professions require multiple degrees, so that kind caught me off guard but I think with it being something I am passionate about it helps with motivation.

I'm glad you chose this module, I think this is one of my favourite modules because I believe self-care is important and sometimes it is not talked about enough. Being physically and mentally healthy can sometimes not be prioritize because we have other ""more important"" things we want to do or accomplish, or at least in my experience. But it should not take the back burner because it does affect every aspect of our life if we are not healthy. Anyway, to start us off, I think my main warning signs are overthinking and procrastination. I think when I'm overwhelmed it becomes harder to be productive because I get ahead of myself and overthink, and being overwhelmed leads me to procrastinate because I don't know where to start. During these times, I try my best to break things down into smaller tasks to make it let overwhelming. In terms of things that I do to lift my mood, I do try to talk to my friends and family when I'm having a hard time to get some prespective, I enjoy watching sitcoms or stand up comedy, I paint-by-numbers (sadly not creative enough to paint free-hand), and I like getting spa related things (massage, nails, etc.) If you would like to share your warning signs and things that lift your mood, feel free to do so!",Mentor,Posts in Well Being and Self Care

And ile work on the others shortly, after this one, along with the last modules, and the wrap up. -Avel M. Do i have a strong personal interest in this type of work? For photography i find that im incredibly passionate about it, for me it's not just taking a photo, but taking a memory aswell. With photography i find that balancing it out with work and life easy, because most photographers just walk around, run etc, to take photos. And most photographers are solo, working, there are company photographers but im leaning more in as a solo photographer, so as a solo photographer it makes me able to manage my own time, and make me go on my own schedule. With photography, it being an incredibly expensive and, tedious career i doubt it will be a stable life, thats why most solo photographers have another job, or a second job atleast besides just being a photographer. Most solo photography jobs, involves events, and weddings, which are seasonal. With photography, ive done abit of research i find that it is a growing market, but until now, i find that if it is a stable career path im going to say not relatively, because as i said before, most photography jobs are seasonal, being weddings, events, my city alone has i think 3 profesional/known photographers, but does are only the 3 known ones, thats not including the people who aren't known, but for me I'll find a way to somehow manage it. For photography, i find that i can live anywhere basically to take a photo, if i wanted to i can stay in prince rupert my homecity, because Photography itself usually just depends on the creativity of the photographer themselves, and how they want to show their work.",Mentee,Posts in Career Exploration

I see that youve laid out the pros and cons of this career choice and that youve thought about it realistically. I think that is a great sign that you will be successful in this career because youve considered all the ways in which you can succeed and possible sources of strain. Are you thinking about being a photographer and a teacher? As you said it is common to have 2 jobs. Nevertheless, I am glad to hear though that you have found something you are passionate about, which I hope will continue to motivate you as you progress in this journey. It is also a meaningful career as you said it is capturing moments and memories that are precious to those people you are photographing. Do you have a specific photography style?
