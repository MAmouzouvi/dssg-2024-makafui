Hello! The app's called ""Mood Tracker: Self-care Habits""!
And it was lovely meeting you too! You really helped me learn new strategies that would be very helpful for when I enter college! I had fun doing the extension activities too, especially the budgeting one! And thank you! I'm three months in and I just can't wait for Christmas!
Thank you for teaching me a lot of new things! I really appreciate it. I hope you enjoy the holidays too!",11:38AM December 3

Hi! 
Don't worry about it at all! I'm sure you're really busy :)
Awe that sounds really cute! What is it called??
And okay! that's great! I think we can stop whenever if theres nothing else you would like to do. 
It was lovely getting to know you! I hope that I was able to help in some way. 
I really appreciate how much thought and effort you put it! You did a really great job.
Good luck with the rest of your school year! Hope you enjoy the holidays :)",10:51AM December 2

Hello! I'm so sorry about the very late response, I had this in mind and even kept reminding myself to respond but my busy weekend held it off :( I just remembered it right now while doing my Chemistry homework 😢
And yes! I found super cute productivity apps - one of them even had a penguin character whose mood depended on my habits. I find that app very productive for I always feel bad whenever I see the penguin sad and so I do the productive things listed 😂
And I don't think I have any more modules I would like to check out, though if one of them is required to finish the program I'll gladly do it! I find that I don't have any more modules that I would like to learn or study about more.
I hope you have a great week!",5:31PM November 28

Hi! 
 
So sorry for the late response! 
and I definitely feel guilty about it as well, so I try to avoid it as best as possible.
and yeah, pomodoro is definitely worth trying in my opinion! I don't use it every time I study,  but when I do I definitely find that it helps.
yes! Let's do the extension activity :)",10:30AM November 8
Mentee commented at,"7:13PM November 3 
Hello! Thanks for the insights, I appreciate them!
That's how I treat my deadlines as well! I'm not too fond of when I'm unable to meet the deadlines because I feel reallyyyy guilty :/ And I've heard of the Pomodoro timer! I haven't tried it yet but would like to do so! I would like to try the extension activity about this technique with my upcoming project/s if that's alright!
I hope you have a great week!",7:13PM November 3
Mentor commented at,"10:40AM November 1 
That's great to hear that you have already implemented some of the study strategies! Especially as it's sounds they have become second nature to you.
I also struggle with switching tasks - I feel very driven by completion, and switching delays that I think haha. I honestly have struggled a lot with study skills, and especially with prioritizing tasks.
I definitely don't have any ""tried & true"" techniques for studying that always work for me. I have ADHD so I definitely struggle with planning (and execution) lol. I do study a lot more in Uni compared to secondary school though. 
 
From what I remember of high school, I didn't really study very much. But it's much easier to fall behind in university, and you also have more responsibility over your education. No one is putting pressure on you to go to class, or to study/do homework - so you really have to motivate yourself. 
 
I find my actual studying is a little all over the map, but I always treat deadlines as concrete. I don't let myself hand in anything late, and I don't let myself fall behind (this is more just a mindset to help myself - I don't judge other's for falling behind). I'm really trying to get better at the studying aspect of things though. I've recently been using a Pomodoro timer, which really helps on the days that I'm not very motivated. I usually do 25 minutes on, then a 5 mintute break. I also find that if I can make anything into a challenge or a game, it can be very motivating!
Hope your weeks is off to a good start :)

Hello! I just finished watching the video about the six useful study skills. I actually have tried out most of these skills, specifically the study strategies of spreading study sessions throughout a week, coming up with concrete examples instead of abstract ones, and writing down what I recall from my study session. These strategies did help me a lot, especially with tests involving a lot of memorization, so then they just kind of merged with my learning style. Now, I tend to do them oftentimes.
A strategy that I may find difficult to do though is switching between multiple topics. I find myself very focused on one topic at a time, and sometimes I spend hours studying that particular topic (which is not very helpful for then I get lesser time to study the others). But I'll try out that strategy though, I might just find it as helpful as the others.
Furthermore, do you have your own strategic study skills that you have developed? Post-secondary classes are very much different from high school classes, and the tests probably are too, so do you have any study strategies that changed as you transitioned from high school to college?
I hope you have a great week! :D",8:42PM October 27

Hello! Thank you, I spent my long weekend screaming during a basketball match haha. And that's okay, I don't mind! But a semester-worth of information? That sounds reallyyy stressful (and brain-frying haha)!
And I don't think I have any more questions about the conversation. You've already helped me learn tips I could use in the future! But I was wondering if this program requires all the conversations finished?

Hi! Sorry for a bit of a late response. I had my first end-of-block exam and I am exhausted to say the least haha. The structure of Pharmacy school is a lot different than I'm used to. We did a whole semester-long course worth of material in 4 weeks and my brain is fried I think 😂.
And yeah it was definitely a stressful experience, but funny to look back on now.
Do you have any other questions for me? Would you like to try another topic? :)

Hi!
I think you resume looks good! I know it's tough to write them when you don't have a lot of work experience. I think it's important to really highlight your skills to make up for not having previous jobs - and I definitely think you did that. 
 
My suggestion would just be to try to make it stand out. Like if you have any unique experience that would make you a good candidate for a job. When places are hiring people, they're often looking through a stack of resumes, so it's really important to get them to notice yours!
Do you have any questions about them? Or anything else? :)
Hope you're week is going well!

Oooo, that's a very helpful way of thinking! I think I'm in the process of adjusting, but I want to start thinking like that. And thank you! I'll start reading the Conversation as soon as I can.
An improv show sure sounds like fun! I would like to watch one someday! I hope you have a good week!",9:56PM September 21
Mentor commented at,"8:05AM September 21 
Yes, we got Monday off too! Because it's a professional program and all the material is required we still have to do it on our own throughout the week though (so not really a day off).
I'm not sure if you feel the same way, but I often find the first few weeks are really hard, and then you adjust and it doesn't seem so hard anymore. Looking back, grade 3 would be really easy for me now, but at the time it was definitely hard! I find this persepective helpful to realize that how difficult something is is completely relative and someday I'll look back and think ""it wasn't that hard.""
Hahah that is very classic of parents to say that. I am the youngest of my siblings so I got that allllllll the time hahah. 
 
Sounds great! I'll open up that conversation! Looking forward to hearing from you :)

Hello! Yes, my school got Monday off! How about you? :)
The new school year is alright, but now I'm learning that the 11th grade really is much more difficult than the 10th grade. My teachers love cramming everything into the last minute of our classes and giving us homework every single day. But I really like it for I like doing homework!
And yes! I read about resources in universities and I think they're a very tremendous help. And thank you! One thing I like when asking my parents about ""adult"" stuff is when they keep telling me how quickly I'm growing up 😆
And if you don't mind, I would really want to talk about the ""Getting Hired"" conversation. I'm planning to get a job next year, and I have 0 experience in that matter.
I hope you're enjoying your weekend too!",7:15PM September 18
Mentor commented at,"2:27PM September 18 
Hi! No worries :)
I definitely know the feeling! How is the new school year treating you otherwise? Are you taking any fun classes?
And I'm sure you will figure everything out just fine! Sometimes it takes a while, and you don't even realize all that you have learned and accomplished. Things may seem overwhelming at first, but before you know it you've gotten used to it! And if you do struggle with it, there are lots of resources at University to help you adjust (ie. mental health, financial literacy, study skills, etc.).
Good work on the extension activity. Parents are definitely a great resource of knowledge! So are friends, teachers, and various resources provided by universities!
Let me know if you have any other questions, and if you want to try another activity! I'm sure you're getting busy now that school is back in session, but I'm happy to continue if you like (no pressure in either direction) :)
Hope you're having a nice weekend!

Thank you for answering my question, I appreciate it! I feel like everything would be difficult for me in the future, especially since I also got used to living with my parents. But I think I can work it out (hopefully)! I'll probably also have to learn how to pay taxes, get a gist of it at least.

No worries! I was a little confused about the update too
 
That sounds like a lovely tradition! Keeping it alive wherever you are with new friends (that I'm sure you'll make) is a great idea! 
 
it can definitely be tough adjusting to life away from home, but over time you will find new things that you enjoy. I think there it's good to have a combination of things/activities that remind you of home, and others that are new and exciting.
When I moved from home I definitely missed playing board games with my family, and my parents' cooking a lot. My boyfriend and I found some 2-player games that we really liked. They reminded me of playing games with my family, but we're adapted and became their own tradition. As for my parent's cooking - I got them to send me some of their recipes that I liked and I made them for myself. It was a great way to remember home, and feel closer with my parents. 
 
I think you learn pretty quickly when you leave what you really miss. Sometimes it's not the things you expect either! It's good to get creative with ways to feel connected to home, but sometime you just have to visit and soak it all in during the holidays! Lol",10:59PM August 22
Mentee commented at,"12:48PM August 19 
Hello! I just finished reading the second anchor text.
About the activity (I picked the second one): Movie nights are a very simple yet special tradition that my family still does until now. We would cook or maybe order food and eat them all at once as we watch a fun movie. Of course, as I leave for college, I will surely miss this practice. I think a very good way for me to cope with this ""loss"" is to invite my friends (if ever I find some) and do the same activity - no phones, just food and one another's company!
Furthermore, may I ask how you coped with ""lost"" traditions that you had already grown accustomed to as you moved on to another level of life? I kind of already have an idea adapting to new places, but I just can't imagine doing so without my family's company 😓",12:48PM August 19

I'm glad to hear that your canoe trip was lovely! I would like to go to one too someday :D 
Yes, I agree that making friends in a new place is very much helpful. They can fill in the loneliness you have for your family! And thanks for answering my question, I'll put your tips down for me to remember in the future!",11:51AM August 10
Mentor commented at,"7:39PM August 8 
I definitely agree with those sentiments. There are so many lovely things about living rurally, but it can get a little boring, especially before you can drive. It's very freeing when you get your licence and you can go places with your friends. 
 
And that's a really good question. I definitely struggled with adjusting to a new place when I moved to Ireland. I think something that really helped was being able to use FaceTime to talk to my family. That had its own challenges thought because they were 8 hours behind me. Luckily I had a friend living in Amsterdam (only a 1 hour time difference) and we FaceTimed a lot. I think knowing someone going through a similar experience helped a lot. You still have your support network of friends and family that you can talk to.
 
It's also important to make new friends where you are living, which can be pretty tough. I would definitely recommend joining clubs or volunteering. Being part of a small group that you see often makes it way easier to make friends - at least in my experience. I really struggled making friends in University because the class sizes were so big and I didn't really have classes with the same people and I couldn't get to know them. If that is the case for you, I would suggest joining clubs for sure!
 
Finding a routine for yourself, and places you like can really help you to adjust too. Whether it is in nature, or a cafe you like, it's important to find places that feel like home and to set down roots. Looking back in my time in Montreal, I really wish I did more of an effort to do this. Right before I moved away I found a couple places I really liked, which made it kind of sad to leave lol. 
 
Hope you had a great weekend. I'm back from my canoe trip now - it was like lovey!

Hello! I just finished reading the first anchor text of the Conversation.
Anyhow, the following are the three things I like about living in a rural area:
The abundance of nature: Unlike in a city, there is a great abundance of nature, specifically animals, plants, and trees, here that makes me feel really connected with Earth! I also love the way people treat animals with care!
The very little pollution levels: In a city, the land and the sky are often overwhelmed with a lot of pollution. In a rural area though, the sky is very clear and paints very pretty colours!
The various opportunities that help my well-being: Unlike the city where I came from, there are lots of ways I can improve my lifestyle and my well-being here. Going to places like parks surrounded by trees and having peaceful road trips with my family are seriously the best!
The following are the two things I don't like about living in a rural area:
Lesser forms of entertainment: There is barely any place here to go to and have fun, and having to drive to a city to do so is very tiring.
Lesser options: There is a limited range of options available here (like schools, etc.).
Furthermore, I have a question about moving from a rural area to a city. How can one make it less difficult to adjust to a new place (especially with no one to rely on)?",9:17PM August 4

Yeah I think it's fine just filling in what you know for now. It's so hard to estimate some of these costs.
I just applied for a student line of credit and you need to figure out your budget for them so it is definitely helpful to have some experience doing so. I mostly overestimated everything a little because underestimating might mean I don't get enough money to make things work.
 
I think when you start post-secondary you will have a better idea about your expenses and such. So don't worry if you felt like you didn't really have an idea for some of the categories :)
Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to move to a different section.

Hi! Sorry for the late response! My family got Covid and it's been a bit of a mess - we're all okay though!
Reference letters are letters that you get people to write that recommend you for what you are applying for. Usually it's good to ask people of authority that also knows you well - like teachers, bosses, supervisors, etc. If you are applying for a scholarship specifically, it may be a good idea to ask a teacher that you have a good relationship with to write you one. The goal is that they will say nice things about you, so that the committee deciding can get an idea about who you are from a 3rd party.
And I think the main difference between scholarships and bursaries is like you said - scholarships are merit-based (academics, volunteer work, work experience, community service, etc.) whereas bursaries are need-based (you couldn't afford school otherwise). 
 
I may be mistaken about this, but I think you might be able to spend bursaries more broadly, while scholarships are usually just used for tuition. Again, I'm not certain about this though!
Hope you had a nice weekend!

Hi!
From what I gather from their website you cannot apply directly out of high school as you need 60 university credits. Most single-semester courses are worth 3 credits (with some exceptions). 60 credits works out to 2 years of full-time school, so you can apply after 1st year on the condition that you complete your second year of studies before starting the program. 
Of that 60 credits, 24 are required prerequisits to get into the program, which include:
- University Level Human Anatomy and Physiology (6 credits):
HHSC 111-4 and HHSC 112-4, or HHSC 105-3 and HHSC 305-3, HHSC 306-3, HHSC 325-1 and HHSC 326-1 or equivalents are recommended. Human anatomy and physiology courses must include a lab component and be completed within 5 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Microbiology (3 Credits):
HHSC 110-3 is recommended. Microbiology courses relevant to Human health must be completed within 5 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Statistics (3 credits):
STAT 240-3 is recommended. Statistics must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Social Sciences with Peoples and Cultures content (3 Credits):
ANTH 213-3 is recommended. Social Science courses dealing with people, languages and cultures must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level English (3 Credits):
One of ENGL 100-3, ENGL 102-3, ENGL 103-3, ENGL 120-3 are recommended or a higher-level transferable English composition course.  English composition courses must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University Level Indigenous Studies (3 credits):
FNST 302-3 First Nations Health and Healing is recommended. Indigenous Studies courses must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
- University level Psychology with human development, behaviour and/or cognition content (3 credits):
PSYC 101 is recommended. Psychology course work must be completed within 10 years prior to the semester of admission.
 
Another 24 of those 60 credits must be 200 level courses (which means 2nd year courses... 100 = 1st year, 200 = 2nd year, 300 = 3rd year, etc...). This leaves you with 12 more elective credits to complete as well. It is also important to make sure that all these courses are transferable to UNBC (but if you go to school in BC, they usually are), and you can check this using the BC transfer guide. You also need to have at least a 'B' average in those 60 credits to apply. 
 
That might seem a little overwhelming as a highschool student, but it is definitely doable! What is nice is that you can get these credits at a college or a universtiy! Many people like doing the first 2 years at a college because it can be an easier transition - the class sizes are smaller, the college might be closer to home (meaning you could live at home), the teachers have more time to help you, and it can be easier to meet people and make friends. University has its benefits too though - they are often located in bigger cities (more to do when you have time off), they might have more resources and clubs, you might not need a car, and you don't have to transfer after 2nd year (if you don't want to). 
I hope that all makes sense! Let me know if you have more questions! :)",1:12PM June 21

Hello! Thank you for answering my question about the program, I get it much better than I did before. I have another question though about the Northern BScN program in Fort St. John. Can one directly from high school apply to it?
Moreover, thank you for providing me insight as to how I should approach any heavy work in the next school year, I'll keep all your advice in mind! And you're totally right, once one gets the hang of something, that certain something won't be as scary as it looked before!

Hi!
I think Nursing is a great program! We always need more nurses. It's too bad thought that ophthalmology is so expensive (I personally think that school should be free - especially health-care fields).
I think that the collaborative program is set up so that students at College of New Caledonia and Coast Mountain College can get a Nursing degree without having to go to university. Colleges can't have nursing degrees on their own, so they collaborate with Universities - which basically means that the students will graduate with a UNBC nursing degree, even though they didn't actually go to UNBC. My local college has a similar agreement with UVIC. 
It also looks like the Northern Collaborative BScN is offered out of Prince George, Quesnel, and Terrace, wheras the Northern BScN is in Fort St. John. As for the actual curriculum - I imagine it is very similar to Nursing programs offered by other schools. I hope that answers your question! Let me know if you have any others.
As for managing difficult subjects, I think a big thing is time-management (which is often easier said than done). I also took as many as I could in grade 11/12, so I've been there. From what I remember, doing my best to stay on top of homework helped. I definitely wasn't perfect though - I once finished writing 4 physics lab reports in 15 minutes before handing them in. It was right before winter break and I was stressed about it all break. I got 41/80 (which I think my teacher just passed me to be nice haha) but I asked him if I could redo them and he let me, so it worked out in the end. 

It's also important to ask for help if/when you need it. There is no shame in getting a tutor, or getting help from your teacher or a peer in the class. If you have friends in your class you can try studying together too. Sitting at the front of the class (if you are able to choose) can be helpful too. It is a lot harder to be distracted near the front - and it's a step that takes very little effort, but might make a big difference. 
I think that you have to approach the subjects a little differently too. Physics is more like math in that you might need to work through the problems a few times before you understand - but once you understand, you can easily apply it. Biology is more memory based though - and being interested in what you're learning can really help in my experience (and I did go on to get a Bachelor's Degree in Biology). Chemistry is somewhere in the middle of the two, and both skills will help.
It can be a lot of work taking many science courses at once, but I am sure you can do it! Remember to try to keep some balance in your life too, and find time for self-care. I think once you're in the thick of things it won't be so intimidating anymore.
Hope you're having a restful weekend :)",6:18PM June 19

Hello! Regarding what I would like to pursue education-wise, I was thinking of taking a Nursing program. Although I was also thinking of maybe getting a career in ophthalmology, I disregarded the idea given the amount of expenses required for the pathway.
Anyhow, I just finished reading the anchor point of Post-Secondary Considerations. In the BC Education Planner, I searched for 'registered nurses'. Attached are schools with programs for this career path.
I researched where all these schools are located, just so I could see whether or not these schools are far from where I live, and UNBC is the only school near me. I was wondering how their Northern Collaborative Baccalaureate Nursing Program works?
I was also wondering if you could give me any tips as to how to manage difficult subjects? I'm about to be in the 11th grade in a few months, and I took up all the science classes my school offered. I'm worrying whether or not I can actually do it :(
Anyhow, I hope you had a great week! Thank you :)",9:14PM June 17

I'm glad that it resonated with you! I can definitely relate to my own thoughts keeping me awake. My partner falls asleep almost instantly and I'm so jealous of him haha. Meanwhile I'm overthinking some trivial thing from years ago! Haha
Those topics sound great! I'll make sure they're open and we can start wherever you like. :)

Hello! Nice to meet you too! 
Yes, adapting was a major obstacle for me. But I believe that such challenges make life life. And yes, I'm really grateful I had met my friends! 
Your favourite quote is really inspirational, given how I worry about tonsss of school-related stuffs too! I often stay up at night and worry about these countless (often unimportant) things 🥲 Nevertheless, I'll surely remember your advice! 
Moreover, I'm interested on the following topics:
From rural to urban
Paying for school
Post-secondary considerations
Well-being and self-care

Hi Mentee! Nice to meet you.
My name is Mentor! 
Moving to a rural area from the city must be a pretty big change for you. I grew up rural but have since lived in the city for school and it was definitely a huge change for me. I'm glad to hear that you have made new friends - I know that it can be tricky (especially when moving to small towns). Having a good support network is so important!
I really like that quote too! It is true that there is a lot to be learned from our mistakes. I think that some people are more adept at doing so. It's definitely a great life-skill to have.
And my favorite quote (although I'm not entirely sure this counts as a quote) is this:

I am definitely someone who worries a lot about things, so I find framing it in this way can be really helpful. If I have the means to change something, then that means I have some control. And if I can't change things, it is sort of liberating to know that it is out of my power. 
I'm really looking forward to getting to know you better! Let me know which conversations at the top interest you and we can get into some of the topics! I am also more than happy to just chat about whatever you like. 
Is there a day of the week/time that works best for you to chat in the future?",7:56PM June 6

Hi there! I’m Mentee, a sophomore in high school. I just discovered this platform and am very new to its structure, so I apologize in advance if I ever get confused or lost in the future. I’m currently fifteen turning sixteen, and this year is about to be my first full year here in Canada! Last year, I moved from a city to a rural area, and adapting to my new lifestyle and surroundings was tough (but fortunately manageable thanks to my family and my newly made friends). For I know almost nothing about the opportunities and options here, I wish to learn them along the way with you!
Moreover, “From failure we learn, from success not so much,” is a quote from the famous Disney movie, The Robinsons, and has been my favourite all-time motivation quote. Whenever I feel unfortunate from whatever defeat I just had experienced, this quote helps me open my mind to the benefit of mistakes — that is, to help us learn. Likewise, I would love to learn what your favourite quote is!

Hello! It's okay!
I just tried out pomodoro using an app I found on the appstore for my pre-calculus exam, and it actually helped me! When I was using it my study session actually felt stress-free, which is absolutely a surprise given all the stress I always have had when studying for exams. I was able to focus more too because I napped during the breaks I had haha 😂
I'll definitely keep using pomodoro for future study sessions!

No worries! Hope you had a good long weekend!!
I have a similar sentiment towards interviews I think. It's easy to get in your own head and stumble over your words - especially when you haven't been in many interview-esque scenarios. It's definitely a skill, which is a bit of a relief because it means you can improve. 
I never really prepared for job interviews in the past (or interviews in general) but I had to for my university applications over the past couple of years, and I think I have really improved!! I would definitely recommend getting friends or family to help you practice answering unexpected questions.
What I find to be the hardest part now (after lots of practice), is getting to feel comfortable with the interviewer. The sooner you relax a bit, and are able to let your personality come through, the better (in my opinion).
As for a memorable interview, my interview for a summer student position comes to mind. I had to take a drug test, and normally they do it after the interview, but I did it before. The guy administering the test said ""compared to the interview, this part is nothing"". And I had to tell him that I hadn't done the interview yet... it was funny but also made me a lot more nervous for the interview. I didn't feel like the interview even went very well because I was so nervous, but I got the job! So I think I was probably being too harsh on myself. 
I'm not sure if that's what you meant by memorable, hahaha but it was indeed memorable!
Hope you have a nice thanksgiving weekend!",8:40PM October 7

Hello! Sorry for the late reply, my family and I went out of town during the long weekend and when we came back I completely forgot about this 😅
Anyways, I finished watching the video for the second anchor text! I'll gladly keep these tips in mind, for the future! I have never had a job interview before, just school admission interviews (which at a young age I didn't take very seriously). I think I'll be alright in keeping a professional aura, but not so sure about the talking part. I'm able to sometimes answer questions and speak what's on my mind, with a bit of stuttering in front of a group of intimidating individuals, yes, but there are times when I just completely blank out. That's what I'm worried about in future interviews — not being able to communicate as well as I know I'm capable of. But practice makes perfect and I'm sure I'll be able to practice well enough and prepare myself before such interviews! Have you ever had a memorable job interview before?

Hi! Thank you - me too lol
Sounds great! 
It's definitely tough to know what to put for things like that, especially when they vary in price. I would recommend looking at a University website that you might be interested in. They often have ideas about what the housing market looks like. I'll link an example from UBC below. 
https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/other-housing/off-campus-housing/
https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/residences-rooms/residences/
As for transit - You have to consider if you will have a car (often necessary in smaller cities and towns), or if you will be using public transit. Public transit is easier to calculate as you can get monthly passes, and often you can get it through your university (its included in UBC's student fees for example). If you are thinking about a car, you have to consider gas, parking, and insurance costs (which is a little more technical, and changes depending on gas prices and what type of car you have).
 
Overall, I would say that you don't need to be exact. It is just an exercise to get an idea of what budgeting is like. Just do your best approximation, and in the future (when you go to school) you will have a better idea about what things will actually cost for you, and you will be able to do a more thourough budget! :)
Hope that all makes sense!

Hi! 
Yeah sports are great, especially when they are just for fun. When I was in highschool I took volleyball very seriously, but soccer was just to have fun more or less. I played on a house team, as well as my school team, and neither were very competetive, but it was great to get some exercise and hang out with my friends. Even if your school doesn't have a lot of sport/club options currently, there might be some opportunities in your local community - might be worth a look :)
Rotary sounds really cool! I have some friends that did rotary at their school and it sounded like it was very rewarding! If you're looking for more things to try you could also start your own club with friends! I have recently gotten very into crocheting and would love if I had enough friends that did it to have a club. Book clubs can be a lot of fun too! 
Hope you had a great weekend! :)",11:31PM July 5

Hello! Thank you for answering my questions on rent and on on-campus and off-campus living! I've gained some insight now on these options :D And yes, I've heard from others that rent in Vancouver tends to be very high 😬 
Moreover, I'm very interested in joining volunteer clubs like that of Best Buddies! I would love to have a chance in the future to join a club like that! I would also love to learn how to play soccer and volleyball, (though my gym class proved my skills to be very bad 😅). 
I'm very interested in extra-curricular activities like volunteer clubs and sports like badminton! Actually, last school year, I joined my school's rotary club, where we did activities like bake sales to raise money. They were very enjoyable and fun to organise and do, and were for a cause too! I also joined my school's badminton team, which was a very fun but tiring experience. I would love to do much more, but my school has very limited amount of extra-curriculars :(

Hi!
Yes, rent can definitely be a big factor, especially in BC as we have a very high cost of living. I am actually just figuring that out for the first time as I was able to live with family during my undergrad, which was a huge help. I'll be going to UBC in the fall and Vanvouver is exorbidant! And yes, alcohol is very expensive - especially at restaurants and bars. It can double the cost of a meal!
I lived off-campus previously, but mostly because I could stay with family for free. I know people that have done both though, and I think that it does really depend where you are. At the small college I went to, I've heard that the accomodation is really bad, and not all that much cheaper in the grand scheme of things as rent nearby is fairly affordable.
I have been looking into UBC housing in Vancouver recently and it actually looks a lot less expensive. My mom stayed in family housing when she went to UBC (she had 2 kids at the time) and I think she saved a lot of money. Currently it is really hard to find studio or 1-bedroom apartments for less than $2000 in the Vancouver area, especially if you want to be close to UBC. Most on-campus housing is less than $1500, even for a 1-bedroom (no roomates). I do think this can vary from city-to-city, and there is more than just rent to consider. Living on campus might mean you can spend less money on transit, but you might be farther from downtown. 
I definitely did fewer extra-curricular activities in University than I did in high school. During my first 2 years I had a part-time job, so I didn't really have time for other activities. I was in a very small program though, so it was pretty easy to make new friends. When I moved to Montreal for my last 2 years of my degree I joined a club called Best Buddies. It is a volunteer organization that sets students up with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to form meaningful connections. It wasn't your typical extra-curricular activitiy, but it was a great experience and it helped me make some new friends (which was a lot harder to do at a big school). 
Now that I am going back to Uni, I think I would like to do more extra-curricular activities. I would love to do intermurals or something. I really love volleyball, and would love to play again. I would be open to soccer and badminton as well. I would also love to do some pottery or sewing classes! 
What kind of extra-curricular activities are you interested in?",12:30PM July 2
Mentee commented at,"7:47PM June 28 
Hello! I just finished watching the video for the first anchor text, and just read the article that came along with it. I learned that rent is often the biggest factor for expenses (and it's not very surprising) and that alcohol seems to weigh a lot 🤔 
 
Based on the article, I learned that learning all about such finances and knowing how to manage them would really help, and that budgeting is a very important thing to do. As mentioned in the video, rent is the biggest factor for these finances. If you don't mind me asking, did you live on-campus or off-campus, and how did you make your choice? I often hear from others that living on-campus tends to be more expensive than living outside, but it may depend on the school. 
Also, what were some extracurricular activities that you enjoyed doing?",7:47PM June 28
Mentor commented at,"6:20PM June 28 
Let me know any questions you have! I am more than happy to talk about my finances surrounding school! I know everyone's financial situation is different, but it can be helpful to talk about it with people (even though it can be taboo). It can be a really hard to transition from being in highschool and living with your parents, to living on your own, paying for school, and having to manage your own finances.
