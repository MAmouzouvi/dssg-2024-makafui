I looked at your profile and we seem to have quite a bit in common. I also love to draw and paint, and let my creative side run wild. I hope to someday work with vulnerable youth either in a school setting or in my own private office. Some stuff I would like to concentrate in is well-being, motivation and nutrition. But for now, I enjoy focusing on myself, my studies, and having fun. Another thing about me is I absolutely love to cook. Last night I made an awesome meal for dinner. I baked chicken in the oven with pesto, tomato and lots of mozzerella cheese. I would say that it is definetely my comfort food for when i'm feeling under the weather (basically anything with cheese). Some words I really like to live by is that the key to life is accepting challenges by Bette Davis. Those words really do resonate with me as it reminds me not to be scared when confronted with challenging situations. These situations will only make you stronger, regardless of how you perform. This is what has kept me going throughout my university career thus far. And now that I am almost done, I know this quote will stick with me forever. Thank you for letting me introduce myself. I look forward to hearing more about your and your passions. Best, Lillie"," 2021-09-14, 11:46:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I always liked to argue with people as well (I'd often spend my whole lunch hour doing so with friends). My brother is in law, and I have a friend who works in the coastguard, so I can tell you about both those paths! Bioengineering was a lot of work but it's finally getting a little easier now! I like studying it because it's pretty broad, and I'm interested in a lot of different subjects. Things in the field are always changing- kind of like the stock market- so it stays exciting. I follow a few stocks in biotech. I usually put my savings into something similar to an index fund- over time, even some of the best analysts struggle to beat the S&amp;P 500. Funnily enough, when I was in 8th grade ( 2012) we had a class with a stock simulator. I put all my money into Amazon and Google - too bad it was fake, because I would have had enormous returns... Two questions for you: 1) Do you ski at Shames? I've always imagined it to be super deep up there... I just started to get into ski touring and feel like it would be a cool zone to check out someday. 2) Are you thinking about heading to university next year? Have you looked at any business programs?

I have a bit of a stutter so socializing (especially public speaking) is really anxiety inducing for me! The thing that helps me is to just keep throwing myself into scary situations. It's easier said than done and some days I just can't, but the more conversations I have with people the easier it gets, and the more I realize that really no one is socially perfect at all! I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020 and I studied Kinesiology and played varsity soccer. I am now working in recreation in a long term care home and enjoy connecting with seniors. I'm working towards medical school and am going to continue working, playing soccer, and volunteering until I (hopefully) get in. I'm so excited to learn more about you and hopefully help you get an idea of what you might want to do in the future. I read that you'd love to get a trailer and see the sites. You can totally do that! I think you can choose a career that allows for time off to travel and do what YOU want to do. Also really cool that you have an interest in opening a coffee shop or tattoo parlour. Very unique ideas :) Let me know what conversation you'd like to start on first.

As of right now, I help around the house to clean and help my mum around and watch over my siblings and dog. I'm still not really coping with the fact that she might not make it to my graduation so it's really weird hearing her talk about it.

I wanted to share with you a quote that I really resonate with and remind myself of everyday: ""You learn more from failure than from success. Dont let it stop you. Failure builds character."" This quote has really helped me push through some tough times in life. I am sure you've also had some tough experiences in life where something hadn't gone how you wished it did. It's very important to not allow any challenges or unsuccesses from stopping you to move forwards.

1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,7," Hi Ann, That's a great one to start with. I will unlock that conversation. I think what helped me the most with studying was finding a quiet space free of distractions. If I had a test coming up, I would write dwon that date in my calendar and plan mini-goals for myself each week until test date. I tried to start early so that I could study in small chunks rather than cramming the night before. I agree with you - reading things you aren't interested in is so tough! Lucky for me, I was genuinely interested in Kinesiology in university, so this wasn't too much of an issue, but I remember struggling with this in high school, as many courses did not interest me. What I tried to do was relate what I was learning to my own life to make it a bit more relevant. I would almost trick myself into finding things interesting. If this didn't work, I would just remind myself of the greater goal - study hard to eventually get good enough grades to get into university - and that would motivate me a bit. I study best individually, but I have a lot of friends who need a group to be able to study well. A group setting can be more stimulating and it is nice to be around friends who you can collaborate with. It just depends on personal preference really.

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,13," Good morning Owen! I think I would find the rain hard in Prince Rupert. I spent my first winter in Vancouver last year and found the long stretches of grey, rainy days quite challenging. My partner and I just moved to the island though! We're in a bit of a rain shadow in Cumberland, and its got a ski hill close by and lots of forested trails to use too. Hopefully I can escape into the snow a lot this winter! Do you ski or board at all? The post secondary question is a hard one, because sometimes I was not enjoying myself. A large part of that was because I was not taking enough time for self care, and another part was that it was a tough adjustment and school can be a grind at times! Your self care routine sounds amazing though. I've just strated using different breathing practises to reduce anxiety and they help a lot! What really got in the way of self care in my uni experience, was way too much socialization that involved a lot of alcohol. I stopped having time or feeling up to going on hikes and getting out into nature, which I've since found out is so important for me. I also did not give myself enough alone time or down time to be physically/mentally healthy. It can be hard when you move to an area and there's a bunch of people your own age getting access to a lot of freedom all at once. I just wanted to see everyone and do everything! Taking the time to get enough sleep, drink enough water, eat healthily and do what you need to do for school is soooo worth it. That doesn't mean not socializing at all, because I think a big way I stayed sane in uni was the great people I surrounded myself with. Do you feel like you know what you need to feel happy and healthy? Do you get recharged through alone time or socializing? What are some signs in your life that you need to take better care of yourself? For me, feelings of grogginess and sadness/anxiety or even getting a cold have indicated to me that I need to be taking care of myself better. In regards to college and university being tougher than high school, I think that depends on the person and what program you choose. Yes, it's probably going to be more work, but if you choose to study things you find genuinely interesting and passionate about (for me, that was wildlife courses, mapping courses, climate change courses, gender studies, ecology, forestry etc), it feels a lot better than high school. In high school you have limited choices in what you can take, whereas in post secondary you can really chart your own path. I would love to help you find some programs that would spark some passion for you! Here are some I thought you might like from your bio: Selkirk College (go to school in the Kootenays!!! So cool) https://selkirk.ca/program/rfw University of Northern BC (Prince George is getting a lot nicer these days!) https://www2.unbc.ca/wildlife-fisheries BCIT (Burnaby is cool if you have a desire to try out urban living for a while) https://www.bcit.ca/programs/fish-wildlife-and-recreation-diploma-full-time-7930dipma/ Anyways, take a look at those when you can! I'm interested to hear your responses from the self care questions. It's so cool that we're talking about this, because I think I would have been happier in uni if people told me to prioritize taking care of myself and gave me tips on how to do it. Also, please let me know if this messaging schedule is working for you! We can always pick a time where we're both able to chat (for example, a couple nights a week) if you wanted to have more of a quick reply!

I have a job at Walmart, but when I am not working I love to read Books by James Patterson or listen to music, but when I'm not doing that, I'm most likely watching Greys Anatomy. In the next five years I want to open a buisiness, so right now I want to know what to expect to go to college and how much money I will need. "," 2021-09-17, 13:18:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I think you can see me profile for some more details about me, but the quick version is I'm 28, I just moved from the Kootenays to Vancouver, and I just graduated from UBC, where I studied Electrical Engineering. Awesome that we both like skiing! What kind of skiing do you do? I mostly go in the backcountry because I like backpacking in summer and ski touring feels like the winter substitute for that, and I love it. I also took a quick look at your profile and saw that you're into coding. That's good news because that's also my thing - even though my degree is in electrical engineering, I mostly focused on software engineering and machine learning, so I think I'd be able to share with you some of my perspectives on tech, software development, university etc. I'm sure we have more things in common that we'll find out about later, and for now we can start with the quick task here (the categories of things to share above). Here's a link to a picture I took last year at Mt Assiniboine while I was running a 57k ultra-marathon there. It's one of the most beautiful places I've been to, and it wraps up many of the things that are dear to me - the environment, taking physical challenges and being active, and beautiful things. I also like this picture because it reminds me of this challenge that I decided to go after (doing this long run) and how I worked hard planning and training for it and during the actual run. What's an interesting nugget about you? Pick something from the list above to show me something cool about you :) Last, let me know if you have any questions about the program. Our next thing up is a quick module on how the program works so it's okay if you're not sure about everything yet, but if there's something you want to ask or say - I'm always happy to hear it.

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,17," Me too. I just got new (used) skis last winter and they're so much better with powder than my old ones. The old ones were from Ontario where I grew up, and there's next to no powder there. The new skis changed my experience of skiing in BC entirely! That does sound like a tough weekend routine to change. I struggled with that in high school and university too. Some of my friends loved to party and go out every weekend. It was always tempting to be out as much as they were. But I know when I stopped going out as much and focused on making time for activities that were good for me, I felt so much better. The constant socializing with alcohol can make you groggy and less motivated to get outside, eat healthy, do well in school etc. All of those things, at least for me, make me feel proud of myself and happy when I do them. It also feels a lot better to be fully ""with it"" when doing something you love. Seriously, if I could go back and tell my younger self that the more time I spent getting good sleeps and going outside with friends would make me feel happier and healthier, I would. What do you try to do when you are noticing those signs that you need self care? Do you make plans to ski or do yoga? Do you have some alone time or take a nap? These will be super important things to remember, because while post secondary is exciting and an amazing opportunity, there will likely be more stressful times and you'll have to focus on taking care of yourself well. If you don't mind, please brainstorm how you hope you'll handle bad mental health signs when/if you're far apart from people you love and know you very well. And then we can move on to Career Considerations. I'm pumped for that conversation because I've come across some awesome outdoor jobs in my time. I'm so happy that you are interested in Selkirk too. I know of someone who went through that program, and they apparently really enjoyed it. Georgina "," 2021-09-20, 16:00:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,13," Hi Ann, What worked for me was picking a person or a few people to study with that I knew studied similarly to me. We could go to the library together and sit quiety and work on our own for a few hours, but we still had eachother there if we needed to ask a question. In terms of taking notes, I found going to class/lectures really helped me prioritize what was the most important. If the teacher talked at length about something or really emphasized a concept, then I'd take detailed notes for it. If they just mentioned it once, I would take very minimal notes. Most of my university professors posted their lecture slides which already had notes on them, so I would download those slides and then just jot down extra notes that the teacher said during class. When actually studying for the test, I would handwrite all the lecture notes and my extra notes into one document that I could study from. I found handwriting helped make things sink in a bit more. Unfortunately I don't have much experience in those areas as I studied Kinesiology at school; however I did take some sociology related courses within my program. I didn't think I'd be that interested in them but I actually loved them. I loved how it made me look at the world and society from a totally new perspective. You can do a lot with those degrees too; social work, law, government work, academia, etc. You could try to meet with a counsellor at school to see if crim or sociology would be the right fit for you :) "," 2021-09-20, 18:51:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,1," Hi again! I just had a look at the studying videos and wanted to comment on the importance of starting studying early. It didn't work for me to wait until a week before an exam to cram all my notes in. I tried to take notes on all my lectures at the end of each week. If I had time, I would also try to review notes from the older lectures. When it got closer to the actual exam, I started to re-type my notes and test myself. I would type out the heading of a slide or segment of notes, and then either type out or say aloud or in my head what I knew about that topic. I didn't try to regurgitate things word for word, but I instead tried to fully understand concepts and make them relatable to me. I can't emphasize enough how important starting early is! Not only does it improve retention of informaiton, but it also greatly reduces stress. Feeling pressed for time before an exam is not the greatest feeling, and it's harder to memorize and learn under stress. Anyway, give these videos a watch and let me know your thoughts and any questions you have! Best, Anna "," 2021-09-20, 19:03:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

I used to play soccer and volleyball growing up but i stopped playing to focus on my basketball career, some of my friends have been telling me I should join soccer and volleyball again but i just dont have the time lately, even though i would love to start playing again I just dont think I can balance out my schedule at the moment. My favourite meal is definitly my dads spaghetti, and my moms shepherds pie! I still live with my dad and his parents, my grandparents. My mom lives with her husband in Port Simpson which is about 45 minutes from Prince Rupert so I go visit her on weeknds to spend time with her and my little siblings.

But the time it takes to finish a degree really depends on the specific university's program and sometimes yourself too. For example, I took 5 courses almost every semester but you can definitely take less. I know some people who've been taking 3-4 courses per semester, so it's taking them about 5 years to finish and it's not uncommon at all to take longer. Hopefully that makes sense. And in terms of how hard it was, it was definitely stressful and hard at times. But I think if you have the interest, that will help a lot because it will be somthing that will keep you going! And I read in your profile you like reading and writing, and there's a lot of that in the coursework so that should be helpful too.

Was supposed to spend a year in Terrace but that fell through. I hear you about wanting to go exploring independently - it's the best - but don't worry, life is long and you'll have lots of time to do that. And what you're saying about snowboarding and skiing sounds valid, I think it's great that there's something you like doing outside with a high heart rate. I wonder what riding is like around there. I love it in the Interior with the dry snow and sunny days but I bet there are some really cool mountains around your home too. It's really cool that you're doing the coding course. Is it part of school or in your free time? I have lots to say about anything related and I'm happy too about being matched with someone who can benefit from my perspective.

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,21," Good on you for being disciplined and making yoga a priority! It sounds like you know what you need to do when you start to feel down, and that is such an important knowledge to have at this age. Wow! I love hearing about your background in work and school. You've had such cool experiences. It is so important to put your all into something when you choose to do it, and it sounds like you do that! What was it like being on the ocean for that long?! Did you feel isolated or lonely when you were at electrical school and didn't know anyone? I just moved to the island and I'm already trying to volunteer a lot so that I can meet friends hahah. Especially after covid, I can't wait to make new human connections with different people. Hiking every day sounds amazing. I get out frequently too, and my dog really makes me stick to a schedule with it! So, I had my first purely outside work experience this past summer, but I've worked in the environmental field for a while now. This summer I was back in Williams Lake collecting field data for my masters project. I had to learn how to do a ""field protocol"" which is basically just collecting data to answer a question. Mine was a lot of counting and measuring sticks and other wood on the ground, and doing a bunch of tree measurements. It was awesome. I got to hike around forests all day. One opportunity for you may be to apply to a research assistant position with a university. I had 3 research assistants who came out into the bush and helped me take the measurements I needed to learn about the wildfire risk in that area! If you're interested in field season (summer) work of any kind, keep an eye out for job postings from December - April! It helps a lot if you're currently a student, because lots of work experience only has funding to hire someone enrolled in post secondary school. That's just one option though. My boyfriend worked wildfire for 11 years, and during the winters had work with the BC government doing wildfire rehab, or worked for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans to monitor salmon populations in the Fraser River. More job opportunities are available through BC Parks, and Parks Canada. I worked for Ontario Parks a few years ago, and even though I had primarily an office job, I hiked after work all the time, got to spend days canoeing and doing park maintenance sometimes. It was awesome to just be in a beautiful park for work. My sister has worked for Parks Canada in Banff, the Gulf Islands, and now she's up in the North West Territories in the arctic circle. These jobs could be a great way to get into the field, and help you figure out what where you want to spend your time. They could all lead to lead term careers, but you'd start at the bottom and that's a really fun and stress free way of working for those organizations. Tree planting is another job opportunity you could pursue. I hear it's the best and worst time of my friend's lives haha. You don't make a tonne of money your first season, but as you get better at it you start making lots and some people live off what they made during the summer all winter. Same with wildfire. My partner LOVED wildfire. There was a lot of people around his age with similar interests and great community there. Does any of that catch your eye? What would you like to hear more about? Also, please check out the anchor texts for Career Considerations. You can take a quiz that might tell you about what jobs match up with your interests, and how many of those jobs exist/what they pay. Pumped to hear back from you!

I know for me getting back into the new school year can be a little stressful but I think once September is over and I am adjusted to the new routine it will be better. Oh, that's awesome, perfect for the fall. It's funny that you say that because a couple of friends and I were actually in New York a few years ago over Christmas. It was truly magical! The only thing was all the people I remember Fifth Avenue being packed with people getting last-minute Christmas gifts. However, Christmas day was a lot more relaxed and we even got a bit of snow as we walked through Central Park! New York is definitely one of those places I would suggest to people to visit if the opportunity arises because there is just so much you can do and see.

I was born and raised on Vancouver Island, and I have choosen to continue to live at home during my undergraduate degree. That's a great question. I am someone who in highschool, and even throughout my first year of university, I was very unsure of myself and if I would be able to accomplish what I wanted to do with my life. During my first year of university, I met someone who was able to give me a lot of great advice (since they were a few years older), and they showed me how to believe in myself. Since then, I have felt more motivated than ever to go after what I want from university/my future career, and I now understand the impact that a good mentor can have on someone's life.

This makes connecting with you so special and honestly speaking, so rewarding and a good learning experience for both of us. Isn't it? Thank you so much for reaching out with your very simple, honest, genuine, and funny message. I enjoyed reading it, and I got to know so much about you. I read through your profile answers to the questions. It looks like you want to become a Waterslide Tester. I did not know that such a job exists in the world. I had to google search and I found out that it is a well-paid job that does not require any technical qualification but depends on the person's personality, outlook, observation skills, intelligence. And looking at your profile answers and your message, I feel that you have all of these qualities from now itself as you are preparing for your future University higher learning, and career in the future. You wrote that you are a person who likes Video Games too much. I guess we all need some passion, time-pass activity, and a stress buster, and something that gives us satisfaction and happiness. I am sure video game is a wonderful activity for you that keeps you sane, active, and above all, happy. :-) You also wrote about the electrical trade. That is interesting for me as I do not have much expertise in electricals. I guess you can teach me something in this area. How about that? I observed that beyond your fun and funny side, you are also a philosopher where you are looking to find answers to the Universe. That is profound. So profound. I am sure if you will continue to be on your good path of living, learning, gaining experience, someday you will have all of the answers with you. I would encourage you to ask me any philosophical questions, and we can have some interesting or debating discussions. :-) I also see that you are an independent person. You are doing a part-time job of Pita bread at Pita Pit. I haven't been to Pita Pit and I am sure it must be a good food restaurant, and of course, you must be an awesome Pita Chef. :-) I love Pita bread, and I have been thinking about learning how to make Pita bread. I hope you could teach me? :-) Now, let's talk a little about your message. Thank you for taking the time to re-write your letter to me. Just so you know, you can feel free, and write to me about anything, any questions, or doubts that you might have. Be sure that I will always be a non-judgmental mentor and I will always support you with your decisions, choices, and perspectives. I surely would give you advice that might help you move forward with informed decisions/choices. I love sandwiches. When you wrote that you were eating Ham and Cheese Sandwich, I felt happy. We share something in common.:-) I also like different wraps. Burrito is one of my favorite wraps, which is healthy and filling. Clash Royle. Hmmmm. As a middle schooler, I used to play video games in the game centers where we had to insert a coin in the slot and we will have three lives to play a game. I remember spending a lot of money into those video games, but there was a time when I realized that draining out money like this is not helping me, and I gave up playing video games. But I do often play some easy video games on my phone or computer. I don't know if you know the game: RodentRush, and Mario Bros. I used to love them and sometimes do play them on my phone. As for me, I always wanted to become a University professor, and I did all of my university education like Masters in Geography, Masters in Population Studies, Master of Philosophy in Population Studies only to become a university professor. But you know, life is not easy as it seems. There were many candidates who had connections with the selectors and they got selected but I did not. Hence I thought I need a job soon, and since I like teaching, I could teach at school too. That's when I did my Bachelors of Education degree and became a high school teacher in Geography (Social Sciences). I worked in India, Indonesia, South Korea, and finally moved to Victoria to do my Masters in Special Education. I love to work with children with disabilities or learning disabilities. That is why I chose this Masters course at the University of Victoria. I hope to finish this course and become a Resource teacher and support children with learning disabilities or special education needs. A little about me, that I moved to Canada in June 2021 with my family: my wife, who is also a teacher. She teaches high school English. I have two daughters: 9 years (Grade 3) and 4 years (daycare). I also have a Maltese dog who is 5 years old. He is white in color and he is super cute and an intelligent yet silly dog. I call him my Son. His name is Mill. I will write more to you soon once I get a reply from your side. Take care David and I am eager to know more about you. :-) Write to me anything about that you like or dislike.

Among the options given above, I decided to choose ""food for thought"" and ""words to live by."" So, first, my favourite food would definitely have to be steak. Though I usually only eat it during special occassions. It's still one of my favourites. The amount of protein, flavour, and tenderness of the meat is something that I really love. I also know how to cook steak, so it's really perfect because every time I have a craving, I don't have to go to a restaurant to eat my favourite food. For the ""words to live by"" category, I really believe in the saying ""one step at a time."" It's really easy to get caught up in school and work. It's easy to feel stressed about a busy work week, but I always remind myself to finish one task at a time. This really helps accomplish even more than I thought I could.

1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,17," Hi Ann, Taking notes was definitely a struggle at the beginning but I did get the hang of it eventually. I typed all my notes during class using OneNote (a microsoft app). I would download the lecture slides onto here and then make notes on them using this software. I only made handwritten notes when I was studying outside of class and had time. Because I had the lecture slides downloaded, I didn't need to copy down everything on the slide - I only made additional notes. I assume you professor would also provide the slides. I think most professors don't allow recordings unless they provide them themselvs, but you can always double check. I think the most important thing is to really listen to what the professor is saying. If they are skimming over slides, don't worry about writing every single thing down. It will just be too overwhelming. Instead, if the professor is really highlighting something, make a few notes about it in your own words. I got way less out of classes where I was frantically writing and learned a lot more when I just really listened and only made notes when it seemed essential or like I would easily forget it. Especially for crim and sociology, those subjects are so conceptual there probably won't be too many facts you just have to memorize. You're best bet would probably be focusing on being engagned and listening to the professor. I unlocked the studying conversation. Are you able to view those videos?

1047513637,1047541060,10/2/2020 12:24,40651,3," Hello Challen!! (: Quite the interesting name by the way. Anyways, what got me into true crime was my grandfather, oddly enough. He used to work as a police officer in Kansas state. He'd tell me SO many stories about working as a police officer and that even inculded some cold cases he was apart of. Which then lead to the extentive reasearch in true crime, mass murders (like Jonestown, one of my favourties), and serial killers. Now, I know I probably shouldn't say that the Jonestown massacre is one of my favourite things, becuase it's not a good thing that it happened. Alright, moving on haha, as for cars the 1966 Ford Thunderbird in cherry red (you might want to google it) is one of my favourite cars. There's also the 1963 Ford Thunderbird roadster, it's a sports car, so it's smaller than the other one. In all honesty, I have no idea why my teacher told us we were doing this, I think I may have missed the whole explanation of it. However, from what I can gather from classmates is that this is kind of a advice for the future and guidence with the capstone project? Overall, I'm fairly neutral about it.

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,25," People really make the work experience eh? That and location really helps haha. If you're with great people in a beautiful place, work can be a lot of fun. With tree planting, you're hired onto a crew by a crew leader working for a company! It's usually a lot of young people and the social aspect keeps people going. It is really repetitive work and your body really feels it, but you get to go to beautiful, remote places and plant our future forests! BC Parks hires Junior Rangers for each summer. You could definitely google how to get involved with that program. They do stuff like trail maintenance, community outreach, wildlife surveys etc and get out to some spectacular parts of BC for work. Have you worked on your resume recently? Or practised writing a cover letter? They really help in getting noticed during a hiring process. Wildfire is a super cool choice. It's hard work and long days, but you're surrounded by other people your age with similar outdoors interests. Skiing and yoga and hiking would make you fit in well. It requires a lot of discipline but from the sound of things, you put your all into whatever work you get. Like I said, my partner loved it. You get out to super remote areas and up in helicopters, and get to help protect communities. It's great you got agricultural job suggestions. I know some people get work seasonally with farms and lots of people enjoy ""woofing."" That's just when you move around from farm to farm living there and working for the farmers. I have heard there's good opportunities in the southern interior and the island for woofing. There's a cool sustainable ranching and agriculture degree at Thompson rivers university in Kamloops. That may also be something to look into. I met a bunch of students from there through my old job, as they visited SXFN territory to see some grassland stewardship and grazing methods. Would working with cows interest you? Or is it more crop production? I had to google what hydroponics are. So cool. Your electrical skills would fit in well just about anywhere in life (such a practical skill), but for sure if you got involved with a hydroponics operation. I would encourage you to google stuff like ""hydroponics in BC"" to learn about if and where they're being used. I grew up on a small hobby farm in Ontario. We had chickens and horses and sometimes kept our friend's cows when he didn't have room in his pasture. We also hayed one of our fields and had a big veggie garden and some fruit trees! I would love to have some animals and a big garden again in my adult life. Would you like me to ask my friends who've tree planted about it more? I can also get some questions answered about wildfire from my boyfriend. Let me know if you have questions about those or anything else and I will do my best to help you with them! It's my goal to open up all these path ways as possibilities for you. No one ever really suggested them as options to me when I was recently out of high school, and I wish they did so I could have started looking for this type of work earlier!

After that I did 2 years of a Rural Pre-Medicine program, then transferred to Concordia University in Montreal to get my Bachelor's Degree in Biology. I graduated in 2020 and moved back home to start building a tiny house with my partner. Currently I am hoping to get into Midwifery or Medical school for next year, but in the meantime I am taking a Doula course.

And if you can't do something about a situation, why worry? - Dalai Lama (I really love this quote because it helps me feel ~slightly~ better when I am worried about something.

Pour over torn and de-stemmed Kale to wilt. Toss well to coat kale in oil. Crumble in feta and add balsamic to taste. Toss and serve. (I love this recipe that I got from a highschool friend's mom. It is so simple and delicious. It doesn't have any measurements because I do it by feel, but it is easy to make. It is absolutely delicious, and I've never met anyone that doesn't like it!

So, I think I would like to start our discussion with Well-being &amp; Self-care as it is the most important aspect in an individual's life. It is important to stay healthy and fit both mentally and physically. In my first year as a university student, I have felt a sense of anxiety, homesickness, and stress. Being an international student it is sometimes hard, whenever I do not perform up to my expectations I get anxious or depressed. But in this kind of situation, I always try to talk to someone, it could be anyone teachers, friends, family, any individual you can trust or government mental health helpline. You can talk to them and share your concerns with them and try to find a solution. I usually talk to mental support health at my university, they give me good suggestions to distract myself, or I talk to my parents or friends about it. I find it very relieving and makes me feel better and comforting. Sometimes you can try some workout, listen to music or do whatever you love or have an interest in, I guess that is gaming, as it is for me to feel better. I would like to know about your experiences if you have ever witnessed a mental breakdown, stress, anxiety, or depression and how did you deal with it? In response to the previous message, I also use my laptop for gaming. I won't say my laptop is garbage but it is also not the best. Although I support mostly all games. Currently, I am playing AOE, Shogun 2, GTA 5 online, and Brawlhalla. Do you play Brawlhalla? I find Brawlhalla kind of childish but it's fun to play.

What pushed you to pursue nursing? What sort of outdoor activities do you do? I love biking, skiing, and hiking:) I really identify with the quote you chose and I try to live my life that way. Lately, it has not been easy as I am very overwhelmed and stressed with school. However, one good thing about my week was that I passed my N drivers test yesterday which is super exciting:) Oprah is awesome I look up to her as well! I look forward to hearing from you!

1047499356,1047541067,11/12/2019 15:26,40644,5," Hi Jaden! Nice to hear from you! Nursing has been great! The past little while during the pandemic has been tough but it definitely is a rewarding career. One thing I really appreciate about nursing is that it's diverse and offers many opportunities in different areas including the hospital, community health buildings, the government, universities, school districts,etc. When I was completing my first degree (in science) I started working in a lab that dealt with genetics. I began to realize that the work was very independent, and although I enjoyed it, I wanted to pursue a career that was team-oriented and this led me to nursing! For outdoor activities, I love to snowboard, take my dog (huge dog fan) for walks, cycling, swimming, and hiking! I'm sorry to hear that you've been stressed with school. I've definitely been there! What kind of courses are you taking in school this year? Congrats on passing your N! That's so exciting!! I remember when I passed mine and it was super exciting. Enjoy and stay safe! When you have time to scroll through the different 'conversation options' below, let me know which ones you want to talk about and we can go from there. Nice speaking with you!

I picked it out myself. ;) That's a really cool way to get into crime -- another phrase that doesn't come out quite as intended, haha -- and I'm glad that you two had something interesting to bond over. I don't have as cool a story for my interest; I just liked listening to the ominous voices of YouTube readers going over new reports I haven't heard of, lol. And hey, the '66 is VERY nice in red!!! I'm not much of a car person myself, but I've seen many an oldie pass by on the way to the antique roadshows my hometown used to run semi-regularly and admittedly that's one of the nicer-looking ones I've seen. Not a bad choice at all. Neutral is totally fair!!! I'm glad to hear you don't hate the idea outright, at least. :P From what I can see, you aren't required to do alllllll of the units here, either (although we can if you feel like it when the required ones are done!), but your teacher has assigned you the Studying, Well-being and Self Care, Entering the Job Market, Career Considerations, Post-Secondary Considerations, and Paying for School units, so we've got plenty to start on if we wanna get it done by the end of the term.

I am from a small town in the Kootenays, but currently I am bouncing around BC for my electives for medical school. I love to be outdoors with my family, friends, and dog (skiing, biking, swimming, hiking, etc). I have recently started a new hobby (jewelry making), and I have kept up with an old hobby (singing). I would love to take up guitar again, as that was something that I used to really enjoy. To select a couple talking points from above, I found one of my favourtie quotes to share with you! I like it because it reminds me to do the things that I find enjoyable, and to live life to the fullest. Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming ""Wow! What a Ride! ? Hunter S. Thompson, I also thought about sharing a song, but it is so hard to choose just one! My music tastes tend to focus around indie/alternative/rock, with the occasional folk song. I am happy to share some songs if you are interested, but I am curious as to what genre of music you generally listen to? Would love to get to know you! I am open to discussing a wide variety of topics - really anything that you are interested in or have questions about. My particular interests lie in rural medicine, but I am willing and able to chat about anything! "," 2021-09-25, 22:45:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047538809,1047541072,9/7/2021 21:48,40634,1," Hey Christian! How's it going? My name is Damon and I'm a senior medical student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I'm currently working at Vancouver General Hospital with the kidney specialist team. I'm excited to be your mentor for the school year! I'm an open book so any questions you might have as you look to transition from high school to whatever is next after graduation, I would be happy to try to answer. In the spirit of getting to know each other, I'd love to hear about what subjects you enjoy at school, what your plans are after graduation, and also what kind of hobbies you enjoy outside of school. Words to Live by: ""compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today"". This quote really hits home for me because it reminds me that everybody has their own unique life situation, so trying to superficially compare yourself to others without knowing their story can lead to negative emotions that hurt rather than help you. It is often more valuable to take inspiration from others and apply it your own life, then thoughtfully track how you yourself are doing rather than comparing yourself to someone else. Public Persona: someone who I grew up idolizing was the late basketball legend Kobe Bryant. He took the quote I just mentioned to heart and worked on his basketball game every single day, regardless of how hard his teammates and opponents were working because his motivation was his love of the game of basketball. His discipline, grit, and wisdom really helped me to frame how I want to live my life and approach obstacles. I hope to hear from you soon!

I noticed that you are also interested in law and that you want to specialize in social justice and supporting women who have experienced domestic violance - we need more peolpe like you! It looks like you are interested in the University of Calgary, too! Although I am not currently studying there, I did my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at UofC so if there is anything in particular that you wanted to know about UofC, or if any questions come up during the program (about law, UofC stuff, applications, or really anything!), please send them my way! :) I am so excited to go on this journey with you and to learn from your experience and your ideas as we go through these activities! I really hope that this can be a meaningful experience for you and that we can accomplish all of the things that you were looking for in this program. For our activities for this section, I chose ""Words to Live By"" and ""Food for Thought"" - of course, you are welcome to choose any of them that you like, they don't have to be the same! My favourite quote is: ""Not all those who wander are lost"" by J.R.R. Tolkein. The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite series, so it is special to me because it is from one of those books but also because I feel like it has given me hope and encouragement throughout my time in university. When I feel like I haven't made the right choices with courses or even with my program, this quote reminds me that I may not be lost when a path doesn't seem obvious. There are opportunities to learn and new paths that arise unexpectedly that remind me that I haven't wasted time or made bad decisions. For ""Food for Thought"" I'll attach a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is special to me because it was the first recipe that I mastered after moving away from home to go to university! When I moved away, I had no idea how to cook anything and that was really challenging because I LOVE good food. I have come a long way from burning water (yes, that did really happen to me when I first tried to make pasta!) and love cooking for friends and feel proud that I can now make good, healthy food that I really enjoy :) Looking forward to hearing back from you when you have a chance!

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,27," https://wwoof.ca/hosts/search This is the Wwoof program that I mentioned! I think people have mixed experiences with whatever farm they're working with, but fortunately this website rates the farms on how others felt their experience went! There's lots in BC if you wanted to get into farming. I don't think this is a great way to make money, but its a great experience and I think farms normally house and feed you in exchange for work. http://hardcoretreeplanters.com/copy/treeplanting-companies/ This website lists different tree planting companies in Canada. Also cool to check out! Again, I've heard that its hard to make a lot of money during your first season, but if you come back anohter year you can make more and more. https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/employment-and-contracts/employment/wildfire-fighters This website tells you about the application for BCWS or contract fire crews. There are no details yet about the 2022 season, but work normally starts in March-April and ends in Sept-Oct. There's lots of overtime and standby pay, so fire fighters usually make a lot of money during a busy season. I'm sure its less in your first season, but still more than other places of employment! I would check job postings for 2022 in Dec/Jan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F1SjQmmOUQ&amp;list=PL98F546CAAFA58723&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=ProvinceofBC https://bcparks.ca/employment/student-ranger/ That youtube video is a promotion for the student ranger program for BC Parks! They haven't posted 2022 jobs yet, but it looks like applications are usually due in February before the season. You would have to be a full time student to get these jobs. Are you still a full time student? Will you be after the 2022 summer? Anyway, you can work all over the province and they get a bunch of unique work experiences. https://alis.alberta.ca/junior-forest-rangers/ The government of Alberta also has an incredible program for 16-18 year olds. They get fire fighting experience, along with forestry experience and other natural resource type jobs. If you're over 18, there's always the crew leader positions! I think you'd learn a lot. Also, my best friend is in the Fish, Wildlife and Recreation Program at BCIT this fall. She's doing the 2 year program, and hoping to work at Parks Canada during the summer. She really loves it so far. They're learning a bunch of plant ID and get so much time out in the field. I think later this winter they'll be tagging salmon in the Harrison River.

Hopefully eveyrthing has settled down a bit now as we try and figure out the whole COVID situation!

It's fantastic to be working with another LGBTQIA2S+ person whos inteterested in health care. I'm interested in hearing about your experiences and the path you've taken. As for the prompts- Musical Interlude- one of my favourite songs currently is Coming Clean by Green Day. The song is about Billy Joe Armstrong (the lead singer and guitarist of the band) coming to terms with his sexuality. The main chorus includes the line ""I found out what it takes to be a man, now mom and dad will never understand"" and I can relate to that. Being LGBTQ+ in general is very hard and not an experience a lot of people get to have. Green day is just one of my favourite bands, but that song sticks me with me.

I read over your profile and am super interested in your goal to become a gynecologist and your motivation being to better this place for women. I thought of pursuing a career in gynecology due to the poor medical care I unfortunately recieved over the past 3 years. Both men and women have different bodies and with that comes unique complications, doctors in the past have told me that if they discovered what was wrong with me sooner- i wouldn't be suffering their consequences today. I want to be able to give women but especially young women a loud voice for all their healthcare needs. However, money has always been a large determinator in my life and has turned me away from a few other career ideas in the past. I find it difficult not to stress about how I'll pay for schooling and the idea of putting myself in debt gives me great anxiety. I am anticipating the advice you may have to share with me!

I also absolutely love the outdoors, living in BC surrounded by mountains is honestly a blessing. I live in a small town near a ski resort so going up there and seeing everything kilometers around you is awe-inspiring. I can hardly hold onto a hobby for more than a couple of weeks but there are some video games I have been playing for a couple of years. I try to do small woodworking projects that just take hand tools every now and then because that's another thing I enjoy. On this website, it suggests a few topics of conversation and one that really stuck out is 'Words to live by' I have a few personal philosophies that I live by and the one I'm choosing is Look for the best in every situation, don't be blissfully ignorant of the bad, accept it all and find the good. I pride myself on my optimism and confidence so That quote is something I think about when I start having more negative thoughts or when I need to analyze a bad situation. There are so many bad things happening which I try to be aware of and it's sometimes hard thinking positively and humanistically but that quote really helps center me. I attached an image of the Torres Del Paine mountains in Chile, I Love mountains and think they are the most beautiful land formations (rivers, lakes, plateaus, etc). These mountains, in particular, are just stunning in my opinion, the black rock at the tips of the peaks with the surrounding area is just a wonderfully humble but extravagant sight.

Four more courses and then you'll be done! That's so exciting! Does that mean you'll graduate in December? Are you looking forward to it? What is CLC? Chem 12 is challenging. That was my favorite course in high school.

1047512913,1047540975,9/18/2020 17:10,40363,7," I am glad you were able to hear a bit about mental health :D I think you are wise for not being set on one specific career path at the moment. Grade 12 is a great time in life to try to hear about a variety of fields/careers. If you plan on going to university/college, I think your first year is the perfect time to try a variety of classes that interest you to see if you could imagine yourself in a field long term. In my first year, I took classes such as nutrition, psychology, and english. I really enjoyed most of my classes, and I got a better idea of what I would be good at in the future. I liked that the major I chose (psychology) allowed for a lot of electives, so I was not restricted to taking only required classes. If you want to do more to try to narrow down your interests, I would also recommend trying to set up a meeting to talk with or shadow someone in a job that you are intersted in. For example, I have shadowed two dentists for a few hours, and it was really cool to see what a typical day looks like for them. It really helped me further confirm that I should continue pursuing a career in dentistry. I definitely think it is understandable that you were less motivated with classes being online! I have heard that many university students had a similar experience. For me, it was a bit of a struggle taking classes online, but once I got used to it, it was okay. There were pros and cons. For example, I saved a lot of time not travelling to and from school, and I didn't have to attend labs in person, but I also did become less happy without much real-life social interaction. It has been so fun getting to know you so far! Although we can of course keep chatting about any of these topics, if you are ready, we can start working through the modules! Are there any in particular that your teacher has assigned? "," 2021-09-28, 20:33:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Wildfire sounds awesome I think it is something i would really enjoy and have some amazing experiences with. This is pretty random but I think it would be sweet to learn how to fly helicopters for wildfire because I could even use it to get to cool islands or mountains so easily in a helicopter, I think it would be hard though because I am very colourblind and I heard you need good eyes. BC parks in terrace were hiring rangers last summer but I wasnt that into it because my friends didnt want to do it and i believe it was minimum wage and I already had a better job offer. I did make my resume this summer for my electrical job but I could defiently add some experience on there now. The fisheries and wildlife course in the kootneys still really intrigues me im just unsure what job I would want to aim for when I finish the course. The alberta firefighting course would be sweet just to get some training in that field as a crew leader. I am a full time student right now but will be working as an electrician full time next summer. BC parks would be pretty fun I think. Im definelty gonna check out the firefighting contract crews it sounds awesome the experiences are probably so insane. Did you say your boyfriend use to do wildfire?

It's like a diamond in a haystack, hard to find, but a pretty gem when you meet one, right? I am excited to share to you my experiences as we go along, and hear about your journey as well. My response to your prompts: Wow, that is a very short but powerful song, thank you for sharing that! The line you mentioned, I feel, hits the hardest in the song. There are many ways it can be interpreted, and I believe that is the beautiful nature of the song you shared. More commonly, I can understand how it depicts ideas of coming out in a world where people are not easily understanding, and willing to understand. When I discovered I was gay in middle school, I solemnly promised myself I wouldn't tell anyone, especially my parents who ""will never understand,"" seeing as how they were raised and the ideas they imposed on me as a child. Nowadays, the feeling is different, and the desire of ""coming clean"" is stronger. ""Secrets collecting dust but never forget,"" really expresses how I feel in terms of that.

Growing veggies for sale would be awesome. I don't know much about becoming a helicopter pilot, but I know it takes a lot of time and money. It's really cool what you can do with a license though. I'm not sure if your colour blindness would affect your ability to become a pilot. Definitely worth looking up if you feel passionately about it. Ya, minimum wage kinda sucks. If you're able to realistically make living on minimum wage work, the experience in Parks would be awesome. Do you already have a job lined up for this next summer? Or are you just currently planning on working full time as an electrician next summer? You may want to look at the link for the Selkirk Fish and Wildlife course. They may have a section on their page about what their grads are doing now for work! Wildfire is awesome, you should definitely check it out. Great networking for other natural resources jobs too. So many of you supervisors and colleagues will be working in a bunch of different fields. My boyfriend fought fire for 11 years! He started while he was still in high school in Williams Lake. He was on an initial attack crew (a group of 3 that go out and action new fires ahead of everyone else), and became a crew leader after about 3-4 years being a crew member. After a few years of being a crew leader, he worked as the supervisor for all of the Cariboo Fire Centre's initial attack crews for two years. So he was in charge of 13-15 three-person crews. One year he transferred to the Yukon and ran a First Nation's fire crew near Dawson City, which made him fall in love with the North and make good connections up there. He loved the community he made with his coworkers, many of whom are now his closest friends. He loved helping people and working with fire. A lot of people find the work hours a lot, but he loved it. Sometimes you work 16-17 hour days during a busy fire season. You make really good money working that much overtime, and sometimes you're paid just to chill at home in case a fire starts (that's called standby). He would fight fire during the summers, and then work other natural resources jobs, travel, or go do his undergrad degree during the winters. His last season was 2019. He quit so he could go get his masters and become a forester. He's now got his masters and is working for a forestry consultant company on the island! But, he really misses fire and is even considering taking a leave from his job next summer to go back and fight fire in the Yukon again. I think the biggest thing he didn't like was never knowing when/if he would be called away on a fire. It means that you can't plan for much during the summer. However, he misses the money and the people in fire. let me know if you have more questions! I have yet again given you a lot of information haha.

The only travel I've done is in BC with the exception of a few trips to Seattle. Every other winter my family goes on a big ski trip around BC visiting a half dozen other mountains. If I were to ever travel I would love to go for a big hiking trip around the world, including the Torres del Paine in Chile. The main video game I play and stick with is Destiny 2. it has such genuinely fantastic world-building, lore, story, and characters. The gameplay is also top-notch having some of the most interesting and dynamic features that arent in any other game. I personally believe it is a science fiction universe rivaling that of star wars or star trek, with the added bonus of being able to experience that universe as the protagonist. As for ethnicity, I'm as white as snow; Irish, and german.

""Words to live by"" There is a Chinese proverb I like to live by, ""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now."" I believe that when we think we've missed that opportunity window to do something, we end up saying, ""Well, there's no use in starting now, because it is too late.""

But I'm going to try to actually cook something for dinner tonight, probably jambalaya - I make it with lentils, tomatoes, and rice. Sounds kinda boring but I promise it tastes good.

I would like to share one of my favorite songs I like to visit back to here and there. IMAGINE. (Ultimate Mix, 2020) - John Lennon &amp; The Plastic Ono Band (with the Flux Fiddlers) HD - YouTube The song I have shared with you is by John Lennon - Imagine. I learned this back in high school in the choir, and I've been shaken by the lyrics ever since. He emphasizes calling for peace and unity and moving past our differences and barriers to be together as one. It is an old song and refers to the Vietnam war. However, I believe it has held its water for years. Especially nowadays, with the social/political climate, many history-made events occurring, and so much conflict going on, we can't help but imagine a world with ""no countries,"" ""no posessions,"" and there is ""nothing to kill or die for."" I guess I really enjoy this song, because ""I am a dreamer"" too. I think a lot can be said about what the lyrics convey in this song. I hope you enjoy it!

I don't bake much at all, so it could get messy. Hope it's not too bad, although nobody is home rn so there will be no witnesses. ... Except my dog. Anyways, cradle is a pretty great song. I listen to it too:) My tastes are pretty eclectic, so I have everything from pop to jazz to rock to classical. Everything except counrty tbh. *Shivers in disgust* Vivaldi was a pretty popular classical composer way back in the day, so I'm not surprised you don't know him. Not too many people do. Nice on the writing! I don't do poetry too much unless its a assignment, in which case I pull out liberal amounts of BS from my back pocket. That, along with a splash of cool vocabulary tends to get the job done. I finished editing my book a month or so ago, and am awaiting my faithful servants (parents, teachers, and friends) to finish proof reading it. They aren't very fast I gotta say. They finish it and then remember they have to edit. Pretty frusterating, cause I was hoping to send it in a while ago. But you know, its just time to relax I suppose. I don't do much creative writing to be honest. I just kind of jumped straight into a book from nothing, which was a very very very steep learning curve. Re-reading the first few chapters after I finished was agony. This has gotten a bit long, so I'll end it here. Two quick questions before I leave though, I read she/her on you profile but just figured I'd confirm it before messing it up. After reading that sentance I realise that wasn't worded as a question, but I don't want to delete my beautiful creation, so I'm just putting a question mark here and calling the last sentance a question?

I have had a chance to look through so here is my bit :) - I always thought of studying in the context of ""traditional"" school, where we are taught something, then we try to memorize it for a test. This changed A LOT in nursing school, as we transitioned to a more drawn out version. It now looks more like Prereading notes before class &gt; class for discussing the topics you should now know &gt; study study &gt; apply to real life people in practicum &gt; test on how you apply knowledge I found this relly challenging beacause all of a sudden it wasn't enough to just know a fact, I had to know how to use this fact to inform my nursing practice (ie I couldnt just know the biology around heart failure, I had to know how it would affect my patients and what I would do to help those patients) The most effective study strategy was whiteboards and reteaching. My friend and I often stayed at school after classes to re-write out concepts from class and then we would teach each other. This was a great way to review the material multiple times, and by teaching each other and asking each other questions, we were able to pick out areas that we needed to work on more. I also 100% agree that thinking of real-life applications is a great way to remember things - there were soooo many times in exams where I couldn't remember my notes about a disease, but I remembered a patient I had worked with and it helped me to answer the question!

1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,5," Hi Ann, I think that is a great idea! Procrastinating is so easy and I've fallen into that trap many times myself. What I think might help you even further is setting smaller goals within your overall schedule. So, for example, Wednesday after school you'll study for capstone - but what do you want to get done exactly? I think maybe set aside a specific amount of time, say, an hour, and then estimate what you can get done in that time. Maybe you're going to study a specific chapter or learn 10 definitions. Whatever the goal is, I think it just helps to have one to stay on track. I know that when I tell myself ""Oh tomorrow night I'll study for biology"" vs. ""tomorrow night I am going to study the cell chapter and have all the cell parts memorized"", I am much more likely to procrastinate the first one rather than the second because there is no specific goal I am trying to achieve. Also, if I tell myself I am going to study for an hour and then see a friend, watch a movie, have an ice cream, etc. I am much more motivated and efficient.

Here's a little bit about me: I am currently in my third year at the University of Victoria studying Political Science. I am also doing a minor in Global Development Studies. I am originally from Calgary, Alberta. I've read your profile, and I saw that you figure skate! I used to dance before I left for school. Kind of similar. I also did school abroad in high school, and have looked into it for university. I'm considering going abroad for grad school or law school. With COVID, I wasn't able to do an exchange term, but I'd love to discuss it with you! I'd really like to know more about you in general too. I also saw that you're interested in pursuing fashion design, which I'm excited to know more about. Do you have any favorite designers, or celebrities you enjoy looking to for inspo? I'm always a huge fan of what Zendaya is wearing. How has school been for you so far? Also, don't feel like you need to tell me more if you don't feel like it. This is all about what you need and what I can help you with. Lastly, I was hoping you could tell me a little more about what you're looking for in a mentor. I see that you're looking for a role model, so I'd like to know what that looks like and what that means to you. If you have any questions for me, feel free to send them along and I will try to answer them the best I can. Cheers, Ava "," 2021-10-02, 13:42:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Damn, I really admire your drive when it comes to writing! Back when I was still a teenager I could run off 3 hours of sleep and be fine but now if I do that I become a literal walking zombie who can't function at all, so I usually try to get as much sleep as possible lol. I actually just made the recent decison to quit my job though so I have more time to focus on writing - and school too of course. Lmao I'm really not the party type - I've always been more of an introvert and into the staying home and spending time with my cats kind of life. Buuuut I do have some friends from work and we'll all go out for dinner or a movie night together when we can find time! I gotta go out at least some times and remind myself there's a whole world out there. I'm one of those weirdos who actually likes school, so I'm really enjoying university! Plus it helps to be in a program that I love. It's soooooo nice to be on campus again too - last year was pretty tough with it all being online. Being in English classes, though, is a shit ton of reading and writing. Luckily there hasn't been anything major due yet though, so I'm staying pretty on top of things. For now. Ask me in a few weeks and I might be drowning. I have 4 classes right now; two of them I really enjoy because the professors are really into hearing what us students think about the texts, like what stood out to us or seems important, because I like being able to share what I connected to in the text. In one of my other classes though, the prof just lectures and asks very direct questions - more of like yes/no answers - and it's just kinda annoying because I want to share my own opinion, not just listen to hers. How's school going for you? Are you in your last year? :) Also - if you want to, we can hit the ""Working through this program"" to start getting into some other stuff! I feel like I've gotten to know you now, so I'm ready if you're ready :) Okay, I think I got a cool sign off figured out: Ba la la la ~ ~ * Stasia "," 2021-10-02, 17:01:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Quitting your job sounds like quite the investement into writing, hope it works out! And honestly for me it was more about perseverance than anything skill related, so more time should hopefully help. What do I know though, college sounds busy.

Otherwise I would be duty bound to exit this website, stop talking to you, and probably fail this assignment. School is super chill for me right now, last year alright. Classes are easy, people don't bug me, and now if anyone gets in my way in the hallways they move around me instead of the other way around. Small miracles I guess. I am unsure what we actually have to do for the working through the program stuff. Is it given to us by the mentorcity platform, or do we have to find images and whatnot by ourselves.

1047541305,1047540972,9/16/2021 13:14,40346,1," Hey Mataya, Hope you enjoyed watching the short documentary on Finding Inspiration. To reflect on the documentary, I encourage you to answer the following questions (all of these are generally listed above as well): 1) What idea stood out to you from the documentary? 2) How do you feel after watching the documentary and thinking about an idea from it? 3) Do you have any questions about the idea in the documentary? 4) How does the idea from the documentary relate to your future? Feel free to share anything that resonated with you from the documentary! For myself, an idea or phrase that stood out to me was when one filmmaker said if it does something for you, it does something for someone else. When I first entered post-secondary, I was very hesitant to try new things or push myself outside my comfort zone. What I learned was you have to try new things to find inspiration. The more opportunities you take part in, the more you get to learn about yourself and learn from others. When I first started volunteering with students, I did not realise that they would have such a huge impact on my life. But they do students will learn from you but you also get the opportunity to learn from them and their stories and experiences. So, going back to that quote I mentioned, these students have had such a huge impact on my life and I have that same impact on theirs as well. If I did not push myself outside my comfort zone and try new things, I would not have discovered my love for working with students. I listened to a podcast in which the speaker said the people that are most successful are the ones that try new things and build a variety of skill sets. I believe that finding inspiration is something we do throughout our lives. We only continue to grow and become more knowledgeable. I can guarantee you that you will learn so much after high school, and a much of your learning will be from your experiences. So, dont be afraid to try new things and explore your interests when the time is right. "," 2021-10-04, 11:16:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

1047513638,1047540968,10/2/2020 12:24,40354,1, I think it's so cool how people can find inspiration in such different ways. I think I am most similar to Denys Arcand and Roch Carrier. I like to use creativity to tell my story in a genuine way. I also find that often the work I am most proud of happened beause something didn't go the way I thought it would. Like if I'm cooking and burn something (I'm not a very good cook so this happens often) then I have to come up with a creative solution quick otherwise my dinner isn't going to very good!

Last year, we did the quarter system, which I liked because I could focus on two subjects at once. Now, we are back to the semester system, so it will take some time to get used to four classes at once. Because I worked full time this summer, I didn't get to do many fun things, other than day trips with friends and family. Now, I don't have much time to work, as I am busy with volunteering at the SPCA, and am also taking an off timetable leadership and fitness class! Although it's a busy schedule, I think it will be benefitial for me in the long run when I eventually have to transition to univeristy.

1047512485,1047538823,9/10/2020 17:51,40135,1," Hi Ann, Ill start off by sharing my thoughts on the video. Ironically, the ideas that resonated with me the most sort of contradict. The first idea comes from Mina Shum; everything we do we plan based off of a want or desire. The second comes from Roch Carrier; what is truly important is not planned. Planning and looking into the future is something that helps me identify my goals and stay motivated. I think its really helpful to spend some time thinking about what you actually want and what makes you happy. This seems like an easy question to answer, but it can actually be difficult at times. What Ive wanted has changed quite frequently throughout my life, and I dont think this is a bad thing. Its just important to try to keep track of what you want so you can make sure youre on the track that will make you happiest and help you achieve your goals. For example, I always knew I wanted to play university soccer, so I worked really hard during my high school days to improve my game and reach out to lots of schools. I had moments of doubt when things got difficult or when I just didnt really feel into it. I found taking time to reflect on what soccer meant to me, what I loved about the game, and why I wanted to play university soccer helped me through these things. If I had ultimately decided that soccer didnt mean much to me anymore, this also would have been helpful and I could have done something else! However, despite how much we can plan our lives, so much of what happens in life and often the most meaningful things are what we dont plan. Currently, I am working in the recreation department at Lakeview Long Term Care Centre in East Van. This is not something I ever though Id do; I was envisioning something like a clinical kinesiology job for myself. Although this would have been amazing as well, I couldnt be more grateful for the role Im in now. It may not be glamorous or what I pictured for myself, but it is the main reason why I want to go to medical school. Spending time with these elders shows me how much I value human connection, specifically intergenerational relationships and connections. I have always wanted to work with vulnerable populations, but this job has solidified my interest. I feel almost called to pursue a career where I can both fulfill my scientific interests and also serve the most vulnerable and marginalized members of our community. Ultimately, what may be the real key to finding inspiration and motivation for me is having an open mind. I have surrounded my self with but also been lucky enough to be surrounded by friends, coworkers, teammates, teachers, and coaches who are really special and inspiring human beings. I learn so much from the people in my life and I try to learn from and get the most out of experiences that I dont plan, such as this job or just meeting people I didnt intend or expect to. This is why its also important to try and say yes to as much as you can, especially during university. Of course, dont say yes to everything as youll become overwhelmed with too much on your plate. But, try to say yes to new opportunities whether they are organized volunteering, clubs, or even just chances to hang out with a new group of people. Still be reasonable and take time to study when you need to or just chill and watch TV (relaxing and self care are also so important!), but I found I never regretted joining or doing something that pushed me out of my comfort zone.

I like what Roch said about how ""creation is always an accident"". Whenever I'm doing something creative, I always start with a vague idea of what I want to do, and then it usually evolves and looks different from how I planned. I think it's like that with life as well, where you can have a plan, but new opportunities and obstacles always come up, so you have to find your way, and yourself, in those challenges.

I like cake decorating too! I don't do it very often, but it's definitely a fun (and delicious) creative outlet. I did the Rural Pre-Medicine program at Selkirk College in Castlegar. It was a lot of work, but I really enjoyed it. I think that there is a lot of benefit in going to a smaller college before university. I made lots of friends and all the professors were really great! I found it a lot more conducive to learning because of the smaller class sizes. I decided not to do the 3rd year, as I wanted to get a Bachelor's Degree and the 3rd year wasn't trasferrable - meaning it wouldn't could toward my degree and I would have to do 2 more years of classes instead of 1. As for how to choose, that's a little tougher to answer. That being said, I would think about what courses you have enjoyed in highschool and why you enjoy them. I have always enjoyed Biology, and that helped me in my decision to pursue medicine. I really didn't know what I wanted to pursue initially, so I took a year off to try something new (becoming a nanny in Ireland) and during that time is really when I figured out I wanted to apply to the Rural Pre-med program. Just remember, whatever you decide to do, you can always change your mind if it isn't right for you. I think it's important to choose a path that's sustainable for you (in term of not burning out before you finish). I found my transition to post secondary to be pretty smooth. I think time management can be tricky, and it can be a little stressful, but it's not entirely different from secondary school. Midterms can be a lot of work, especially if you have more than one in a day/week, or if you have a midterm many weeks in a row. I think it just solidifies how important it is to not fall behind. Schools have a lot of resources to help you when you neee it, so it doesn't have to be as scary as it may seem. The hardest transition for me was moving to Montreal and not having any friends at university. The classes are so big, and I'm pretty introverted, so it was difficult to make friends. I did eventually make some friends, and I could text/FaceTime my friends in BC, but it was definitely a little lonely. I hope those answers make sense and aren't too long lol. Let me know if you have any more questions. :) Madia "," 2021-10-05, 19:31:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I went to the University of British Columbia Okanagan for nursing school and I took a bunch of classes ranging from Anatomy and Physiology to Advanced clinical reasoning.

That is probably my favorite thing about nursing school. The program at UBCO is set up to have the same classes and clinical rotations with your cohort as your progress throughout the four years so you get to know most people pretty well!

1047512913,1047540975,9/18/2020 17:10,40363,11," Yes that's basically how I asked to shadow! If you know the dentist, you can send a professional email to them asking to observe them at work, or if you don't know them, then I would probably recommend calling their office or dropping by in person to introduce yourself and ask them (and bring your resume with you). When applying to dental school (to become a dentist) they often recommend or require a certain number of shadowing hours, so most dentists should not be surprised by you asking, and they may have even had a student observe them before! Another great thing that you can get from shadowing is that you can try to build a strong professional relationship with the dentist you are shadowing (especially if they allow you to come back to shadow multiple times). This will come in handy when it's time to apply to dental schools and you need reference letters, or if you would just like someone to give you advice about your application or dental school in general. Okay, thanks for letting me know. Good choice of the studying topic!

To take a step back, the context of the video is that various filmmakers are presented photos taken by other filmmakers, and they are asked to describe the context of the pictures from their own perspective. The idea that it tries to communicate is that the same prompt could inspire a variety of different thoughts for each person. Additionally, as they talk through how they think about inspiration themselves. One of the ideas that I found most powerful in the video is ""I'm trying to evoke a feeling or I'm provoked by a feeling. The more specific the better. As long as it does something for you, you have to trust that at some point it translates into something for other people."". Oftentimes, we hold back our own creativity by putting limitations on it even before we start exploring ideas, and I think this helps provide an insight into some of these filmmakers' minds into how to approach the topic of ""inspiration"".

They get blasted by winter and lose their branches but they keep going. So they symbolize strength and even though they're kind of ugly, they're also beautiful. And for music, I listen to a lot of different things. It was hard to find something safe for school - I don't want to get us in trouble lol. When I'm studying and working I listen to a lot of electronic music because if I listen to music with words I get distracted. Here's a song from one of my favourite producers in Vancouver, something light and easy and not going to distract me. Link That's a lot of words for now. Looking forward to hearing back from you.

It's an interesting one. I thought the idea behind the documentary, that they take pictures and pass them off to eachother to provide someone new with inspiration and motivation was really cool. It shows that different people see things differently and that is what makes each of us unique and special. Personally, I related most with Denys' idea of inspiration in that the creative process should come from inside of you and not be influenced by what you think people want you do or create. Only when you are personally drawn to something, will it feel fulfilling to you. It's just like when considering your future education and jobs, only if you learn and work at something that inspires you (and not what other people suggest you should do), will you be happy. What did you think about the video and what I said about it? which of the people in the video did you relate the most too when it came to the way they found their inspiration? Also, I know that pro gaming is something that interests you in the future; can you see what inspired that decision from seeing how these people in the video were inspired?

I am hoping to get into law school after I finish my degree, but Im sort of in the same boat as you  Id love to travel at one point before the rest of my life gets going. When I went abroad in high school, I spent five weeks in Europe in the following cities: London, England; Paris, France; Strasbourg, France; Gimmelwald, Switzerland; Munich, Germany; and Prague, Czech Republic. If I travelled for university, I would have loved to go back to Europe  I really would love to go to school in Edinburgh, Scotland. The options are really endless though! As for gap years, my roommate here in Victoria did a gap year before coming to university. She travelled Europe and doesnt have a single regret about taking the gap year, so if you do want to take a gap year to travel, theres definitely nothing wrong with that! If you do want to do school while youre gone, I can tell you a bit more about my experience. Your travels will probably be different, but we spent short amounts of time in each city. Managing school with travel was an interesting experience, as it called for a shift in my time management compared to what I was used to in high school. I put myself on schedules so I could have time to do work and sightsee. Time management is pretty crucial if you're continuously traveling, and I know one of my regrets is not seeing more because I was a pretty brutal procrastinator. However, I have no regrets about the trip overall. It was such a great experience. Let me know if you have any more questions, Ava "," 2021-10-07, 18:13:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I could see teachers doing this in a creative writing class - and I'd be one of the students all over it haha. I really like what the first speaker said - about if you are partaking in creation, you have intention. Sometimes when I go to write - especially poetry - I don't necessarily have an intention I can put into words, but I just feel like I NEED to write. And then after some playing around with words, something will emerge that I latch onto and can write an entire poem from. I think it's interesting how you can have that intention without even knowing exactly what it is, it might just be a fleeting feeling, but something in you is like I GOTTA GET THIS OUT and create something. I love the process of creation - I like losing track of time because I'm so focused on creating. At times like that it really makes me feel like this is what I'm MEANT to be doing. Do you ever feel like that with writing too? Or is your process different when deciding to write? :) Ba la la, Stasia "," 2021-10-08, 12:14:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

10161,1047541041,1/10/2017 17:16,40639,9," Hi Elise. The 3rd year isn't entirely untransferrable, but it didn't transfer into a degree I wanted or a school I wanted. I think it's transferable to Royal Roads university (but I can remember which program), and some others. I think the Selkirk website outlines where it is transferable. And obviously if you get into med, the tranferability into a Bachelor's degree doesn't really matter. I would still recommend the program to people interested in pursuing Rural Medicine. And I found the first 2 years that I did to be really good, and easily transferable out of province. I'm very sorry to hear about your cousin. I hope you don't mind me asking (feel free to ignore this question if you do), but is your cousin Evelyn? We were pretty close friends as she was my lab partner and we also worked together. I would say that my grades didn't fluctuate too much. My average probably went down a little, but generally was pretty similar. I did find Calculus to be a lot harder than high school math (which was my best subject back then). I think that this varies between people, and generally has more to do with time management and study habits than it does to do with ""intelligence"". I think it is harder for many people to stay on top of things in college/uni, so good habits go a long way. My expenses in first year were pretty minimal because I was living at home and had some scholarships. That being said, I think tuition was like $3000 a semester and I spent at least $1000 on textbooks. This is Selkirks breakdown of fees: https://selkirk.ca/financial-information/tuition-fees/tuition-fees and other schools will have similar tables or calculators. If I was renting and buying my own groceries my costs would have been a lot more. I would really suggest not buying new textbooks. There are lots of 2nd hand textbook sale groups on Facebook and you can save a lot of money that way. I learned pretty quickly that new textbooks are not worth it. Most professors say that older editions are just fine (though sometimes the page numbers don't line up, but you can work around that). Sorry I can't be more helpful about the rent/living expenses side of things, but don't really know the costs. I had a pretty difficult time deciding what career I wanted to pursue (honestly still not entirely sure). I was sort of thinking about engineering in high school, but not very seriously. And then my older sister went into engineering and I didn't want to do the same thing as her (maybe not a logical choice, but I didn't like being compared to her lol). When application time came around in grade 12 I had no idea, so I decided to take a year off. When I was in Ireland, the two things I was considering were Acting (I love drama class in high school) and Med school, and I decided on medical school because I didn't feel like I had the skills or courage to pursue acting. I don't think I was ever serious about pursuing acting anyways lol it just seemed like it could be fun. I hope you are having a lovely long weekend and are enjoying the nice fall weather.

One thing I dont like is how far we are from big cities like kamloops and vancouver because everytime our rugby team goes on trips we have to travel 15 hours just to play 1 game of rugby, its pretty silly. Also I dont like how we dont have any fun hangout spots in our town so there isnt much to do in our town.

1047516843,1047538827,12/4/2020 17:52,40142,1," Hello! I totally agree with you regarding the close community and access to nature that is found in rural areas. I am rural at heart. That is a really long way to travel for just one game of rugby. My partner had to do that too for his high school rugby team haha. My hometown was southern and suburban, about an hour east of Toronto. Even though it was probably equivlant to Abbotsford or something else in the lower mainland, it still felt small and we had no where to hangout other than McDonalds or the movie theatres haha. So I feel you there! The biggest city I've ever lived in was Vancouver. We moved there last September and stayed until May of this year, when we moved to the island. We did a couple things to find rentals there. I joined a bunch of rental facebook groups for Vancouver, and looked on Craigslist. Because we were looking for roommates (the price of living on our own wasn't worth it), I posted in the facebook groups and Craiglist with a little about us and what we liked to do. I had many people contact me directly, and we kinda got to choose the best option for us. Making friends was for sure harder in Covid times. Being enrolled in school helped because there were people in my partner's program and mine of similar age/life phase that we could ask to go on walks, or have a campfire with, or grab coffee with. So, starting with coworkers or school mates is always a good thing I think. If we were there longer and if Covid was less of a factor, I would have volunteered more. We're volunteering in Cumberland for things now and it's an awesome way to meet people that have similar interests as you. Also, joining clubs for sports or board games is another great way to meet people. Facebook pages are a good way to find out about local events or groups. It's definitely harder to meet people as an adult, but if you're moving to a city for school, I think that can help in the pursuit of friends. Do you have any more questions? Or shall we move onto the ""Between Worlds"" link above. There's a small video to watch there that the Rural eMentoring staff would like us to watch and talk about."," 2021-10-13, 08:38:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

The faculty and staff at UBCO were very supportive and want you to succeed! It is quite important to build a set of strong coping mechanisms to offset the stress that comes with University.

A quote that resonates with me around that topic would be Sometimes you risk everything for a life worth living, even if your not the one thatll be around to see it- Cherie Dimaline. Growing up in a few small towns and being around such amazing groups of people I feel that this quote really speaks to our fight against things like the climate crisis, and how it is possible to get through them. I am just very grateful that I dont feel alone in these problems. I feel as though there are lots of people around me who really do believe in [risking] everything for a life worth living A place that feels lonely for me would sometimes be around other people.

It's Human nature that we run blindly after a ""dream life,"" but we often end up missing the present moment, which is worth more than a million dollars. Nature is divine and a true blessing in the literal sense, but we see it passing off our hands by running after the technologies. Although technical development is essential, compromising it with the most excellent, most divine, and life-giving nature can not be justified. You are definitely not alone in this fight against the climate crisis, water levels falling, pollutions, etc.; in my country as well, we are experiencing a terrible phase of the climate crisis. Another more painful part is that we are losing humanity along with nature :( I totally understand the need for me-time. Although I'm an ambivert, as much as I desire social connection, my longing for staying all by myself is the same. I know right, we have a whole universe within ourselves, so how can we feel lonely!

I know we will get along well and be good partners. This quote Ill be sharing with you connects with most of the time here is the quote Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. By Jennifer Lee. I connect with this quote because it reminds me to be brave and strong with your problems and not let anything or anyone let you down the hole or dark space. I try to be strong most of the time but lately has been hard trying to eat but fake I did eat then Im in the bathroom getting rid of the calories. Its been hard these past two years but doing Career life education is helping me and making know I can do this and achieve my dreams. The song Im showing you is a good song its called Leave a light on by Tom Walker. I like this song because the song centers mainly on overcoming addiction and were inspired by a friend of his who had been battling severe drug addiction. In the song, Walker encourages his friend to get help. People with problems often feel like there isnt anywhere safe to go - they feel like theyre alone. Walker, Tom. Leave a light on.

No worries at all that your class hasn't gotten to eMentoring yet (thanks for sending me a message anyway! :D). Believe it or not, I have definitely burned tons of stuff learning to cook (water, eggs, pies...), but the great thing about it is that the more you practice, the more it becomes like second nature so you just kind of KNOW when you need to remember stuff. Since you are great at sports (and so many different kinds!) maybe you kind of know what I mean about just getting a sense for things with practice? :) Thanks for your question! I started in Neuroscience because I wanted to be a doctor, but the more Neuroscience I did the more I realized I liked it a lot...so I didn't want to be a doctor any more. For example, I learned that I actually really liked writing papers and working in a university. I did Neuroscience for 10 years, and over time I realized that even though there was a lot that I liked about it, it was still missing something: being able to help people. Science can definitely help people, but it can take decades to know how a discovery can do that and I really wanted to help people around me now. That was why I wanted to do medicine in the first place. For me, Law made this perfect connection of giving me the tools to help people around me and keeping what I liked about Neuroscience (writing, working in a university, etc.). It was hard to change my plans after being in Neuroscience for 10 years, but it was really important to me to be honest with myself about how my ideas and goals changed over time as I got to know myself better. So far I think it was a good choice - Law is awesome! Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? Have a great weekend! Hopefully I'll talk to you more next week!

Sometimes I just fall out of contact with people for a couple of weeks at a time. I really do enjoy our talks, I just messed this one up. I'm typing this out right now with my dog going nuts beside me hoping for food, and I can't feel my mouth. Man does getting wisdom teeth taken out suck or what. Anywho, I don't neccesarily agree with the idea that intention MUST be a key component of creation. Creation, at it's most base form, is giving life to something, putting a piece of yourself into it. That doesn't translate into needing a specific intention. Take a doodle for example. It's a creation, yet you likely had no intention behind it when you started. This example could be called the lazy method. It's so small and inconsequential, that intention is not needed. Makes sense. You don't have to put effort into it, so there's no investment. I would argue that larger projects like books could be created without intention as well. Personally I just let it go. (Yes I'm legally intoxicated from getting the teeth done and am watching Frozen.) While I had the intention to finish the project, I would discount that as irrelevant to our point. I felt the need to write consistently almost to the point where it ached, so I did. Mostly on a paragraph by paragraph basis, without an overall driving goal or desire. (That came back to bite me in the ass on the editing stage.) It is a bit tricky to continue a cohesive large scale project without intention, but is by no means impossible. Now my teeth hurt, I have ice cream to eat, and I must unpause Frozen. As much as I love our scintilating conversations, I must depart to better things. Onwards and upwards as they say. Don't feel bad. It's hard to compete with Frozen and ice cream. Ba la la la Evan "," 2021-10-15, 21:33:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

It's great that you already know that you want to work in the field of mental health! I think the most difficult thing when I transitioned from high school to post-secondary was definitely getting used to the workload and being a proactive student. In high school, teachers definitely try their best to help you succeed and help you along the way; in post-secondary, I find that you have to look out for yourself if you need some extra support. When I was taking a full courseload (so, 4 courses), I say that I spent about 20 to 25 hours a week doing coursework. To balance studying with hanging out with friends and hobbies, I tried to make sure that I had a routine so that I would have time set aside for fun things :-) Before we move on to ""Working Through this Program"", please have a look at the options under ""Choose two of the following"" under the instructions and share!

I like down hill mountain biking in a rural place because it is a fun adrenaline rush and the trails are not as full as they could be in a urban area. another thing i enjoy doing is fishing, we have a lake a couple kilometeres out of town and we go there pretty often it is a fun activity and good quality time spent with family. one more thing i like about living in a small town is that its not very hard to get places and when i wan tto go somewhere i dont have to go super far. those are my favorite things about living in a rural place "," 2021-10-18, 09:08:",Mentee,Posts in From Rural to Urban

It made me think how sometimes as a student can feel overwhelmed or crushed by all the expectations of school and even sometimes crushed by comments from friends. But even though the can is crushed it still has worth because you can take it to the recycling depot and get 10 cents. When we are down sometimes, we are still special and mean a lot to our family and friends. I think that is important to remember.

Photography is another great outlet! I was into photography for a bit but found it wasnt allowing me to fully let things go as I need complete distraction to relax. Another outlet I have tried, and found really helps me, is yoga. I know it sounds a little clich as everyone says yoga is a great relaxant. And for a time I didnt believe it and found it didnt work, but then I realized it was because I wasnt believing in it. Nowadays, yoga is something I do every day, or every other day, at the end of my day and it really allows me to get that release of tension and stress. I also used to swimming a lot, before I injured by shoulder, and found that was another great away to release my stress and anxiety.

Some word combinations were never meant to exist, and that one crosses a line. Moving on from that, I do feel honoured that you paused a show for me. It's actually kind of a good feeling to know somebody stopped doing something they enjoy doing because they value somebody elses time/company.

I thought it was a very powerful look into inspiration and creativity, and the ideas they shared could be applicable to many different types of work, even those that may not superficially appear to require much creatvity. An idea that stood out to me was when Mina Shum said ""I think to partake in creation, you start with an intention."" I think this is an important idea behind finding motivation and inspiration for pretty much anything that one sets out to do. For example, this could be applied to school work. When feeling unmotivated, I could remind myself of my original intention behind partaking in school (to learn new information, to understand new perspectives, to reach my future career goals, to meet new and inspirational people... etc). I think this could allow someone to help internalize their reasons/take responsibility for doing something as opposed to focusing on outward forces that are ""making"" them do something.

I quit band during a really hard tim but it was something I really enjoyed. And I feel like it's too lae to go back and rejoin. Imagine is a great song! And I think the message is important.I know that when my dad was in elementary school, they wouldn't allow them to sing it beause it included the lyric ""imagine no religion"" and that was labeled as too contraversial. And like you said, we are full of conflict in the current world. And I don't believe that the lyric is about taking away the freedom of belief, it's just about taking away the things we are so divided over. Its honestly exhausting living in a society where you have to constantly fight. No more conflict would be a great break. I'm a little confused on where Anchor 3 is. Is it the section with the choosing the topics? I hope you have a great day! You seem ike a wonderful person. - Seth "," 2021-10-20, 12:51:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I was looking into travelling to London. Was it expensive for you to live there? What was your favourite place you visited on your travels? I saw you wanted to travel to Scotland. I went there when I was about nine months old. I obviously don't remember anything, but I apparently met a lot of relatives. So when you travelled did you do your school online or in person? Did you go alone? Did you have a job or would you get a job if you went back? I would love to hear more about your experience in London. Were the prices high for food, and rent? Was there a lot to do? I'm looking into travelling to London but I'm also looking into going to Italy. Honestly though, I don't think I'm ready to travel that far from home. I don't think I could learn a new way of life, while doing school by myself. Hopefully one year though!

I find I take notes in such a rush sometimes, taking time to rewrite them and organize is always good And these are great questions! I think what is important is to know what works best for you. Knowing that lists help and you have trouble keeping a schedule are 2 very important things to keep in mind! Personally, I think lists are great. I found keeping a day planner or semester chart was even more helpful so it was more of a timeline of assignments rather than just a list of everything on my phone or something. At the start of the semester you will get a list of all the assignments in each class so I really recommend taking time to organize early! I liked to colour coordinate my planner and put %s next to the assignment too (so Id put ""Professional Practice Paper due - worth 20%, Critical Reflection due - worth 5%) and this helped me see which assignments I should prioritize because Id rather spend a lot of time on the paper worth 20% of my final grade and risk having less time for the 5%. Maybe I start the paper 3 weeks early and do the reflection a couple days early ya know? You will also get a sense of which classes will be more work and which classes you can put at the bottom of your priority list :) As for keeping up with studying, I relate. I struggled and still do... so I like to do all of my work at school or a coffee shop. I cannot for the life of me focus at home! So for keeping a schedule, I would often plan to go straight from class every day to a private study room or stay in the library and not go home until I was done. I also liked having a classmate to go with so we could share ideas, share snacks, ask questions and support each other - very helpful! Once I got into that habit it made a HUGE difference. It was also a good way for me to balance school and life because I knew when I left the library I had finished with my school responsibilities and did not have to feel guilty about doing other things.

I have excellent focus and concentration so I am able to study in any environment and not get too easily distracted.

That was were I had difficulties to manage in the past. However, I am having a better balance now and go to gym 2-3 times each week and I'm happy about it. it is great that you have a goal of going into the sonography path and study about it. Except that I know BCIT offers that, I have not much of information about it. However, generally, when choosinh a path I would suggest to be honest with ourselves. I started studying architecture when I finished my high school. That was my passion back at that time. However, soon after I realized a couple of things which made me change my whole career path. First, I realized to be a good architecture, I have to have a solid background in art which I didn't. I had to be honest with myself at that time and accept that there are others in this path with a more related background than me. Not to be discouraged and not try new things, not at all. But I realized I am not that passionate about the artistic side of this job and I just liked the vibe of it being an architecture! It sounded so good! But not the right fit for me! Second, I realized the money and salary do matter to me. I realized in the future there won't be a very high salary for this job. If I wanted to be ignorant I would have say ok the money doesn't matter to me! But it did matter and still does! (Another section of being honest with ourselves) Lastly, I realized how the prestige and job title also matter to me. And i feel better when I'm involved in medical settings comparing to engineering or art. This is also cultural related I believe. All in all, it was scary to change the path, because I was like, what if I don't like pharmacy either??? What would happen then? What if I am not good at that too?! But I gathered all my energy and did make the change, and after all, I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier ?? I am so happy with where I am now, thanks to the hard work in past, thanks to the very very hard moment of making decisions and taking risk. Nothing is permanent, if you don't like a path you choose now, you can definitely change it in the future, it's never late. And be honest with yourself, set your goals and expectations and see if this career path will fulfill them?? "," 2021-10-21, 13:16:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

The calculators are super helpful, and I think they are fairly accurate. Right now I am thinking about medicine, midwifery, and maybe pharmacy. I have the prerequisites for all of them and I think I can make them all work with the lifestyle that I want in the future. There is definitely pressure to know exactly what you want to do, but I honestly think most people don't know. And that's okay. Its also okay to try something and change your mind. I used to always think that people in their 20s had everything figured out, but thats definitely not the case lol. All of my siblings took a while to discover their career path, and it has definitely taken the pressure of for me. I wish I knew about the midwifery program sooner. I first heard about it when I was already in the rural pre-medicine program. This, and other circumstances meant that I could only apply for the first time last year as I didn't have the pre-requisites. It's okay though, as I am able to apply now. Pharmacy also only came on my radar this year. I am still not 100% sure about it, but I think it is a path worth exploring. I have heard good things about the Selkirk Engineering program. I think it seems like a good starting place to become an engineer, especially if you want to stay close to home for your first year. To my understanding you have to transfer after that, and that could be good or not depending on the person I think. From what I remember, the program at Selkirk was very male dominated, which could also be a consideration for some people. (This is quite the opposite from the RPM program which had way more women). As for volunteer experience, here is a non-extensive list: - Best Buddies: I was a peer volunteer and later a co-president for the club. ""Peer Buddies"" are matched with adults with disabilities to form lasting friendships. As a co-president I helped recruit volunteers and organized monthly group events - Rural eMentoring: This one is self explanatory lol :) - BC Summer games volleyball referee &amp; transport supervisor - OuiCanSki: teaching immigrants to ski so that they can participate in a very Canadian pastime - SQx Danza: I presented to boards around the Columbia Basin to get funding for this volunteer dance organization that aimed to promote arts and culture in grade schools. My recommendations for applications are to start them soon after they open so that you maximize the time you have to work on them. I would also recommend getting someone (or a few people) to look over it as you write it. My partner was SO helpful when I was writing my applications, and it helped me get 2 interviews last year. It is also helpful to start a ""resume"" of sorts that contains all your work, volunteer experience, and traning/certifications. This will make it easier to think of things when you are filling out applications. I hope this helps. I have really enjoyed answering all your questions so far! Hope you are having a nice week. :) Madia "," 2021-10-21, 13:58:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I recently upgraded from a paper butterfly to a notebook. I made this cool looking paper butterfly in one of my classes and drew up the draft of my next planned novel on it. Unfortunately it's full of writing now, so when I recieved a notebook as a gift, I thought to use that instead. Mostly though I just log onto the docs for the next novel and put stuff on that. I have a friend who has too many projects on the go right now, and she's never going to finish any of them. But hey, that's life I suppose. I prefer to take it one at a time until it's done.

My trip was organized through the school, so I'm not totally sure about how much we paid for rent. I have got to say my favorite place I traveled was the Swiss Alps. I grew up in Calgary, which isn't far from the mountains, but the Swiss Alps are so much different for some reason. They're so picturesque it looks fake. School for me when I travelled was in person. Work was done mostly on the laptop though, just because of the traveling. I travelled with my class -- there was about forty of us with five teachers. I think if I do end up going back, I would get a job because I'd plan on staying a lot longer. For London, there was so much to do. We did all the touristy things: Buckingham Palace, all the museums, the London Eye. There is so much to do and I would love to go back! It goes by so much faster than you think it would. It's totally okay to not be that ready to travel far from home! That's why I chose UVic for school now. It's not far from home, but it's far enough, if that makes sense. All three of those options you listed are great. Some of my good friends are interior design and in business! I have yet to meet somebody going to fashion school, but that would honestly be so cool.

I was never very good at english or social studies, lol. Wow! Being a cardiologist would be very cool! My only advice would be to study things you love! Becoming a cardiologist takes many years, so I believe it is important to enjoy whatever it is you are doing. For example, many people complete an undergraduate degree before going to medical school, so I always recommend focusing that on something you enjoy because it will make it much easier to study on the days you really don't feel like studying.

1047513314,1047541088,9/25/2020 18:10,40637,5," Hi Destiny! Those sound like a very good basis for studying! Based on what you've said a lot of your studying techniques are based around memorization of the material. One thing I found very helpful during my time in highschool was re-writing material in multiple different ways. As an audio-visual learning I found taking the notes I had written during lectures/lessons and adding in any missing details along with any notes I'd taken from any assigned readings really help with my comprehension of the material. It sounds like you also really struggle with focus and motivation? Living in a busy home I can understand that it can sometimes be difficult to focus with the other activities and noises around. A few thing I'd done to help with this is I invested in some good quality noise cancelling headphone. Whether I'd decided to listen to something or not I found them extremely helpful to prevent background noise becoming distracting. During times where I felt that I still couldn't concentrate at home I would often leave and go to a coffee shop or library, I've found that getting a change of scenery can be very helpful. As for your struggles with staying connected i found that downloading an app that prevents you from accessing the apps that prove to be distracting can be helpful. I've also found that working for smaller bursts of time with more frequent breaks easier on my brain to handle. If I work for long periods of time I tend to start feeling discouraged in my work and getting more easily distrated. When it comes to assignments and projects are you one who tends to like to get them done early? On time? or are they often handed in late? Are you aware of what style of learner you are? Visual, auditory, or kinesthetic? If you aren't sure I'd be more than happy to provide you with some resources to learn this and we can try and come up with some learning and studying techniques based around that?

That person was having a great time, relaxing in a beautiful park, reading her book without worrying about the outside world. The person was fully present living that moment.

A little about me: I'm 21 years old, finishing up my final year before I graduate UBC with a Bachelor of Arts Degree with a double major in English Literature and Psychology. I'm part Chinese and part Filipino, my pronouns are she/her, and I identify as bisexual. It's a nice little coincidence, but I'm also thinking about going abroad for a year or so to teach English to others after I graduate as well. However, my passion is less for English as a language, but for English literature. If you've read any good books (or do in the future), I'd love any recommendations. I admit that I take guilty pleasure in cheesy romance and young adult/children's literature. Oh, and I see that we both also enjoy video games! Last summer, I actually ended up building my own computer so I've been able to run a lot of new titles and have been having a lot of fun with my new setup. Honestly though, my favourite video game will always be good old Ace Attorney. What do you play? What console(s) do you use?

It would also be less school than a lawyer too because I think it is 4 years at a university for the degree or 2 at a college for a diploma. This means you will be out and helping people faster than if you do a law degree because that is 3 years and requires that you already have a bachelor's degree. However, if that was something that interested you, the bachelor's degree doesn't have to be in any field that is especially law-like - it could be anything! So if you really liked kineseology, you could do that for your bachelors and then go to law school after. I think I want to do intellectual property law and help people get patents for their inventions! You know, even if you have a law degree and are a lawyer, you don't have to practice law - there are tons of jobs in the government, libraries, nonprofit organizations, consultation, etc. that don't involve lots of public speaking! When I first came to law school, I thought it would be like on tv where you go to court and argue a case and, although that can be the case if you want it to be, there are tons of other jobs out there for lawyers that I didn't know about! Do you have any ideas about where you would like to go to school?

You are right, owning and buying a house is quite expensive, however, you are on the right path by saving some money. Budgeting can be tricky but a tip I have is having control and being consistent with your money. In other words, let's say you tell yourself that every week you will put $10 into your savings. Although it may not seem like a lot of money, by the time the year ends you will have around $520 saved up. Another tip I have is asking yourself if you actually need something or if you just want it. It is okay to splurge every once in a while but a lot of times I spend money on things that I do not necessarily need. For example, last week I bought a phone case just because I liked the design on it and thought it was cute (it had puppies all over the case). But, I did not need it because my phone case was perfectly fine! I'm just curious but have you thought about where you would like to own a house? (ex: Vancouver) If not, that is completely okay! I would also love to know why you want to buy a larger house? (ex: For school, For the experience? Living with friends?)

Noise cancelling headpones was one of my most valued purchases for sure haha, music is one of the few things that can get me on track. When it comes to projects and such, I often get them in on time, but this year theres definitely been a couple overdue. Ive been bit more focused in my academics rather than careers, so its tough to find balance. In terms of motivation, if I enjoy the idea of the project it will often be done earlier as I tend to ""push off"" things I dont find relevance in. I believe I am a auditory-kinesthetic learner (according to myblueprint,cant assure its accuracy), but I know that I can retain more knowledge when its hands-on learning.

You need to share your self-care plan it could be text, image, video, or audio file, save it to your portfolio. Ques: Choose THREE changes you can make to your life right now that will allow you to take better care of yourself. For each proposed change, describe the concrete plan you have to make that change part of your daily schedule. Hopefully, these new actions will become habits. To help support these changes, you may want to check out the Solo Conversation: Setting Goals and Building Habits. Check out the list below for a suggestion of how to format your note and some examples to get you started: Self Care Action How I will make it part of my life Get more and regular sleep Leave my laptop and phone outside of my bedroom at night.

It's good to hear that you have some great plans for your future and it's also good to know that many people still don't know what they want to do even in their twenties. I am pleased to hear about your input on the Selkirk Engineering Program. I was aware that it's a male dominated field and sometimes that stresses me out, but I've learned to not restrict my interests due to a slightly stressful start. I actually was put in a class of only guys for my metalwork class. I was lonely at first but I eventually found my place and a few friends. In the end, I built a go kart from scratch. My dad acts like it's his instead of mine sometimes. He's a bit a large child and that fact often leaves my sister and l laughing while he races up and down the street in front of our house.

Since UBC is such a big campus compared to even UVic, going from a small town to UBC straight out of high school can be a massive shift and pretty overwhelming so I honestly think what you've got planned is perfect (and you'll save a bit of money too which is always a plus). Application/tips wise, I think Selkirk is pretty straightforward to apply/get into but i would recommend looking into what the univeristy transfer requirements are for UBC to get an idea of what their requirements are for grades and classes. Its good to know what you're grades would have to be since UBC it is a bit more competive. Do you know what bachelors program you're interested in before applying to physiotherapy (biology, chem...etc.)?

As an auditory learning I do understand that recording notes off slides isn't always easy I find it much easier to retain information that was told to me. Some learning techniques that I have found helpful over the years would include looking up videos on topics that you're learning about. I found youtube a very important asset during my highschool years. As I remember you previously saying flashcards are very useful in remembering terms and definitions. You can also adapt certain projects to fit your needs with the teachers permission. During my time in highschool I often struggled with projects that needed to have a creative aspect such as posters or pamphlets. However, I really excelled in powerpoint and essays, so with teacher permission I adapted the assignment to fit me in order for me to learn the material best. Obivously some teachers would not be so accomodating so you'd still need to be willing and able to do the ones you're less comfortable with but I found that very helpful.

I apologize for not opening it sooner and for the confusion about opening a new conversation, I have been kind of scrambling with school deadlines the last couple weeks. My studying methods have varied over the years, but I have formed an organizational system for my habits. I don't know about you, but I can tend to be a huge procrastinator. Deadlines can be daunting. It makes my life so much easier when I keep an active calendar full of my assignment due dates. I also keep a Google Sheets document to organize my readings that I need to do for my classes, and it really helps me stay on track. As for Political Science, there is a lot of reading, which is why the organizational aspect is so important and so helpful in prioritizing what I need to get done. What works best with me in Victoria is making sure I take breaks in between studying. It's so easy to feel overwhelmed with what's going on with school, so it's really important to me that if I dedicate a specific amount of time for studying, I also leave room for breaks. It's a nice way to stay refreshed or to maintain self-care. Looking for outlets for stress are important too -- running or walks are great. I love Victoria! I am so used to snow and the cold of winter from living in Calgary, and the rain is a welcoming change. Living by the sea is also nice, as I have been living around the mountains my whole life. It's nice to get a change of scenary. You're lucky you've been here in the summer! I always have to go home. I don't find that it gets boring -- there is always so much to explore and everybody always has new spots they want to check out and sightseeing is so nice. I no longer live on campus, as they give priority to first years, but instead, I live off campus with five roommates. It sounds like a lot, I know. The housing on campus is great! It's so nice to live on campus and be able to walk to classes or the library. When I was in first year, I did the majority of my studying in the kitchen of my apartment cluster, or the library. There's also a building at UVic that is pretty much open all night, so students monopolize that space for the night too! I find studying somewhere other than home can be super helpful because it really allows you to focus. Now that I've opened the conversation (sorry again), we can look at the videos and anchor texts. Some opening questions for you: what do you do for studying? Is there anything you'll think you'll need to adjust for university? Have a good week!

This Conversation explores inspiration, and how we might find, think, and feel about creativity. Though it's always important to address the anchor text, I would also love to hear about your own experiences with art - Perhaps some passion projects, your own hobbies, and more? For myself, after watching the video a couple of times, what initially and especially stuck out to me were the differences in Mina Shum's and Roch Carrier's ideas on creation. Shum believes that art begins with intention - Why do we find ourselves creating? Whether we think about it hard or without much thought, we all start with the intention to do. What I got from Carrier's idea of creation is more so like that ""A-ha!"" moment or an epiphany. We find ourselves hard at work until we stumble upon the ""essence of creation"". Personally, I relate to Shum's concept of creativity more, as I don't often find myself with these artistic breakthroughs . I place my pencil on paper and art (or at least an attempt at art LOL) happens... But it all began because I thought to put my pencil on that piece of paper. What are your thoughts on the film?

I put so much effort into my projects for school that I feel burnt out. I then waste the time I could be doing things I actually wanted to do. I think I have to work on managing my time better and not putting so much focus on one topic. Like the first video said, in order to study effectively you need to switch up topics in order to remember things. When studying I will try and draw more pictures and diagrams. I usually rewrite my notes a lot, but I think incorporating more pictures will help me. I think I will incorporate small study sessions throughout units so I don't have to cram all the studying right before a test. The video said that people who do this will spend less time studying overall because they still remember most of the information. I think I will have to manage my time better when I go to university. I will try and not put too much focus on one subject because I will fall behind in other topics. I will try and use some of the strategies in the video now to prepare me for university.

It was scary a little bit to see all who seat with me in a classroom have a science background or at least passed some biology courses but I had none based on my architecture background. I had tu study very hard to reach their level and compete. At the same time I had to not only pass my biologu ans science related courses, But also haf to keep my gpa high so I can enter the pharmacy school. for getting into the ubc pharmacy, we had to pas 60 credits with high gpa in science with a good resume to get interview. Then those who het the interview based on their gpa, will compete with each other in the interview and some will get acceptance aftet the interview. through the whole process, I could have say to myself that this is hard and I donyhave the background and I cannot compete with the other students, BUT INSTEAD! I kept telling myself that it others were able to do this and get into the pharmacy school, I CAN DO THIS TOO?? "," 2021-10-26, 09:23:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047498662,1047538890,11/1/2019 17:04,40144,25," Hey aTeanna :) Another thing to think about is how you study before a class. Each class will have pre-readings that you do before going to the actual lecture. Sometimes these readings can be entire chapters (like 100+ pages) so it's important to be strategic to save you time. A few things people in my class have tried: - split up the readings with a friend and share notes (google docs is very helpful for this!) -each week the syllabus (course guide) will have the main concepts you need to know written out. so use these to guide your studying and note taking. This will help guide you tk make sure you are studying the important things. 5his will also help you use the textbook readings more efficiently because you knkw what info you are looking for and what info you can just skim quickly - read the intro pages, tables, headers, and conclusion in a textbook chapter to get the main ideas and concepts. Then do the other assigned readings (like papers or blog posts) and only go back to text book for extra info as you need it. This is helpful if you find the readings overload with details that just confuse you. Better to get the main ideas down and only look at the little details once youve got the big ideas down. Let me know if these make sense or if im speaking gibberish. Its hard to explain through text! :) Happy Tuesday "," 2021-10-26, 09:39:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

My definition of studying something is to focus and concentrate on a subject until you completely understand the concepts surrounding it. My personal regiment when studying is I usually end up waiting till the last night and then staying up extremely late getting everything nailed in. I usually learn best re-writting and wording the concept in forms where I would understand it. This is a really bad way of studying however it has worked for me being pretty busy.

I hope everyone is okay. Certainly, a good experience for you, and it sounds like you received some great feedback My weekend was good! I've been working and doing school work The study tips I would suggest trying out is reading and/or reciting the lecture notes 2-3 times. The first time have the intention to just read over the notes, the second and third time try reading the beginning of the sentence or bullet point and then close your eyes as a test for yourself to see if you can remember the corresponding information. I've tried many techniques and this was a method that one of my biology profs suggested and I find it works well for me!

Anyway, now talking about inspiration, I thought the activity that the filmmakers did in the video was quite interesting. It really showcased how each individual, and individuals in general, find and define inspiration in different ways. This really showed when I was watching the video and I too was making stories from the pictures that were totally different than what the filmmakers had described. I related to the first filmmaker who talked about how if it makes sense to you, to just trust yourself on that. I think that relates back to what I said in one of our first conversation how your interest in the topic will really help you be motivated and also I think inspire you to keep going and keep wanting to learn more about the topic (i.e., psychology).

Also watch ted talks! or crash course videos on youtube! it gives you a good sense of of what you like and you can learn interesting things very quickly.

One thing the first video mentioned and something I've learned throughout university is that studying is more of a marathon than a sprint. So rather than cram studying the night before, it's a lot more effective to study in scheduled time slots days in advance. I know from experience it's definitely harder to focus on studying material while you're also trying to ignore the stress of the test being the next morning. We're all still guilty of it but starting somewhere is good to build habits! What study techniques from either of the videos are you going to try?

I really like music where the horns stand out like at the start of You'll Understand when you're older. What other bands do you like? Have you listened to the cranberries at all? Recently my go to song is Zombie by them. Sounds like you might have some great recommendations though, if you're into music production. How did you get into that? Do you play any instruments yourself? Game development sounds super sweet too. Not something I'm super familiar with, though I've recently got into gaming a bit more so I'd be interested to hear more about that too :) I really love the quote you chose. I'll keep that one on hand too! I think that sometimes in school, when things are graded a certain way, or you are forced to learn things in a certain way, it can be really hard to showcase what you're good at and what you're interested in. The fact that you have strong passions for other things is really really cool and in the real world are often what makes you stand out and (I know this sounds cheesy so I apologize) is what makes you YOU.

I wanted to get in contact with my supervisor to check if I am allowed to unlock all of the conversations at once. Typically, us mentors are told to only unlock one at a time so we can work through them together and chat about the topics as we move through the program. Normally you would let me know which one you wanted to do first and then we would get started on it together.

10161,1047541041,1/10/2017 17:16,40639,17," Hi Elise! That's great to hear. I think it's very important that women are encouraged to go into STEM, even though it continues to be a male dominated field. My sister is an engineer now and I think she enjoys it (she is a Civil and environmental engineer). As for taking metalwork - that sounds like a lot of fun. I know some girls that took it when I was in high school too and they really enjoyed it I think. And it's such a great thing to be knowledgeable about in the future. As for studying tricks, I am honestly not the best at studying to be completely honest. That being said, one of the things I have found most is effective is the Pomodoro Technique where you do 25 minutes of work, and then take a 5 minute break and then repeat. The hardest part for me is definitely getting started, but this technique keeps me on track. I have also found that pressure helps me start things. I think everyone is different when it comes to what works for them, so there is a bit of trial and error when it comes to figuring that out. I honestly don't think I had to do a capstone project in highschool (or I don't remember doing one anyways). I did have to do Grad Transitions but I also don't entirely remember what that entailed - sorry about that! I haven't heard much about the Trades programs at Selkirk as it is at the other campus. In highschool I did have some friends that did the Aceit program (not sure how it's spelled) where you do a trade alongside grade 12 so you graduate with both. I know people who did the hairdresser program as well as someone who did the mechanic I think. They are all still working in the trades that they learned, so I would take that as a good sign! I can't really comment on what it's like, but if you're interested I'm sure you could email the various departments for more info :) Here are the jobs I have done: - Starbucks Barista from July-Oct 2015 (right after highschool) - Au Pair (nanny) in rural Ireland from Nov-June 2015/2016. - Janitor at a dental office for ~2 years while I was at selkirk - Summer Student at Teck in 2018 - Summer Research Student at the Jewish Research Hospital in Laval, Quebec I an current unemployed right now as I am doing an online Doula course and would like to finish it before getting a job for the year! I'm not sure where I want to apply entirely, but it would be really great if I could use my Biology degree for it lol. I think Biology on its own is hard to get a job without a masters. sorry for a bit late of a response. Hope you have a lovely weekend.

I have many difficulties when studying such as being able to retain information, a lack of motivation to start, and being unable to stay on task. I have tried many different ways of studying but none have been effective. The first video has 6 techniques, the first strategy is spaced studying, I have tried that but I do not have a schedule that works with it. the second strategy of switching is worth a shot but the problem lies in the ability to start and stay motivated. Asking questions is what helps me retain information best, but not with myself, I prefer working and studying with another person. I just wish it was more available. concrete examples help but memorizing these examples is just as difficult as what the examples are about. words and visuals are just not at all effective for me. recall what you know is just not gonna work. Note-taking is very difficult because I greatly dislike physically writing stuff down, I don't have very neat handwriting so my pages are a mess. so when you are having difficulty starting the process of studying what do you do? my week has been incredibly hectic because I was the leading organizer of a week's worth of school events.

The first thing I'd like to share would be a quote that I like: ""It matters not how strait the gate, / How charged with punishments the scroll, / I am the master of my fate, / I am the captain of my soul."" (Henley, lines 13-16). This is from the poem ""Invictus"" by William Ernest Henley, and it's something that reminds me to always have faith in myself, and that I can overcome hardship if I choose to be brave. These lines help me remember that even if I feel hopeless and lost, I can turn things around with the effort. Next, there's a song I'd like to share with you. You may have heard it before, it's known as Nocturne op. 9 no. 2, by Frdric Chopin. Here's a link to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg. The reason I enjoy this song is for various reasons. I find the music very soothing and delicate. It also reminds me of home, as this was one of the first songs I learned to play on the piano, althought very poorly. Let me know what you think of the poem and music, Dan! Once again, I really am thrilled to be your mentor and hope you come to enjoy it too. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to answer!

1047499512,1047541054,11/13/2019 21:44,40633,21," Hi Calli, The class size was smaller in BCIT comparing to UBC. However, I believe it depends on the program. I was enrolled in a par time architecture program which was only 9 months and I received a certificate at the end. The class size was ~30 from what I remember. The fact that it was a part time program might also answer your other questions as it it didn't have a hard application like a full time program might have. I was able to just apply for the coursees within the certificate that I wanted. The staff were very helpful to walk me through everything as I was new to Canada back at that time and was living alone. They helped me to apply for loan and everything. That program was 3 days per week. I really enjoyed it as it was very much a hand on experience. Is BCIT your only choice or you're planning to apply for more institutions? I belive it would begood to have more options to choose from just in case that something happens with your first choice.

1047517757,1047541049,1/8/2021 16:04,40655,9," Hi Niko, I hope you had a great halloween weekend! I'm sorry you've been having difficulties studying. To Prevent distraction, I suggest to try putting major distactions in another room and shutting them off (such as leaving your phone, iPad etc.. in another room) or moving to a room with minimal distractions (a room without a TV, loud noises, distracting posters). While studying, I always leave my phone in another room and put my laptop on do not disturb. I find this technique helps me focus and stay on track. I know it can be difficult to find time to study when your schedule is jam packed, but at the begining of each week I find planning my schedule out for the week and setting aside designated time to study works best, which is especially useful when your schedule continually chages each week. This is also related to prioritizing what's important. Planning your schedule out for the week based on work, school, and social life lays everything out and allows the visualization of the free time you have available and when there is a possibilty to shift tasks around. In regard to studying techniques, I relate to needing someone else to study with. I find talking with someone about different topics and hearing their viewpoint on the topic helps me retain the information more effectively as well. I would suggest talking to your teacher about having access to studying with other people, such as having in class discussions with a partner or starting a study group that could take place after school, would this be something you'd be willling to talk to your teacher about? If neither of these are possible you could even talking with a friend over video chat. If I am really not feeling up to studying, the best thing for me to do is reflect on why I am not wanting to study. Am I tired? Do I feel overwhelmed? Am I just not interested in what I am learning. Figuring out why you are having difficulties starting to study is a great way to find solutions. The next time you are having difficulties studying, try reflecting on what you are feeling in that moment! Usually when I'm having difficulties starting to study, it's because I'm not that interested in what I am learning, but despite that, I know it's something I'm going to have to learn. To make things interesting, I try and relate what I am learning to real life exmaples that I am interested in. For example, (because I am learing science), The binding of actin and myosin are what allows us to move our muscles. If you like cars, you can think of actin as the wheels and myosin as the motor. The wheels and the motor have to work together to allow the car to move, and the motor is the driving force that moves the wheels. Finding examples like this helps making learning a little bit more interesting and forces you to think a little bit deeper about the topic which strengthens learning as well! Have you ever tried a study strategy like this? I hope some of this information helps, and if you have any questions just let me know! :) "," 2021-11-01, 13:26:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

What I found interesting was when Mina Shum was saying that everybody wants something and when we're waking around the street we have a purpose even if we don't know what it is. I'm not sure exactly what to take away from that but I found it very interesting that what we do in our everyday life has some sort of purpose that we either know of or don't. ," 2021-11-02, 09:28:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

The feelng of authenticity generally dervives from our own personal experience and values but there is something to be said about empathy, and putting yourself in someone else's shoes. I'm a creator, I probably have hundreds of charcters and dozens of stories planned out. Imagine how boring it would be if they were all simply a reflection of me? I believe that each character has a piece of me in it but they're more like a funhouse miror reflection than a perfect carbon copy. I was also in spired by Roch Carrier's quote: I believe creation is always an accident. You have to work hard but in the process, something happens and this is the essence of creation. Its something that you cannot plan. You have to do a lot of planning but what is important is not planned. I think that's something truly beautiful. As I watched the video I was thinking about a story I am currently writing and how when I go onto my next draft I would surely find many plot holes and unanswered questions and as I pondered this I thought ""How exciting."" When I write, no matter how much planning I do, the story always tells itself to me and not the otherway around.

The program I am wanting to get into reccomends post secondary education for better chances of getting in, since it's a competitive program, but it is not an entry requirement. So, I am applying at a local college for associates of Science Degree, and other health science courses. I am also going to apply to SAIT, and most likely UBCO for general sciences as well, since it is the closest university to where I live. I am choosing schooling close to home because if I don't get accepted into BCIT straight out of highschool, I would like to stay at home for 1-3 years for my post secondary education. I want to stay home because I still want to spend time with my family, it would be nice to be able to keep my part time job at starbucks, and a few of my close friends are staying home for awhile too. On top of that it's also a good option financially. At UBCO I wouldn't be able to live at home but it is still relativly close compared to other places, and a lot of my friends go there/plan to go there.

Ultimately the things I work on will (hopefully) end up improving quality of life for people. For example, in the final year of engineering, you get to do a ""capstone project"". A capstone is where a company comes to us and asks us to design something- my group is working on quality control for a type-1 diabetes cure. We are working on a very small part of a massive project. It's not flashy. But it's inspiring, because I know we are uniquely suited to do the project, and it might end up improving a lot of lives. That being said, inspiration doesn't always have to have a ""life-saving motivation"" behind it. I get inspired when I know I can use my unique skills or experience to provide something people appreciate &amp; respect. For example- maybe you are a clear communicator, and calm under pressure. Being a pilot might be inspiring because you know you can apply your unique skills to being an incredible pilot. Essentially- think about the things that make you special.

It was shock and disturbing to learn that the bones of children were found buried. It just brought into focus for everybody the reminder of how colonialism impacted and devestated a culture and its people. Just like the video showed, you can live on a land and not know the truth about the history of that land. I can see how Science and tradition are in conflict. Science is based on fact, numbers and its so technical whereas tradition is all about emotions and the history of actions and behaviors and beliefs. They don't jive together. I have an example. My moms friend gave her the bark of a tree to boil and make a tea. It was to soothe her coughing. Science would say take cough syrup but it didn't help my mom. The tea stopped her coughing after one day. Her friends culture believes in using nature for healing. What do you think? Do you know where using nature heals a person?

I tried to save the screenshots of my budget to my portfolio, but I don't know if you have access to it. Studying has been something that I've had to learn and work on throughout high school. My main problem is that I tend to procrastinate until the night before an exam to start studying. This is mainly because I either don't want to study, or in the past have gotten away with not studying at all. Now that I'm in 12th grade I realize that I actually have to put in the time studying if I want to do well in school. One thing that I really like to do to study is to find a journal that I can rewrite all my notes in. I like to summarize everything I've learned in class into easy notes that I can reread and understand. I use this for courses where I need to remember a lot of info for example biology, chemistry, and french. I find that actually writing something out with pen and paper helps me remember things easily. Another thing I like to do is make flashcards for terms I need to study or facts I need to remember. This way I can put my cards on my nightstand and go through them before bed. I also like to bring them to class and go through them when I have nothing to do or I'm on break. The last thing I like to do is help my peers with their homework. For example, I'm in chemistry right now and I'm usually done my worksheets on time and have all the answers corrected. If I see someone having a hard time with a question I'll offer to help them with it. For some reason simply explaining topics to others helps me gain a better understanding of them.

I did not start saving until I was in grade 12 so don't be too hard on yourself! If you want to start saving more money maybe try my first suggestion of setting aside $10 a week, which will drastically increase your savings by $100! I know you may want to save more money but as time passes, this really does add up and as you have access to more money you can continue to increase your savings goal! If you don't mind me asking, at what age would you like to move out? Because if it isn't until later in your life that you want to become a foster mom (which is AMAZING) and have more space maybe buying a small 1 bedroom apartment to see if you would like to settle in Kelowna would be a good place to start. Starting off small would give you the chance to know if you like the environment in Kelowna and if you don't there are tons of other cities in BC you can settle in!

I think that this is the best strategy for me because it fits to how I think, and how I work. 6: The strategy that I think that would be the most challenging is the other strategies from the video because they dont fit with how I learn. 7: I dont have any questions about the strategies in the video.

I admit that I'm really, really bad at online competetive games. The one and only time I played League of Legends I almost cried. My 16 year-old brother plays Valorant and is ranked diamond 3, which I think is pretty impressive. But I did play Genshin Impact for a few months (wihtout paying!) until I got tired of grinding every day. Pretty sure I finally pulled Xiao on hard pity and then noped out a week later.

If you ever need any help with parts I'd love to help, but I honestly also got all of my help from friends/Reddit LOL. It looks like you have a good set of options already for post-secondary! As another potential option (if you really want to go to UBC) it's also possible to transfer after studying at any of those other institutions for at least a year. My high school experience was honestly a bit of a mess: I was in academic programs throughout, and finished with the International Baccalaureate program. Because of that, I felt super overworked/pressured to succeed in traditional, academic ways. By the time high school ended I was super happy to just graduate and have my UBC Arts acceptance, but I had to deal with a lot of burnout. I kind of felt like I was just going through everything blindly, but in the end things seemed to work out! Looking back though, sometimes I miss seeing the same people every day and just being in the same building as them. I understand that you're doing this program on your own time (so cool!).

1047514516,1047541032,10/16/2020 18:54,40635,3," Hi Connor, sorry I have also been busy these days and didnt get a chance to reply. I also tend to procrastinate and leave my work till the last minute. This worked well for me in high school (I was an honor roll student) because the teachers teach in class as you have never learned the subject before. When I started university, I continued doing that and found that my grades dropped significantly. Why? Because professors expect you to pre-read your material before class. I used to skip this because I was busy finishing my homework from last week. In this way, I was always behind. Also, even though a semester is of four months, you only have classes for around 3 months. So, you may have a midterm of 4-5 chapters every month for all classes. Thats why being organized is key to being on top of your schoolwork especially if you are involved in volunteer activities or have a job. The most helpful thing for me is that I write all my due dates for the semester on a calendar and then aim to finish the assignments 3 days beforehand. Sometimes I do tend to get lazy and do things last minute, but the results are not always the best. "," 2021-11-04, 12:39:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

I think biology is probably a good starting point, its a bit more memorization than chemsitry (and often people find chemistry harder because it takes a stronger math background and also its more theorietical - have to visualize molecules and atoms in your head). And don't stress about it because you can always switch majors too at any point! In comparrsion to high school, courses are usually a bit more difficult partially because you have to have to independetly motivate yourself to study and partially because (depending on the prof) they often ask more in depth questons on exams so you have to really understand the material but you get used to it.

10161,1047541041,1/10/2017 17:16,40639,21," Hi Elise I hope that technique works for you. Everyone is different so you never know, but it's nice to have some tools that you can use when you need them. And your questions are not annoying, don't worry lol. I am very happy to answer any questions you have :). My summer job at Teck was pretty great. It paid very well, which definitely helped with my tuition and other school costs. It could be pretty exhausting at times, so I didn't really do much during the week, other than work. It was also interesting working in a very industrial environment, but I was very lucky with the people I was working with. I was one of four summer students, and I really lucked out with who I was working with. My best friend (since we were 4!) and Evelyn worked with me, and that was very nice. It made work really fun, and we also hung out outside of work. Our responsibilities varied a lot because we were ""floor crew"" which basically meant we did a lot of cleaning, but also anything else they wanted us to do. We also got to operate bobcats and forklifts, which was fun. At some point I got the role of safety checker, which meant I had to go around the plant to check all the eyewash and shower stations to make sure they were operational. I also changed HVAC filters around the plant. I think I would do it again, but I don't think I can because I am not in full time school right now - which you are supposed to be in to apply. Towards the end we did have a bit of a negative experience though because we had issues with one of our collegues (not a summer student). I won't really get into it, because it wasn't really to do with the work (it was more of an interpersonal conflict). Overall though, I still really enjoyed it, and it was a summer well spent and I was very lucky with the other summer students I was working with. The Doula course I am taking is an online certification program so that I can become a certified labour and post-partum Doula. Doula's provide emotional and informational support in a number of areas. As I mentioned, the 2 I am learning about are labour and post-partum. Once I am certified I can work as a Doula to help people that are giving birth, and also help people afterwards with their new babies. I am taking it partly to help with my midwifery application, partly because I find it interesting, and partly because I think that the interpersonal skills that I will learn will be helpful in any sector of healthcare (as I am hoping to get into medical school or midwifery). I hope that all makes sense. My current goals (from short-term to long term): - Finish my Doula Certification course - Submit my school applications for next year (due in Dec) - Get accepted into Midwifery, Medical School, or maybe Pharmacy (if I end up applying - I am still deciding on that one) - Finish building the tiny house with my partner - Save up with my partner to buy property and move our tiny house All of these goals (except the last one) I am hoping to do by next Sept. I don't have many very long term goals, just vague ideas. I would like to end up close to home when I am done my schooling, and would obviously like to find a job I enjoy. I would also like to not work entirely full time. I want time to enjoy life outside of work in the future. I would say my goals have changed since highschool in that I know more of what I want to do. When I graduated high school I didn't really know what I wanted to do at all so I took a gap year. Now I know that I want to do something in healthcare and I have based my goals around that. I think I have also discovered what is important to me now, which has also changed my goals for the future. I know that I want to be close to family, and I want to have ample ""time off"" to be able to enjoy life with the people that I love. Thanks for the great questions! I think that I am supposed to be ""unlocking"" other conversations but I am having trouble doing so. Usually theses a navigation wheel I can click on but its not showing up.

As well as making lists of essential ideas and trying to find or remember the information for practice. Finally using concrete examples to remember concepts!

I love using the 'recall what you know' strategy as well; my program offers us a lot of practice tests and questions before examinations and I really use these to hone in on what I don't know (and so need to study more!!) To be honest, I'm not the best at studying. That being said the 2 habits I use the most are: - combining visual and verbal information --&gt; I like to re-write my notes and add diagrams or explanatory pictures to the information that I re-write in my own words. When I go back to study my notes, I have notes that are written in my own words combined with visuals and this is much easier to study that having to read long textbook chapters! -Ask, Explain, Connect: This is my favorite study pattern because it makes you feel confident in what you know, and identifies areas that you still need to improve on. What I do (and I think this would be great for you to try too!!) is that I picture that I am the one who has to teach the class the topic I am studying. I ask myself ""how would I explain these concepts?"" If I can explain a concept from class well, I know that I can probably answer questions about it on the test. I have a few questions I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on!: when you use the 'recall what you know' strategy, what are the steps you take while doing it? Would you ever give the other methods from the video a try, even if you think they wouldn't work for you? What makes you think these strategies don't fit with how you learn?

Once I graduate, my plan is to attend graduate school to become an epidemiologist (a scientist that studies health problems and diseases in populations). Fun fact: when I was in grade 10, I also wanted to become a marine biologist! Could you tell me a bit about yourself? What are your interests and hobbies? What would you like to do after high school?

I had been watching videos and news updates and while watching I was so disheartened by all the terrible stories that I decided I wanted to be a part of something positive in my lifetime. That's when I started looking for careers that would allow me to work closely with people and I came across nursing. It is very cheesy I know but really I had not considered nursing at all before that. I was a sudden idea and I went with it. So it was more than just choosing a job for me, it was about choosing something that aligned with my values and what I wanted to be a part of big picture (helping people through some of the really tough times in life). As for your second thoughts, that is totally normal. I considered other jobs before I chose nursing and honestly still wonder about other careers. I am still trying to figure out what area of nursing I want to work in because there are so many and my interests seem to change so often! That was another reason I chose nursing - because it is one degree and it can take you so many places. There are A LOT of jobs out there so of course you will have many interests. Can I ask what other jobs you are thinking about? There is no right or wrong...I think considering what is most important to you as a person, writing out your values/beliefs/hopes and comparing each career choice can be really helpful. Again SO cheesy but at the end of the day doing something that is meaningful to you is what will make your school and work enjoyable! And nothing is ever set in stone, theres always a way to rethink your career in the future either by going back to school or getting other forms of training through work!

Im currently studying cognitive systems (its basically computer science with some psychology, philosophy and linguistics thrown into the mix hehe) at UBC! I'm not sure if you're into musical theatre at all but one of my favourite songs is You Will Be Found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSfH2AuhXfw) from Dear Evan Hansen. It's my go-to pick-me-up song for when I've had a rough day! The entire musical is a work of art so if you've got an hour or so to spare, I highly recommend listening to the Broadway Cast Recording (or the movie version if that's more your vibe. Both albums are available on YouTube!) But if you ever just need a little spark of hope in the form of music the You Will Be Found is my solution! My favourite meal that I've ever made is probably this tom yum pasta (thatspicychick.com/creamy-tom-yum-pasta/). In my opinion, it's the perfect blend of Asian flavours with western cooking styles. I haven't been able to find tom yum paste in Vancouver yet though so I haven't had the chance to make it since I've moved here :/ but I'm still optimistic! I've only been to 2 Asian grocery stores so far and there's plenty more for me to try. I see you're also a fellow coffee lover! Do you have any warm drink recommendations?

1047547565,1047541563,10/4/2021 6:55,44728,1," Hi Madelyn How are you? I just opened From Rural to Urban module for our conversation. You may now start with the anchor texts and respond as directed. Before starting this module, I would like to share my experience on this topic. I was born in a rural setting, but I moved with my parents and started schooling in a city. Despite the fact, I didn't have the typical urban setting experience because I belong to a small town and didn't have many opportunities there. But, my transition to a large metropolitan city for my University was not as hard as I imagined it would be! Therefore, the most important advice I can give you for an easy transition is to GO FOR IT! DON'T HESITATE! Don't avoid things only because you don't have experience with them. You might make some mistakes initially, get lost, feel alone, but time passes, and learning comes with it. If you don't know what to do, where to go, ask somebody. You will find a ton of people who are willing to help you, approach them. You know what, by the end of your school years in an urban city, you'll be guiding other people ways where you got lost in your first week. So whenever you hesitate or get nervous during your transition, remember what I am telling you, GO FOR IT! Have a great week! Looking forward to your reply. Thanks (PS. Let me know if you can't access the anchor texts or face any other technical issue) "," 2021-11-07, 13:01:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban
1047538809,1047541072,9/7/2021 21:48,40634,1," Hey Christian, I've unlocked the Studying conversation. Let me know when you've read/watched the material and what you think! What sort of habits or techniques do you usually use to study? Do you use different study techniques for different subjects? For me, I think learning how to learn made a huge difference when it came to being successful at school. You've probably heard over and over again how cramming is bad, and it's true! But at the same time it can be hard to plan a week's worth of studying to crush that exam on Friday because it's daunting and takes effort to follow through on, especially if all you're planning to do is re-read/highlight chapters from a textbook. That can be super boring and exhausting. I think there's a sweet spot in between those study habits that I found to be really useful for me. Here's some tips that I use all the time when I'm studying for my exams: - Active recall: when I study, I try my best to actively test myself whenever I can to almost replicate the exam before I write it. At the end of every chapter, this might mean making my own study questions/flashcards that I can test myself on later. This also helps me digest the information because I need to understand the material before I can make a good question. I love this technique because it tells me objectively what I understand and what I don't. It can be really hard to have a sense of where you're at when you're just reading the material passively and not engaging with it. Practically, I use flashcards all the time. I use a software called Anki to make/store my flashcards. If you're interested I'd be happy to talk more about Anki. - Spaced repetition: basically, once I have my set of questions/flashcards for the topic I'm studying, now it's simply a matter of testing myself. One way can be to blast through them repeatedly the night before the exam. This works for some people, but the issue is that you tend to forget everything you learned really soon after the exam. For subjects that you want to continue to study in college as you work towards becoming a family doctor, it's more useful to study your questions a few times. Rather than doing it all one day, you can make it more manageable by doing a few every day. This cuts down on daily study time but also forces you to recall the information more often, giving you more bang for your buck. - The basics: a healthy sleep, diet, and exercise schedule is key to keeping your brain healthy and ready to learn new information. As a hockey player I'm sure you have the exercise part covered. One thing I still struggle with is respecting the fact that getting 8 hours of sleep and eating healthy is huge when it comes to studying and remembering information. It's essential! Here's a really useful video that goes even deeper into the study philosophy that I have: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE Looking forward to hear about your own study techniques, and any questions you might have.

Writing out flash cards and making notes look nice is helpful, but you may find in nursing school it takes too long to do that. My pathophysiology teacher taught me to just use a whiteboard and scribble things down as much from memory as possible. Or even a scrap piece of paper. Sometimes I would re-write things over and over until I could do it by memory. A lot of the patho stuff is memory, and also doing it helps you figure out how it works! I found my friends who took a lot of time making things look nice, did worse than I did, and they spent longer on things. That is my advice for that! Otherwise, all of the things you do sound good! Have you ever used a timer when studying? It is a good idea, but I do struggle with using it, haha. I tend to just sit down for as long as I can and hope the time goes by quickly, haha.

Lately with school, I haven't been able to write as much, and writers block has also been an extremely difficult thing to get rid of. But in the past I liked to write adventure stories I guess. I enjoy making tense moments to keep someone on the edge of their seat and wanting to read more, id often show my stories to my classmates and they would ask if I had written any new chapters yet, but that was nearly 3 years ago. I prefer poetry now, or really just making words flow together nicely, it's satisfying to me in some sort of way. I'd love to hear more about you and your life!

I noticed that you are interested in studying architecture - that is awesome! Do you have any idea of where you would like to go to school? Are you hoping to stay in BC or do you think you might look elsewhere in Canada? I am so excited to go on this journey through the program with you and to learn from your experience and your ideas as we go through these activities! I really hope that this can be a meaningful experience for you and that we can accomplish all of the things that you were looking for in this program. For our activities for this section, I chose ""Words to Live By"" and ""Food for Thought"" - of course, you are welcome to choose any of them that you like, they don't have to be the same! My favourite quote is: ""Not all those who wander are lost"" by J.R.R. Tolkein. The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite series, so it is special to me because it is from one of those books but also because I feel like it has given me hope and encouragement throughout my time in university. When I feel like I haven't made the right choices with courses or even with my program, this quote reminds me that I may not be lost when a path doesn't seem obvious. There are opportunities to learn and new paths that arise unexpectedly that remind me that I haven't wasted time or made bad decisions. For ""Food for Thought"" I'll attach a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is special to me because it was the first recipe that I mastered after moving away from home to go to university! When I moved away, I had no idea how to cook anything and that was really challenging because I LOVE good food. I have come a long way from burning water (yes, that did really happen to me when I first tried to make pasta!) and love cooking for friends and feel proud that I can now make good, healthy food that I really enjoy :) Looking forward to hearing back from you when you have a chance! :) Essie "," 2021-11-08, 10:01:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

It must have been different for you leaving a bigger city to a smaller one. I hope to move to a more populated place to have a change of pace. I red the anchor text and will answer the questions... Three things I like about living in a rural area would be the connection I have with nature, the connection with most people with in the community and no commuting. I like being able to go for walks right from my house into nature and being able to walk places. I feel more cared about living in a small community because everyone knows everyone. I also like that most shops are with in a small drive, but we lack a lot of stores that big cities have. Some things I dont like would be that there arent many places to go shopping, and there arent as many activities as a big city has. Do you keep in touch with the people you went to high school with? How did you keep your friendships when you moved away? What are your favourite things about living in a big city?

I attached a link here. Quizlet is an online platform, and app, where you can create flashcards to help you study. There is also a database of flashcards made by other students that you can use. To get the best results, and to reinforce my learning, I added flashcards to my quizlet account after every single class. Following this, I would review them every weekend. It is awesome to have the app handy when you are in a waiting room, or in line as it is much more productive than scrolling social media (although I am guilty of that as well). As a side tip, I reccomend reviewing the cards using 'learn' mode! I found that this technique greatly helped me when it came to writting the test as it forced me to review the content several times.

Actually, I was in France a couple of years ago, and honestly, I have not tasted a macaroon as good as the one from there. I always thought they were extremely difficult to make, but maybe you have an easy recipe you would be willing to share? I've never taken astronomy but it's fascinating to think about giant balls of gas (i.e. stars) just millions of times bigger than our Sun - just seems pretty unreal?????. I hope the rest of your classes are going well, I remember French being slightly more difficult for me (I wasn't great at learning a second language). But whenever I encounter a difficult class I always think of this quote ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.""

There were little ghost figurines and pumpkins dangling from the ceiling at Christmas and it was awesome. I love brownies, I'll have to try that recipe and I'll let you know how it goes! I'm lactose intolerant though so I'll have to adapt it to be dairy free, but I do a lot of baking so it won't be hard. Thanks for sharing it with me!

I've really struggled with procrastinating which can obviously eat away at time to study and that is one thing I've found that actually helps!! Everyone's different but you should give it a shot (: The key is to do everyyyything it says (which is only like three things lol) even though it may seem small and irrelevant... So for example, one of the tasks is to set a timer. So, set a timer instead of looking at a clock and saying 'okay I'll stop at 1:00 (in 20 minutes).' I think why it works is because it eliminates everything else your brain has to keep in mind outside of what you're working on which allows you to completely focus on whatever the task is. Same thing with writing down any thoughts that come up, write them down and let it go for the remainder of the time on the timer then you can switch your focus !

I think you can see my profile for some more details about me, but the quick version is I'm 29, I just moved from the Kootenays to Vancouver, and I just graduated from UBC, where I studied Electrical Engineering. Looks like we both like skiing and being outdoors! What kind of skiing do you do? I mostly go in the backcountry because I like backpacking in summer and ski touring feels like the winter substitute for that, and I love it. I took a quick look at your profile and saw that you're into mechanical work. That's really awesome and I think it can be useful and valuable for so many different things in life and career paths. I also love crafts and working with my hands. Never been much of a mechanic, but I do love building things in a carpentry sort of setting (worked in it for a little bit too). I went to university for a relatively scientific degree, so that's naturally something I'd be more than happy to tell you about - even if your go-to interests are more in mechanical/physical stuff rather than coding and math. I also took a very unusual path to university, so I'm sure there will be plenty in my set of experiences that can be helpful for you to hear about. I'm sure we'll find even more things that we have in common, and for now, we can start with the quick task here (the categories of things to share above). Here's a link to a picture I took last year at Mt Assiniboine while I was running a 57k ultra-marathon there. It's one of the most beautiful places I've been to, and it wraps up many of the things that are dear to me - nature, taking physical challenges and being active, and beautiful things. I also like this picture because it reminds me of this challenge that I decided to go after (doing this long run) and how I worked hard planning and training for it and during the actual run. It's something I'm really proud of. What's an interesting nugget about you? Pick something from the list above to show me something cool about you :) Last, let me know if you have any questions about the program. Our next thing up is a quick module on how the program works so it's okay if you're not sure about everything yet, but if there's something you want to ask or say - I'm always happy to hear it.

I am unsure of a double major currently and/or if I should choose a major and minor. I have researched some institutions and so far UBC, SFU and BCIT are my top choices. I am also thinking of starting in the winter time instead of the fall because, I think it might give me some time to prepare myself for courses and if needed I could work a bit before starting my semester. If I do take a break as well, it would give me time to apply but I would like to know if it's still possible to apply for scholarships then or if I can only apply during early/normal registration. I would also like to know what direction we should be heading in while writing our personal profile for applications? Should we focus within, or talk about outside experiences such as sports, work, hobbies etc. How was the transition between grade 12 and university? Was it a big change? Did you go straight into a full course load or did you start off slow? I am also curious about when you actually pick your major, I heard that it is either in your 3rd or 4th year usually, but how do we apply if (say) we are unsure. I am thinking of staying in BC but in the future I am interested in traveling out of the country to experience different cultures and learning more about the world in general.

I really enjoy going to university but there were a few challenges I had to overcome at the beginning. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about university. What conversation choices do you want to start discussing? A quote that I love is from the Nacho Libre movie by Jack Black when he says to a boy when he serves the porriage, ""today is especially delicious"". This quote is great and I find myself saying it a lot in the morning when I'm motivating myself for the day. I also think Nacho Libre is the funniest movie ever. A lonely landscape I can think of is when I visit downtown Vancouver. Outside by the Waterfront Skytrain Station, above the Canada Place sails, is a space to sit and look out at the city. I enjoy going to this spot because I can see all the buildings around me, listen to the noises of sirens and cars, and I can smell the ocean. In the midst of all the hustle that Vancouver has, I feel lonely but content as I know that I have a space to be myself in this large world. Talk to you soon, I hope you have a great week.

What do you mean when you say there are less opportunities compared to cities? Do you mean for schooling, career options, making friends, etc.? That is a good question about the financial cost of living in a city compared to a rural area! I have found it is definitely more expensive to live in a larger city. However, there are some ways to minimize the cost. For example, you could live with roommates in a city, which usually brings down the cost of rent compared to living alone! When I moved to Vancouver for a few months I did not bring a vehicle, which saved me some money, and the public transit system there is very reliable so I was still able to get around easily.

For University, I had to switch up my study habits from the ones I had in high school. I made sure to make a plan of when to study and what to study at least a week before each exam. That way it gives you sufficient time to review without feeling pressured that the exam is in the next 48 hours. I would often make my own study plan of key topics from the lectures and then go back over that while I was reviewing for the test. Sometimes the professors will also give you an outline of what to study, especially in the first year of university. Spacing out the studying and allotting enough time to study where you don't feel rushed is key to doing well on exams!

We live in off-the-grid cabins in the backyard of one of the islander's farms. We are always learning new things about the environment, sustainability, biology and history. I came to this program because I love learning new things and I have an interest in sustainability, the environment and history. I also have very similar hobbies as you, haha! The admin really followed through on my request for someone with the same interests as me. I love to crochet, pottery, play soccer, cross country ski, garden, cook, bake, hike, and watch movies and documentaries. Ive always loved school, I enjoy woodwork, science, math, english and history. The Assignment Food For Thought- Here is a recipe that I have been making for school at SEEC, thats really yummy. I started making these noodles because they are really easy to make once you have the ingredients, they taste DELious, and they have a good fridge life for school. They are so good because they are spicy, tasty and crunchy from the peanut butter. Ahh, they are just so good! If you do make them, make sure to use wheat flour noodles, like udon noodles or soba. Cultural Knowledge- I am half Polish and half Chinese, I have always had a stronger connection to my Chinese heritage, over my Polish heritage, because of the physical closeness of family members. One way that I bonded with my grandparents and my heritage was eating dim sum together. Eating dim sum with my grandparents, I spent so much important time with them, I learnt new Cantonese words, I got to eat delicious food, and I overall learned more about my identity. Even when my grandparents are gone, dim sum will always be something for me to connect with them. "," 2021-11-10, 11:01:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

1047547565,1047541563,10/4/2021 6:55,44728,5," Hi Madelyn Living in a place where you are surrounded by mountains and forest is truly a blessing! It must be super soothing to be near the divine nature in its untouched form. I agree with you, we sometimes need to cut off from the hustle-bustle of life and be in a moment to self-reflect. And you can, actually must continue doing that even after you move to a school in a city; you definitely will have opportunities for that. It must be warming to know all the people you see in your high school! And yes, it offers fewer opportunities to grow and explore. Well, transitioning to a new place sounds challenging, and it indeed is, but don't worry, you'll easily cope-up with that. I would advise you to join as many Whatsapp or other social media groups of incoming classes as possible. Also, join the orientation program that your future school will most likely organize to welcome the incoming class. Through these, you'll come across many people that you might become friends with, and it will make the whole transition a lot less intimidating. But, remember, during the initial days of your school, you will meet and hang out with a ton of people; but, it's essential to sort and keep only the ones you liked. Drop the friendship that you think can be harmful to your mental and emotional health right away. It's completely ok to let go off the people you don't connect to. Everyone you'll meet is on the same boat as you; everyone will be willing to have conversations with you and become friends with you. Even though almost everyone moved in in September, I moved to my University campus recently. And, it's comparatively harder to become friends with people when they already have found their groups. I had good conversations with some of my fellow students through a Disord server university made for us. So, I could rely on them during the very initial days of my on-campus experience. Nonetheless, if you'll move in on time, you will have many resources, events, and gatherings organized by your school. I understand that socializing this much can be challenging for you as an introvert; therefore, I would say that don't force any friendships. Don't put in too much effort. Go with the flow. You will meet your people. Try saying Hi to the people you meet. Trust me, everyone will be amicable and welcoming. Also, have conversations with your advisors and counselors in the school. Approach them if you struggle with anything, feel home-sick, or maybe just introduce yourself and ask for their advice. Things will be very fast going when you transition but, you'll settle down gradually. You will want to do numerous things but will have less time. Therefore, don't rush and take it all easy and slow. Stay attentive and distant from those you think are not suitable for your personal and academic growth. Of course, many friendships will form and end in the initial weeks, and that's ok! Complete the anchor text two whenever you get time. Let me know if you have further questions. I'll be pleased to clarify. All the best!"," 2021-11-10, 15:49:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I'm in my fourth year at UBC - Vancouver, where I'm finishing up my Bachelor of Science in Biology. Originally, I wanted to become a doctor but over my time at UBC I realized that what I really love doing is teaching so now my plan is to do my Bachelor of Education after this degree is over and become a high school teacher soon. What are you thinking of doing career-wise for now? It's okay if you aren't sure yet, I didn't know what I wanted to do until my third year in university, haha. The instructions for this introduction said to choose two topics for us to talk about so here is what I've chosen: Words to live by One of my favourite quotes is ""If you can dream it, you can do it"" - Walt Disney. I actually used this as my grad quote! I like this quote because I'm a really big Disney fan, so I obviously have a bias towards it. But also, I like how concise and powerful it is. It's easy to understand and has a really big impact. It's almost like a sort of mantra to use when I need encouraging words!

Do you have a few things you're interested in/looking into, or do you truly have no idea? If you have some ideas, it would be good to connect with people working in that area and to do some research. If you have no idea, I recommend reflecting on some questions like what do you enjoy doing? What are your skills? What are your values? How many years of education are you willing to complete? Where is the job available? Can the job be done anywhere in the world? Where do you want to live? How much income do you need for the lifestyle you want? What are the job outlooks? Is it a growing or shrinking area? What do you want your work environment to look like? What does a typical day look like? Do you want to work alone or as part of a team? There are many questions to ask yourself. Start answering questions like this and writing them down so when you think of a potential career, you can evaluate how well it aligns with what you want in your future. So far I have enjoyed UVic however most of my time there has been online so I don't have a lot to say about it. If you have any specific questions I can certainly answer them though.

1047498664,1047541045,11/1/2019 19:50,40642,7," Hey Hudson, Below is a list of things I do to get school work done when I don't want to. Now that you have completed this module I have unlocked the next one called ""post-secondary considerations"". If I find myself extremely unproductive and not motivated on a particular day, I don't do any work. It seems odd, but if nothing is coming due, your time is better spent doing something else or 'recharging your batteries so that when you do work, you are more effective. Nothing is worse than sitting in front of some work all day and procrastinating (phone, youtube etc) when instead you could have gone out and enjoyed your day. If you're doing some work and start to feel unproductive, take a break! (but set a time limit). The Pomodoro technique is one example of a way to do this (there is some science behind this method). Sometimes it can be hard to start, but once you get going, it's easier. If I'm feeling unmotivated, I like to start by working on the things I enjoy the most or are the easiest, even if they are not the priority. Once I complete that task, I feel good that I'm getting things done, and then I tackle some of the more complex and important tasks. I always use to-do lists. Put it on your desk and when you complete a task, physically put a checkmark beside it or cross it out. It's motivating to see that you're making progress. Another tip related to this is at the start of a semester, look at the syllabus for each class and put all the due dates and tests etc, into your calendar (I use google calendar on my phone). Make each class a different colour, and if you're using a digital calendar, you can often set reminders for each thing so that it will remind you X amount of days before something is due. Check your phone messages and social media, turn the phone on silent or off, and then put it away from your work area, in your backpack, or in another room. It's just too tempting to pick it up if it's right beside you. I tell the people around me I'm working for the next X amount of hours so that they know not to bug me unless it's important. I use headphones or earbuds and play white noise like rain sounds or anything non-lyrical so I can't hear anything around me. I personally get most of my productive work done between about 11:00 pm - 4:00 am because there is minimal distraction, but if you have morning classes, this isn't very realistic."," 2021-11-10, 21:00:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047542659,1047541034,9/24/2021 21:51,42220,9," Exactly!! Do what you find works best for you because you're the person that has to write the test, and it doesn't benefit you to incorporate a study method that (for example) relies on memorizing if it's not something you think you're good at. I think you've basically answered the questions in the last extension activity! You seem pretty aware of what works and what doesn't, which is good!! I think try incorporating the 'write it down' part of the pomodoro technique and see what difference that makes for you in trying to stay focused. I've also started turning my phone off completely when I study and I found a ""do not disturb"" function on my laptop, which also help!

In the latter case, you'd check off all of the conversations you wanna talk about at the bottom of this page and I can unlock them for you. We'll be discussing each topic you choose throughout the term, and if certain topics really interest you, you can complete the extension activities (though these aren't mandatory unless ur teacher assigns them).

1047549093,1047548897,10/19/2021 13:57,45444,7," Hi Ava, No worries at all, I totally understand it can get very busy with work and school. The quote you send is very interesting, and made me think about our lives. I feel that we all need to learn to live in the present...it will really reduce half the stress in our lives! It's great that you love the movie Kung Fu Panda, I liked watching it as a kid too :) I don't really listen to music so I don't have a favourite song, but I think it's great that you feel you can connect to people through music. Being a Sikh, I mostly listen to Sikh religious prayers that are sung, which I feel that I can really connect to and learn a lot from too. Also, we already found something that we have in common that we both like poetry! Yay! I would love to read your poem when you are finished. Please do send it over to me when it's done. My favourite poem is called ""Broken English"" by Rupi Kaur. I have included it below for you. I feel that it really makes you think about how so many immigrants face hardships in life, and that everything does not come easy. ""I think about the way my father pulled the family out of poverty without knowing what a vowel was. And my mother raised 4 children without being able to construct a perfect sentence in English A discombobulated couple that landed in the new world with hopes that left the bitter taste of rejection in their mouth. No family no friends, just man and wife, Two university degrees that meant nothing, one mother tongue that was broken now, one swollen belly with a baby inside. A father worried about jobs and rent coz no matter what this baby was coming. And they thought to themselves for a split second was it worth it to put all of our money into the dream of a country that is swallowing us whole. And papa looks at his woman's eyes and sees the loneliness living where the iris was. Wants to give her a home in a country that looks at her with the word visitor wrapped around their tongue. On their wedding day she left an entire village to be his wife and now she left an entire country to be a warrior. And when the winter came they had nothing, but the heat of their own bodies to keep the coldness out. And like 2 brackets they face one another to hold the dearest parts of them, their children close. They turned a suitcase full of clothes into a life and regular paychecks to make sure that children of immigrants wouldn't hate them for being the children of immigrants They worked too hard - you can tell by their hands, their eyes are begging for sleep but our mouths were begging to be fed and that is the most artistic thing I have ever seen. It is poetry to these ears that has never heard what passion sounds like and my mouth is full of likes and uhms when I look at their masterpiece coz there are no words in the English language that can articulate that kind of beauty. I can't compact their existence into 26 letters and call it a description I tried once but the adjectives needed to describe them don't even exist so I ended up with pages and pages full of words followed with commas and more words and more comas only to realize that there are some things in the world so infinite that they can never use a full stop. So how dare you mock your mother when she opens her mouth and broken English spills out. Her accent is thick like honey, hold it with your life, it's the only thing she has left from home. Don't stomp on that richness, instead hang it up on the walls of museums next to Dali and Van Gogh Her life is brilliant and tragic. Kiss the side of her tender cheek. She already knows what it sounds like to have an entire nation laugh when she speaks. She's more than our punctuation and language. We might be able to take pictures and write stories, but she made an entire world for herself. How's that for art"" What's your favourite poem?

Go to the river. its super easy where i live, put your mind at ease anytime. not to busy, no scary men that often. its just easy and simple here. 2. Two reasons why i dont like living here is you dont have many options for work here, everyone knows everything about you and cant go shopping and get what you need all the time. 3. a question about moving to the city is what would it be like? how would the people be? hoe expensive would living be? how different would it be?

I was taken aback by how much people rely on public transport and how not everyone drives themselves places. It's also taken some time for me to realize how far certain things are compared to in small towns when it only takes 10 minutes or less to get to the grocery store. All of the people I have met have been very kind and I haven't had any issues dealing with others. If you are wanting to have roommates you can get a reasonable price but it gets more expensive when you want to live alone or live in a very specific area. Since moving here for school it can be isolating at times because everyone is so focused on studying and their classes that making friends was hard for me in the first year. But once you have a friend or two here it made the biggest difference for me. It makes me love the city being able to have 2 people I can depend on here instead of just my family and friends from back home. 1.

School's been sorta tough lately since I have to well, do school things, and think about a decision that will drastically change my life. Though it's nice to meet you too :-) My name is Rooke, and I am currently in grade 10 and will hopefully get into a trades program. I am creatively inclined and love to draw and animate. I sometimes draw out my feelings to destress or as a drawing prompt. A question I'd like to start with is how is it like in university? Is it true that school and homework are really hard? What are the educators like? The students? (i just really want to know so I can be prepared for what may go on in the future) A phrase I live by is ""Don't pass out."". I originated this phrase when I was doing a double day (which means two sets of martial arts classes in one day) in my jiu-jitsu class after the first class. I was really tired, but as the saying says, I have to keep going through it, no matter how tired I am. A song I'd like to share with you is Solar Waltz by Cosmo Sheldrake. Mr. Sheldrake's music sounds so very ethereal, it was as if you pulled it from another world. This song in particular sounds regal, something fit for a ruler of the deep forests, or a lullaby to a sleeping prince. It's very soft and warm, like a cup of warm hot chocolate. (I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and if you didn't, thank you for taking the time to listen to this song! Cosmo Sheldrake's music is very underrated, so I want to expose his lovely music to other people) Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkQW5xr9iGc See you at some point next week!

1047516499,1047541029,11/27/2020 16:54,42218,3," Hi, here are my answers What are three things you like about living in a rural area? For each, explain why you like it. One thing I like about living in a rural area is that you are not surrounded by light and noise constantly like you are, when in a big city because it helps me to feel calm and uncrowded when falling asleep. Another thing I like is how you can walk anywhere you want and still feel safe because I feel like I have to be constantly on guard to stay safe in a bigger city. The final thing I like is how you can always escape into the wilderness because I enjoy being out in nature. What are two things you dont like and, again, explain your reasons for each. The first thing I dislike is how everybody knows everyone and how you have zero anonymity, making you feel like you have to be on your best behaviour at all times. The other thing that I dislike is how you can't always access products that you want due to the limited selection of local stores because this can often limit me in what I can do in some areas of my life. What is one question you have about living or moving to the city? One question that I have about living in the city is what is your preferred method of transportation and do you find city lights and noise to be a problem at night?

Maybe you could tell me what a day in your life right now looks like. I was born in Germany and lived there my entire life. Now I came to Canada for Grade 10. Then I will go back to Germany and graduate. After this, my dream job would be to become a surgeon. Other careers I'd be interested in are something in the area of science (like you) or programming. My favourite class right now is Web Development. We're currently learning how to use a program called Blender to make 3D Models. My favourite classes overall are Biology and Math (I'm one of the few people who actually enjoy doing Math). Next semester I will be able to take an Anatomy class which I'm extremely happy about. I also just started curling here and I'm really like it so far. A quote I like is ""Speak your mind even if your voice shakes"". I think it is originally from Maggie Kuhn. I like it because at times I find it hard to stand up for things. I think I don't have the perfect arguments or comebacks or my vocabulary is not big enough. The quote reminds me that it is important to say something even if you're scared or afraid that your expression is not perfect. My favourite food is called ""Milchreis"". The literal translation is milk rice. It is especially good in the winter because it warms your stomach. You can eat it with cinnamon and sugar or with hot cherries.

Do you know if you want to teach elementary/middle school, or do you want to teach high school? From my understanding, if you want to teach elementary or middle, you do the ""Elementary Bachelor of Education,"" which is a specific degree that prepares you to be a teacher. If you want to teach high school, you get a bachelor's degree in whatever area you want to teach and then you do the ""post-degree professional program,"" which is a 16-month program that essentially trains you to be a teacher, so you can teach content from the degree you got. https://www.uvic.ca/education/areas-study/teacher-ed/index.php "," 2021-11-16, 09:36:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

The one that was probably most helpful to me was the studying one and how you can be more effective while studying with less stress. I really enjoyed being able to relate to some of the points but became fascinated by the one's I didn't already do. I think that I have a lot to learn from that video because I'm absolutely terrible at studying and note taking. whenever I actually buckle down and try to take good Notes, it almost always after the fact looks like chicken scratch and I can never recall the information very well, so I end up messing up the simple questions on tests and quizzes. I think that if I was able to convey my ideas better, with the use of organized notes and pictures along side them. The correspond pictures would help me recall when it comes to the test/quiz. My grades would probably improve especially in English since it's not my strongest class. One thing I sorta want to ask is how you're able to convey the ideas of the presenter to make clear and consice notes that relate to the topic?

I've just started learning how to drive (very late, I know) and it's given me a whole new idea of how chaotic Mumbai is. It's also super hot except during the monsoon. I prefer Vancouver in a lot of ways lol. But another nicer consequence of having so many people from so many parts of India here is how great and varied the food here is, and how so many languages are spoken here, and so many holidays celebrated. Okay so, about taking notes effectively -- I really struggle with this too. Typing makes a massive difference for me, are you allowed to type notes at your school? But when I have to take written notes, I usually rely really heavily on acronyms or I just shorten words, like 'develop' becomes 'dev'., 'Britain' becomes 'Br', etc. But also I've realised that if a teacher is just talking way too fast, it's better to just not worry so much about writing down every single thing that's being said, and instead just try and pay a lot of attention. Then you can write really really basic notes whenever they pause, and it usually makes sense when you read it later since you'd been paying so much attention. And if the lecture is just pure info not an explanation (like maybe in a history class?), it can sometimes be easier to note down keywords and important dates, figures, etc. and google them again later. I hope that's helpful. Are you a really focused student then? These are the strategies I use for note-taking now in uni, I kind of slept through my classes during tenth grade, I'd just study the textbook later. How old is your brother? I have a younger brother too, he's 18. I listened to Little Red Bird after reading your message, it is really nice. And yeah, I've heard of Aaron Sorkin, he's supposed to be really good. I haven't watched anything of his yet though, but I'll definitely try Newsroom now that you've recommended, and the Social Network has been on my list for a while. I hope you're having fun in Mexico!

You can choose a focus of forest biology, marine biology or neurobiology. Some areas of work you can go into with a biology degree include: Conservation officer, Dentist, Environmental educator, Fisheries biologist, Forest biologist, Health educator, Marine biologist, Medical doctor, Physiotherapist, Research technician, Science writer, Veterinarian, Wildlife biologist. Prerequisites: Approved English 11, Pre?calculus 11, Chemistry 11, Physics 11, Approved social studies 11/12, English Studies 12 or English First Peoples 12 (minimum 67%), Pre?calculus 12 (minimum 67%), Two approved science 12 courses. They recommend you have an average of 82-85% in your grade 12 classes. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you get into the program because it's reasonably competitive. Tuition is around $6,780 for two terms, and there are scholarships available for academically outstanding students. Scroll down to the bottom of the page under program planning and open the files for the diffrent programs to see the schedules and the classes you would do. https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/programs/undergraduate-programs/pages/biology.php?residency=D&amp;level=HS&amp;school=HD&amp;curriculum=BC#ipn-biology Also, keep in mind that you can do a minor during your degree, which I believe can be a subject you can teach.

For me the most inspiring events in my life have been by chance. These inspirations result in hard work, but I do not feel hardwork results in inspiration. An example from my own life would be, while working as a paramedic I was called to a patient who was dying from cancer. I was able to help that person die at home comfortably, which inspried me to pursue medical school and that is why I am now at Selkirk College doing pre-med.

This works best for me when trying to remember definitions! For example in psychology I had to memorize what mean, median and mode meant. I remembered mean is the average because they both have the letter 'A', median is the middle number because they both have the letter 'I', and mode is the most occurring number because they both have an 'O'. This method has always worked for me, even when I really have to stretch to find a connection! ?? My hand writing is not the greatest?????.. so when writing notes in a rush I find them hard to read later on, so making sure to slow down and make neat notes is definitely important and benefits me later on. Repetition for me is definitely the most useful form of studying for me, really nailing the idea into my head. Re-reading examples or definitions.

My favourite trick, which they also said was the most affective, was active recall. Dumping out the contents of your brain either by explaining concepts and information or writing things down on a piece of paper. It allows me to make connections and visualize concepts that I didn't think about thouroughly before. Another trick that I thought was interesting was spacing out your studying. I knew that it was less stressful then cramping everything in the night before, but I didn't know that it was actually more effective and allowed you to receive better grades. I'll be trying that for my next test for sure. What is the most effective way to study for university? "," 2021-11-17, 13:56:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

1047547291,1047549754,9/30/2021 8:54,46108,5," Greetings Rooke, I love your phrase ""don't pass out"". It shows you must have some great stregnth and resilence to keep pushing when you're at jiu-jitsu class or getting through a hard day. I will probably say this phrase to myself when I'm having a hard day. Your phrase also relates to the song you shared from Cosmos Sheldrake. The Solar Waltz is a wonderful ballad that is very poetic discussing the need to keep working and living life. I think there's a hidden message of joy in the emotional song Cosmos Sheldrake sings, as it illustrates how life changes and new things grow when other things decompose. It was a pleasure to listen to. Thank you for introducing me to Cosmos Sheldrake. Being in university is like managing your own full time job. It was hard at first cause I had to learn how to organize my time. But now I love it cause I meet so many different people, I get invovled with student union, and go to events. I tend to be very busy but I'm busy doing things I enjoy. Many students don't show up to class, or go to class over Zoom, and then show up for the test. School and homework can be hard, but it also can be easy. It depends on the professor or instructor. For me, I found homework hard at first but then I started going to the writing centre and got connected with the accessibility centre. I got a tutor who helped me out a lot, they showed me how to use a marking rubric to write my assignments and meet the criteria that a professor asks for. I think that accessing student services, such as the Writing Centre and Accessibility Centre, helped me pass my first two years in university. Most people in university are very supportive and will help you succeed, but you have to ask and seek the help on your own by emailing people and setting up appointments. Often these appointments are on Zoom or virtual meetings. It requires some good time management skills, I use Google calendars all the time to remind me about appointments and classes. The educators are very supportive, most of the time the the professors (profs) want you to pass. I always email my professors and ask them questions about assignments. Their answers always give me hints to the homework. Normally they are very nice people. The students are great, I've definately made more friends in university than I did in highschool. All the students want to help eachother out. For example, there's a test tomorrow, so I met with some students earlier this week to study and go over the text book. That helped me a lot because if we didn't meet I would just read the text book over and over again. So now I feel prepared and I had a good time studying with others. Wow, that was a lot of stuff to fit into a message. I hope it wasn't too much. Those were some great questions, I hope I answered well enough for you. We can start a conversation if you'd like. I think we're suppose to complete two by the end of January. Chris "," 2021-11-17, 20:26:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

As for a bio major, I learn more about plants/animals which I find a lot of people dont know a lot about so its often my go-to facts when Im talking to people.

I think it'd be fun to visit a rural town and maybe even experience living in one one day. :) To answer your questions: Q: What is your preferred method of transportation? For the post-secondary schools I attended in my city, bus passes were included in our tuition costs. It wasn't something I could opt-out of, so to make the most out of it, I found myself busing to and from campus frequently. I find busing is a more tuition-friendly option compared to driving (as it's included in our tuition), as driving involves the additional costs of parking by the hour/day and stressors of having to find a spot. You may also notice that many students bike around campus as well - You'll see students just cycle from building to building, wherever their class is next! However, if we were talking outside of school, I mainly drive from place to place, as our landmarks are quite far from each other (for example, I don't think walking from one mall to the other is a friendly distance!). Q: Do you find city lights and noise to be a problem at night? I think it really depends on what part of town you live in, as well as your neighbourhood. For myself, I live in quite a quiet neighbourhood, so I seldom have problems with noise or lights. But when it comes to things like city lights, noises, and safety, I believe they'd be more of a concern around more condensed, metropolitan areas like downtown. Just like with every town, there are quiet areas and loud ones, but these places also have their positives and negatives of living there. I think you've actually covered the questions I had for you, but did you have anymore that you wanted to ask me? If not, and if you were comfortable with moving onto the next section, I'd be happy to continue our convo on the ""Between Worlds"" page! Let's message again soon!

One is that everyone knows everyone here that Is how small of a town I live in. Two is we have great quading and snowmobiling trails so I can go, hang with the boys and I can let loose. Three is that we love to play hockey and baseball. We will either host tournaments or go to tournaments.

As for notes taking, you are not the only who are in trouble. Taking concise and to-the-point notes is also not easy for me. When the instructor speaks too fast or the slide is a little vague, I will panic . However, I will follow some steps to take notes as better as possible. First, take advantage of resources the instructor gives me. In some courses, I might be given the slides, workbooks, or reading materials from the teacher. I will initially take my notes based on these materials because they are what the teacher requires me to focus on. If I don't lucky enough to have them and have to take notes on my own, I will catch keywords in class and supplement them ASAS after class. You are right, I cannot record everything detailed and well-organized in class, but I have time to review it after class. Just make sure your notes in class are clear and important so that you can recall them easily. At least, it is never a bad idea to ask for your classmates' help. I always borrow my classmate's notebook because of her excellent notes. You know, we cannot be good at everything. We are students.

For the research side I was thinking about looking into how sports are good for you and what the benefits of activity are in youth. And for the presentation side I was thinking I would make a presentation or video about sports at our high school and go present to elementary schools in our district so they can create an interest in sports before they come to high school! ," 2021-11-18, 19:29:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

It's great to hear that you are learning new information from these videos! I completely agree with you that active recall is an effective way to study! I personally use this method when studying for specific courses as I find writing things out and visualizing concepts helps solidify the material more which makes it easier to retain. And yes, absolutely. Spacing out studying seems to work as well although sometimes it's understandable if you can't necessarily do this because life gets in the way so cramming is ultimately the only option haha (If I'm being honest, this happens to me too sometimes). At least dedicating 1-2 hours a day to study for every class that you're taking should help in the long run and help with long-term retention of material versus short-term retention.

1047499279,1047541058,11/12/2019 0:33,40648,7," Great question, this is fairly subjective though as it can be different depending on the person, but I would say the most effective way to study for courses when in university for me is applying all of the concepts mentioned in the video. Yes, this probably sounds daunting and like a lot of work but getting through the hurdle of studying effectively in university definitely helps in the long run. It also depends on the course, active recall helps in most classes but for classes where calculations are involved, I like to work through as many practice questions as possible to really understand the material. I also find that spacing out the number of hours studying for different courses can be tricky when taking a full course load at university, but even if I manage to get through material for 3/5 courses in one day I consider this an accomplishment and then the next day I start with the remaining 2 courses. Also, another great way to study (and this can be applied to high school as well) would be to collaborate with others! Sharing ideas and working through problems with other students allows for a better understanding of the material and is helpful for all students.

Unfortunately, I have never been to your town, but I could feel how tranquil and relaxing your town is. On top of that, I am really down for trying quadding and snowmobiling trails!! I guess it must be snowy during winter, which must be beautiful! In Vancouver, snowing is not common since it is rainy all day...I guess you must be good at sports and outdoor activities. Where do you usually go to play sports? By the way, ""contact"" hockey sounds interesting! As for things you dislike, I hear you 100% LOL. Waking up early, going to school, and taking classes that you might not be interested in that much is a really big thing, right? However, I believe there are certain things that you can do only at that moment. I hope you can have a special memory in school before you graduate, which makes you have fun and feel confident! About your great and realistic question, I am living on-campus and my monthly rental fee for a studio is around $1282, which is quite pricy. However, there are many options to get a place to live in. Some of my friends lived with a homestay family (around $600-$800) or share a house with others ($500-$1000 depending on the size of a room). If there are residence and accommodation in your college or university, you can also live there, which costs around $600-$1300 depending on room type) If you get a job here (even a part-time job), which makes it affordable to pay for a rental fee every month, then you can definitely live here.

How physical activity impacts people's mental health and the role/importance it has played in people's lives during Covid-19. If you wanted to do a video you could interview people at your school who are in sports and then edit in some quick action clips.

1047550296,1047549751,11/5/2021 16:54,46085,1," Hi Anna, Hope you are doing well! After watching the video about studying, I definitely find it helpful as I already do some of the mentioned studying techniques. I always study at least 2 weeks in advance for any tests, although usually I always try study one month in advance to give myself ample time to prepare for everything. This also prevents me from cramming and being stressed last minute. With that said, its very important for me to plan out my schedule early as well, so I know exactly when I need to start studying. Having a calendar either online or written down has always been helpful to me. Another technique I have is using active recall. Although its important to review notes or write them out, it would benefit you even more if you can remember things in broader terms, but also be able to recall the details that go along with them. For example, for each lesson I have, I would write out the notes as review. After having my notes, I would create a mindmap or a flow chart that summarizes the lesson. I would only broadly summarize the lesson with these flow charts, and I would try to recall all the other details when I look at the flow chart. This helps me see the bigger picture and understand concepts better. Lastly, an advantage of studying early is that youll be able to find out what you have questions earlier. This gives you time to get the help you need. I always take advantage of office hours where I am able to go to the professor or the teaching assistant to ask them questions. Remember, there are no dumb questions!It is always better to ask than to assume. Let me know what kind of studying tips you use and what you think might be helpful! Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers, Christine "," 2021-11-20, 13:16:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying 
10161,1047541041,1/10/2017 17:16,40639,5," Hi Elise! I also love those things about rural living. When I was younger (especially before I could drive) I felt that living in the city was a lot more exciting, and maybe it is, but I've come to be grateful for what rural living offers. I've also realized that I'm much more of a rural person than a city person. I also agree with your disadvantages! As soon as you need something that you can't get locally you have to drive pretty far to get to a city that has what you need. Maybe sometimes its a good excuse to have a road trip...? lol I found moving to a big city to be both exciting and scary. I was excited to see what the city had to offer vs. my home town. I was leaving my friends and family and would have to make new friends, and I didn't speak much French but I was moving to Montreal. I did struggle making friends, but luckily I had my boyfriend and his family. I eventually made a great friend too, but it took a while. And luckily, a lot of people in Montreal actually speak English, and if not my boyfriend could translate lol. I really liked having great transit options, and being in walking distance to stores. I wish I knew more about Montreal before I moved there. I feel like I didn't really take advantage of living there, and looking back I would have liked to do more exploring. I spent a lot of time at home, and would have liked to done more outings. As for activities there were a lot of little things because cities just have more options. I like to try new things when cooking/baking and there were lots of international grocery stores (that are amazingly inexpensive). I also had the oppourtunity to see my favourite musician live (Tom Odell). When I lived at home my friend and I drove 8 hours to see him in Vancouver the very next day. The 30 minute transit ride was definitely a lot more convenient lol. I also found some restaurants I love! There is this place that sells samosas for $0.50! It was also nice to be able to go to actual stores instead of ordering stuff online. Overall I think moving to the city was a great experience. Even though I had some hard times, it had a lot to offer, and I grew to appreciate rural living a lot more. It also allowed me to finish my Biology degree and get to know my boyfriend's family very well. Hope you're having a nice weekend.

Any imput you have would be terrific. It's pretty fun sleeping over night here. It's been a little quite the last little bit because usually we have four people sleeping in our cabin but two of them haven't been here the last two weeks because they were sick. The school work is just different because it's a little more work than I'm used to, plus the school I'm at does a lot of outdoor/hands on kind of learning, a few weeks ago our teacher taught us how to use a compass, and had us find an airplane crash in the middle of the forest area on the island.

I feel like I would get lost in the city and not know where I'm going when I first move there. I also like that there are not as many people in areas that I enjoy being at. If I were to go to the ski hill where I live there would be way fewer people than at a ski hill near an urban area. I like that I know most people in my community and have friends because I feel it would be harder to make friends in a big city. I don't really like that I have to drive most places because everything is so spread out. I also don't like that I don't have an option in places I do stuff. There's only one gym in my town and it's not very good so I either have to work out at the bad gym or drive 20 minutes to a different gym in a different town.

We aimed to reach Cirque lake which was about 45 minutes canoe ride accross the lake and a 3-4 hour hike up, (given the conditions). What we found however when we crossed the lake was that we were about a month too early for the conditions we expected. Nevertheless we found our way up, mostly Hiking on a mix of snow and mud. Once we reached the lake we were astonished to find it completely snowed over. It was by far the most beutiful landscape that iv'e seen in rescent memory. The sun and heat were intense as the snow around us magnified it increadibly. Nevertheless it was an increadible experience for me. I was excited to hear that you play football!

1047551030,1047548894,11/8/2021 16:35,46217,3," Hi Herman, It's nice to meet you too, and I'm sorry that it took so long for me to get back to you. To answer your question about what I wanted to do in the future as my career, I'm not entirely sure; lately, it's been a fluctuating concept for me. I know that I like art and storytelling, and I'm pretty good at programming things on a computer, but I haven't really decided on a job yet. All of the possibilities I've come across just don't interest me. I also like your quote, Walt Disney Studios has always been a favourite thing of mine too. Their films are just so spellbinding, and the stories they tell are really unique. My inspiration comes from music rather than words, however I can understand the impact they can have on a person. That picture from the airport is also pretty cool. I think Canada definitely could have more art in public spaces, having stuff like that to come home to and visualize would be much more comforting. Musical Interlude I like all sorts of music, and I don't have much of a preference so long as it has good rhythm and beats. One song, however, has been on my mind all week. I think it's just something nice to listen to from time to time, and it's ""Save my Soul"" by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Unfortunately, I can't link it right now, but it's easy to find on YouTube. Food for thought I'm not much of a chef, I'll admit to that, but I'm particularly fond of a stirfry recipe I make from time to time. My mother showed me how to prepare it when I first began cooking, and it's been a meal that I've loved from the youngest years of my childhood. It's just a simple amount of beef diced into bite-sized pieces, and bite-sized peppers, green onions, and mushrooms, all poured into a pan with a crushed clove of garlic and a variety of spices. One teaspoon of cornstarch, soy sauce, and a small bowl of water are added into the mixture, and then it's all prepared on top of cooked rice. I'm no cook, and I often mess it up when I'm preparing it alone, but it's my favourite food. I think you'd like it. My teacher only told me to introduce myself to you, so I don't think there's anything else to say.

I hope you and your family are all good now! I hope your town has been doing okay. The crazy weather did affect my house a little bit! There was a bit of minor flooding in my basement, but other than that, I am doing well. The week is a little hectic due to my university workload, but other than that its been fun. I'm excited to finally hear from you back though! :) I am very impressed when you said you were already taking pre-calculus 12 at grade 10 and business computer applications 12! I only took precalculus at grade 11 so I guess you are already one step ahead of me. Computer science sounds very important right now considering everything is becoming automated already, so it sounds great that you are already preparing for the future. What got you interested into computer science if I may ask? Its great that you look up to your dad because I do too! My dad has always valued hard work and emphasized to me that you must try your best in everything you do. His results speak of the success of those actions, as he is now self-employed as a pharmacist after years of busy study at UBC after immigrating from China to obtain a pharmacist's degree. A quote that I stood by is ""The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing"" by Walt Disney. It motivates me to stop procrastnating by saying I'm going to do something, and actually begin to do it. After when you gotten this message, please read the text and watch the video.

You can take all the time you need for responding since you are probably very busy with school as well (the citizen science work with the Hakai Institute sounds super interesting!). I hope you and your family are safe and doing alright after the flooding. In regards to your question: Yes! When I first started working as a pharmacy assistant, I was considering attending pharmacy school to become a pharmacist after I graduated from university. However, working at a pharmacy opened my eyes to the sheer amount of people that are living with incurable chronic diseases who need to take daily, life-long medicine in order to live a normal life. I realized that instead of becoming a healthcare provider who could only treat these patients individually, I wanted a career that could instead improve the health of populations on a much larger scale, which led me to chronic disease epidemiology! :) I'd also love to know more about you and your future goals and aspirations if you'd like to share them here!

One of my best friends actually did the Beaty business program and she loved it! She was considering between UBC and SFU as well. She is now working for a major financing company in Calagary and I think she plans on moving to Ontario soon. Please let me know if you have any questions for her and I can forward them to her and I'll get back to you :) I would LOVE to talk about transition to University! I really wish I had someone to help me during my transition because I totally underestimated how tough it would be. I fully support the idea of you starting in the winter, I actually wish I had taken a gap year, to do all the things that you mentioned such as travelling and preparing for a higher education. I did go in with a full course load with the mentality that I could handle it. I wouldn't say it was hard but mixed with being in a new environment, joining new clubs, and meeting new people, it was definitely super chaotic. As for choosing a major, that usually happens either at the end of first year or second year so that you can spend third and fourth year completing the required courses for your major. I honestly wouldn't worry too much about that right now because there are so many things to explore in university that you never would have thought of. For your other applications, I would take some time to think about what makes you an optimal candidate for university. What experiences have made you more mature? What motivations and goals do you have? Also, have you thought about applying outside of BC? Many of my friends went to Alberta, Ontario, Saskatechewan, and even the East Coast (Dalhousie!)

For exams when they come around I often go to my Google classroom and just read over all the slides that we did in the unit on, then afterwards I'll look over my old tests seeing what I did wrong and correct them to the best of my abilities. I never really use my notes to study because they're just so awful and I can't make anything out of them, but as of recently I took some of the note taking strategies from the videos into affect and cleaned up my notes a little bit but they're still kinda chicken scratch and illegible so I kinda suck at studying. I do love that you borrow without returning others notes because I definitely relate to that. I'll take photos of the good kids notes, then read over them on my hour long bus ride on the test day morning which somewhat prepares me. One thing I'm kinda curious about is how you set up your notes and provide context to them that helps you study for tests and exams? Also what strategies are good for the actual wrighting down aspect, because I know lectures are long with lots of info that the prof will just breeze through so writing everything down is kinda impossible for me at least.

We mentors got a heads up that your school is still figuring out what to do with this program, so we were told that our mentees might be unresponsive during that time. Light traps? That sounds so cool! I could spend hours a day watching trapping videos like that tbh.

What kind of critters did you guys manage to catch? Also I really admire how you tattoo yourself, I definitely don't have the skills to do that lol. I haven't been doing much other than volunteering and doing school work, though the rain and wind did add some spice to my week.

Getting to your questions, about my university experience. I had my undergraduate background in Agricultural Engineering as I am currently in a graduate program at University of British Columbia (UBC). My university days during undergraduate were one of the best days as far as I remember because the course opened me up to a lot of thinking and exploration about the environment. I had both classroom knowledge and field experience analysing different soil condtions, working on community water supply projects as well. This undergraduate program also gave me the option to think of environmental preservation and sanitation. Currently at UBC, the Land and Water Systems program have been nothing short of amazing! I've been blown away by the amount of resources I am opened to working with as an environmental professional. To simply put, the Land and Water program prepares you to be an expert in the two major resources (Land and Water) that affect agriculture or food production. A graduate from this program could go on to work in different positions such as environmental facility technician, soil consultant, land and water researcher, and sometimes a climate change professional. Thinking about your current program, I think post secondary degree related to environmental sciences, environmental resources sustainability, aquaculture or marine science may be good programs you could possibly go explore - just my little opinion. Zach, concerning the files you shared with me, I see that's a link which probably contains some photos. So, when I tried to access the link, it says ""ACCESS DENIED"" and I have to request access from you through my personal email in order to view the files. Realizing that personal information such as our personal emails ARE NOT TO BE SHARED ON THIS PLATFORM, I'd suggest that you post the pictures directly to this message chat. Also, read the section under ""INSTRUCTIONS"" on how to share photos and the section titled ""REMEMBER TO SHARE LINKS ETHICALLY"" so that we can both comply with the guidelines of this platform with in view of the photos you may want to share with me. Considering the information you shared after the links that contains these files, I'm really looking forward to seeing these beautiful photos! Lastly, talking about my footballing experience, this was a habit I casually picked up while growing up in my early life years. Whenever I returned from school, I would go to a sport field miles away from my home just to be part of a football game. Till date, I still love playing football but I have not been a part of a major competitive tournament in a while due to the time demands from my graduate program. I truly hope I have exhausted your questions and if not, kindly point my attention to it/them. I'm glad to answer further questions before we move on from this current anchor text.

I also saw that you love being outdoors, do you have any hike recommendations? I love kayaking as well, I also learned how to paddleboard this summer and thought it was so much fun...

Figuring out your study method is so important but of course that will take some time and it could even vary depending on the classes you take. Kinda like that video said, your notes, or in general your study methods, in a math class will be different than a history class. Personally, one thing that helped me is definitely not cramming. I know that's such a cliche but I found it effective and it was overall just less stressful. Not gonna lie, but my study habits kinda went down the drain during COVID because it was tough doing online school so I've experienced both paced learning and cramming. But keeping on top of things is a lot of work because you have to keep up with several classes in terms of the lecture material for exam studying and on top of that you'll most likely have assignments and papers that'll take up your time too. But when I was at the ""peak"" of my study habits, I would have the class readings done before the lecture or at least within the same week as the lecture, and I try to take notes from the textbook if I think it will be useful, which depends on the class. Then during the lecture, I prefer writing my notes down on paper. Most profs have a powerpoint presentation during the lectures which they make available to the students. So if I know the slides will be available I dont write them down, I focus on what the prof is saying. Then I aim to do the following within the week of that lecture: I will type up the lecture notes and insert my own written notes in the same document. Then from this notes document, I will make flashcards. And I just keep adding to this doc and making flashcards with every lecture. So closer to the exam date, like a week or two if possible, I can start going through my notes and flashcards and everything is all organized. Hopefully that makes sense! How about you, what are your current study habits? Was there anything from the video that you already do, and is there anything you wish to do?

I am jsut intrested because for awhile I was really intrested in becoming a psycho therapist but I am no longer sure. I do not think I can handle that much school. I got really interested in psychology around 5 months ago when I was hosting a relationship advice podcast that quickly turned into metal health due to some of the people we met and the psychological issues they faced some were very interesting and we never thought we would see first hand. When I was 12 I started my lighting/audio business that I still have but every since covid has been shut down. I am still trying to learn as much as I can about business and have been working on it online.

That is something I feel to be of a more ""greater risk"" when going to the city. Say, downtown or something. Some pointers others had given me when I was younger was not to look like you're scared. Even though you are. This could be very obvious that you're looking around (the side to side ""check""). Or, taking out your phone constantly. I mean, you may be checking for directions but people tend to do it to avoid interactions and to do something with their hands when they're feeling skittish/anxious. I know this may not be the ""answer"" you're looking for, I can only provide some reassurances/things to look out for. When you feel uneasy about the people around you, take 3 deep breaths. Breathe deeply from your stomach and slowly exhale from the mouth. Do this as many as you want, till you feel you're in control and be able to react when something bad happens (i.e. getting jumped, people coming up to your face, out of the ordinary stuff). I want to make sure that you can react/make a decision IF something does happen. I'm a big worrywart, so I would recommend to re-assess the situation before reacting. Sometimes, it's just the overthinking that gets us all alert. Lastly, I would say act cautious but don't forget to have fun. ?? When you get the chance to go to big events, the goal is to enjoy yourself. Take a break from school and life, in general. Thanks for reading this mumble-jumble!

Some of the cool things I saw people would come to the emergency room with their hands cut in half, electrical burns deep enough that you can see the tendon, and people with burns. It is wild. I was lucky to be in the operating room and helping with the surgeries. Obviously, I am at the beginning of training so I would only do basic stuff like guiding the camera in someones abdomen, using tools to push aside organs, and suturing up the incisions at the end. They even led me cut someones scalp open for neurosurgery!

I think I am going to take a year once i graduate to fingure some things out and work for a little bit. We did a litle bit of work with a counsellor yesterday learning to send out transcripts and navigating the college and niversity websites. Im gonna sure be glad once i get all of figured out because it is quite confusing to see what requirements i need. One thing I would like to ask is that if I dont have a required class how would i go about getting it once im out of highschool? Im looking into the medical side of things and seeing what the options are. More so into the side of health/safety such as a health and safety coordinator or safety officer. Which is someone who views worksites of any kind (mines, stores, recreational centers, construction sites) and make plans to ensure worksites are safe. There are many paths and options to the career which interests me. The carreer requires a degree or certificate in Occupational Health and Safety.

There are many places to go for a walk in nature to have time to yourself. Ever want to go for a long drive, go down the lake. Everybody lives close together so you can meet up with people and hang out at the park even go for a small walk. 2 things you dont like and why: There are not many opportunities for sports or places to go shopping at. Only have one grocery store and the food it pretty expensive. I really like playing sorts and wish we had a bigger opportunity to play more sports. It gives me something to do and learn something new. I would get to play games against other teams and play with my own team members and get ready for games. Another thing that I dont like is there are not many different opportunities for jobs. When it comes to trying to find a job for myself I find it hard to find a job mostly because the jobs that are here are being a waitress or working at a hotel or the grocery store and I really dont wan to do any of those things.

You ask a very difficult question. The average cost of an apartment is different in different cities. In large cities, the cost is more because it is so populated; in some places the monthly cost is between $1500-2000 or even more. I would suggest that you do some research based on the location you are interested in and I think Google can work wonders with these sorts of questions.

A lot of the tips within the video are things that I do in university and I also am an academic coach so they are things that I suggest to the students I work with. Its really great to start practicing how to do active studyingwhich is doing practice problems and explaining concepts to other people, as in post-secondary I have found studying is a lot less about memorization or reading over notes (passive learning) but more application so like problem solving type questions. Also the tip that they mentioned in the video about switching between subjects while studying is helpful because in post secondary there is usually a lot of deadlines around the same time as Im sure is the same thing in high school while trying to juggle all your classes. The one strategy in the video that I still struggle with is spaced practice so starting to study early becuase I find its hard to start studying for final exams for example, when I have all these other assignments due for all my classes before final exams start.

You asked two ""tricky"" questions for me. Sorry I am not such an expert in note-taking! First question, I would say ""expanding deeper with your notes"". Maybe your current notes are not adequate for cramming all knowledge, but you can consider the notes as the outline, and recall what else are important and shoulde be remember in this course. Then, you supplement more details in your notes, and they might look more meaningful for study. Next, there are no doubts that no one can record everything in his notebook, and I personally will focus on the instructor's guideline and syllabus. I think teacher's emphasis would give your hints for what aspect is more important for exams and quizzes. In this turn, I gonna bother you about procrastination, because it is really an issue for me. Sometimes I wanna finish one task on Monday, but I catch myself not finishing it by Tuesday. The initial reason for that is even for wasting time on social media!

However, you might ask what if I plan for my day and cannot finish all the tasks I assign for myself (which happens a lot for me and others for sure). For me it was and still is very hard to stay focused while studying. For example, I check my phone regularly, if I'm working on my laptop I open different tabs and websites to check, etc. I realized the only way to decrease this (not possible to make it zero! at least for me) is to realistically minimize the distractions. Forexample when I am studying with my laptop, I cannot put my laptop away but I can leave my phone in a different room. Also, what I am trying to do recently is to assign specific times during the day for my distractions ! and I literally called it distraction time! So,whenever during studying, I am prompted to even think about family problems, worrying about some stuff, or checking on something, I try to remind myself that I have 2pm-3pm to spend for my distractions. This way you are realisticllay dealing with it because everyone has lots of distravtions and lots of things to think about or worry about, but this way you are even managing your time for those stuff.

I'm not sure how much advice I can give since I live in a ver tiny town (like around 3000 people during the off season) but here's my best shot! When I get nervous about being around people or getting lost in bigger centres since I'm AWFUL with directions, I like to make a routine! That may be a specific route I always walk or a certain order to my day so I feel organized and safe. I also listen to music a lot in public but when I'm walking in unsafe areas, particularly at night, I always make sure to take one earbud out so I can still enjoy my music and be calm while knowing what's coming.

For me, no one really taught me good stud techniques either, and that was something I really struggled with throughout school until my later years of high school. It took me some time to find studying techniques that fit my learning style because I am a big visual and ""doer"" learner. You are totally right about how studying is when you focus on a topic and do your best to learn the material within each topic, and your technique is a solid one! I do the same where I need to highlight the areas on some things I need to work and working with your friend is awesome because you are always keeping each other on your toes! Did any of the strategies in these videos interest you? Or do you think they could help you for future studies? You should also watch the second video in this conversation, I think it would be really helpful for you because your own unique studying techniques for each different subject may differ and you may have to adapt to some different techniques of studying.

In cities many people pay to get thing things done and over with. In the country we just do it on our own. It is just showing what the differences are. I relate to all the outdoors stuff, I do it all. Firewood, fishing, hunting, fixing things that have to be done. I felt encouraged to not stop the things I do. To push through the cold and harsh times. Do whats best, the film presents that very well.

In the city, a lot of people can be rushed, but as you said, there are many activities to meet people with similar interests, so its possible to make lots of friends but by putting yourself out there into activities. Do you find that in your town you find it hard to find people like you? Or do you feel like there are not a lot of opportunities or people in general?

You will have to apply for entry for September 2022 to be eligible for this scholarship. After you are accepted, you will have to fill out a ""deferring your admission"" form to start in January! Long story short, if you win the scholarship, it doesn't matter when you start as long as you meet their basic criteria, I've included their link; https://you.ubc.ca/financial-planning/scholarships-awards-canadian-students/entrance-award/ You can also call them to make sure you have all of your questions met!

They are both very similar in terms of the hard work it keeps to manage them.

1047547931,1047541570,10/8/2021 20:46,44736,5," Hi Tobi, No worries! I hope everything is good now. I think it's really interesting that you mention how you live in a small town and that you like that everybody knows each other. You'll find that, if you move to an urban area for university, that it's pretty similar. On university campus, there are a lot of students, but you'll be interacting with the same people all the time and get to know them. Of course, it won't be the exact same, and you'll most likely be more like acquaintances to a lot of the people you meet, but it's a little funny how you'll run into the same people even in a bigger city. I also found it interesting that the view of the mountains remind you of home. I know it's not entirely the same, but we can see the mountains in the horizon from here too. I have to tell you, though, growing up, I never realized how rare it was to have such a view. I'm sure yours is much nicer than mine, but my extended family live in other parts of the world and they always compliment how you can see the mountains while you're driving. I'm so happy that you appreciate how lucky we are to have the beautiful scenery and call it home! As for knowing the area that you live in, if you do end up moving to an urban area for school, you'll also find that it isn't that different. I can only speak of the greater Vancouver area, of course, but the good thing about Vancouver is that it's incredibly small relative to other bigger, urban centres. Another advantage we have is public transit. If you're here, I'm sure you'll be able to navigate using public transit. The truth is, living in the city can seem daunting because that's how they portray it in the movies. Cities are big, and busy and I hate getting lost too! But I think the good thing is that we have great technology and people are really easy to talk to, when getting directions. Thanks for getting back to me!

I focused a lot of my class time on a website called Chatter High. I dont know if you heard of it. Basically, it asks you a bunch of questions about post-secondary education and you get points for correct answers. There is currently a competition running and I wanted to do well in it. It worked out and I won some prizes, but I realized I didnt balance my time very well, so I will try to do that more moving forward. I hope youre not too upset. I watched the video and here are my thoughts on it: I think planning your time out and not cramming before a test makes a lot of sense. When you want to be more fit it also doesn't help to just train for 5 hours in one day and then not at all for two weeks. When youre less stressed you also have a better feeling about taking the test. Here in Canada I dont have to write exams; only little tests. So Im a bit scared that when I go back to Germany, where I have to write big exams that count for my graduation grade, I won't be in the habit anymore. Thats why I decided to gather a lot of information and knowledge on studying and different methods. That way I can prepare for it. One study tactic that I learned about on YouTube and used a few times in the past is writing questions for yourself and basically creating your own exam. Then you let it be for a few days or a week and later try to answer the questions. This way you can see very well how much you know and it also simulates the situation of taking an exam. I think this also has to do with tip 5 where you try to recall anything you know about the topic without looking at any notes. You just have the test in front of you and answer everything from memory. I like your method for active recall. Were currently studying WWI in Social Studies and Im pretty sure were going to write a test on it, so I will try it out. As I said, the test wont be that big, but it will be enough to give me a chance to try the method. Can you tell me a bit more about office hours? I heard of them, but Im not sure what they are exactly. How often are they? How much time do you spend there? Is it just one person and the professor or multiple people? Do you do like a lesson that the professor planned beforehand or do you ask your specific questions? Thank you in advance! Anna "," 2021-11-30, 14:33:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

I'm so sad to hear that Castle Fun Park in Abbotsford is destroyed, my love for arcade and video games originated there. I apologize for my late response, wifi has been scarce but I should be able to contact better soon. As you already know, my name is Keith. :) I use he/him pronouns and am interested in attending film school some time in my future. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do when I get there, though; there are so many options. I want to write, produce, animate, voice-act, conduct music, and film, I can't pin-point it to just one career. I sadly never got into muscials but had a lot of friends that would play them outloud, lol. When I was younger, I listened to a lot of edm and dubstep music but now I enjoy pretty much every genre including country. My current favourite song is ""ACHE"" by emawk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ne7tLBvNaw), it reminds me a lot of Billie Eilish's style of music; but my all-time favourite is ""Reckless"" by Healy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSW8fEQleY). It's the perfect summer-weather song and it's helped me calm down many times. Music has always been an important thing to me, and I've considered making my own, but I still haven't decided. I'm not sure if you're into animation or not, but my favourite television show is 'Bojack Horseman"". It's pretty raunchey but I think it has beautiful character development and messages about growing up, depression, confusing relationships, important topics, etc. All six seasons are available on Netflix so if you're interested I recommend checking it out. :) I absolutely love all different types of coffee but personally prefer mine iced with extra steps when I go to Starbucks, lol. I'm currently obsessed with their iced London Fog (just an earl gray teabag with milk) with a single espresso shot, vanilla syrup, and honey blend. They always know when it's me pulling in the driveway. I look forward to working with you and getting to know you better. :) Is there a certain career path you want to take after UBC?

I chose: Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life. I think that all of my hardest situations in life have always been the ones with the biggest changes and the scariest unknowns. I am typically able to foresee how my future will be to an extent and how I can get there, so I usually know the right choice to make. However, from my experience, the situations I have been in where I was very unsure what would happen in the future have always turned out for the best and have had a positive outcome that has made me stronger. I think that the unknown can be scary, but life holds so many unknowns and it is impossible to predict everything, so new situations make us stronger and wiser for our futures. The unknown can also bring big changes, as said in the quote. While change can be terrifying, it is necessary for us to grow and learn, so it is a necessity. Learning to accept change is something I am always working on and I have done my best to become more comfortable with letting my future take ""the ropes"" of my life and learning to accept whatever outcome I am given. I think that this quote was one that really made me think about my life a lot. It provoked a big reflection and I think that I will try and remember it for the future and the idea that the unknown and change are necessary and will get easier as I gain more experience.

I understand if it may not be your number one choice to participate in this program, however, I believe me and you can achieve a great deal meaningful work over the next while. More than just helping you exercise some of your post-secondary options, I am also here for you as a peer. A quote that I want you to think about comes from one of my favourite movies: ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"". Ferris Bueler famously proclaims that ""life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while you could miss it."" I think this is a perfect quote to think about as you transition from high school to post-secondary life! I also wanted to share a photo I really like. The photo is taken at Tofino, which I got to visit last. Although the water is cold, it's the closest you can get to feeling tropical in BC! https://unsplash.com/photos/_wM1ZSWlUIc I dont expect you to tell me your entire life story in response to this message, however, I want you to know that I am always open to hearing about your life outside of this programs context.

I hope you are not stressing yourself out because you still have plenty of time to figure that out. I sure struggled a lot with figuring out what I want to study, and to be very honest with you I settled with dietician/nutritionist AFTER I got into nutrition major, something I havent thought of in high school. Back in grade 12, I ranked the Faculty of Science as my first priority and the Faculty of Land and Food System as second only because the content of study is closest to science compared to the others. Well, now you know I did not get accepted to my first choice and ended up in nutrition! The message I want you to know is that people dont always know what they want, and as long as you keep going, thats okay. I have a lot of friends who switched majors within 4 years of study or even dropped out because they want to go for something else, so there is really no stress because it only adds to your knowledge and experience. I was kind of anxious over the uncertainties I might encounter in post-secondary because I dont feel like I am ready for all the challenges, but one thing I learned is that no one can be 100% ready for everything that's ahead of you. So dont be nervous with the idea of going to college, were all here to learn and grow! "," 2021-11-30, 22:37:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Acceptance depends on faculty, for example Science/Sauder requires higher grades whereas Arts require the lowest. Undergrad applications differ for each college so you will have to look into each on their websites. For now, I would suggest asking yourself why you are interested in those occupations. Artists and photographers and pharmacy technicians are very different options, so you might wanna think about your situation and see what you value the most in your future job. Some people value how much money they can earn while some other people value their passion over other factors, so thinking about that might help eliminate some of the occupations or even add new ones!

I had the same experience in highschool, and while it was sometimes nice to know everyone, it was really hard to deal with never having any privacy and how much drama everyone created. I find when everyone knows you they're more likely to think its okay to get involved in your life in ways that aren't acceptable in the big city unless someone is actually your friend. I loved certain aspects of growing up in a small town, but I've definitely been happier and healthier since moving to the city. It was a big adjustment, but there's always fun things to do here, and you get to choose friends with the same interests as you that are healthy instead of just the people who are nearby. My mental health definitely improved when I came to the city and could surround myself with genuine kind people. As to getting lost, I know it seems like it would happen a lot, but now that we have phones its almost impossible. It can be really scary trying to navigate, but google maps has never steered me wrong. I don't have a car, but public transit is usually way better in big cities than in small towns, and there are transit apps for bus times that are really useful. If I'm ever anxious in a new part of the city or while transiting, I always make sure I have $20-30 extra dollars in case I get really lost and need to call a cab or an Uber. In a big city you're never alone and can always ask for help from the people around you if you do get lost or overwhelmed, people are usually happy to help. Hope this helps!

I have lived both in a city and a rural area so I know what they are both like :) Three things I like about living in a rural area. Living in a rural area usually means it is more quiet and that there is more privacy! I think this is nice because sometimes a city can be too loud and everyone knows what you are up to. It is a way better life for my dogs because there is so much space to free roam! Do you have a dog? I do! She is a Mexican mutt named Honey. There is more room to have a vegetable garden so you can grow your own food :) Two things I dont like. I don't like that it takes longer to drive to get groceries or see friends and family. I don't like this because it takes up a lot of time and money to pay for gas. It does get lonely some times because there isn't the hustle bustle of the city at your fingertips!

1047547291,1047541033,9/30/2021 8:54,42217,9," That's awesome you got caught up with school. Sorry I replied so late, it's been a busy last week of the semester. You wanted to start a conversation about if post-secondary is more challenging than I expected. I think post-secondary is a bit a bit more challenging than I expected but eventually it gets much easier. Post-secondary does have a lot more more homework, but there are fewer assignments. Classes have 3-4 large assignments, that are large 1000 word essays. I don't know if that's more than what you get. I also am in social work, where the instructors use projects rather than tests to grade us. The biggest part of this is using the rubrics, grading criteria, to complete assignments. There is a lot of reading text books and a lot of writing essays. But eventually you learn what to read and what to skip or skim over. The reading part becomes easier, and writing becomes easier with practice. It's very self-paced and it helps to use the writing-centres, wellness centre, and other student services to help with the homework. There's a lot of resources available if you search for them. During COVID all the school went online, which was very challenging for me, but other students like it. So my experience is probably different than other students. Do you have any other questions about how school is different than highschool? Or question about any specific aspect of post-secondary school? There are conversation choices we can choose from with specific topics. They have videos, or messages that we can talk about? Did you want to start any? I'll copy/paste the list below: Finding Inspiration Different Ways of Knowing From Rural to Urban Studying Well being &amp; Self Care Dis- and Misinformation Entering the Job Market Agency in the World Confronting Discrimination Career Considerations Post-Secondary Considerations Paying for school General Discussion"," 2021-12-02, 14:10:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

1047542659,1047541034,9/24/2021 21:51,42220,5," Hey!!! Idk how I missed your message sorr While I didn't grow up in a rural area necessarily, I did grow up in a small town so I totally understand where you're coming from! Moving to a city was an adjustment for sure, but the cool thing is you learn a lot (like using to learn how to take public transportation/navigate city bus routes.... virtually unheard of in my town hahah). And I found it increased my independence exponentially. Suddenly, I could walk everywhere and go where I wanted when I wanted because it was all so accessible. As for meeting people, don't be afraid to introduce yourself to literallyyyyy everyone you meet. Just a simple hello :) I will be completely transparent with you and say sometimes I found it harder to make friends in larger settings, and to that I would tell you to simply get specific with what you like to do and you will narrow down your group of people. For example, I love sports and my university had a group that was going to represent our school at the ""Kin Games"" which connected me with so many people that also love to play sports. Intramurals are great too! When you choose a university, look for a Facebook group of incoming students. For example, say you'd start at UBC in September 2022, search Facebook for ""UBC class of 2026"" the summer prior. Living on residence is also really great for meeting people and 1000% why I think go the traditional dorm-style route first year!!!!! It's so tempting to want to go straight to an apartment but I really thing the dorm experience is such a foundational aspect of creating relationships with people throughout your time at university. It's not always ideal sharing a room, or bathroom, or living spaces, but it's just so worth it in the end. You'll see that you create a different kind of connection with these people (: Anything else you're not feeling 100% about?? "," 2021-12-02, 15:35:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I'll have to get my barista friend to make it for me when I go to her place for christmas! I'm still trying to get my regular-ish baristas to recognise me haha. I'd love to be able to just rock up to a store and be known as a regular though. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what I want to do after university.

That living in the country is calm and living in a city is busy, everyone is in a rush in the city but in the country you can learn and understand culture in the bush. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? Yeah, because i live in Fort Nelson which is in the country but in the summer i usually go to Edmonton which is city and its totally different from country. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? It showed two different types of life styles and how it was like in rural and urban worlds. In what ways does your emotional response to the film match  or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling?

I am going through the same thing and it has been a struggle to learn how to study properly again and gain the motivation back that I had in my first year of university. Hopefully school remains in person for us both and we can continue working on that! I have found it helpful to study with friends (in a covid safe manner) since we can motivate and help each other! I am not sure if that is a feasible option for you, but if it is I would suggest giving it a try! That's super interesting you're thinking of going into the medical field! Don't be too discouraged about grades. You still have lots of time before reaching medical school and there are plenty of qualities they are looking for when hiring in the medical field :). Studying biology has been great at UBC. It was hard leaving my small town and living on my own in first year. On top of that, the course loads are much heavier at university. Although there were some initial struggles to adjust, I have made great friends and I love learning. In first year I wasn't very interested in the math and physics courses I had to take so I had to work very hard in those courses. However, now that I am in third year most of my classes are biology classes which I am super happy about and I really enjoy them. I'm happy to answer any questions about my experience studying biology! If there is anything else you'd like to know that I didn't cover in this message just let me know!

1047514156,1047541071,10/9/2020 17:42,40728,15," That's a good question! Honestly, I don't think I necessarily took scheduled study breaks. Usually my breaks would come when I was having a meal, in between classes if it was a short amount of time that I wouldn't have enough time to get into something, or at the end of the night. I was pretty bad for giving myself breaks, and even worse for feeling guilty when I took them. But of course, I shouldn't have and definitely allowing yourself breaks is a must for your own well-being! I wish I had a better answer but I was really too pre-occupied with getting good grades to cut myself some slack. One thing I always tried to do though is make sure I eat enough and I get a decent amount of sleep. But yeah, sorry I wish I had a better answer. I do think it's awesome that you are thinking of that because breaks are a must, whether it be to work out, watch a show, or even just chilling on the couch doing nothing for a little bit to give your brain the break it deserves. I'm not sure if you've heard of the Pomodoro method though? It's when you set a timer, for example 45 minutes, and you do as much as you can in that time. Then once that timer goes off, you take the next 10-15 minutes to just have a break, then set the timer again for 45 for work and you just keep cycling through. I know that's a pretty effective method for a lot of people. I've tried it a few times and it was really nice and it made me feel quite productive.

While it is nice to know everyone in town and have a relationship with your neighbours, it sometimes limits our hobbies and interests as there can be less resources. It is natural to be unsure about moving to the city, especially if a small town is all you have ever known. While change can be scary in my experience it typically results in new positive life experiences and allows us to grow as individuals. Why do you think you are craving a new identity when you move to the city? What aspects of yourself are you looking to improve by making this change? It looks like you are making great progress on this module! Please let me know if I can open another module for you or if you need any further instructions!

You're right -- it allows people to have a drive to accomplish something, and pushes them to be better. And totally okay if you haven't found your passion for school yet. It's a big decision, but you have time to change if you find out that it's not what you're into. My cousin is in marketing, and she loves her job. There's a whole lot of things you can do with it, and she's looking into traveling for it! As for me -- I had no idea what I wanted to be in high school and what I wanted to study. I considered sciences first -- I was really into neuroscience and astronomy, so I thought either of those had been neat. I realized in the second half of my grade 12 year that I really enjoyed political topics and I was pretty good at writing, so I thought why not? There wasn't anything that really pushed me towards it, but it felt like it fit. I have inspiration that has changed throughout school. I remember I was really inspired by finding women of colour who were excelling in their fields, especially when they were of Asian descent, and I realized that I just knew I really wanted to make a difference. I remember another really important thing for me was watching Emma Watson's speech for HeForShe. This is the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk I remember watching that at some point and being like ""this is what I want to do"". Of course I have doubts. Bad marks can ruin your week, and some can really transform what you think about what you're doing. It can be hard sometimes, but it's handy to find new inspiration to help you keep going. I'm in the same boat as you -- I am a perfectionist and I am really hard on myself sometimes. I was so driven by this need to not disappoint others and myself that it was easy to lose sight of what I wanted to do for myself. I go to therapy now when I need help in handling my emotions towards that, it can be tricky! It's okay to have some kind of pressure on yourself, but I hope you take breaks and remind yourself that it's okay to slow down and that it's okay to do things at your own pace. I was really bad at that in high school. I'd be glad to share more about pressures and stuff like that too if you wanted to know more. Mental health is really important to me! Have a look at the anchor text when you get a chance and tell me what you think. Have a good weekend and take care, Ava "," 2021-12-04, 13:08:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration
1047516309,1047549054,11/20/2020 16:41,46211,1," Hi Anoush, After watching the documentary, one idea I found interesting actually was mentioned right at the beginning of the video: ""everybody wants something."" Putting it into my own words, people don't do things by accident. There is purpose and intent behind others' actions. My thoughts and feelings that come up in response to this idea are those of agreement. I totally believe that everything everybody does is purposeful. Nobody wakes up in the morning and goes through the motions of their day by accident. Granted, certain things in life do happen by chance (e.g., finding five dollars on the ground, meeting the love of your life), but the actions that got you in those situatons happned because you wanted them to. I don't have any questions about this idea. I do believe it realates to my future because basically everything I do everyday is done purposefully to contribute to my future. I go to school, my job, and volunteer in order to get into graduate school and work toward my future career. Basically, my whole life is structured around working towards my future, so like the idea states, I want my future career, and everything I do is planned around that.

I'm currently in my 3rd year studying Computer Science at UBC. In my free time, besides studying job-related skills on my own, I like playing FPS games such as CS:GO and Valorant and following esports events. Recently, I take on walks in different areas in Vancouver and listen to audiobooks or podcasts since it reminds me of travelling and I also enjoy listening to people sharing their stories as well. I would like to know more about you! Since you mention you like playing Valorant, are you following the VCT in Berlin? If so, are there any players or teams that you cheering for?

I do currently work as a lab technician at LifeLabs and I do various volunteer work as well. I find that scheduling things using a calendar is really helpful. I tend to write everything I have going on for the month out including homework, work, and volunteering and I make sure that I communicate with all my different managers so they know what's going on. I think that as long as you communicate and express when you are busy or feeling overwhelmed or just need a break you will do fine. A couple of my friends worked at Mc Donalds and said that they were able to take a lot of time off for school so maybe that would be a good place to start since there is flexibility.

1047550296,1047549751,11/5/2021 16:54,46085,7," Hi Anna, Absolutely no worries! I was also a bit busy myself with final projects. But I'm really happy to hear that you won some prizes, congratulations! Time management is definitely hard and I also struggle with it sometimes. I find it helpful when I write out all my tasks in a planner or on a notepad on my laptop. It's just something visual so that I can see what kind of tasks I have ahead and what I can do to complete them in advance. It's always a satisfying feeling when I cross the tasks off ahead of schedule. Yes, your analogy to fitness training is a very good example of why you shouldn't cram. Your brain also works in a similar way. You can try to cram all that information in 24 hours, but you won't be able to retain all the information. A good way for you to prepare for bigger exams is to review your class material regularly. Sometimes it's easy to forget what you learned after taking small tests/quizzes. It's important to go back and review what you have learned before, so you won't be as overwhelmed for the big exam. Your strategy about writing questions for yourself is definitely a good strategy and is related to the active recall. I think creating a storyline for yourself on WWI might be helpful in helping you memorize the important events in chronological order. Good luck! Office hours are usually when a professor or a teaching assistant (TA) allows students to meet with them either in person or online to ask them any questions about class. Usually, there are held once a week at the same time, but you are allowed to ask them for an alternative time if your schedule doesn't work with theirs. Sometimes you can expect many students in office hours when it is close to final or midterm exams. Other times it is usually just one or two students. It is definitely much easier to ask questions if there are only a few students, so you don't have to wait around for your turn. Although, I know some students go without asking questions because they like to listen to other students' questions. It's definitely valuable to listen to what other students have questions about because you might not have thought about it yourself yet. Usually, I write down questions on the side when I am reviewing my lectures and notes. Sometimes I would have 5-6 questions prepared to ask, other times just 1-2. It really is up to you how you want to ask questions. I just feel more prepared when I have the questions ready so I don't make the TA or professor wait for me to think of a question. I try to go regularly so I don't have questions piled up till the end. I also ask them through email when I can't attend in person. Although it depends on how fast your professor or TA replies, sometimes it's better to just go in person. Hope that explains how office hours work a bit more! :) Have a great rest of your weekend!

I am a fourth-year student at Simon Fraser University studying a bachelor of arts in Health Sciences. I have taken a look at your profile and noticed you enjoy food and art! When I was in elementary school and high school I absolutely loved to draw random things such as cartoons, people, and objects like fruit. What are some things you like to draw? I also LOVE food, I enjoy cooking and baking as well! I found a recipe on TikTok called the strawberry tres leches cake! Here is a picture of it! I love it because it isn't super sweet (which is why I am addicted to it). The cake is also super moist because the cake is soaked in condensed milk! It is a super easy recipe and if you love strawberries I recommend you try it! What are some foods you like to make? I also noticed you like the show Euphoria! I have been meaning to watch that show but have not gotten around to it! Once I found out Zendaya was going to be in a tv show, I put it on my list! Maybe you can tell me a little bit more about the show! :) You mentioned you are confused about your career and what you want to do. I am in the same boat and can relate to this! I am also quite confused as it is difficult to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life. You and I can definitely discuss your career and hopefully, I can give you some tips on career exploration!

This quote is important to me because it reminds me that I do not have to have everything figured out! I just need to keep going :) Just remember, you do not have to have everything figured out by the time you attend university!

It sounds super cool, do you have any examples? Pursuing arts sounds like a super plan - there are so many things you could look into - lots of schools offer bachelor of arts programs, and also graphic design programs! The transition from high school to college is a crazy time, haha! I think there are 2 separate challenges - the first starts when you are still in high school and trying to figure out what the heck to do. I reccomend starting to think about this early, so when it comes time to apply you have a solid plan. It sounds like you have some ideas of what you are interested in and would like to pursue, so this is great! The second challenge - is adjusting to university life, which is hard to describe, but it is wonderful :) I had a unique experience, because I decided to go to a school in my hometown so I didn't get the experience of living on campus. I know from the experiences of my friends, living on campus really helps you become you! It was definitely a challenge for them at first, adjusting to the freedom, but they made so many new friends, got to experience a lot more events, and figured out how to fend for themselves. I think, before university its easy to see how its so much about 'school' but its about so much more too - extracurriculars, forming relationships, and becoming who you want to be!

1047551823,1047551612,11/29/2021 14:06,46788,5," Hi Soma, It is great to hear from you. It is so cool that you went and looked up my university. It's on a mountain with nice scenery. It gets really cold in the winter, but I have gotten used to it. Don't worry about university being big, when you find your passion and people who you connect with, it will not seem as intimidating. Thrifting has been such a trend lately. Many Youtubers have been making videos on it. A few of my favourite Youtubers thrift. I love listening to music and singing. I am so impressed that you play the guitar. I learned guitar during high school, but I wasn't very good at it. I hope you are finding other safe ways to socialize even with school and covid. I am studying educational psychology, which looks at how psychology concepts can be applied to how people learn. I remember you mentioned in your profile that you might be interested in studying fashion or art in university? It is good that you are in this mentoring program. We can start to think about your options for university. The process does not need to be rushed and there is no need to be scared if you don't know what you want to do right away. Once you start thinking about and reflecting on your interests, it will come to you. It is important to plan so that you have a sense of direction. University can be seen as harder than high school in terms of expectations for reading, writing and test taking. However, at university you have more freedom in what you study, who you meet and connect with and where you get experience in volunteering or work. The transition to university can be stressful if you are unprepared. Hopefully in this program you will be able to gain skills to cope with stress. For example, using effective study habits and self-care strategies. If you are interested in these topics, you can ask your teacher about them. Let me know when you are ready to move on. We can go to the next section called ""Working through this program"". It is a blue link at the bottom of the page. We will be go over how the program works and how to use this system.

Honestly, cause my parents always drive me to school by motorcycle in Vietnam (I'm Vietnamese by the way ??) It's not like the cool motorcycle image on the internet.

This module has been really interesting for me as I am typically not a sterotypical 'creative' person. I really like the idea that you chose from Mr. Arcand. My favorite idea in this module is from the first speaker, Mina Shum, speaking about intent. This really spoke to me because beyond inspiration or work put into art, there is intent behind every action or decision we make, whether this is something we are concious of it or not! My choice to go into healthcare work was definitely shadowed with the intent to help people and work to make the system as accessible and efficient as possible! I also really think that Ms. Pool's idea is important as in my opinion it is important to go out of your sphere of influence and knowledge, to push the bounds of your comfort zone. I suppose that overall in whatever I do, I try to find a medium between Ms. Pool and Mr. Arcand's ideas; playing to your strengths but being ready for unexpected to bring more interest into your life. Let me know if you have any questions about the module or my response; I'd love to hear what you think of what I said and if there are any connections in our thoughts you may identify. Also let me know which module you would like to start next :) -Brett "," 2021-12-08, 18:41:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I decided to do a Bachelor of arts in health sciences instead of a bachelor in science because I did not want a very science-intensive degree but still wanted to focus on health. So, this degree allowed me to avoid classes like physics and chemistry but I still got to learn about health :) I absolutely LOVE crepes and apple crisp! Warm apple crisp with some vanilla ice cream is the best! Euphoria sounds super interesting! I will definitely watch it! Currently, my favourite show is atypical, it's about a boy with autism and he is trying to make his way through high school and university while figuring out the difficulties of being a teen/ young adult.

I have a major procrastination problem. I usually try and get all of my assignments in on time but in high school we get a lot of practice questions and I always find myself saying "" I'll just do it at home,"" but that never works out in my favor because I don't exactly have the will power to do so. So I end up doing all the homework on the bus in the morning before it's due. Today's no different I got a Chem assignment that due in a day or two, and me being me I procrastinated till the last minute and now I'm about to do it on the bus, so I swear I don't procrastinate (sarcastic tone). I know this isn't very related at all but yesterday I went out and bought a car and I probably was supposed to do a bunch of research on what I sorta liked but I procrastinated and wound up only researching like an hour before we left to go pick it up. It's nice but I should've done way more research. My main question for you is do you feel down on yourself when you end up procrastinating when it leads to sub par results? How does it affect you mentally/physically? Could we also move over to the ""finding inspiration"" text in the next few conversations because I'm an artist and I'm kinda going through an artist's block right now and I don't really know how to deal with it.

1047550298,1047549745,11/5/2021 17:01,46110,1," The video really covers a lot of different ideas, but all are quite inspirational. Personally, the idea that I found most intriguing was by Denys Arcand, who talks about how something one experiences personally may be different from how another person, who is looking from the outside, sees it. From this, I thought that it was kind of hinting at the idea that something that may be inspirational to one person may not be for another. This is why when we try to find something that can truly inspire us, we shouldn't base it entirely on what another person finds inspirational. For example, I personally love playing soccer, and was even on a soccer team in high school. This is why if I saw a picture of a soccer ball, I would find it truly inspirational because it would bring back those memories and how I should continue to play what I enjoy. Yet if someone else, who doesn't play soccer, saw the same image, they may not find it all that inspirational, or even interesting at all. And this idea can even be applied to everything I do because it further enforces the idea that everyone should try to be themselves and find their own inspiration, be it a person or otherwise. What are your thoughts on this idea that inspiration is different for different people, William? And what other ideas did you find interesting from this short video?"," 2021-12-10, 02:07:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

School has been relatively easy so far with not a lot of studying. I'm not entirely sure about pot secondary school. I am incredibly passionate about working in law enforcement when I get older. Ideally, I would like to work my way up through the system, which often requires a few diplomas. I've been thinking about some classes in Law and justice and toxicology. I assume that police work and paramedics have a lot of similar responsibilities and similar mindsets. Currently I'm 16 and living in a cabin on my parents property next to the river. Recently I've been getting more into fitness and healthier lifestyles. No pressure to respond super fast if your busy, everything is pretty relaxed here right now.

I found it interesting how the one guy who couldn't play hockey anymore, still had inspiration to keep in the hockey industry. He just had to find another way to be involved I the sport he loves. Another Idea that I thought was cool was the one person who said they only do things they are experienced in. This is important in making sure what you are doing is true my authentic. Another person said that he believes that creation is always an accident.You still have to do a lot of planning but what is important isn't planned. I think it is important to stick to what you love doing because you have a greater chance at succeeding. I found concept interesting because I think a lot of people try and play their futures safe. I think a lot of people miss out on unique opportunities because they don't feel like what they are good at is enough. If someone is very invested in something they should stick with it because that's how one gets noticed. I have applied to some schools for marketing but that's not exactly what I'm interested in right now. It might be because I don't have much experience in it. Some things that I have thought about is design school because I have experience designing and creating. I'm not exactly sure what I will end up doing, but I hope I find something that I am passionate about because then I will be more driven to do well. Thank you for your responses.

But yea in a way it can be counterproductive because you can be doing something more useful/something else that is still productive in its own way (for example mental health break, working out, cleaning your room/house) instead of just forcing it.

Love that you are living in the cabin, that is a cool experience and gives you some independence that will build character for your policing career. Police and paramedics do share some similar mentalities and experiences, but we do approach 911 calls with a different lense. In the most basic form, cops assume everyone is lying and we assume everyone is telling the truth lol. My brother is a cop, and currently an instructor for the peace officer college. When you get hired on with law enforcement you are sent to a college for 4-6 months to train before hitting the road. If you are serious about policing I would recommend taking a criminal justice degree. Diplomas are a dime a dozen for policing. A degree will hold more weight. Additionally, the experience of taking 4 years of classes will only strengthen and mature your brain to improve your policing ability. The other benefit is a degree will keep more doors open. If you decide you want to do law school after being a cop, you would have a degree to apply, but could not apply with a diploma. Also, you could leap into a masters or even a PHD! My brother did a criminolgy degree at Laurier online! You could keep living in that cabin and get a degree! Although I would recommend moving away for post-secondary and gaining some life experience! Police forces really like to see diversity in life experience. It really allows cops to connect to the communities in a more profound way. As for fitness, I am on board with that! You cannot beat staying in shape, especially if you want to be a cop. You WILL get into fights and you will need to be strong with good endurance to survive the fight. It is no joke! Personally, I am hitting the gym 4-5 days a week, plus some yoga, mountain hunting, skiing, and mountain biking! So, why policing? "," 2021-12-11, 16:41:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Great question about how to stay organized! Since everyone has different preferences, I recommend you test out a few different platforms before settling on one. Google calendar is a great one if you know the dates to many future assignments, exams, or meetings etc. It's helpful in that it reminds you to start assignments early. I also use Notion as well, although I mainly use it as a to-do list and nothing fancy. For instance, you can assign a date to each task. You can then insert a calendar view below to see those tasks placed on the calendar. There are many templates available on Notion you can use. Try to search for Notion templates for school online. I find this one pretty cute: https://janicern.notion.site/janicern/your-student-dashboard-d54c2b26ad814497b072696a650fc54d. Although to be honest, I sometimes just prefer the notepad app on the laptop because it's simple. I find that Notion can get a bit too complicated. But to each their own, it's better to find what works best for you! If you are ready to move on to the next topic, let me know and I will select ""complete conversation"".

It is finals week in college now so I have been busy studying:( Although I am privileged to not have to stress too much about finance right now, it is inevitable to be concerned about whether the amount I will be earning in future jobs is sufficient to support me and my family. For sure salary is an aspect you have to take into account when you are considering post-secondary paths, so thats why researching is important because you can sort things out easier. I also suggest looking for a part-time job with the premise that the work schedule fits into your current schedule and does not interfere too much with your study. Although salary from a part-time job might not help a lot with finance, it is also an opportunity to meet new people which means you can learn from their experiences and perspectives too. Since you are still in grade 11, make good use of the time you have to explore more about yourself. It is only when you get to know yourself more that you discover what you are actually passionate about, and if what you are passionate about does not turn out to be one that meets what youre looking for in a future job (eg. cannot support you financially), make it into a hobby so you have something to fall back into whenever you are stressed/need a break from other duties!

I dont know alot about how universities work so forgive me if this is a stupid question, but would it be possible to get a degree in toxicoligy while also doing other classes for toxicology? If you know any thing about the E.R.T, please lemme know. - Thanks "," 2021-12-13, 12:24:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

1047541369,1047551624,9/17/2021 12:41,46777,11," Can you clarify if you are referring to the ERT for police? If so, you would not need a toxicology degree/courses to be on ERT. It is competitive process you would apply for and many things would come into consideration for the team, including fitness level, and performance on the department. I actually am a tactical paramedic instructor! Although I have never been involved personally as a paramedic on ERT. Your thought process for policing is spot in. It will be something different every day! I resonante with a lot of what you say in regards to that. lol...Have you ever seen the movie train spotting? If not, I would recommend it! The end monologue speaks to what you said. Great movie, caution though, lots of drugs, some scottish accents that are hard to understand, and some pretty intense scenes. But really nothing you haven't seen in video games like grand theft auto or call of duty lol In university, regardless of what degree you take there are always electrive allowing you an oppurtunity to explore differnent interests. I appreciate 4 years seems like a life time, but in the grand scheme of life its not that bad. Another path, is to take the 2 year police foundations course, work your way onto a police force or sheriffs department, and than while working get a degree if you wanted. Both me and my brother did that. The added benefit was our work place gave us money towards tuition! I barely paid for any of my degree :) So that is an alternative route. However, like I indicated before, police forces like to see someone with added life experience and really everyone and their cousin has a police foundations diploma.

Also, I am sure you will make some friends in your new area and you can perhaps spend the day outside doing activities with them! I also take part in a number of traditions as well such as Eid and Ramadan and doing so makes me feel very happy :) "," 2021-12-17, 00:06:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I think the difference is that when you study the land you are focused on understanding the importance of it. When you live on land and don't understand its history you don't have a strong connection with it. When I travel somewhere I like to research the place because it gives me more connections with the area. Knowing the history of land can make you feel more connected with the culture and the intentions of the people living there. Where I live, there is history that most people who live here know. Our town is revolves around a factory that most people who live here work for. It creates most of the jobs here so it plays an important role in our community. The only reason this town exists is because of this factory. It is important to understand your own community because it allows you to understand the importance of certain things that allow you to live there.

It's fun to find out that we both enjoy the beach and sports. Great connectin there. Getting to your questions, about my university experience. I had my undergraduate background in Agricultural Engineering as I am currently in a graduate program at University of British Columbia (UBC). My university days during undergraduate were one of the best days as far as I remember because the course opened me up to a lot of thinking and exploration about the environment. I had both classroom knowledge and field experience analysing different soil condtions, working on community water supply projects as well. Currently at UBC, the Land and Water Systems program have been nothing short of amazing! I've been blown away by the amount of resources I am opened to working with as an environmental professional. To simply put, the Land and Water program prepares you to be an expert in the two major resources (Land and Water) that affect agriculture or food production. A graduate from this program could go on to work in different positions such as environmental facility technician, soil consultant, land and water researcher, and sometimes a climate change professional. Thinking about your current academic class and seeing that you enjoy Maths, I think post-secondary degree related to Statistics, Applied Maths, Mathematical Finance, Civil or Electrical Engineering, may be good programs you could possibly go explore - just my little opinion. Lastly, I have a simple question for you, What does life currently feel like for you in your Grade 10 classes? I mean what happens in your day to day actvities at school? I'm glad to answer further questions before we move on from this current anchor text. I look forward to hearing from you soon Michael"," 2021-12-18, 01:41:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

1047541369,1047549748,9/17/2021 12:41,46106,17," Yes in terms of paying for school there are number of strategies you can take advantage of. #1, have a job and save money. Ideally, would want to save 25% of every pay check. This will keep money available for school! #2. Look at getting a student loan. they are interest free in BC so that is great! Even if you do not need the student loan, I would still take the money, open an Tax Free Savings Account, have the loan put into a GIC (gauranteed investment certificate) and you can make some extra money on the interest! Than once you have to pay the loan back, it is sitting in your TSFA plus the extra you made on interest!!! Alternatively, if you have a financial advisor, they can invest the money into low risk portfolio. Financial advisors can be found at the bank. #3. Look for scholarships and aim to apply to 20 of them before the end of the summer! This will be huge. #4. Explore all the options financial aide has at your post secondary school. They have access to bursarys and scholarships. Those are all great strategies in my opinion! "," 2021-12-18, 21:24:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration
1047541369,1047551624,9/17/2021 12:41,46777,17," I have to say I am very impressed with your writing and handle on language. This is an invaluable skill that will pay dividends in your bright future. In terms of ERT, my understanding is there are not necessarily pre-requisites, however it is a competitive process. So the better your resume the better chance you have! In the first responder world, I think the police is the best route in BC. If you were in other provinces I would probably vote paramedic to be honest! As it stands right now, BC Ambulance is a challenging place to work, hence why I would vote for policing. However, there has been drastic changes to the service this year and many more to come which may improve the career of being a paramedic in BC. Of course there is always fire fighting, but I do not think you would find the job rewarding. there are rarly fires to fight, and on medical calls I am the boss, they carry my bags, hold equipment and do CPR for me. I personally would not find that meaningful. However, they are paid the best of all first responders and do the least amount so if you want to make over 100K, sleep, eat, workout, and only work 7 days a month than firefighting is for you. For police and fire I would still highly recommend a degree program. With that being said, currently the RCMP is so desperate you could do police foundations diploma and get in there. The downside is they send you where they want lol so you could end up in a really remote area away from home. Also, I have not heard good things about that service. Another important point, policing does a very thorough back-ground check. For example, if you get audited on your taxes and had to pay a penalty, you would not be eligible for some police forces for a few years. So keep that in mind! If paramedic is something up your alley, you can complete the PCP program in under a year, and than immediately take the ACP program. If you are an ACP in BC, the world is your oyster and it is transferable across Canada. So if you ever wanted to move to Ontario or something that is an option. You could probably start that program while finishing up highschool I would think. Other jobs that are not office jobs would be trade work. Plumbing and electrical is fairly lucrative.

1047547831,1047541079,10/7/2021 10:46,46893,5," Hi Niel! :) Thank you for your reply! No needs to apologize for the delay, I know that this is a busy time in the school year! I am currently studying for my last final of my fall semester! Wow! Thank you for all the questions, I will answer them all to the best of my ability. I was wondering what kind of lifestyle you chose because I know that nursing can be expensive and tiring? Youre right! Nursing school is very tiring and expensive, but it is very rewarding. I think I live a fairly average lifestyle for a university student. I have a part-time job that I work 2-3 shifts a week at while I am in school and on days that I am not working at my job I am busy with school! It is sometimes a hard balance trying to manage many different roles, but it is doable. I think an important thing that needs to be priority in anyones lifestyle is their mental health. School can easily become overwhelming, and it is easy to neglect your mental health, but it is worth taking a break for studying or thinking a school for a few hours or even a few days if that means it is bettering your mental health. I also try to get together with friends once a week or once every few weeks because it is also important to maintain your social life and get out of the house. -What advice would you give me since Im going to move from urban life to rural life ? Did you mean to say a rural life (small town) to urban life (city)? If so, the transition is difficult at first just because it takes a little while to get use to just simply being in a place that is bigger. But it does become much easier. know for a lot of people transportation is an issue, so if that is a concern for you, I would recommend getting a bus pass (which is often offered by the college/university as a part your tuition) and learning the bus routes. However, if you have your own form of transportation, it is really not a limiting factor because google maps is easily accessible and can help you get anywhere around town. There are definitely many more opportunities presented being in a bigger place and many more things to do so that is a plus. -What should I really expect outside the school thing? I think when you are moving out and going to pose-secondary school is going to be a major thing that take up the majority of your time and what you think about most often. However, along with moving out and going to school there are additional responsibilities that you will have. I think expecting to learn how to budget your money is going to be very beneficial because school is expensive and it is exciting being on your own and having the ability to buy whatever you want, but I would just caution you as things cost a lot of money and it is easy to blow though a few hundred dollars in a day. Another thing is cooking meals independently for yourself now. I am not sure what your situation is like now, or if you already cook your own meals, but I found it beneficial to make weekly meal plans so I know exactly what I am going to have for supper every night. By doing that, it also makes it easier to save money because you wont be eating out for every meal. Living outside of home can be hard some days, and it is totally normal to become homesick. Having some family or friends to talk to about that really helps because a lot of others are probably feeling the same way. - What's it like to go to college and be separated from your family? Personally, I moved out of home when I was 17 so I have been separated from my family for quite awhile. I think I had a unique circumstance where I had not been living with my mom since I was 14 (due to parents divorcing) and my dad was always away working so I was used to being on my own already. I also moved out with my boyfriend, so I had an additional support system with me while in school. I think as long as you have a good relationship with your family and are able to rely on them as your support system the transition of being separated while in school is much easier. Also, college has big breaks such as Christmas break and reading break which you have 1-3 weeks off, so it makes it much easier to be able to go back home to visit family or for them to come up to see you. I think an important thing to remember though is that it may be hard to be separated from your family initially, but you are going to college to better your life/ work towards your career. - What was the inspiration you had when you were at your lowest? Wow, good question. School is tough and being independent with your life and finances and all the other things that adults have to do is hard. It is easy to fall into a cycle of doubt and insecurity and feeling like you are failing and just want to go back home. But what helped me get out of that mindset is remembering why I am doing this and how proud of myself I am. It is inspiring to see yourself succeed and beat all the negativity that you were facing whether it was internal or external. I know the life in which I wish to have so I know these are the steps that I need to take to get myself there. I do not want to speak on the experiences of others but it is still a constant battle for me to be my own inspiration and get the negativity and self-doubt out of my head. For some this is not something that just disappears instantly and then your good, sometimes it is an ongoing daily battle. But knowing you are not alone and that there is a light at the end of whatever tunnel you are in is what helps keeps me going. -Whats the day-to-day basis as a college student? I think the day to day as a college student is very dependent on the individual. I think my situation is unique because my courses are currently still online, so I have only 1 day a week of lectures which are held online, and I have one day a week where I do to the school for my lab and then I also am in clinical at the hospital so much weeks never look the same. However, if I look at how my schedule was before classes were online it was much more consistent. When creating your schedule, you are able to choose usually from a couple of options of when you would like to take your classes during the week. For example, you lets say you are taking a math class, you will have the options of doing to class Monday from 11-1, Wednesday from 9-11, or Thursday from 4-6. So, essentially you create your own school schedule for the semester. -How hard was it to do time management for everything? For me personally, I am not the best at time management because I am a BIG procrastinator. But I also write absolutely everything I have to do on my calendar so I can have a visual reminder of what I need to get done. I think creating a routine and making daily/weekly to-do lists for you may be beneficial as you can complete things in a priority order. Along with being full-time in school, I also have a part-time job and I am in a relationship which comes with its own struggles of balancing and time management. Having this added responsibility of having to being independent for your time management is hard at times but it is completely doable. Also, since you are in control of your schedule you are able to complete tasks as you see fit. I hope these answers helped you a little!

So right now, all I'm working to do is graduate high school. I am on the right track to doing so because I complete my homework, I volenteer, and I participate in class but besides that, I don't really know what I want to do after that. I have no idea what my future holds so I don't really know how to work up to it, or how to plan or accomplish my post secondary goals.

If you want to talk more about post-secondary goals and what your future may look like, I'd love to discuss that with you. There are some great conversation options""Post-secondary Considerations"" and ""Career Considerations""that explain some of the things that are important to consider when planning your future.

1047547291,1047549754,9/30/2021 8:54,46108,1," My apologies for starting this conversation, I was busying finishing my school work for the end of the semester and then became distracted with the winter break. I hope you're having a good holiday and getting a bit of a break from the school work. I'll start this conversation by answering the anchor questions, feel free to answer the questions as well, or just share your thoughts about how you study and what methods work well for you. What does it mean to study something? For me this means to spend time to learn about the class content outside of class time. What do you do when you study? This depends on the course, but normally I skim a text book and write notes, I'll ask myself questions and try to answer the questions as I skim the text book. This allows me to read faster and target my reading to what I think is important. What have you been previously taught about how to study? I have a tutor in college and they told me to follow the SQR4 method. This stands for ""Survey"" the textbook which is reading the headings and titles, then ask ""Questions"" about what you surveyed, and then ""read actively"" which is reading the text to answer the questions, and then ""respond"" which I do by writing notes. Here is a link if you are interested in learning more about SQR4 method: Reading Textbooks with SQ4R - Study Effectively - Guides at University of Guelph (uoguelph.ca) I enjoyed the video, it gave some tips and skills I didn't know about. Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? One I use often is the connecting abstract concepts to concrete examples. Often at the start of many classes an instructor will ask if anyone has any questions about the reading, most of the time the class is silent, I think because most people didn't read the text. But, if I did read the text book for the weeks class, I would try to ask the professor for an example to a concept I read about. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. Connecting abstract concepts to examples I find to be the most useful skill. It allows me remember the information. Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the case The strategy I would find most challening is switching, I find switching topics very challenging when I'm studying or doing homework. Normally I'll read a magazine or comic book inbetween study topics to get my eyes off the computer screen and shift my focus. Do you have any questions about these strategies? Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective?\ Strategies I would add to the list would be Study Groups. When I join a study group I am able to explain my understanding to others and this helps me remember what I am studying, I also get to listen and learn from other classsmates about concepts I might not understand. I think study groups are the most effective way for me to study. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? It's hard to be focused, especially for harder topics. What gets in the way is time and motivation. Honestly, many times I don't have the time or motivation to complete all the six habits, so understanding which skills work for me is important. I don't always write notes or recall my learning through practice tests, so I use the connecting ideas to examples skill instead. I definately see that the amount of time I spend studying reflected in my grade. So finding the best study method that works for you is very important. What is your favourite way to study?

I love nature and hiking but during the winter from November to about March I can't really do much because we get lots and lots of snow so I stick to snowboarding. I love the sky and views and take lots of pictures of it, they aren't high quality or professional and I've been saving to get either a newer phone with a good camera or a camera itself, haven't decided what one I want/ would benefit more from.

1047542659,1047552931,9/24/2021 21:51,47165,15," All valid concerns, so here's my two cents if you're open to hear it. Some things I didn't fully know or understand when getting my degree: 1) scholarships/bursaries! there are so so so many opportunities to get a little extra funding to partially or fully cover your schooling! Whether through your school or outside, it'll take a bit of time and research to find ones you feel you are a good candidate for but it absolutely pays off. 2) you can do a bachelors degree in four years (maybe even a little less if you take extra credits in the summer) or you can complete it over several years. the pace is actually totally up to you. the only difference may be whether you're considered a full time student or a part time student. At VIU, to be classified as a full time student, you need to be registered in 3 courses or 9 credits per semester i believe. You can take anywhere from 3 to 6 courses a semester (depending on the number of credits) to be considered full time. Part time is anything less than that. 3) same thing with masters degrees, there are tons of funding opportunities out there! if it's something you truly want to do, there are resources to assist you. and the sooner you know what you want to do (check!!), the more time you have to find and access them 4) With masters programs, i was surprised to find out that very few require a specific degree versus prerequisties. For example, physio programs in Canada don't specify what degree you need to have.. most state that you need a bachelors degree in general and then X credits in anatomy, physiology, statistics, psychology, etc. While a science degree would be a little more diverse in what you can do beyond your undergraduate studies, a kinesiology degree can be extremely flexible as well :) "," 2022-01-07, 20:52:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Scientific knowledge is usually viewed as something that is better than Traditional knowledge,Which isnt entirely true.Traditional Knowledge is very useful and can be very advanced because it has been passed down from many generations and verified by many elders. In my culture, (Im Dene first nations) any traditional knowledge of the land is only passed down by elders, so its more factual. I think the view of scientific knowledge being better is changing as archeologists and scientists are realizing that the people who once lived on the land know all of the secrets and things about the land. If people started to listen to the stories about the land they would have a lot of help doing whatever investigation theyre trying to do. Q2: Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor Where I live, It gets extremely cold. Last week it was -50. There are many stories about people casually walking across the town in this cold and simply just dying on the sidewalk.

Apparently it happens every year or two, there's actually a grave down the street from my house from where someone literally just dropped dead from walking to the store in -45.

During these times I hope you and your family are safe and healthy! Here is some questions my teacher wanted me to answer and send to you. What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? The difference between studying the land and living on it is the information you gather. From studying the land you can learn why things are, how they have evolved, and how they will evolve. Whereas living on the land gives you some sort of connection to the land. You can learn all the ins and outs of the land. You can learn first hand how things could impact the land or the people living on it. It also can change your perspective, when studying the land you see it as a subject of interest, something you conduct experiments on and gather information on. When living on the land you feel connected, in-touch, and you see it as you're home. Somewhere you want to learn about, and want to help. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? Like I had mentioned before, perspective is very important when it comes to how we treat things. Living on a land I don't know about I don't stop to appreciate the little things, I don't feel connected, and I do not consider it my home. I might not take care of the land as one might their home. However, if I had learned about this land I would feel as if it were my own, I would notice little things and consider them precious. I would do my best to treat it with dignity and respect, and I would make sure others do as well. I hope you enjoy my answers and I hope you are able to connect with them. :) Have a good day and I look forward to hearing from you.

Share one of these stories with your mentor In Fort Nelson the weather has been some of the coldest I have ever experienced. It has been constantly -30 or worse which is not normal, in the summer we had a heat wave. It was so bad I had to sleep in my camper because it had air conditioning to keep me cold. During that heat wave the town was in chaos. All of the fans in town were sold out and any form of air conditioning was nowhere to be found. It was something that I had never experienced before and it was interesting to see how people reacted to all of the fans being sold out. Logan Penney What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? The difference is when you live on the land you know whats really going on, you know the hardships of living on the land and you have first hand experience with it. When you study it all the information that you see might not be accurate and you can't really understand what happens because you dont have first hand experience.

Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor No, I do not.

Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Yes and no. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledges working together? it could work by comparing the tales of the peole of long ago with the scientific knowledge.

1047548854,1047549414,10/16/2021 14:52,45456,3," Hey Shianne, Super interesting observations about scientific and traditional knowledge. I definitely see the shift that you bring up happening in the sciences here at UBC. There is a very prominent focus on Indigenous stewardship of the land and discussions of the usage of unceded territories, especially in the forestry and Land and Food Systems programs here on the coast. In the intro biology and environmental biology classes I've taken, there are modules where we discuss the traditional names and Indigenous uses of the various coastal plants that grow in this area, and there is also a focus on how land has been used and how Indigenous perspectives can teach us to better care for and steward the land that is so impacted by climate change. I think that a balance between the two forms of knowledge can only be beneficial for everyone. Here where I live in Vancouver, I'm living on traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the x?m??k??y??m (Musqueam) People, and am adjacent to unceded ancestral Coast Salish and Tsleil-Waututh territory as well. Acknowledging and understanding that the land I live on has a history separate from and much older than ""Canada"" as it is defined is very important, in my opinion, and I'm looking forward to learning more about the peoples who originally lived and continue to live here. That story about people freezing to death is intense, that must be somewhat scary conditions to live in, especially considering how cold it has been lately. I don't know any good stories about my area, scary or otherwise, but I hope everyone where you live is doing their best to stay warm and safe. And if you'd like to share any specific experiences about what its like being Dene first nations, I'd be really interested to talk more about how that has impacted you growing up and your identity, but no pressure at all!

In the program I'm in at University I have been fortunate enough to be presented with some lectures that featured Syilx storytellers. The Syilx are the First Nations peoples on whose traditional territory I live. This is one of the first Syilx stories that I read that was in a book that was gifted to us through the program (I'm going to try to remember how to send a picture).

I thought the video was really interesting- I liked the contrast between between Mina and Roch, where Mina is saying that everything needs to start with a plan, while Roch adds that creation is always an accident. Neither one is wrong; you can always start with a plan, work really hard at it, but sometimes something unexpected happens that leads to a whole new different plan or way of doing things. For me, choosing a career was kind of like that! I had a plan throughout university, worked hard towards a goal, but ultimately fell short. Instead I ended up in Pharmacy- which I'm really enjoying- and I think I'm enjoying it more than what I originally thought I wanted to do. Maybe not as creative of an example, but unfortunately I'm not much of an artist... What about you? Did you agree/disagree with what was said in the video? Did anything stand out in particular?

Ive been pretty busy with both my school work and after school activities, my mom is pretty scary so when I get home I always have lots to do. Christmas this year has been pretty fun for me. The town I live in Prince Rupert almost never snows but this year was very different for once we had a snowfall it was crazy. We had so much snow it blew my mind. When the snow was dying down I went Christmas shopping with my younger cousin, I wanted to make sure to get gifts for everyone so I even got my girlfriend to help me find something for her parents. How was your Christmas? Some hobbies and interesting facts about me would include, I enjoy playing sports like badminton, soccer and softball, I have a French bull dog named Daisy she's white with black spots, I'm indigenous and my native background is from an island called Haida Gwaii, and my favourite subject in school is biology. Recently do to COVID I haven't been able to play the sports I love thankfully I've been able to go to the gym where I can play badminton, a few years ago we had 2 people who've played in the Olympic and they helped teach me and my partner. Ive been playing badminton since I was in grade 2 as for softball I've played for 5 years but the past 2 seasons have been canceled thanks to COVID. I have 2 sisters both older then me one is a nurse who moved out her name is Stacey and the other a pharmacist named Calli. I wouldn't quite call you a boomer yet my sister Stacey is older then you and I would classify her as a boomer. I think its amazing that you're a scientist ive always wanted to be one but my grades aren't exactly the best so I've been thinking about specializing into a specific science related job. How long did you have be in school to become one? The transition from Iran to Canada must of been very difficult. I was born a raised here so I couldn't imagine what it was like.

1047547951,1047548884,10/9/2021 13:57,45453,1," After reading through the anchor text and watching the provided video I must say that there is a heavy difference between simply studying the land and living on it. Living on the land lets you experience the things that happen on and in the lands while simply studying it can give you some misleading information depending on what and how you're studying stuff. Also, knowing the stories of the lands you live on can drastically change how you live on them, knowing stories about locations people died or traditional grounds can make people avoid them or draw people closer to them. Personally I dont know any stories about the land I live on at all, ive never really payed any attention to them, and if I did I no longer remember them. Now, Scientific knowledge being seen as superior to Traditional knowledge is extremely untrue where I live as around every corner you can always hear about someone who doesnt believe in these new vaccines for covid-19 and its variants, some dont even believe that the virus exists at all!, though slowly there is a change happening that probably wont make a huge impact on anything around here, but will most certainly make things just a bit better Finally to end this off ill say that Scientific knowledge and Traditional knowledge are probably seen as in conflict most of the time as they really do seem quite opposing, the biggest thing I know of this are the native creation stories, such as the sky woman who fell down from the sky islands through a hole and started a new life on the back of a turtle From scientific knowledge that should be absolutely impossible, but other than the video on the Hauyat, I havent seen any time where Scientific and Traditional knowledge worked together.

However, in terms of possible ideas, you could make a video highlighting the benefits of mountain biking along with clips of yourself on the trails.

If you provide me with the criteria of the capstone I can help you further, and we can continue to brainstorm after we have completed the rest of this program.

And then after the lecture, going back and solidifying anything you didn't understand and taking notes or completing any homework assinged. In college, your lectures (the time your instructor tecahes) is less of them teaching the entire course, but more pointing out the main points and expectring you to fill in the gaps.

1047547951,1047548884,10/9/2021 13:57,45453,3," I do agree with you that living on the land allows you to experience the things that happen on the land. I guess that creates an emotional connection that force you to view things from a more personal perspective. When studying the land, you are most likely getting information from other people and viewing the land from a more objective, outside perspective, so it is very important to decide whether the source is credible such that we won't be misled. But does that mean if you live on the land, every piece of knowledge you gain from your own experience must be more trustworthy? For example, there are many things we can't really experience ourselves, and must rely on other people like scientists to tell us, just like the existence of bacteria or the virus. We know there is something that can make us sick when we actually get sick, but to know that the thing that makes us sick is a new virus, we are relying on other people's discovery.

While there are some people who disregard scientific knowledge like the antivaxxers, the majority believes in scientific knowledge more than traditional knowledge. Interestingly, since I am studying subjects related to biology and medicine, I actually learned that a lot of medicine developed in the last century are actually inspired by traditional medicinal knowledge! For example, cinchona has been used to treat malaria for centuries and their usage is spread across the globe. Even though there are no formal experiments testing it, people still use it without fully understanding what chemicals are in cinchona. Turns out it is a chemical called quinine that cures malaria, and the traditional medicine is not just a placebo! While traditional knowledge is not properly proven in a laboratory, I think we can still take them as inspirations for future experimental ideas.

1047550340,1047549770,11/7/2021 1:30,46105,3," Hi Rhea, as I was watching the video and reading, I kept thinking to where my family goes back, there is a place that makes up the fabric of ourselves. In Europe, there is a midieval town in Estonia called Tallinn, even though it's not the raw land and nature of the area, I understand the history within every brick and stone that was laid by hand to make this village, and utilizing the deep forests around it. I also totally understand how having places within you makes you feel more connected to them. When I visited where my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents are from, I didn't want to leave! For one of the questions it says to recall a story of the land where you live, I can't rememer any at the moment but It made me think of northern Finland. There are the Sami people that were first in northern Finland, they herd reindeer and care for them, and that's all they care about. There are beautiful landscapes, lakes and islands, auroras, and deep forests. The Sami people take care of their land, using it to hunt and gather, and herding reindeer or a living. There is something sacred about being alone with nature and the natural resources provided. I think that is the traditional way for them to think and do their resposibilities in a way that makes sense for them. I found this village of Hauyat very interesting and I haven't heard of it before. I enjoy imagining of what is underneath of you, how many people have stood in the same spot, seen the same things over hundreds of years, it's hard to conceptualize. There is a certain respect in knowing how the land beneath you was treated for thousands of years. I tried to answer some of the questions, I hope it's clear enough :) "," 2022-01-12, 14:18:",Mentee,Posts in Ways of Knowing

What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? Simply living on the land is what I think I'm doing right now. For example, I live in the city that I am at but I'm not very invested in it. It is simply a location that I reside in. On the other hand, studying the land means I know beyond the external image. I know information that can only be gathered after looking for it. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor I love folklore and stories; however, I don't have any for where I live. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? I think it would allow us to respect our surroundings more when we look deeper. Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I do think so. My mom is super into traditional medicine and I've always viewed it as dubious when compared to ""scientific"" medicine. I don't know if it's changing or not because I do know it's prevalent amongst some older generations. Basically, from the traditional medicine I've had, I think it can relieve some light symptoms but it wouldn't be as potent as ""created"" medicine.

1047490352,1047541073,1/24/2019 19:28,40641,3," Id say probably yes in general its more expensive to live in a city but Im no expert. I think it depends how remote of a town youre comparing it to. Because super remote towns can be pretty expensive too with getting fresh groceries and stuff. I think in cities youre more tempted to eat out because theres so many cool restaurants to try, and to pay for activities and stuff. Housing cost is definitely more. As for having a car it depends on what you do day to day! Transit is usually MUCH better in cities which is great so youre not driving the car thats sitting in traffic and busses move through traffic pretty quickly. Train is even better. That being said how easy it is to get around on transit depends on where you live, even in a city. Have you spent any time in Vancouver/the lower mainland? I also like the quiet of smaller towns. I like that its so much easier to access nature and when you do is so much more pleasant when there arent crowds of people there too. Online shopping/delivery has improved so much lately that its pretty good (except for when theres weather catastrophes...). I kind of like just going to the big city once in while for necessary shopping and not having it all at your fingertips all the time - another reason why one might spend more money in the city!

1047551506,1047551395,11/18/2021 16:22,46509,15," Happy New Year! My break was awesome! On my forst day off I headed up to Whistler with a few friends. We rented out an Airbnb and snowboarded for a couple of days. The weather was great so I was able to practice in good conditions. It was my 3rd time snowboarding so Im still trying to learn how to use my lead foot to navigate. I then headed to Abbotsford to hang out with my family. It wasnt snowing the day I travelled so the drive was smooth. It was nice to spend time with my family and not worry about studying. Played a bunch of card games and whooped my cousin in FIFA (ps4). Now I am back at VGH during my internal medicine block. I am in a new clinic each day. I spent a few days in the Pain and Symptom Clinic which cares for people with terminal illnesses (various types of cancers). Heading into the rotation I thought it would be depressing because these people will pass away with their condition. To my surprise, most of the patients were in good spirits! The visits were focused on making sure that their pain and symptoms were manageable. This includes prescribing opioids such as hydromorphone and laxatives to help with constipation. The doctors were also very nice so I have been enjoying the rotation. I am looking forward to tomorrows clinic which is a cardiology care centre. Lol, but I am not down for my dermatology rotation next week I am not a fan of skin conditions. Cardioverting arising in many different conditions. There will be emergencies where things feel tense and you are not sure if the patient will live. Thankfully, I was part of a chill situation for my first time. A man came to the emergency department because he had some chest pain. We did an ECG and noticed that his heart was beating funny. He had a condition called atrial fibrillation. This condition can be fatal so we had to shock his heat back into the proper rhythm. Looking at the dude, you would not think there was anything wrong. He was calm and pretty relaxed. We gave him some anesthetics and put the pads onto his chest. From that point on its pretty simple. You wait until the machine is charged and the patient is asleep or extremely drowsy. I then pushed a button and the machine did the rest. It was pretty wild because he whole body spazzed out. His heart went back into normal rhythm and he walked out of the hospital 45 minutes later. I imagine that it is pretty stressful/nerve wracking to figure out the bachelor degree. Have you talked to anyone about it? Do you have specific questions? If you would like, I can take a look at it if you send me the link. Oh man! Prince Rupert is pretty far up North! I bet that it would be pretty cool to spend some time there. Have you ever been to Prince Rupert or know anyone from there? What are some things that excite you about Prince Rupert? Seems like you have a good plan going.

Then, I would appreciate if you can read through the ""working through this program"" section so you are aware of what this program looks like.

In January the temperature averaged roughly in the high -20s and the low-30s but towards the end we got hit with a rough few days where it was -40 or worse. In February temperatures started to rise averaging the same weather as January for the first bit but towards the end it got up to above 0 and snow started to melt. March is when the first signs of summer were shown, it began to get above +10 and there was very little snow after March. April was the exact same as March in the +10s no higher no lower but the snow melted. In May however temperatures started to sky rocket for the better, reaching over+30 around the middle of the month and maintaining nice warm weather for the whole month. June and July werw both the samw weather, both having +20s to +30s weather throughout the month and nothing too special. August is when the weather spiked, it was the highest all year at over +40 for the majority of the month. In September and Ocotber the weather started to go way down, going from over + 40 to + 10 by the end of October.

Recently I've been pushing myself to get in better shape so I can make this a reality. I'm not that concerned about background checks, but I admit that I don't know what being audited for taxes means, so maybe i'm not all good lol.

In life though we strive off goals you see the rich and famous they have many goals they wish to acomplish. theres the people that can put their head down and work on thier goal if they know they can make it and theres the people who have no goals now im not saying the people who dont have golas early on in life arent goin places your life could change at any time at any time you could lose your home if your very unlucky or some days if your extreamly lucy you could win the money to buy more homes that you know what to do with. But people can decide their fate ususally if they try hard enought and look both ways when they cross the road. basicaly most of your future and your life is based on the fact of a goal that you had and how hard you tried to get there you control your life and thats about it ," 2022-01-13, 13:53:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I loved how she talked about your book being your friend, because whenever I read I always feel connected to the characters and story. Right now I'm reading The Song of Achilles, and I love the characters so much they really do feel like my friends. l also liked when Mina Shum talked about how everything we do we do with an intention. It made me think back to decisions and things I've said or done.

As for your question, to be honest, it was really interesting and outstanding for me to see people recognize and acknowledge the land where we live. In Korea, we don't have any concepts of indigenous cultures and history. That's why it is really meaningful to learn more about indigenous perspectives. For sure, not only learning indigenous perspectives but also listening to just diverse stories from people coming from different regions can help me understand them and their cultures. Thus, I really love reading your story which sounds really cozy and exciting!

It seems like your view aligns more with Mina Shum and her idea that life is based on intention and working towards goals. I thought it was interesting that Roch Carrier had almost the opposite view where ""creation is an accident"". I think it's good to have a balance of these ideas - like you mentioned, sometimes circumstances out of our control are able to have a huge impact on our life, whether it's positive or negative. I think being grateful for the circumstances that allow you to focus on your goals in combination with a strong work ethic is important. "," 2022-01-14, 09:18:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Science has always been my favourite subject but when I got into high school I realized I was able to take all sorts of science classes. As soon as I got into grade 11 I tried to take as many as I could this year I'm taking biology, chemistry and physics. I've already taken and passed biology, after my current classes ill be taking chemistry and I'm very excited. Recently in my careers class I think ive decided I want to be a paramedic and a fire fighter as both of those jobs connect. I've been talking with my tutor Megan and her boyfriend works for the hospital in many town and thanks to her I'm able to volunteer at the next health clinic and meet and talk to paramedics I'm very excited. When I got onto this website and realized you have a biology degree I was excited so I may ask you a question now and then. I was wondering how long you had to be in school or you biology major? And what was the hardest assignment you had to do. I agree im hoping we'll be able to get as much stuff done. Currently im not sure if you were told anything about this but in my careers class i have a project worth 50% of my grade called the Capstone project im a little bit behind on it but ive been slowly progressing in it. The subject my capstone is on is steps/how to become a paramedic. The topic I'd like to choose is 2) entering the job market I think i have experience in this topic because ive had a job at one of the grocery stores here for over a year.

I highly recommend looking into post secondary and taking classes that just sound interesting even if you don't have a career picked out yet, you never know where it will lead you.

First off: How do you go about studying currently? Do you think there are any certain techniques/strategies that you learned about that you think you might try out? Why do you think this strategy works well? If this helps, I'll tell you what I do. I've tried to do the ""Pomodoro Technique"" before, and have found that usually doesn't work for me. I try to go by tasks rather than by time. So if I have three things to do, I'd finish each task, and take a break between each. I take longer breaks if I notice that I worked for a longer period of time. If you aren't sure about the strategy that does and doesn't work, I'd highly recommend giving some new techniques a try. It makes it much easier to learn if you know how you study best. If you can figure out a solid study strategy and you choose to attend university, you'll have a much easier time.

Welcome to Finding Inspiration, so in this section there's a little video for us to watch that touches on how different people can get inspred and then afterwards we can chat about and each share some ideas from the clip. Right when i started watching the video (maybe it stood out becuase it was so close to the begining haha) but I thought it was super interesting when the first women said ""everyone wants something and because of that there's always going to be conflict"", i just thought that that was an interesing, kinda dark view on what fuels us but I liked it! I for sure think that a lot of much actions are probably driven by wanting. Another thing she said (the first quote written above) is that you always have intention for what youre doing, so if you're sitting down to paint something, there's a reason why you're there trying to paint something - i thought that was interesting too because, as i said before, i comepltely agree that there's usually a want or desire behind why we do. Its cool to think back on decsions I've made and try and figure out exactly why i made them but it's usually because i wanted something thats for sure - let me know if you relate to this at all or not!

You have to work hard but in the process, something happens and this is the essence of creation. Its something that you cannot plan. You have to do a lot of planning but what is important is not planned. I related to this idea a lot because I like to think that the best things come from the places you would never expect and you can't force things, they just have to fall into place. I think that when it comes time to ""figure out what you want to do with your life"" people tend to try and move so fast and force things that might not be meant ot be, but beautiful things will happen when you just work hard, you'll always get somewhere. Hopefully in my futre I try to keep this in mind because letiing things fall into place is always the best way to go. "," 2022-01-17, 18:50:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

10161,1047541041,1/10/2017 17:16,40639,3," Hi Madia I hope you're doing well. Here is my response to this section. Before Videos: What does it mean to study something? It means to practice and perfect a new skill or lesson to prepare for a test etc. What do you do when you study? I take good notes, make flash cards, do practice quizzes and pre read the next days lesson. What have you been previously taught about how to study? I have been taught to study on short bursts to keep my brain fresh and reduce fatigue. After Videos: Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? I have used the ask, explain and connect method while reading a textbook. I also try and integrate both colourful words and pictures into my notes because it makes my notes easier to read. I write down clear examples in class to help me with my homework. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain. No cramming seems like the one I should pay most attention to because I like ti procrastinate. Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the case? No cramming would be the most challenging because it's the one that I struggle with the most. Do you have any questions about these strategies? Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? I would add pre reading because it introduces you to tomorrow's work and let's you process it overnight. By pre reading the next days work it makes it easier to understand. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? I think I will try most of them, but my procrastinating might get in the way of the no cramming. I am a pretty good student, but lately I have been struggling with applying myself to my school work. I think I need to utilize my day planner more often to help me organize my time for studying and to make a check list so I feel motivated. Thanks so much Madia!

The answer is yes, when I was younger my grandma used to like to take me on adventures and explore places. When I was younger I didnt appreciate the places as much as I do now. Since I have grown up I have learned more about the places I have visited. One place I particularly remember, there were huge trees, and I remember thinking when I was young how amazing they were. Now I've learned that those trees were actually super super old, and my grandma had visited them lots when she was younger. After I had learned that when I visit them now I feel more connected to them and I often wonder what they have lived through.

It can definitely be super challenging to know how to embrace different parts fo your identity, especially if they carry any kind of trauma or discrimination. I am white so I don't have that kind of shared experience and can't speak to the struggles it must create, but my grandparents are both Yiddish Holocaust survivors and I have the option to identify as and think of myself as Jewish. I don't, mostly because I'm personally not religious, but integrating and exploring that cultural heritage, trauma, and the risk of antisemetism (hatred of Jewish people) has been a central theme in my own identity. I think its so important to embrace those cultural roots and explore traditions that you have a blood connection to, and the fact that you've taken it a step further to raise awareness about MMIW is something I think you should be very proud of. It can be hard to stand strong in your beliefs in the face of discrimination from peers, but I hope that the attitudes of the people around you have changed and that you can embody the pride for your ancestry.

1047547831,1047541079,10/7/2021 10:46,46893,17," Hi Niel, Are you meaning you cannot move your leg muscle directly after sugery was completed? Or can you still not move your leg muscle now from the surgery? I would assume you could not move your leg following the surgey because the surgeon would have had to remove part of your femur and replace it to fill where the tumor was growing. This leaves your femur very fragile and vulnerable to damage therefore you would need to withstand weight and excessive movement of the leg for awhile. Did you recieve an epidural for pain while in the hospital? That would be another reason why you would not be able to move your legs because and epidural essentially numbs you from the waist down. Doctors will typically use hydromorphone over morphine because it has a greater therapeutic effect with a smaller dose compared to morphine. That being said, being able to take a smaller dose with having the same therapeutic effects lessen the chances of negative side effects on the body, so I guess you could say hydromorphone is ""safer"" than morphine. However, they are both narcotics and you can become easily addicted to both. It depends on the dosage you have of hydromorphone as well as what route the medication is being administered but typically if taken orally, it will have a therapeutic effect for about 6 hours. I hope these answers helped :) "," 2022-01-18, 15:43:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

My artistic side leans more toward music. What do you think of the quote by Lea Pool, ""Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life""? Personally, I believe that what she is saying is that not knowing keeps you in the dark about things, and the more you know and grow your knowledge of the world and grow skills the more you can appreciate things of life. For example, I play a few instruments and I notice that people who do not play instruments do not appreciate the complexity, hard work, and dedication of musicians in the same way I do.

1047550296,1047549751,11/5/2021 16:54,46085,1," Hi Anna, The conversation of respecting different ways of knowing and the risk of getting stuck in only one way of understanding is very relevant for someone who is currently residing on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Musqueam people. This means that the land was never given up by the Musqueam people and I am a mere settler on their land. We often hear the land acknowledgment first thing in presentations, however is not further explored beyond the statement. In my first and second year of university, my knowledge of the Indigenous community felt reduced to the short land acknowledgement. I'll admit that I could've taken more initiative to learn more but I was generally not aware and none of my peers really knew much either. There is a significant difference between truly acknowledging the land by understanding the values and struggles of the Indigenous community compared to simply knowing that we are on their land. It's important to try and broaden our understanding when the information provided to us is limited. However, it is also crucial to note that we will never be able to fully understand the perspective of the Indigenous community, as we all come from different backgrounds. This relates to the first question of the difference between studying the land and living on the land. When we study the land, we look at things from a third-person perspective and play the role of an observer or a spectator. However, the Indigenous people that have lived on the land have rich historical, traditional, and cultural knowledge that has been passed down to them for generations. They possess scientific and innovative knowledge that we might not fully understand. Nonetheless, this does not give us the right to determine what is right or wrong and their way of knowing should be respected. This is exemplified in current Western medicine as they integrate the learning of Indigenous medicine instead of outright rejecting their traditional practices. There are ways to introduce different properties of cultural practice to create inclusivity in healthcare. I believe that all cultural knowledge should be respected equally because they provide comfort to people from different backgrounds. Let me know what you think and feel free to answer the guiding questions on the top. Don't hesitate to ask any questions. Cheers, Christine "," 2022-01-20, 20:49:",Mentor,Posts in Ways of Knowing

I completely understand that you were away for good reasons as I was informed by the eMentoring staff about your absence. As I have said earlier on, I think a degree related to environmental sciences, environmental resources sustainability may be a good fit for you considering your current educational background. Just my little opinion. For the football thing, actually, it wasn't much of a big deal for me at all. Hence, I can't consider it challenging so to say. As a matter of fact, looking back, I can't remember having any struggles because I replaced it with phone games and indoor games like Table tennis, Monopoly... Let me know if you have any final questions about our introduction before we proceed through other conversations. Cheers Michael "," 2022-01-21, 02:03:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

1047551508,1047551396,11/18/2021 16:28,46505,13," Hello Sahar Next week ill be presenting my capstone I'm excited to get it done and over with but I still have to finish and i'm not looking forward to that. Thankfully my tutor has helped me come up with a plan on what to do and how many slides I want. I honestly don't know how or why I got interested in science but out of all my classes it was the most interesting, I think theres like 4 other people in my grade that also like science. I'm ready for the ""entering the job market"" I'm hoping we can get this topic done. I'll try to respond faster but since I have one week left of my classes I have a lot of work to do. Thank you for answering my questions. Before i choosing to become a paramedic i was thinking of other science related jobs and one of them was getting a degree in biology and trying to become a biologist or something like that. I think its really awesome that you managed to survive that many years in school especially with such a difficult subject. It's to see how long you were in school, I was looking at different paramedic programs and schools and they all varied in length. I think i saw one program going for 2 and then I saw another going for over 2 years. Chemistry for me has always been one of the subjects i had absolutely no clue what to do but I'm taking chemistry 11 and 12 for my next classes so hopefully ill be able to get at least a B in those classes. Since I'm almost done my grade 12 year I'd like to ask another question. Do you have any advice for college or if i should take a gap year or not? My parents don't want me to take a gap year however almost everyone i know is taking one, and getting a job to get money then going to school after a year sounds pretty good to me. For an actual career ive been thinking of multiple things but after thinking a lot becoming a paramedic sounds perfect for me, I've also been thinking of becoming a fire fighter as those two jobs go perfectly together and ill get paid even more. My teacher told me that we're starting it and she seemed pretty happy thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond. I hope these past few days have good to you, and i hope you have a good weekend."," 2022-01-21, 09:45:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I encourage you to try it sometime! I can be a bit difficult in the beginning, but it is not hard to control your speed. Every rotation has been great. In this case I did not put the pads on the patient. I was busy and joined the team when they were already set up. The pad placement is depicted on a diagram so it is pretty straight forward. How did your physio shadowing go? Is there a reason you do not want to do that anymore? Thats cool that you had a chance to see both in-patient and out-patient. I did not get a chance until I was in medical school. How did you get that opportunity? What did you see and/or do? Shoot! It is unfortunate that you will not get a chance to study microbio and disease control until your later years. Its a tough subject to study, but very interesting! Maybe you can get an opportunity volunteering? (eg. research positions) I just finished my dermatology rotation. TBH I am not interested in derm and it is one of the few things I ruled-out in my first year of med. However, it was actually really cool. I had an opportunity to use a nitrogen gun. People came in with some wart-like conditions and one of the best treatments is to freeze it off. I basically shoot compressed nitrogen onto their skin (-150 degrees Celsius). It is painful for the patient, but it is effective. I was also part of a surgical team that removed skin cancers. They do a Mohs procedure to treat certain types of cancer. Basically, we go in an cut out the cancer. We then put the tissue onto a slide and look under a microscope to see if there is any evidence of cancer on the borders we cut. If there is a sign of cancer cells, we go back to the patient and cut out some more skin. It is a cool procedure because it basically cures the cancer and we ensure that we are not leaving anything behind. Couple of interesting cases included a person with skin cancer on their lower eyelid and another person with cancer on the side of their nose. For the eye patient we basically cut out their lower eyelid crazy to see. The nose person had a large cancer so we cut out the entire left side of their nose... it is wild to see because the hole is pretty deep. For the nose person we actually had to cut out some skin from their shoulder so we can replace the skin they lost on their nose!!"," 2022-01-22, 18:01:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Occasionally I reward myself with candy or some other sweet thing. All previous studying information I got from my mom, who game-ified my studies to help me remember the studying material so I'd get good marks on my test. The most helpful studying strategy to me is retrieval. Usually, I know most things about the subject already and I just need little refreshers from the textbook to fill in the gaps. I think game-ifying falls under the category of retrieval (if you jump straight into a game without reviewing). It's a nice method to see what you already know. 2/3 [thank you for being so understanding :-D] Rooke "," 2022-01-24, 14:26:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

In terms of paying for post-secondary my first year of univeristy my parents paid for because the didn't want me to get a student loan for my undergraduate studies. I went to SFU Burnaby campus so I was living at home. SFU is a bit more on the pricier side when it comes to tuition but since I live in Surrey I didn't have to pay rent for residency on campus. I would commute everyday to school or once i made friends that lived nearby we would carpool. My second and third year I managed to pay for my own tuition and books/supplies because I started working part-time. I also applied and got two scholarships in high school for a total of $5000 so that defintely helped cover some costs as well. I 110% recommend applying for scholarships and awards theres literally so much free money out there that insitutions and companies hand out every year to senior high school students it's insane. And you'd be surprised how much of the money isn't given out because no one applies for them. In terms of my future plans of going to law. Since this whole Covid thing it's been really hard to get in person experience in law firms because you either need some sort of legal certification or a long term volunteer. The in person volunteer I did get wasn't enough so I've applied to the Legal Administrative Assistance/Paralegal certifcation program. So come this September I will be doing that program, they give you paid experience and a job right after so I will do this for a year and then start applying for the 2023-2024 law programs across Canada and in the UK as a backup. I've written the LSAT once last year and scored a 159, so I'm hoping to study a bit more and rewrite that before I start applying as well. Hope that answers some of your questions. Were there any other questions you have about post-secondary? Like programs, application process, university life on and of campus, clubs etc.?"," 2022-01-25, 12:56:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

It was kind of weird because I was preparing for my year abroad and the organization told me I would go to Kamloops. I never heard of this city before. Then some time later the news came that the mass grave at the residential school was found and we saw that it was in Kamloops. That was the first time I heard of the city. And then a while later I was actually there and saw the old building. While I went to school here I learned about the general history and struggles of the indigenous community, but I havent learned much about the specific group. There is a map that shows the territory of different native groups around the world: https://native-land.ca/. On it, you can see very well that basically all of Canada is native land even though nowadays only a fraction is actually given to them. I think its important to take traditional knowledge into account. Indigenous people have done a way better job of living in balance with nature. They make sure that they dont take too much from it and thereby destroy it like we unfortunately did. Anyway, I wish you a nice day! Anna "," 2022-01-25, 13:57:",Mentee,Posts in Ways of Knowing

I think about those happy brain chemicals a lot when I am studying and writing, and try to figure out how to get more happy brain chemicals as it makes studying easier. I would encourage you to focus on this skill as your education advances, like changing the questions or modify the rewards and always reflecting on what works for you. Even in the workplace we have to study and memorize things, and you already have a skill to use which is awesome. You got me thinking about tests, and what I am surprisingly having more open-book exams this year and last semester, this is different than pre-COVID times. Many times exams are openbook online, through Moodle or some other website, and the teachers tell us to use our books, or we are allowed to bring in our own hand-written notes. So part of my studying process now is note taking, which have tons of doodles on them. It sounds like our mentor time is ending on Friday :( Do you want to talk about anything else before then?

1047550296,1047549751,11/5/2021 16:54,46085,5," Hi Anna, The news about the unmarked graves of Indigenous children from residential schools definitely shocked many and was a dark moment for humanity. However, this was also a moment of reckoning and an opportunity for all Canadians to reflect on how society has treated indigenous people. As settlers on their stolen land, we really aren't doing much in their favour. How Indigenous communities are treated must change and it should start by respecting their knowledge and way of life. I agree with you that Indigenous people have done a much better job at maintaining and cultivating their land. It must be devastating to see your homeland being destroyed without having a voice. Given the opportunity, we should try our best to uplift and support the indigenous community as best as we can. For instance, a club I am part of raised money for the aboriginal health society here in Vancouver last year by holding fundraisers. I also heard that school ends next week for you? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Time really flew by these past few months and it has been a pleasure talking to you! It surprised me that you only came back to school for a month and then you get to have a summer break. I have to say I'm quite jealous. I still have a couple of months of school left. Anyway, let me know if you'd like to move on to the next subject and/or how you'd like to move forward. Hope you have a great day! Christine "," 2022-01-26, 23:43:",Mentor,Posts in Ways of Knowing

I know quite a few stories about the land where I live. Where I live it gets very cold in the winter and also pretty hot in the summer.It is usually partly cloudy or pure sunny days which is super nice. A big event that happened just north of us was the flooding of the Mackenzie River. This flood happened because during the spring the ice on the rivers begins to break up and starts flowing down the river, if the flowing ice meets ice that is still solid it can cause a jam. As more and more ice jams up the water levels at the jam rises greatly, But once the jam let's go and starts flowing it is very catastrophic. Water levels at the village of Fort Simpson NWT went up past the 20 foot high banks and still so much farther than that flooding the town- Not to mention the giant ice chunks that cause destruction as they float through the water and get pushed up on the land. My family's tugboat and barge business suffered many damages to our equipment that costs lots of money to repair. What is a story that comes from the area you live that involve the landscape?

I currently live in Abbotsford and in November 2021, the entire Fraser Vallry endured a historic flooding that destroyed many farmland and houses. We had a tremendous amount of rain that occurred which caused rivers to overflow, and we had a river from the US, which is called the Nooksack River, overflow across the border into the Fraser Valley. It was a really scary experience as roads were closed off, houses were under water, and the highway was closed. You can read about it if you do a quick Google search.

It also has that nostalgia factor to it for me. Oo classic, I was obsessed with going as Scream or the Grim Reaper for Halloween when I was younger. What other ones did you have in mind?

My class is trying to find a better structure to keep in contact with our mentors, so hopefully from now on our conversations won't be so few and far between! That sounds so cool! Your work in chronic disease epidemiology sound super interesting. Did you choose to pursue it before or after you started university? I've always been interested in sudying marine mammals, particularily whales, dolphins, and porpoises ever since I was kid wandering through the Vancouver Aquarium. In grade six I moved away from supporting animal captivity, especially wih cetaceans, and became interested in the species that live along the coast of British Columbia. I have worked with a few different organizations to try and do my part to protect these animals, and I know that it is something I want to continue into post-secondary. Of course, marine biology is a pretty broad subject, but I think I've narrowed it down to bioacoustics and behavioural studies of killer whales. Learning more about how such intelligent creatures use and react to sound is one of the bigger questions I have about them. Going to school on Saturna was a long-time dream of mine partly just to be in such close proximity of these animals and the rest of the natural world :) "," 2022-02-07, 12:16:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

It's so fascinating to hear about how your interest in marine biology and conservation has developed; I'd love to learn more about the work you do with these organizations in our future conversations! It's great that you've already narrowed down your research interests so early, it'll make it much easier for you to decide on your courses and major/minors when you enter post-secondary education. Regarding your question - I always knew I wanted to pursue research, but narrowing it down to epidemiology and public health was something that I realized a bit later towards the end of my university degree when I took a few SPPH courses at UBC as an elective.

I am going to school while I work so I'm on the slow track to my degree. On my way to being a soil scientist I did a lot of things in university. I started in engineering because my dad is a geotechncal engineer, but I changed programs after my first year. I wasn't a fan of all the math, and when I was 17 I didn't want to study as much as I needed to, lol. I went into business, then I was in anthrolopology for a while, then I thought I would be a teacher, then I got interested in biology and geology and eventually I got my degree in Plant and Soil Science. It took 11 years if you include the years I took off to travel, but I got it done! I've been working in mine reclamation for about 8 years now and I love it. I work with engineers all the time and I don't have to do all the math :) Outside of school and work, I like to climb, hike and play hockey. I used to play lacrosse but I was a late bloomer and there were dudes with scruffy beards clobbering me once I was 13 and it wasn't that much fun anymore lol. What makes you want to do civil engineering? Do you have any plans for where you want to study? I'm here to chat about whatever you want to. We'll get to the conversation choices below (not sure if your teacher has certain ones you need to do, or you just pick, but we'll figure it out), but first we can just get to know eachother a bit. Talk soon, Trevor "," 2022-02-10, 15:52:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

I'm very happy to discuss anything about attending university with you through this messaging platform. I saw that you enjoy learning some computer languages, I think that will be a very great skill you will use in the future, it will make you stand out in a many professions.

I'm 22, I've lived in Vancouver for almost 4 years after moving from a very small town, and I come from a very big family. A few things about me! I love to read and write (kind of necessary for an English degree lmao) but I also really enjoy most forms of media for creation. I've been really into crocheting lately and made three hats over the winter break; I love to paint, even though I don't have much time for it lately. I'm terrible at sketching, but give me some paints and a canvas and I do okay. I collect house plants, tarot decks, and books (I'm building my library, which sucks because every time I have to move, I have six heavy boxes of books). I also love to cook, and worked in a kitchen as a line cook for two years before starting at UBC, and my boyfriend (who I live with) is a sous chef. So if you ever want good recipes, I've got tons of those. Other things: I'm also pan! And I go by she/her pronouns, but the more time I spend in healthy queer spaces in Vancouver, the more I question my own feelings about my gender. Your name in your bio is listed as Leah, is that your preferred name? I will refer to you however you prefer:) Anyway, that's me! I'm really looking forward to getting to know you while we work through this program, and I hope we can have some good chats. Hope to hear from you soon! Best, Kira PS. I was going to insert a photo of some of my artwork to show you, but mentorcity won't let me, so if you would like to see any of it, I will put it into a google doc and then send you an anoynmous link so you can view it without us breaking any of the privacy rules from mentorcity.

I was a university varsity volleyball player for 5 years so I definitely share your love for sports and being active. Working out and training is still a passion of mine so I would love to hear more about your workout routine. It seems that your biggest goal throughout this mentoring process is gaining some insight into potential future careers. I completely understand the desire to have a job that allows you to have a work/life balance so that you can continue to enjoy your hobbies. You also said that academics come easily to you, so maybe looking into post-secondary education would be a good fit for you. We'll explore that further as we work through the program.

I'll also be graduating soon as I'm currently finishing my final year of Applied Biology at UBC, with a major in Applied Animal Biology. After reading through your profile, it seems that you are also interested in pursuing a degree in Biology, which is awesome! Biology is a great field to study as there are so many things to learn. I read from your profile that you'd like to study in the field of Zoology and personally that is a bit of what I've been learning; I can tell you it is definitely interesting and worth pursuing. Animals are awesome and dissecting them can be fun too, you get to dissect a wide variety of animals depending on the courses that you end up taking and the institution you choose to study at. Have you thought about which schools you'd apply to once you graduate? I also read that you hope to gain a greater understanding of biology, so in addition to completing this program, feel free to ask me any biology-related questions and I'll try my best with answering them! I've only ever had a dog as a pet, so knowing that you had two rough-skinned newts as pets (which aren't normal companion animals) was quite interesting, as well as learning about the fun fact that they possess a toxin that is the same toxin found in pufferfish (which I never knew before). I'm curious to know, how do pufferfish release and transfer the toxin? Also, a little bit about myself, if you haven't had the chance to look at my profile yet (which is totally okay btw), I enjoy hiking, playing soccer and swimming. I also like to travel, but haven't been able to enjoy this as much given the times. What are some of your favourite hobbies/ interests? Lastly, I'd like to mention if you have any questions, please ask as I am happy to answer them. I hope to hear from you soon and here's to a fun mentoring experience!

Last night i made orange cookies because they're easy and really yummy. Mainly i bake muffins, cookies, cakes with my mom, or stuff in foods class at school. i like making bread but it always has a certian taste. i should work on that. I also really need to learn to make cinnamon buns. they are my favourite and i made them so easily at school but i made them at home once and it was a disaster. i also want to know how to make pie. What do you like baking? do you cook at all? my favourite subject in school is foods because there isn't any actual work and it's so fun to make stuff but if you don't have a good group then it sucks because you have to cook/bake with a bunch of idiots. I also enjoy english and socials studies. Spotify says my top genres are hiphop, indie, rock and pop. My favourite artists right now are Kanye West, Puzzle, The Garden, Machine Girl, but mainly i listen to playlists with a bunch of arists i might not know rather than just one person's music. I'm glad we have some of the same interests (: I love nature walks, they really are meditative. What kind of arts and crafts do you do with your students?

I will also share with you a few exciting things in Computer Science major as well, so wait for it! ^^ As I shared in the previous message I have pets at home which are a Labrador and her name is Paige and a British short-hair cat with his name is Rupert (he is a 14-year old man now) ^^. When I have free time, I always make something for them, for example, clothes. I have made a collar and crocheted a t-shirt for my cat, he wasn't happy with it at all, but he still wore it! So, I am satisfied with that! I am really surprised that you had 5 cats and 2 dogs, heh? Taking care of them might take a lot of work, right?

Usually after school I will do my homework (if I have any) and then have a nap. When I wake up I'll usually take my dog for a walk if it's not dark out and then when I get home I play videogames and talk to my online friends. School is going alright. I have most of my favourite subject this semester. Them being Science, PE and Band. Some of my likes include anime, watching sunsets, crystals (specifically rose quartz), pasta, cats and whales. Some of my dislikes are wasps, the dark, airplanes and spiders. What are your likes and dislikes? I guess some of the topics I'd like to know more about would be what type of schooling I need to do to be able to be a criminal investigator/therapist. -Thanks Quinn! :) "," 2022-02-11, 11:27:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

Since you said you wanted to hear more about my workout routine, I get most of my activity with hockey and basketball practices and games, but I try to hit weights when I can, and I also like HIIT workouts, mainly with cycling or running. I definetly want to gain insight into potential future careers. A job with a work/life balance would be good, but I also want something with big pay. Looking into post secondary will definetly be something I have to do, even if I don't want to, my parents have said post-secondary will be mandatory.

And congrats on making your way through grade 9! These are all big accomplishments and they should be celebrated! I noticed you've played sports for a long time and you are curious what directions you could take. I have several friends who do kinesiology (sports-medicine type thing) and/or play college sports (football, soccer) so I could answer any questions you might have about these. But really, the paths anyone can take is endless so no pressure! As for me, to be honest I am not very sure! What I do know is that I love creative writing to my core, and do not see myself stop writing any time soon. It is a highly rewarding field, and I recommend everyone to experience it at least once. There are options I keep thinking on, taking a masters in either creative writing or English to continue my education, there is also a high demand for proficient English Majors for their writing and critical thinking skills in a variety of fields (marketing, technical writing, publishing industry, free-lance writing, nearly all industries need writers). Sorry for this looooong message, but feel free to ask any questions, I love answering them and hopefully I can make it shorter next time!

I also can't wait to help you with questions that you might have. But before that, I would love to hear more about you, your hobbies, interests and some fun facts about you. To start it off, I will share some fun facts about myself. I am 24 years old boomer who has already graduated University. I refer to myself as a boomer because although I am young but I have an old soul, so I can realte to you but I also can relate to the older folks. One more fun fact, I am an immigrant from Iran. I moved here when I was 14 years old and had to deal with adjusting to a brand new foreign culture all by myself. I am also bilingual, fluent in Farsi and English. I would love to know whether you are also bilingual or not.

I am glad to hear that you would like to learn to be more independent prior to attending post-secondary. Some points of advice that I believed would be useful for someone entering the field of educational psychology is: 1) to develop strong reading, writing, presentation and research skills 2) to develop good study habits and strategies 3) to practice time management 4) to not be afraid of failure 5) to connect with professionals who have similar interests (teachers, professors, psychologists, counsellors) 6) to volunteer in different multiple settings (schools, day care, tutoring, mentoring, camps) 7) to research different career paths in education and psychology since both fields have a wide variety of choices 8) to practice lifelong learning 9) to keep an open mind and try new things, because sometimes you need to try something that you don't like to find out what you are truly interested in "," 2022-02-11, 14:27:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

1047513637,1047554195,10/2/2020 12:24,47953,1," Hello and welcome to the program!!! My name is Challen (they/them pronouns) and it seems I'll be your mysterious mentor from the far reaches of the universe this term! :D I've noted that you use he/they pronouns as per your profile, but in terms of names, I always like to ask just because we've had trouble with registration in the past -- do you go by the name attached to your profile or would you prefer I use another? Human-wise, a little bit about me: I'm a fourth-generation settler Canadian (mostly English with some Ukranian background mixed in), going on 24 years old next month. I grew up in BC on Vancouver Island in mix of semi-rural and urban settings, completed my English BA at Vancouver Island University a year or two back (luckily without student loans!), and now I'm currently an English Masters student way out at the University of Saskatchewan, existing academically in the nerdiest way possible by writing a thesis on the mythology in the modern TV reboot of Battlestar Galactica (dreams really do come true, haha). Though gaming-wise, I'm not as active as I used to be -- used to be quite into Pokemon, Zelda, and Portal 2 on that front -- I'm big into fan-art (as well as original!) these days and spend a lot of my spare time working on a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky fan-comic (as well as drawing Fakemon concept art for an upcoming Pokemon ROM-hack... don't tell Nintendo, lol). I also like to paint, play piano, pluck at guitar in a very vague sense that I can't yet call playing, and to read... which is good, because being an MA student in the English discipline is 75% reading books. Also, super cool to hear you specifically reached out for an LGBT+ mentor -- I'm both non-binary and pansexual and am happy to say that Existing While Queer(c) in the university sphere is an increasingly welcoming prospect, at least at USask (though admittedly we're still in the works in terms of moving past ""visibility"" to ""understanding what being an enby actually means"" sometimes, lmao). All in all, I'd like to say I'm doing pretty well in life these days; I got diagnosed with ADHD last semester in the first term of my Masters studies and admittedly it's set me back a bit in terms of organization and time management (as I'm sure some of my earlier mentees can unfortunately attest QwQ) but I'm getting better at it every day and medication helps a ton. It is a Life(c) over here. What does your existence look like? What drives you to look into Social Studies in particular? What sort of hobbies fill your spare moments? What brings you Happiness(c)? In terms of the program itself, please do let me know if you have any questions; your teacher's asked us to do the units on Well-Being and Self Care, Confronting Discrimination, Career Considerations, and Post-Secondary Considerations by June 24th, but beyond those perameters we can do any other material you want or just chat about general life advice if there's anything you're curious about in terms of... well, everything but taxes, which I still don't understand myself. :') Once you've familiarized yourself with the site, just lemme know where you wanna start and I'll open the first unit!!!

I grew up on a street with a lot of other kids and we would spend time together exploring our neighborhood and playing sports. Something I disliked about growing up in a rural area was the long commute I had when I started to play elite-level volleyball.

While I have not aspired to body building, I certainly would consider myself a gym rat lol except during exam pressures...then I would say I'm a junk food rat lol I have come to BC from Ontario to take Rural PreMedicine at Selkirk College. I have been a paramedic for 13 years and love the adventure of the human body! While I certainly suck at cars, the human body is what I am good at and in many ways not that different from working on trucks and stuff! Outside of medicine I hunt, fish, hike, camp, ski, whatever is outside I am in to it. Why dont you tell me a bit more about you and what you hope to get out of our time together?

Its mid term season for me plus all my damn extra curriculars and medical school interviews so its been hectic! I am taking a study break to touch base and get to know you a bit better. I see you are interested in becoming a cop which is fantastic. I have worked for the last 13 years as a paramedic, so I have worked with plenty of cops. My brother is also in law enforcment and current a seargant at the training academy for peace officers in Alberta. RCMP certainly has come a long way in the last few years!!! not only in terms of pay, but training and equipment. I think you will find it to be an awesome and rewarding career. I see you have mentioned some interest in university work. I would highly recommend pursuing that if you want to be a cop. There are lots of applicants to the police force, and having a degree will definitely set you apart. Moreover, I think going to post secondary will teach you some valuable life skills needed to approaching policing in an pragmatic and humanistic way. Plus university is a lot of fun!!! :) Do you have any mentors currently that have inspired you to pursue becoming a cop? Or was it something else that inspired that career choice? Tell me a bit more about you too if you would like Talk soon buddy!"," 2022-02-13, 17:25:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

My course, is 40% practical(building stuff) 40%theroy(books), and 20% final.

Doing a Bachelor's of Science in Biology (or any other med related major) takes up 4 years of your life (as you probably know) and it will be very hard to complete if you aren't interested in the courses you are taking. Plus after that, getting accepted into UBC Med or any other Canadian program could add another 1-3 years after your degree, depending on how competitive your application is. And then when you finally get in, it will take another 4 years of med school and 2-6 years of residency (somewhere in Canada) before you become a fully qualified doctor. So yea, a super long time, not taking into account the amount of time to do volunteering and study for the MCAT. Meanwhile a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Programming will allow you to do co-op so that you can get paid work experience while you study so that by the time you finish your 4 year degree, you'll already have work experience. While it's a pretty competitive field, you can end up getting some big bucks ;) Which universities are you applying to if I may ask? I realize this advice is probably too late for you, but I've heard that UBC and Waterloo have really good CompSci programs. I actually got into computer programming in like grade 6, watching YouTube Tutorials on HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript on this one channel called thenewboston. Ever since then I took programming courses in school when I could. I was lucky that my high school had a lot of computer programming and computer networking courses, including AP Computer Science A. Most high schools in my city didn't have very good computer programming courses which is why I would have liked to take online courses on Udemy or Coursera for a good challenge. I would recommend you to sign up for some during the summer while you wait for university to get a head start on some good programming languages. One of the problems I heard with the first year compsci courses is that they start with old languages that no one uses in the real world anymore. Also, just in general, university courses escalate in difficulty very quickly throughout the term so it will be extremely helpful to have a solid background already. What kind of computer programming courses have you taken already at your school? I would be very interested to know what opportunities you have available to you in Prince Rupert.

You can have friends over whenever which is cool as well. But, sometimes you do miss living at home. There are upsides and downsides to moving out but it definately is a great experience to have. You have to be more disciplined because nobody is going to cook or clean for you. In term of balancing time, it isn't too difficult to have time off. The important thing is to schedule things and do things in advance. I found that highschool its easier to get away with procrastinating. Once you get into college/university it's much harder because they teach at a faster pace. So, I encourage you to do a little everyday! If you keep up with the work, you will have lots of time to see friends and family. There are times when you can hang with friends in between classes as well as after so you dont need to worry about sacrificing your personal life. Just make sure to work hard and you will be golden.

Through working on the project, I hope it'll teach you many lessons on project planning and overcoming challenges commonly met by both experienced and new learners such as fixing bugs and working on the project as it gets bigger. Although I won't be able to address your concerns specifically to the Roblox, feel free to reach out if you have any other concerns about the project. To answer your question, in my job, I am currently working with C# and Unity. Outside of my job, I am studying React and JavaScript since I want to learn more about front-end web development. When I started learning in university, it took me quite a while to know how I best learn and change my habits around it. I also had to look up a lot of things in order to implement the theory taught in class into the weekly assignments although I should have attended the professor and TA office hours to get my concerns answered and save the time I've spent looking up online. I also didn't take breaks when I should have whenever I encountered a blocker so at the moment I remind myself to take breaks at work and in my own study time outside of it. These are the two things that come off the top of my head right now but hopefully they help answer your question. On a final note, which Conversation modules would you like to start first this week?

I havent taken any kinesiology courses explicitly, but I have quite a few friends in the program, and they say its super fun!

There is lots of wildlife the life around my house, such as families of deer and even sometimes deer, and the property I live on is surrounded in forest. There is also two big lakes just 15 outside of town. Another thing I like about living in a rural area is the traffic. My family usually goes to Oakville, Ontario in the summer to visit family in the summer winter, and the city traffic is incredibly busy compared to what it is where I live. Another thing that I like about living in a rural area is that I know alot of the people in town. We only have one high school, and once you move up there you pretty much become aquainted with everybody. A thing that I don't like about living in a rural area is the lack of services here, such as stores or activities. Most of the stores that you would see in a city aren't in this town, and you have to travel a couple towns over to get there. And as you said with your volleyball, if I wanted to play higher-level hockey, it would be a 2 hour driving commitment 3 times a week. Another thing that I dislike about living in a rural area is how small the town is. I have been on every street in this town 100s of times and I enjoy the bigger feel of cities when I visit.

It seems at Mcdonalds you have learned to be more confident and take more initative in your workplace. I think #4 and #9 on the list are two things I had the most trouble with. Being a FGS, I really wanted to make my family proud. My extended family has some members whose parents do have a four-year university degree and they always made me feel insecure. I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform well and to avoid failure. I find that pressure was deterimental to my physical and mental health because I was pushing myself too hard. I ended up with major burnout and had to take a year off graduate school. I have resolved these issues recently. My mother, brother, thesis supervisor and professors are all very supportive so I was able to balance self-care and school. I am striving for a healthier lifestyle: getting a balanced diet, taking breaks and getting more physical activity. Related to my fear of failure was avoiding trying new things. During my final year of university, I felt that becoming a teacher was more in my comfort zone so I volunteered at two schools. I did enjoy teaching kids, but I found myself more interested in learning about how people learn and socialize. In my courses, I also noticed that I really liked reading research and a few professors suggested that I should go to graduate shool. Thus, I made a sudden shift to apply for graduate school. This was the first time I took a risk in my education. I only had 3 months to apply. I felt unprepared and I was scared to be rejected, but I went forward with my application. I went to several workshops and did my best to apply. My application process taught me that the fear of rejection is not worth the regret of not trying something. I find that I have learned to get out of my comfort zone and take more initiative in finding new opportunities to apply my knowledge and creativity. I used to only connect with people at my university, now I am making use of the internet and social media to meet new people in my field. In fact, this mentor opportunity is one of the ways I am getting out of my comfort zone and meeting new people and experiencing new things. "," 2022-02-15, 14:16:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

We can work together to help you find out some potential post-secondary institutions. I think it helps to create a schedule to deal with proscratination. If you are dreading to do something, I find it helps to schedule an hour per day to do some work on it. To start don't put too much detail on what you want to complete. Simply just pick up the book and read. Once you build a habit of reading the book at a certain time, you will gradually work on it more. It's good to take notes and practice tests before your official test. When you are ready to move on, let me know which Conversation you'd like to work on first. I believe your teacher wants us to do From Rural to Urban, Entering the Job Market and Paying for School. Double check with your teacher on which conversation we should work on first.

I decided to learn water resources engineering, as water is so critical for us. You have to drink water everyday, use water to take a shower and the crops you eat need water for irrigation. Meanwhile, lots of issues like flood events, water pollution and water security are happening all over the world. You can see it is a fantastic subject affecting everyone. The water, land and air are closely associated with each other. The hydrological cycle is a good example, after the precipitation falling on the ground, it will infiltrate into the aquifers, becoming groundwater, some of which will move into rivers or oceans. When the weather is hot, the groundwater will be transferred into the air via evapotranspiration. So you can see it is such a integrated system, right? As for my hobbies, I like ice skating lol. UBC has amazing ice rinks. I also like music. Nothing is better than enjoying music in the bed after submitting my essay. Well, that's lots of words. Hope you don't get bored. And what about you? Can you talk about your favorite subjects and your hobbies? [Also, I want to remind you that your tasks for this program is finishing Finding Inspiration and Well being and self care, plus two others before March 18th. If you are ready, you can choose one topic, and we can start.] Keep well and safe. Good luck in your study. Yiming "," 2022-02-15, 19:16:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047512913,1047554069,9/18/2020 17:10,47866,5," Hi Brandt, I am sorry to hear about what it is like there! I wonder if it was separated like that when my mom grew up there. I will have to ask her. Does it make you want to move away when you are finished high school? That's great that you've been able to bring up your socials grade. I knew lots of students when I was in highschool who almost, or actually did, fail a class. Many of them went on to do well in the following years and even in post-seccondary education. What's english new media like? I haven't heard of a class like that before. I defintely did have some pressure to attend college/university from my parents and friends. I also felt like if I didn't go for a while, I would fall behind my age group, so I think I put some pressure on myself too. I remember coming to the second semester of grade 12 and feeling very unsure of what I should do. Previously I had thought about going to Vancouver for school, but once I got to the end of high school, I was so burnt out from all the school work that I didn't feel very motivated to apply to university. Eventually I decided to apply to UVic just incase I decided to go, and once I was accepted, I decided just to go and see what it would be like. Looking back I am very glad that I did so because it really changed my life for the better. I made new friends who I really liked and eventually found classes that I was interested in and inspiried by. Now I really love going to UVic and could not imagine what my life would look like if I wouldn't have gone. Almost everyone I know who has gone to college or university ended up really enjoying it.

I really look forwarding to our conversations :) Here are my responses to your questions: Computer Science: The intro courses are designed as beginner friendly so they will go over the most basic concepts. When I started my studies in CSC, I had no prior knowledge of coding or anything like that. I do have a few tips for you that should help you feel more confident with taking on that intro class, and even more programming courses down the road. It is super important to build a strong foundation, so going to all the lectures and practicing the assignments and course material as much as possible is really going to help you out. There are also free programming courses that you can even start practicing on your own now, or whenever you have free time. Ex: Code Academy. Ultimately, you don't have to have prior knowledge in programming, and very likely that lots of students won't have that either.. so it is just up to you :) Mental Health: University can be very stressful and managing school, part time job, friendships, health.. it can be overwhelming but that is okay, it is expected. So it is always good to have some tools in your pocket. For myself, it took me some time to figure out what particular activities worked best for me. I joined the mental health initiative program (I believe that UBC has one as well) where I got to collaborate with other like minded students and it instilled a sense of community and support - which was awesome. I also started incorporating healthier life style by doing relaxing activities like yoga - it really helped me de-stress. I have lots more examples to share with you as we chat more about this. If you like, we can start with the well being and self care conversation. If you want to start with a different, that works too! Hope this was helpful!

1047551774,1047554022,11/26/2021 12:40,47863,5," That's awesome! I played volleyball for two years when I was in middle school - it's super fun! Vaguely connected but have you seen the anime Haikyuu!! ? It's my all-time favourite! That's a really cool dream. I'm actually thinking about becoming an English teacher, and I've just begun to explore international opportunities. At least in Canada, becoming a teacher typically means getting a Bachelor's degree in the subject(s) you want to teach (usually 4 years) and then completing a BEd (1-2 years depending on the province). It's a big question, but I do know that there are typically a few extra hoops you need to jump through relating to certification and legal qualification when it comes to international work. This is definitely something you want to talk about with people who have relevant experiences. I'm curious, what makes you want to become a teacher? A typical day for me: wake up at 8am, go through my morning routine, and leave for class around 9 or 10. Then, I attend my lectures. Here's a list of the English classes at ubc if you're interested: https://english.ubc.ca/courses/. With a full workload in English literature, I typically have three hours of class per day. There is a bit of discussion in them but it's mostly just listening to a professor talk while taking notes. You are expected to spend 2-3 hours outside of class for every 1 hour in class, so this means doing readings, discussion posts, essays, and other assignments; most of the time, this needs to be done before class so that you can properly follow the lecture. Once my classes are done, I usually just head home, but many people stay after school to work in libraries and study spaces with friends. Once I'm home (around 3-5:30 depending on the day), I cook some food, relax for a bit, and then start preparing for the next day's classes after finishing up any work that I didn't get done earlier.

You are going to need to finish highschool, and while in highschool you need to complete various high school pre requisite courses such as Biology 12 or Chemistry 12 etc. These depends on which university you plan to go to for undergrad and what they require for the program you want to get into( these pre reqs can be found on their website). You will probably want to do a bachelor of science undergrad so can you learn more about it and see how you like it. Once you are done 4 years in undergrad you will apply for grad school for denistry or whatever you decide on and do that for 4 years....and thats pretty much it.

I grew up near a forest as well and it's so amazing to be surrounded by nature all the time. Funny that you bring up Oakville as I am originally from a small town in Ontario near Oakville, so I know exactly what you're talking about in terms of the traffic. As for the downsides of rural living, I think your responses are completely reasonable and I think a lot of people living in small communities feel the same way. Are there any stores in particular that you wish you had in Port Alberni? In terms of city vs rural living it's very dependent on who you are. I lived in a city throughout university and loved that I could get to any store I wanted, had easy public transit but also the ability to drive most places, and had awesome facilities like gyms, pools, beach volleyball courts etc. I think in a place like Vancouver there is also great food throughout the city and you have access to more culture through live music, performances etc. However a more rural setting allows me to do a lot of the activities I love like rock climbing, hiking, biking etc. Rural communities are also typically very safe and can be must less expensive. If you're someone that loves good food, the fast-paced lifestyle of a city and the amenities that come with it, I think urban living would be a great choice. However, if you enjoy spending a lot of time outdoors, value having your own space and have a tight knit group of friends and family, rural living might suit you better. What are some your non-neogtiables when determining where you want to live? When you've gone through my response and answered some of the questions I've given you, we can move on to the 2nd part of the rural to urban conversation. Can't wait to hear from you!

I really appreciate what your mom and you do to help homeless cats and dogs. You know, for me that work is very beautiful.?? I'm sorry you didn't have any electives for this term, but I'm glad all the core subjects didn't keep you too busy and pressured. I know and I believe you are a very good student. The effort will never be superfluous to get what you want, but don't work too hard. You know, the results won't determine who you are, but your efforts will. So don't put too much pressure on yourself, ok? ?? And about how many subjects to choose from in university depends on the program you choose, the regulations of the school and your ability. With TRU (my university), each student must register for at least 3 subjects each term. I also usually maintain 3 to 4 subjects a semester because I want to complete each subject with the best results and quality. I also have a few friends like your brother, they also take 5 subjects a semester, and they are very busy. However, Ella, that depends on your decision and also your school's future regulations. Well, it's also a fact that my school doesn't have weekend classes. However, that also depends on the program of study. Actually, I don't think many schools will let their students study on weekends.

It's not a big deal for those who don't have an idea, but a bonus if you do. I'm impressed by what you said about trying to learn during high school, and trying to appreciate the world around you. I don't think I was like that, I did what I had to do but I didn't really have a good attitude about it and growing up in Surrey I didn't really have a deep perspective on the world - my world was pretty much hanging out in parking lots and driving around with my friends,but I at least loved to play hockey and snowboard. I didn't really start to appreciate the world until after I went travelling for a while and that opened up my eyes a lot. My study habits in high school were pretty much non-existent and that made it really hard when I got to college and started in engineering. I switched programs in my first year becuse I wasn't ready for it. It worked out well in the end. Once I travelled for a while and went back to school then I was actually serious because I was there because I wanted to be and not becaue my parents expected me to do it. I was a way better student then and I saw all the people who were a few years younger than me right out of high school having the same problems I did. It sounds like you're really stoked on carpentry and you have a real interest in learning so it sounds like you're going to be fine. Are you feeling good about moving to a new town? Do you have connections for a job there? I'm sure findign a job wont be hard if you're eager to work, but moving can be a mixed bag. Some people really flourish and others dont like it so much, even if its only an hour and a half away."," 2022-02-16, 10:24:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Oh, to access the Anchor Text 1 of From Rural to Urban section, you can find a blue link upon the Send Message part, it will take you to the Anchor Text 1 called Where We Live with the two beautiful pictures under ??. Let me know if you can not find it, ok? As promised, I will tell you a little bit about my journey as an international from a small country to a big beautiful country like Canada. Actually, I dreamed of studying abroad for a long time, but it took me several years to complete it. I had to go through a lot of difficulties to be able to come to Canada, but when I came here I felt like all my efforts were worth it. I've been here for over two years and I love living here. There are many reasons why I like Canada so much: 1. The scenery here is very beautiful with four distinct seasons. The air here is also very cool and fresh 2. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful. For example, when I walk to school, even though we don't know each other, people always smile at me and say hello. That small thing makes me feel very happy and lovely 3. The biggest benefit that I gained when I study abroad is that I have a new language, friends from many different countries and more advanced as well as new education. 4. I also learned a lot of interesting things from other cultures. 5. The opportunities for your future career will also expand Actually, there are many opportunities that you can get even if you are moving from the countryside to the city or from one country to another. And I believe that big changes I made are worth it ?? However, when moving from one place to another, we cannot ignore mention its limitations: 1. If you are a person who has never been away from home like me, then the first thing you will encounter is homesickness. Then what should we do to overcome that? My sincere advice is to make a lot of friends or take the time to explore the area you live in. The worst thing I've ever done wrong is keeping myself busy, it's not necessarily bad, but it's not a good solution to keep you going. So, to avoid homesickness, find yourself a lot of friends, it will help you have more fun and learn more things. 2. If you decide to move to a new place for your studies, keep that in mind. Because sometimes the part-time job will make you forget that important thing. Part-time work is great because it will help you build your own experience, but that was not your main goal at the first time. So, we should try to balance them well! ?? 3. A few other drawbacks I encountered were language and cultural barriers. However, it is easy to overcome because I love to expand my knowledge about it, so I try to overcome it by learning every day. You know, when you decide to move from one place to another new place or from one country to another, you have already accepted its limitations. Life in a new place is not easy, especially when you are far away from your family. However, everything you get will be worth your effort and you will learn to be more responsible for yourself. ?? Oh! All of the above sharing comes from my personal experiences only. ^^ So, Ella, What do you think? Have you ever thought about moving to a new place (a new city or country) to study or work (maybe)? And If yes, then Where would you like to go?

1047547585,1047554072,10/4/2021 12:35,47865,5," Hey, great to hear that you have such a focus on what you want to do. Civil engineering can offer great opportunities! My brother was on his way to doing that but he ended up stopping school after 2 years when he had his engineering technologist credentials. He went to BCIT. He was going to work for a while and then go back for school but he eneded up finding that he made enough money as a technologist to be happy and he didn't have all the project management stress that the engineers had. He moved from a large company and really liked to be at a smaller company after because there were more projects and variety, like you said. The bigger companies had big jobs that went on for years and he had to live in camps and didn't like that so much. But there's a lot of different things you can do and everybody finds what they want eventually. In those 11 years I spent like 6 of it in school, a couple years working odd jobs in construction, warehouses and landscaping, and the work was mainly to fund travelling. I was in Australia and New Zealand, Fiji, Southeast Asia, India, parts of Europe, Morocco. It was a great time and really shaped me as a person. Mayb eonce you get your degree youll be able to do that too. There's always tons of work in Australia and a few years working abroad looks good on a resume! In mine reclamation, it's kind of like they mess it up and we fix it. Making plans to salvae soil, where to place it and how deep, what vegetation to plant, managing vegetation and soils after planting. All that kind of stuff. I mainly write code in R to analyze data and model outcomes, and in the summer I spend a bunch of weeks travelling around Canada going to various sites and checking on our work or planning for new projects. I really like it and I'm glad that my 11 years from high school to BSc led me here :) Does your teacher have conversation choices that you are supposed to do? Last semester my mentee had a few that the teacher assigned, but I know in some cases its more open-ended.

I'll do my best to answer all of your questions about engineering, but I'm still learning myself, so it may not always be the best answer. Since you asked about the workload, it's something I can definitely speak to. As I'm sure you have heard, the workload in engineering is significant. There are times when you will have a lot going on. However, you can manage it. You need to be proactive and put in the effort. I'd suggest trying to find a balance between schoolwork and having fun, so that you never fall behind in school nor drain yourself out. What that looks like is all up to you! :) It was a bit challenging to adjust to my first semester, but eventually, I ended up falling into a rhythm and it was smooth sailing from thereon. Know that the professors are here to help you and that every other student is also going through the same process, so you're never alone. As you get used to university, I have heard it becomes easier to manage tougher courses and bigger workloads, and, surprisingly, you will probably start to do better too! That's all I can think of at the moment. If you need some clarification or suggestions, please let me know. The most important thing to take out of this I'd say is the idea of ""getting out what you put in"" (reminds me of the law of conservation of energy :D).

To study is to advance your knowledge, whether it be by looking over information you have already learned or learning new information. The ways I study are looking over my notes, re-writing them and using Cornell notes (word or concept and definition). These are the ways I've been taught to study along with making flashcards. I haven't used any of the skills in the video fully but I've used parts of them. I think they would all be really good to try to see which ones work best for me. I think the writing and visual would be the most useful for me because it gives you more than one way to look at a certain concept. I don't know which ones wouldn't work well because I haven't really tried studying many different ways, but I'm very open to trying in the future.

1047550122,1047549062,11/3/2021 17:55,46003,7," Hey Asha, no worries! My favourite study method is to rewrite my notes as well! I find it helps make things a lot neater and easier to read than the notes I take on the spot in class and I can organize it however I want which I also think makes memorization easier. My other study tool I use which has been really successful for me is trying to explain the concepts I'm studying to someone else in as much detail as possible. Doing this really helps me find any holes in my understanding or areas that I thought I understood really well but are actually still a little unclear to me. As well, it also helps me get an idea of how I would prove my knowledge of a concept on a test with a written questions because sometimes I tend to write too much and my answer isn't very clear, so practicing highlighting all the important points when I'm explaining it to someone else really helps me with that. So if you haven't had a chance to try that strategy I would definiely recommend it, especially if your teacher likes to have tests with written questions because those are often a lot harder to answer than multiple choice questions even if you feel like you know the answer.

I love reading and analyzing literature, but then also hearing about the things that influenced the writer. The look at both helps me understand the mind of the poet or author in a more detailed way. And I think its great that you have specifics that you love about History! Shakespeare has a special place in my heart, his work is the reason Im studying English and History. I find it basically impossible for me to pick a favourite musician, author or even movies. I listen to all music (like all, even classical) and I try reading almost anything.

Three things that I like about rural living are as follows; there are less people, which is good because I am not a very social person, it is a smaller area so I have less commuting time to and from the places I go. There is also more wildlife where I am from, and I enjoy being out in nature because of it. Two things I don't like, however, is that because of the fewer people, I see people that I am not as fond of more often. Anouther thing is that there are less things to do in a small community, which forces me to travel further to do more activities.

I'm not really sure what transferable skills i have. I think i would be a good problem solver in the workplace but i'm not certian. I'm good with communicating, i'm good with helping, good at debate, thinking creatively, i'm pretty sure i'm a good instructor in topics i understand well, i am patient, i'm a great helper, good listener, good at adapting, following instructions, and working with others. I am friendly and helpful. But i don't think i have one specific skill although i really am good with people i think. I say i think because i don't really have experience in formal settings, i only really get involved with others at school or in summer camps when i was younger. I have experience with teamwork in my foods classes at school in grade 8&amp;9 and i have one right now, i plan to take foods grade 11 and 12 as well. This is also experience communicating because i have to talk with everyone to determine who is doing what and what our preferences are. In gym i also have experience with teamwork. I have been a team leader/taken initiative in strategic games and i make the most out of activities i really dislike or when working with people i dislike. I am good with making a plan within groups that works for team members. In Humanities 8 we had a small debate unit which i did well in, i am good with arguing and making a clear point.

I also like living in a place where you can comfortably walk around and chat or get to know your neighbours. To be honest, I'm not that close to my neighbours, but I love the way people give me a smile or a hello when I just run into them. It makes me feel like my day becomes happier and warmer 2. I feel sorry to hear you talk about where you live??. However, we cannot completely eliminate it, can we? Crime can happen anywhere, just more or less often. It is important that we know how to protect ourselves against all situations, right? 3. Wow, I found our common ground again. I also like a peaceful place and not too busy, that's why I chose Kamloops 4. It's hard when you have to spend about 1 hour getting to the mall. That's sad, isn't it? Especially when you want to meet your friends every free time, it will take you a lot of time to be able to complete that outing, right? I understand your feeling. However, at some point, you can also choose where you want to go in the future, and I am sure that there will be many interesting things to have fun and explore. 5. I understand that going to the same school and meeting a few friends over and over will make you feel like nothing is interesting. However, sometimes it is better to build a lasting and solid friendship than to have many friends. I meant it's not that I don't promote making friends ??, however, the only people who stand by you during your most difficult times are your closest friends.?? 6. So you've been to Vancouver already? I've never been there, but I've heard it's one of those cities worth living in. The weather there is also gentle and not too harsh like Toronto or other places. Vancouver is also one of the trading cities between many cultures. The opportunity to study and work there is also very good. Looks like Vancouver is the right place for you! Also, I don't know if you've been to Victoria yet? I went there once, and I love it very much, because of its beauty and I like the sea too.

1047547913,1047554068,10/8/2021 11:59,47890,3," Hey Jong this is Spencer reporting to you today. Yipee! Today I will be talking about why I like and dont like living in a rural area. There are several things I like about living in rural area but the main one is the community. In a rural city the community is smaller so it is eisier to know people and know who is who and this makes a lot of good connections. The connections you make from a community like this makes it eisier to get jobs and to make friends. A problem with the community being small is that if you mess up it gets around and you might have a bad reputation making everything in life harder. Efficiency is another good thing about a rural area. In a urban city there is tons of traffic and is super busy while in a rural city it takes me a 30 minute walk to get anywhere in town. This is a huge upside about a rural city. The last upside about a rural city is that it doesnt cost a million dollars to live here. Housing in rural citys are normaly a lot cheaper then in a urban city and that is a turn off when trying to move to a larger city. Overall those are my 3 upsides about living in a rural city. What do you think about them and do you have any other reasons why you would like to live in a rural city? Sincerely, Spencer Meikle "," 2022-02-17, 12:45:",Mentee,Posts in From Rural to Urban

There's nothing to distract you from the music, it's just you and the notes. I think if I could visit any era it would be either the romantic era or the eras of Ancient Greece and Rome. I love the works and art that came from both of these times, so I think it be fascinating to visit. Plus, Greek mythology features some of my favourite stories and figures to analyze, there's just so much there!

I like living in a smaller town because a lot of people know each other and everyone is usually very nice to eachother. When it gets to about 9:00pm not many people are driving around, even the main roads are bare, I like this because its peaceful and easier to fall asleep. Living in a small town as a teenager is awesome, another reason i like it is because it is easier to know your way around, and to get from one side of town to the other is probably a 20 minute drive. Something i dont like about this place is theres not much to do here. We have had the same pool and museum for a long time, so as everyone is getting older, all that stuff is getting more and more boring. Another thing i dont like is we rarely get new things.

After taking Russian lit, I actually went ahead bought my own copies of War and Peace and Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy- both are amazing and powerful stories. The gothic literature course was really fun because it featured books I wouldn't normally read, like The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. There was one short-story that I read a long time ago that Id recommend, its called The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman- I read this one all the time and it's an interesting story.

1047548830,1047554042,10/15/2021 14:31,47895,9," Hi Tyla! For sure I can tell you a bit about moving out :) The biggest thing is I definitely could not have done it alone! I had a lot of help, mostly from my parents, who actually came with me from Vancouver to Montreal to help me get everything set up in my dorm. So the actual moving process was about as painless as could be. What I wasn't quite prepared for was the homesickness- dorm food obviously is many steps down from home-cooking, I missed my dog, I missed having my own room/bathroom (again- dorm life!), etc. I was doing a lot of video-calling when my roommate was out, and basically just calling home every night. It didn't help that the whole moving out experience was compounded with being in university for the first time- classes were huge, there were so many midterms coming up- it wasn't the best first month of living alone. Eventually things did get better and I did begin enjoying living alone, but for me it just took some time. I like sharing this experience because while I was going through it, it seemed like everyone around me was having the time of their lives, while I was really quite miserable for a good couple weeks. Obviously, I hope you'll have a great time when you move out! And for most people, that is the case. But I think it's important to know that it's definitely okay to not be happy and excited for a bit, because moving out can be stressful and hard, and if you find yourself feeling that way- you aren't alone, but know that it will get better with time. I'd be happy to answer any more questions you have about moving! I think MentorCity now lets us view all our messages even when we start a new conversation, so I'll unlock the Rural to Urban one, and if you want to chat more about moving out, we can continue that here :) "," 2022-02-18, 09:51:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

How long have you done professional acting? My condolences about your mom, it was really nice that she was treated by kind and helpful doctors and nurses. I tried for a while to do acting when I was in middle school, as much fun as it was I like theatre more and then grew to love the tech side of theatre and directing plays. Yeah being someone else is a lot of fun, is there a certain type of chracter trope you enjoy? I always like playing either the clown of the show or the mean and cruel character. (Yeah they are very opposite which makes it fun haha) Oh yeah chemistry wasn't my cup of tea, even know it's probably my least favourite course. I knew I wanted to go to med school since I was fairly young, I saw that overall there was a lot of need for doctors, but even more for kind and well trained doctors who care about their patients. I'm not in med school yet, just on first year of univeristy. So, how I pay for univeristy is by working in the summers and saving the money, going after bursaries and scholarships during my high school years, some that my univeristy offers, and outside scholarships that companies or organizations offer to students. As well I did depend on my family to cover the other costs but going after money like that helped me reduce my tuition by a lot. For med schools I plan on doing the same and probably start saving up for it. I've actually really enjoyed university so far, it is a lot different than high school, of course. The courses are more in depth and challenging but if you like what you are majoring in it makes it a lot more enjoyable to do.

1047551823,1047554062,11/29/2021 14:06,47859,3," Since birth, I have been living in Metro Vancouver. Unfortunately, I do not have experience moving from a rural to urban area. However, during my K-12 education, I went to a small private school in Maple Ridge. I spent most of my schooling with people I knew since I was six. I did not have much experience with meeting new people, making new friends or attending large events. I have always been a shy person and I was able to get through school without having to take initiative in forming relationships. As a result, transitioning to post-secondary was slightly overwhelming. All of a sudden I had to attend courses with 300 students, participate in class discussions, talk to professors and teaching assistants, meet with an advisor for course selections and attend workshops for studying strategies. Every day I was connecting or seeing new people. Luckily, my university has smaller classes for students majoring in Education. I was glad that I enrolled in a first year Education course that only had 30 students. There I met a third-year student who was from a rural area: Sechelt, B.C. She was very nice and understanding. I felt comfortable talking with her and she helped me work with other students in the class. Slowly, I got more used to the norms of university and forming relationships with other students and working with professors. "," 2022-02-18, 13:42:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I also really enjoy reading, doing arts and crafts, and binge watching Netflix. My favourite book is ""Educated"" by Tara Westover, because it is so suspenceful. One quote that I really like is: ""The only person you should strive to be better than, is the person you were yesterday"" - Matty Mullins I really like this quote because I feel that a lot of the time everyone keeps comparing themselves to others in their lives, and they constantly feel like they have to be better than others. I feel like this quote shows that you should just focus on improving yourself and growing, rather than keep trying to be better than other people. Also, a public figure that I think I really look up to is Humble the Poet. He is a poet, but writes poetry is simple language so that everyone can understand... especially people like me who can't read poetry! I really admire how he is always writing about how to be happy within yourself in life, which I think is really important. He is very positive, which is a trait I want in my life. I am pretty positive most of the time, but sometimes I need an extra push. Humble the Poet's Instagram posts really help me to be more positive. Enough about me, tell me a bit about you.

I'm an ambiverst person who loves nature and being outside- all types of animals and plants give me joy. I also enjoy public speaking and love spending a lot of time with myself and my thoughts (big irony i know haha). I like singing and reading books as well but I mostly end up procrastinating :( (But let's together try getting over procrastination this semester!) That was about me.

If you have any further questions about the logistic of the program, please do not hesitate to reach out. Otherwise, we can begin this first conversation! Ill begin with what I felt while watching the video. Upon my initial viewing, there were two main messages which immediately jumped out at me; the first was in the quote because we want, there is conflict, and the next was when Mr. Arcand described creation as the combination of accidents and hard work. I feel that these two ideas encapsulate the meaning of the chaos which is inherent in the creative process. To put this idea into a metaphor, the creative process is much like a chemical reaction (I thought you might appreciate this one!): molecules hurling in space, random motion, but a spark, some activation energy is needed to kickstart the process. In this way, the creative process blends the random nature of ideas, with deliberate action. This collision of chance and intent is what lead to the creation of art, theories, and any manner of concepts or plans. I am very interested in your thoughts are on this video. What did you find were the main concepts? How did you feel while watching the video? I look forward to hearing your response! "," 2022-02-18, 21:18:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Money would definitely be something to be concerned about when you're living in the city. I would suggest getting a part-time job to help alleviate the financial burden, or applying for a scholarship at your institution would help as well. there are a lot of scholarships you can look for that ranges from academics to sports to even volunteering i believe. So it would help you financially to look into that, especially when you'd want to do well in school already (i mean you're paying for the tuition gotta make that money worth lol). I am taking up a part-time job aside from school, and it will be quite tough if you're taking a full course, but you may also feel more stress thinking about money and such. I have my parents' help in paying my tuition and some expenses but I understand that not everyone's financial situation allows that so looking up part-time jobs to do in your free time or applying for scholarships can help. I would also look up saving accounts and stuff like that but that might be a bit too much haha "," 2022-02-18, 21:47:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban
1047541369,1047554084,9/17/2021 12:41,47907,1," Hey Jacob, I have unlocked the finding inspiration conversation. For some reason I can no longer see our previous chats. But I do recall you wanting to learn more about the human body in relation to working out and body building. So just to touch on that a bit before we get into the finding inspiration. I know the body building world has plenty of examples of people using steroids. I want to make sure you are aware these drugs can cause significant health concerns and are illegal. This means that they can be tainted with toxins or bacteria and result in serious harm. Additionally, do not forget your heart is a muscle too and taking these types of drugs can lead to an increase in your heart muscle which is not a good thing! I know for many in the body building world it seems to be the only solution, but long term it is harmful. You can achieve great results with a disciplined working out regimen, managing your macro nutrients through proper diet, and getting an appropriate amount of sleep. On top of that, non of these have long term or legal consequences! I am not trying to imply that you were planning to do that, but I am aware of the industry and would feel terrible if I did not pass along the information and evidence I am aware of in relation to that stuff. Now in relation to finding inspiration, I think it is interesting how each participant in the conversation had a different perspective on how to find inspiration. I feel what that highlights is the best way to find inspiration is to do what works best for you. Personally, when I am faced with a challenging task that I cannot figure out a solution for I like to sleep on it. I will go and do something completley different, go to sleep and wake up and the vast majority of the time I can come up with a creative solution to my issue. Sometimes for me inspiration pops up out of no where, so it can be handy to have a writing instrument nearby to put those ideas down for later :) "," 2022-02-18, 21:53:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Do you specifically look for it or do you allow it to come to fruition on its own? For me, when I am trying to be inspired I try to do something completley different from what I want to find inspiration for. If I had a problem such as issues with my tenants at my rentals that needed to be solved in a creative and tactful way I will try and go do soemthing else like ice fishing or school work and than sleep on it before making a decision.

Before going into this video, I'd recommend you to watch this at 1.5x speed to get the gist idea since the pacing in the video is very slow in my opinion. Feel free to read my response before or after you finish the video! Although my work does not require as much of my creativity as what the video is about, I found my intentions aligned with some of the filmmakers featured in the documentary. As a student, I have an intention of learning and delivering my best when doing my assigned work at my job. I also like to dive into the codebase on the team I'm working on as well to figure out how a codebase is structured on a large scale since I won't be able to learn this by myself since it is not common outside of enterprise/company codebase where organized code in large projects is a concern. I have a question for you, what drives you interested in programming or your hobbies at the moment such as volleyball and taekwondo? Don't worry if the motivation behind them isn't clear right now, my intentions weren't very clear at the start of my internship and the start of my 1st year when I chose to study CS.

The process of finding inspiration can be so non-linear and challenging so it was nice to hear from other creative people. I think the perspective that stuck out the most to me was Denys Arcand; I am a writer, and I've found that whenever I write what I know, or write about an experience that I've had or a story that's true, the piece is always a lot more impactful. Writing something that I've experienced and can put really deep feeling into is usually what my readers enjoy the most, so Arcand's advice about creating from something that is your own truth really resonated for me. For example, last month I wrote a story about the crazy things that happened at the first christmas celebration after my brother passed away, and it made a few people cry when they read it. (I know I've suceeded in producing strong emotion when I've got somebody crying). Are there any creative projects that you produced that you feel like come from your own experience? Do you enjoy creating in that way? What creative method from the video did you agree or disagree with? "," 2022-02-19, 09:45:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I like hanging out and I am also very social so if I can do it, Im sure you can as well. In terms of schedules, it's important that you do things daily and prevent yourself from procrastinating. In college, nobody is going to force you to do the work, the professors will not come after you, and if you live away from home, your parents will not be telling you what to do. So, it is important to be disciplined and set a time aside for work and a time to play. For me, I like getting things donr early so I always write out my assignments schedules for all my classess and start earlier rather than later and start crossing them off. There is definately satisfaction coming from when you can cross of an assignement or a test on the schedule that you make.

1047514156,1047554104,10/9/2020 17:42,47916,9," Hi Vanessa! I'm sure it will be a good ending! I'm excited to see it! And I totally get that, I only really like watching sitcoms and I always just rewatch ones that I like :) Nice, that's really cool that you know specifically what you want to get into within the field. I personally was not that aware of what I wanted when I started my degree, and even now I'm still trying to figure out my focus. For sure, so as you may have read in my profile I work for 2 professors. So the first professor was actually my Honours Thesis supervisor. I'm not sure if you're aware of that but an Honour's Thesis is how you can get research experience in your undergraduate degree. So that process usually starts with finding a professor that is willing to supervise you. It is usually done on the last year of your undergraduate degree, and you usually jump on an existing project that the professor has or if they have the time/capacity you may be able to develop a project with them. So my personal experience, it happened during COVID and we did a study on doing experiments online because we couldn't test in person. So I was able to do the research on this topic, design and program the study, and also test participants remotely. And of course there is the thesis portion, which is essentially a research paper/lab write up. Another cool thing about Honours is that your degree will say Honours in Psychology instead of Major in Psychology! So Honours is really important if you are interested in research and if you are thinking of grad school because it is required in most grad programs. But you can definitely start early with research and volunteer as early as your 1st or 2nd year and I highly recommend that. It is better to start early, but I personally started when I was in my 3rd year of university. Profs will usually say if they have ongoing research or even if they don't most profs will talk about their research and if you find it interesting, definitely don't be afraid to ask them how you can get involved in their lab. Getting these jobs is essentially building a network. So my Honours supervisor was able to see that I am capable, independent, and trustworthy so it was almost a natural next step to hire me as her research assistant (RA) because I was taking a few years off before continuing with more school. But even if there is a specific professor you want to work for and let's say not your Honours supervisor, getting these experiences early on during your undergrad is very important so you can build up your resume and your network. Then my second job as an RA came about through the network that I have built. So my Honours supervisor told me that a professor was looking for an RA and my supervisor was able to vouch for me essentially, and I was able to meet with this other professor who is in the Health Science department. So building that network is really important and definitely don't be afraid to ask how to be involved because profs are researchers, that is half of their job so they are most likely very passionate about it and will be excited about someone who shares the same passion. Sorry if that was super long... I think telling you about Honours was necessary as it is a really important part of the process. There are a few more details about the Honours thesis that I wasn't able to add like having a GPA requirement, it is different in every school, but I can expand on how it is at UNBC if you would like. Hopefully I didn't overwhelm you... Really the main points are start early by volunteering in a lab, and doing your Honours is important if you are interested in research/grad school, and do not be afraid to approach profs! :) I will unlock Finding inspiration for us to start!"," 2022-02-20, 12:19:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!
1047514156,1047554104,10/9/2020 17:42,47916,1," Hi Vanessa! So two things spoke to me in the video. One was from Mina Shum (the first filmmaker) saying ""as long as it does something for you, you have to just trust that at some point that will translate to other people."" The other piece was from Denys Arcand (the second filmmaker) discussing how he works from within. Those lines resonated with me because that's kind of how I saw being interested in psychology. People asked me why and it was always hard to find the answer for that, it just kind made sense when the idea of pursing psychology came to me. And thankfully it stuck throughout my undergrad until now. I think we're quite lucky to know what we want before starting university because from my personal experience it helped me stay focused and motivated when things got overwhelming and stressful. Even now with my jobs, it helps keep me grounded when things get stressful because I know I am contributing to my future plans. Hearing from my old roommate, she was someone who wasn't super sure about what she wanted to pursue in university, so she had a difficult time because she didn't see an endpoint/goal to it. But that's not to say that it won't be difficult because you have a goal in mind because as you probably already know it can get quite intense. Also not to say that you cant change your mind as you go through your univeristy journey because that's another part of uni, learning about other perspectives, seeing what's out there, and that is why we have electives. Having that idea of what you want to do in the future or just something within you that seems like a ""calling"" or something you're passionate about, really using that to your advantage will be something that will help you through your university journey as that is one of the things that I believe helped me! :) How about you, what pieces/lines spoke to you in the video?

I really understand the benefit of having small, tight communities in rural areas. Communities definitely vary from location to the type of people the community is built up by, and personally, I find it difficult to imagine thriving communities in urban areas. However, it is possible! Could you think of any examples? Also, are there any other downsides to living in rural areas? The pricing and commute are also important factors to consider when considering adjustments to the city. I hear about a lot of friends moving from rural areas that really hate all that city noise! But also some love it as well. As for me, I think as time has passed I enjoy the silence and peace of rural areas a lot more now. I used to think I was a full-blooded city kid, but I realize I really like the outdoors, and I usually get my fill going tree planting during my summers where we live in tents deep into the wilderness. But, the city is also a kind of forest and environment all on its own, each unique, bustling with its own people and neighbourhoods.

This idea for me can develop into a creation, an art like paintings, drawings, etc what do you think:)?

In this section there's a little video for us to watch that touches on how different people can get inspred. we can chat about and each share some ideas from the clip. I thought it was super interesting when the first women said ""everyone wants something and because of that there's always going to be conflict"". I thought that it was a bit of a dark view on what drives us but still interesting to think about. Nwo that i think about it, most of our actions are probably driven by wanting even if we're not aware of it. Another thing she said (the first quote written above) is that you always have intention for what youre doing, so if you're sitting down to paint something, there's a reason why you're there trying to paint something - i thought that was interesting too because, as i said before, i comepltely agree that there's usually a want or desire behind why we do. Its interesting to think back on decsions I've made and try and figure out exactly why i made them but it's usually because I wanted something thats for sure - let me know if you relate to this at all.

That video was a really interesting one to watch and to see all the different perspectives of these film makers. I really resonated with what Deny Arcand said about sticking to what we know to use as an inspiration and guide to doing something that is authentic to us. In my personal experience, whenever I have done any artistic work (poetry, paintings etc.), I have always found it easier to get the inspiration by looking into myself, my experiences, my memories. It has helped me resurface emotions and memories that I had forgotten about, helped me realize of ambitions that were hidden away - I definitely found the process very therapeutic.

Three things I liked when I lived in a rural area is the community aspect and how everyone knows their neighbours, how easy it is to get around (if you have a vehicle), being comfortable in a town that's familiar, What I don't like are the prices of food and fuel and I also enjoy having this sense of anonymity in the city, I can go down the street knowing that people won't recognize me. I think that's the biggest difference from a small town to a city life, people act and treat you like they won't see you again because you probably won't meet again. But people are still very friendly. Just a bit different atmosphere, because in a small town, there's a good chance you'll see someone again. I'm going to open the part 2 for this conversation.

I like that house are far away from eachother so that I can have my music loud. I have lots of animals and I don't have to worry about them getting hit by cars, or theres less of a chance. There's lots of nature closeby. I like to take a little nature walk every so often and it's convenient because it's right behind my house.

Other times you might be scared to try something new but it can be one of the most enjoyable experiences. one question i have is why do some peopl have such a hard time opening up to change when it can be such a beautiful thing.

I only work from inside of me, from what I am truly experienced in. Authenticity means you are true to your own personality, values, and spirit, regardless of the pressure that you are under to act otherwise. You are honest with yourself and with others, and you take responsibility for your mistakes. To me your authentic self is who you truly are as a person, regardless of your occupation, regardless of the influence of others, it is an honest representation of you.

I agree and disagree with the statement because it would be easier to talk about what you know best. But on the other hand, if you keep to what you know you may get too comfortable and not go outside of your comfort zone. With me personally I stick to what I know but there is a fear that I won't go outside of my comfort zone to challenge myself and grow. If I could ask Denys a question, I would ask him if he ever regretted only sticking to what he knows? My creative ideas come from my experiences and my surroundings and the willingness to go outside my comfort zone. Jordyn "," 2022-02-22, 12:54:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

If you have some sort of emotional reaction or connection to something, you can create something with it. I love the idea that you can find the smallest details like a beer can and create something out of it. Being a performing artist, I thought it was cool to see people find inspiration for their art in other mediums.

The quote you used I also agree with I find that when you make something its always great to see what others think of it. I think the thing that stood out to me was the quote from Mina Shum I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled. Cause its very true for me at least, when I make something it always has a reason behind it even if its just I was bored and wanted to draw. I know sometimes things go unplanned, but I dont think thats what they meant by that more that you planned to make something and may have not known what you where going to make. I have made a few creative projects that come from my own experience. I came up with a story for a comic I wanted to make, mostly for one character called tam she is ace and I wanted to have her show what its like trying to come out and dealing with rude people.

That's really cool how you have traveled all over the world. I definitely want to travel once I'm out of university or even maybe before. I would really like to go to Japan I've wanted to ever since I was younger. My dad traveled a lot when he was younger he also traveled to Fiji and Australia, he said it was really cool to experience different parts of the world. He wants me to also travel the world so I can get to experience different cultures as he did. I think that is one of the biggest reasons I would like to travel to Japan because the culture is very different from ours. All good about the conversation rural to urban thing I totally didn't realize there were questions and things I was supposed to say until you and my teacher mentioned it to me lol. Three things I like about living in a rural area are probably the privacy, not much traffic, and nature. Honestly, Port Alberni isn't that rural but there are definitely countryside parts to it. I feel there is more privacy because everyone mostly lives in their own house instead of apartments and stuff. The traffic isn't that bad here during this time of the year but during summertime, there is tons of traffic mostly people going to Tofino and Ukee. Port Alberni is surrounded by lots of beautiful places to go like lakes, mountains, the ocean, etc... Things I don't like about living in a rural area are that it lacks new people and things to do. Even though our high school has 1400 kids you start to see the same kids and people every day it gets kinda lame. There's quite a bit to do in Port Alberni if you're visiting but once you live here for a few years you've kind of done most things there are to do. With living in a city do you find you really have to give yourself a lot more time to get somewhere due to traffic and how you're gonna get there?"," 2022-02-22, 14:47:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Met him at first friend's wedding(we were both his best men) abt a year ago. Finding inspiration: Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words: Roch Carrier believes that creation isn't producible, but must happen naturally. He thinks that during the process of creation, something not describable, plannable, or foreseeable happens and it is this that is the essence of creation. Although lots of planning goes into the creation process, it is the things that are not planned are the most important to the creation process. Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea: I agree with this thesis since when creative writing and trying to make an interesting plot or story, I often have difficulty creating intricate details and character developing events Questions you might have about the idea(s): What mishaps and uncooperative ideas did he venture to come to this conclusion? What is he implying about his or all work out there? How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future: The future is unknown, and although we know what we do, and what we wish to do through those actions, it is what we don't plan to do, but happens anyway, that shapes us the most, gives us the most inspiration and provokes unique creation from each person. I see this as a metaphor for life, and how it is the unexpected things that we don't plan that mean the most, and sometimes, seem to be the largest events in our life. My future has yet to fully develop, and possibly change due to these unexpected events, and I'm eager to see what God has in store for me.

If it isn't unlocked or if you need some help, please let me know. :) I am excited to work with you. I was looking at the ice breaker activity on getting to know each other and I found this photo and I thought I'd share it with you. I have recently moved to Kelowna for schooling to become a High school teacher. I moved from a smaller city on my own. I find the lakes that surround me here are so beautiful. I love water and swimming so living here is a positive. I find walks by the lakefront very enjoyable and a peaceful way to destress after a long day. I also love animals so seeing all the cute puppies that walk by always make my heart melt. I love how peaceful it is and how pretty the color of the lake is. It's sometimes a greeny aqua color or a deep blue color. I like seeing all the boats parked there and how clear I can think when nature is involved. Do you have a special place or somewhere in nature that you find beautiful and freeing? I look forward to hearing about your special place. Have an awesome day. :) https://www.comfortsuiteskelowna.com/blog/2018/kelowna-hotel-vacation-guide-ways-to-enjoy-okanagan-lake.html"," 2022-02-22, 17:33:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Trying new things not only helps us to vanquish past fears, but it also allows us to expand our minds to learn new things. We learn more about ourselves. For me it was trying every single thing my town had to offer to find out what spoke to me. Some things I didnt like, and I distanced myself from it. But when I found the things that spoke to me I embraced it. I surrounded myself with people who shared the same interests and goals, which shaped me to be the person I am today.

I have a couple of friends who are also going and we were contemplating splitting costs and being roommates. Right now I dont think I have any other questions, but I will let you know! The idea that stood out to me the most was Denys Arcands line about authenticity. My understanding of his idea is that the greatest way to be authentic is by being true to the experiences you have had. You should stick to what you know and not try to be something you are not. Especially when it comes to interacting with people, I often find myself shying away from things that make me unique out of a desire to be more similar to others. I wonder if this is a struggle that many people have. I live in a small town, so I have grown up around the same people I am going to graduate with. I believe that once I have had a chance to get out and experience the world a bit more I will be able to be a more authentic person. Part of the reason I wanted to go away to university, was so that I could make new experiences and grow a bit more. I find that change and newness can be difficult. I like things to be routine and organized. I think a lot of people are like that. I think bringing new passions into life kind of goes hand-in-hand with authenticity. Figuring out what you are passionate about can be a massive change in your life. I think overcoming the challenge will be easier if you can be honest with yourself. Those were sort of my thoughts! How do you feel about authenticity? I look forward to hearing from you again soon! "," 2022-02-22, 19:56:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

It's funny that the thing you picked out from the video was the same thing that I did. The idea that you have to plan but the important things that come are unplanned. I've seen this happen a lot in my life. When I travelled I planned a lot, but all my best experiences and the most important people I met were totally random. Same thing with going to school - thought I was going to be an engineer, almost went into teaching, and came out as a soil scientist and I wouldn't change a thing about that. I think that you'll find the same kind of thing for yourself when you move to Terrace. You'll think that you're going there for school but so many interesting things will happen in life. There will be other people there in the same boat as you and you'll probably make some really meaningful friends. And at the end you'll know what life is like living away from home and you'll be able to decide better about where you want to live later on. It will be so much better to have seen something else and chosen to come home than to never leave and always wonder what might have been. It really seems like you have a good head on your shoulders and you'll find a way that works for you. It takes courage to make a big change but later you'll see that it was all part of the path towards the happy accidents that make you who you are. You said that you wanted to take on Studying as the next topic, so I'm going to unlock it. I don't know if your teacher wants you to complete the Extension Activity for this conversation, or if you're good with how we've left it. Check in with her so we make sure you pass lol.

My parents were kind of on the fence because they thought I'd never come back and get serious about life :) I did eventually, though. Japan was one of the coolest places I've ever been. I only got to spend about 2 weeks there but I plan on going back for more. It is such a great experience - so much to do, so many interesting foods to eat, the people are all very polite and like to have fun. I get what you're saying about Port Alberni. It can be really nice to be somewhere familiar and les sbusy, but that has its drawbacks too. I moved to Penticton from the heart of Vancouver last year and it was a huge change. I really love being close to nature and not having to deal with traffic. The weather is nicer too. My girlfriend and I have found a great group of friends and, unlike in Vancouver, people are rarely busy so we can just meet up regularly without much hassle. It's really nice to be able to go for a hike after work and not have to plan it for the weekend. I lived in Vancouver for a long time, most of 15 years except when I was out of the country, so I got used to it. Once you know your routes then it's not too bad getting around. You definitely learn not to drive and once you get used to it taking the bus can actually be nice. When you know which bus to take at which time and you can get a seat, then you can just spend a half hour zoned out or reading or whatever and there's no stress about traffi or parking. One thing that is really nice about Vancouver is all the great places you can go in just a short walk or bike ride. In a smaller town there's like the same 5 restaurants that everyone goes to but in the big city there's always something new to discover. And like you said, there's always new people to meet and you can make friends who have such diverse backgrounds. It can be harder to meet people in the city because everyone is on the go all the time, but especially at school there are tons of people in the same boat and you can make some of your best friendships there - the kinds of people that you'd never meet otherwise but can really change your life. Right now I'm actually staying with two university friends in Vernon. They met at university and now they have a kid who is running around just outside the door. So it can be kind of intimidating but it can also be life changing, and at least once you've moved away from home you will really know if you want to be there. People who never leave and experience a different life might always wonder what their life might have been like, but people who leave and move back make the decision and know that it's really where they want to be.

1047548830,1047554042,10/15/2021 14:31,47895,13," It's great that you have people around you willing to help! For finding a place to rent- it really depends on the city/town you're moving to! In Vancouver, I've had luck with craigslist, but in Montreal, they used Kijiji more. The biggest thing to watch out for on those online platforms though is scams- if it's too good to be true, then it probably is (and never ever put down a deposit for a place you've never seen! It's too common, especially in larger cities, for people to post pictures of apartments that aren't theirs, then claim to be out of town and need you to e-transfer a deposit to secure the place). I would definitely recommend to start looking for a place about 2 months before you want to move, and then make a trip out in order to visit different neighbourhoods as well as actually see a few places/sign a lease if all goes well, just to avoid signing for a place you've never seen before since online pictures can be quite misleading. I've also seen people move first to an AirBnB for a couple days while they look for a place, just to minimize the chances of scammed by someone online. If you are moving out for school, then often there will be Facebook groups for students looking for roommates or subletting their apartments as well. As for paying for rent, it will depend on your landlord. Some prefer e-transfer, some will ask for post-dated cheques. Most banks these days won't charge you a fee for e-transfer, but that might be something to look into if you're not sure what kind of account you have. Paying bills again will depend on a lot of things, like if utilities (gas/electricity/hot water) are included in your rent or not, then if they're not, it would depend on the city as well and how they charge for utilities. I can only speak for Vancouver- you can set up automated payments directly to BCHydro for electricity. For things like wifi/phone plans, you can also set up online payments, though I use a credit card for that (I believe a debit visa should work as well if you don't have a credit card). Essentially- online banking is the way to go for a lot of these things, especially if you're renting (I've never received a paper bill haha). I didn't have an exact budget when I moved out, but I did keep track of what I was spending in an Excel sheet, and tried to limit eating out when I could. There's loads of student budgeting tips online though if you want to look into that! And again, if you are moving out for school, there are usually financial advisors you can speak to and they'll definitely be able to help you out. If not for school, then try talking to people at work and see what they're doing! Generally, most people are happy to help if you reach out. I've given you quite a bit to read there!

1047551823,1047554062,11/29/2021 14:06,47859,7," Hey Adora, thanks for asking these questions: 1) Would you say in post-secondary you have to have connections and relationships with other people to succeed? Yes, you want to open up to other students who have similar backgrounds, interests and good study strategies. Don't be afraid to connect with older students, they often have more experience and can give you advice. Also, it is important to learn how to ask your professors or teaching assistants (older students in your university courses who help you with coursework and mark your assignments and exams) for help. In addition, you want to connect with the librarian and attend learning workshops offered by your university. These workshops can help with developing good study strategies, presentation skills and reading and writing skills as well as learning to research and cite your sources. Another important person is your advisor, this is the person who can help with course selections and building your degree. Finally, it is good to keep an eye out for volunteer, co-op education or internship opportunities, these might be on your program's website or in email newsletters. Having connections with professors can help you apply for positions since they can be a reference. 2) As a high school student there is a lot of dumb drama around the school, does post-secondary deal with any drama and/or rumours? In university, you do not have as much drama as you would in high school. The university environment is quite large so it is not possible for all the students to know each other. However, if you do end up in a toxic friend group, you could still experience drama. I would say you have a better chance of avoiding drama at university by being careful when making friends. If you notice that your friend group has the habit of gossiping, then I would rethink staying in the group. 3) After university do you have any thoughts of moving outside Metro Vancouver? I don't think I have any plans to leave Metro Vancouver. I like the location. My family is here and I don't want to be far away from them. I don't expect to travel outside the country since there is COVID. 4) Would you recommend taking smaller classes compared to the huge classes in University? Yes, I would recommend taking smaller classes in your first year. You have a better chance of building relationships with classmates and your professor. Often in smaller Education classes, you get to do more group assignments and solo writing assignments. Since the course has fewer students, your professor can provide more assistance. The smaller classes may or may not have exams. With the large classes, you may or may not have a group assigment and usually you do a few solo assignments and take two exams.

1047549490,1047554024,10/21/2021 15:41,47880,11," Well first you do your undergraduate degree where you typically choose a faculty (arts, business, science, engineering etc) and then within that you choose what subject you want to major in and what subject you want to minor in. So I was in faculty of arts at McGill and I majored in history and minored in political science. Then after you do your undergraduate degree you can apply to law school. In the 1st year of law school you have to take all required classes but then in 2nd and 3rd year you have more flexibility and can choose what to take. I am hoping to take intellectual property and sports law next year. I don't really know what kind of lawyer I want to be yet but I am interested in sports and entertainment law or being in house council for a fashion house/luxury brand. Criminal law is super interesting! It's what made me want to go to law school, I used to really want to be a prosecutor. Investigations and true crime shows/books are so fascinating! And that's such an amazing dream you have to become a judge. It takes a lot of work and there are a lot of steps to getting there but I'm sure if you put your mind to it you can do it.

1047513314,1047554041,9/25/2020 18:10,47875,5," Hi Kalee, Moving to the city can definitely be intimidating at first. During my time in college I've lived both in rural and urban areas. Yes, cities do typically tend to be higher in price in terms of accomodations, i.e. housing, transportation, gas, etc, however, this is very dependent on which city you're going to, what kind of accomodations you're looking into etc. There are ways you can be prepared for the shift in prices and the change of living in the city. A few of the things I did were: 1. Look into different housing options. There are many different types of housing you can look into, some will usually be cheaper than others. Student housing, as well as basement suites/apartments will usually be your cheapest option as a student but it is always best to look around, and make sure it will be a good fit. A few alternatives you can try would be finding a Duplex or a house to rent with roommates, as well as apartments or basement suites. 2. Look into getting some scholarships and bursaries. There are many different sites you can look into to see what scholarships and bursaries you'd qualify for, as well as looking into the ones offered in your local area. Scholarships and bursaries are a great way to get some funding to help towards your college and moving expenses. 3. Save early. During the years leading up to college I made sure to put away as much money as I can, that way I always had some money just in case. 4. Look into student loans. Not every student will be eligible for goverment student loans, however it is always a good idea to look into your options in terms of loans. Some colleges/universities offer financial aid, as well as other avenues such as goverment lines of credit. 5. Look into different modes of transportation. Some cities gas prices are significantly more expensive than rural areas, therefor it is important to look at the different expenses and weigh out which for of transport will be best for you, i.e. public transport, carpooling, taxis, or personal automotive. I see space is a concern of yours based on what you like about living in rural areas and that is definitely to be taken into consideration in terms of your living arrangements. I see you enjoy listening to music so a nice pair of noise cancelling headphones might be beneficial for you. In terms of your concerns with your animals, often times it is difficult to find housing, in the city especially, that will allow animals living. I found when I moved out that I had to leave my pets at home with my parents, as much as I love my animals, they do tend to be expensive to care for. As for your nature walks, the amount of nature and the proximity all depends on the area you're living. Though most places I've lived have hikes, or nature walks not too far from the city. As for working while in college there are definitely people who do it. Depending on your program some of them may allow you to do school part-time as well as working part-time. This takes some learning for time-management. There are people I've met who do college full-time during the day and work part-time a few evenings a week. One of the biggest things with working while in school is to learn how to manage your time to avoid burn-out while maintaining your GPA. Do you have anymore questions regarding moving to the city or anything regarding any of what we've discussed so far? If you had a choice what type of housing do you think would be best for you (i.e. townhouse, basement suite, college dorms, apartment etc.)? Research the different types of housing in the area you're considering going to school and do a price comparison. L "," 2022-02-23, 17:41:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban
1047546936,1047554098,9/27/2021 14:15,47926,5," I love these thoughts! Because I grew up the same way you have, in a small town with the same kids I've known since kindgergarten, and I always felt like I couldn't change anything about myself because everyone was familiar with a certain version of me. Authenticity can be really hard to achieve in this kind of environment, because the expectations can difficult to overcome. Going away to university is something I will always encourage, because it allows you to have new experiences, and it gives you an oppurtunity to introduce yourself as the most authentic version you can be, without anyone's preconcieved notions getting in the way. I am also somebody that loves routine, and find changes difficult, but everytime I break the organization of my life in safe or supported ways, I grow in the best way. Through new experiences we also learn which facets of ourselves we love, and which parts we wish to develop, which contributes to that feeling of authenticity and assuredness in who we are. How do you think our identities contribute to inspiration? Do you think our passions shape us, or our experiences shape our passions? I'm excited to hear from you, and I wish you the best with UVIC, I think you'll have the best time there!! "," 2022-02-23, 18:31:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

A sense of community can be very helpful, especially when you are going through a tough time or if you need help with something. On the flip side that can also be a negative, like you pointed out. If you had an issue with someone, it can be hard not to run into them from time to time. You asked a good question. I live in Vancouver. There are soooo many different personalities in the city. I think it is fairly easy to make friends, especially if you are active (eg. play sports, go to social events, etc.). One nice thing about a bigger city is that you can always ask people if they want to try new reasurant or hike. Although people might be busy, it's usually not too diffiuclt to send a text and arrange a meet up time. What are some of the small things that you find fun? Personally, I like going to the gym, watching UFC, and going on hikes. I'll open up the second section of this topic "," 2022-02-23, 19:03:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban
1047514903,1047554096,10/23/2020 16:20,47914,3," Mina Shum - Everybody Wants Something Finding inspiration can sometimes be challenging to do, especially if one lacks the motivation to achieve what is necessary. Being inspired is a powerful tool when it comes to completing what you want, but ones motivation can be an inhibitor or catalyst of sorts. Inspiration doesnt stem from desire but rather is the desire to achieve your goals based on the world around you. In the Oxford dictionary, inspiration is defined as,  the process that takes place when somebody sees or hears something that causes them to have exciting new ideas or makes them want to create something. This explanation shows inspiration is a desire, a want, and a passion to make something great. Inspiration is what you want, and is what you need. I think that because everybody wants something, inspiration stems from the passionate side of that want. Wanting something can be malicious, harmful, or just overall negative, but when one is genuinely passionate and positive about what they want, that is inspiration. I believe the malicious side to wanting something is where the conflict comes in. Some questions I have about the topic are: How does one go about finding what they are passionate about? How does one be inspired to commit to acts of selflessness? How can time for inspiration be found with school, finding a career, and other priorities in life? This idea can help me in my future by pondering this, thinking about what I want so I can be inspired and motivated to do what I need to do. For example, if there is any homework I have in the future, I can think about why I want and need this homework to be done to achieve success in my schooling to have a better life in my future.

1047514903,1047554096,10/23/2020 16:20,47914,5," Hey Isabella! sorry, I didn't see your comments about the topic, I just saw it was unlocked and was instructed to answer the questions beneath the video. I don't know about the schedule for our class logging on here, but no on the 24th because that day we have a guest speaker, and not Friday because we have Fridays off to work on our capstone project. Mina Shum's explanation of everybody doing everything for a reason is something I can definitely relate to. Any time I feel overwhelmed or unmotivated to do something I think about why I need to do it and how it will inevitably help me in the future, such as with homework assignments or essays. When I think about things in the past and why I've done them it's always because I want something. That doesn't mean I want something for myself because I want the people around me to be good just as much as I'd like things for myself. I think the idea of not knowing something sometimes can bring the biggest change is an interesting thought. I know not always this is the case but for me right now, I don't know whether or not I'm going to be accepted into my university. The outcome of this uncertainty is definitely going to bring the biggest change to my life so far. "," 2022-02-23, 20:39:",Mentee,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I see it as a willingness to express your thoughts and feelings, without the worry or intention to change these to fulfill certain criteria or please people. Im interested in your thoughts on how an occupation or other people could influence ones sense of authenticity? Do you find that work/friends/teachers can make it difficult for someone to be who they truly are?

1047514148,1047554080,10/9/2020 17:42,47906,5," Hi Catherine - I totally get what you mean! Since you are well versed in finding inspiration within yourself using your life experiences, I think that it would be a driving force when you are making decisions/finding inspirations in your life. Great point about how this can maybe hinder ""spontaneity and living life to the fullest"" because it is comfortable to stick to what we are familiar with however I think that it is also equally important to try new things so that new experiences are possible and through that, you can expand on what you know about yourself. I have been an introvert my whole life, but I started pushing my social limits just a little by putting myself in situations that normally would give me anxiety but are also good to help me overcome any associated shortcomings (that I have identified) - so when I joined social clubs at the university, I had to meet new people, have ""small talks"", and be comfortable in those situations. By doing so, I found that I prefer a balance between intro/extro-verted life style where I like to give myself some ""me"" time but also dedicate some time towards socializing with my friends and meeting new people/trying out new adventures. You have mentioned that you are pursuing engineering, and from my experience I found that the courses can be very stressful. What I did was take an elective (whenever possible) that motivated me to use different skillsets or learn different skill sets and also serve as something that is naturally easy for me to enjoy. I took a painting course and I loved it! I got to listen to other people in my class talk about their art work, their inspirations, their stories and I got to share mine and it was such an enriching process and it made me realize that I really enjoy visual arts. Then in my senior years, I ended up doing projects that involved lots of data visualization - hence marrying the tech and artistic skillsets that I have.

When I was younger (maybe elementary/beginning of high school) I used to think how I would love to live in a big city... but now I love the opportunities to get away from it all and relax, less traffic, less population density of smaller cities. Haha, its great! Anyways, to answer your question living in a bigger city is totally ok! Certainly there can be challenges like finding a place to live (finding a place to rent is nutty!), and the general cost of living (think groceries, phone bills) there are also many advantages. I think if you need to move to a larger city to attend school or to work a job, then the benefits of growing as a person outweight the cons. It sounds like you are very much rooted in a small town.

Really reasonable and scientific. I think I prefer to be a ""quick learner"" when looking for inspirations. When I am facing a task, I would like to google the information on the website, and search for successful examples which I can reference. For instance, now I am designing a virtual poster for an art organization in Vancouver. First, I search for their previous design productions to learn about their favorable styles, and then search and compare various high-quality posters from different organizations to see if I can learn something from them. In this way I can hone my skills and accumulate fundamental knowledge in a short term. I don't know if it works for you. It is super cool to see different people have different ways to find inspirations. My question for you at this time is: how do you think the way you find inspiration can affect your future (choose what major or conduct what kind of career)?

Although I'm from Kelowna which isn't a very small town I went to an extremely small school from kindergarten to grade 12. My class was so small I graduated with 5 people. Because of this I always felt like I couldn't choose my friends since I didn't have many options so I couldn't find ""my people"". One of the reasons I'm so happy I chose to go to UBC is because there are so many people. This allowed me to meet tons of nice, like-minded people. At first I was extremely nervous to move to a bigger city and live away from my family but after about a week (once I got settled) I realized I love living here and all the experiences it had provided me! I think it is scary for most people but it is a great way of getting out of your comfort zone. When I was growing up, Kelowna also didn't have many clothing stores for people my age so that was definitely a perk of moving to Vancouver:). Are you planning to move to a bigger city once you graduate and are you nervous? Have you visited any big cities and what did you think? Yes, living in Vancouver is very expensive which is why I always try to find cheap options for living, groceries, etc. Cheap housing can be pretty hard to find but if you plan ahead and look early on you should be able to find something! I had to apply for my dorm about 7 months in advance. Currently I live on campus with 3 roommates. I haven't gotten a job in Vancouver since I come home during the summer to work and I find a job would be too much along with taking 5 classes. Yep I'm on reading break! When is your spring break?

When considering different options for post-secondary education, I would recommend you to focus less on the brand name of the institution, and more on the reputation of specific departments within the institution and job prospects. For example, I attended UBC and BCIT. BCIT has no reputation at all outside of Vancouver or BC, but I learned the most useful things from there. However, employers outside of BC may not even know what BCIT is, and may prefer a UBC graduate. Meanwhile, despite what UBC or the marketing departments of other universities try to tell you about their world ranking or something similar, employers care more about experience (which you can get from programs like co-op, so definitely check if there is an engineering co-op program, how reputable it is, how many connections with employers) and the specific department (you need the right degree from the right university, e.g. the employers may prefer UBC graduates if you are in computer science, but may prefer another university instead for law or business, take the overall university ranking with a grain of salt and focus more on the reputation in a department or discipline specific manner).

Getting into a prestigeous university with co-op program does not mean you are more preferred than maybe a lesser known university. The co-op program, or reputation, or other things are only paths available to you. If you don't network or gain experience throughout your degree, the name of the institution in the end won't matter.

Sorry I wasnt able to reply I have been super busy this week and have not had time to check my email. - I like living in a rurual area because there isnt a ton of people and its not super crowded. There is barley any traffic or anything like that here and I really enjoy not having to wait in traffic forever just to get to a destination that is like 15 minutes away becuase I can get very impatient. I also like living in not such a big city becuase Covid doesnt get as bad there, wheres in a big city like Vancouver or Toronto it would be much worse, its much easier to avoid getting covid in a smaller town. My last reason is becuase if the town is small enough like Port Alberni for example, everyone in our age group sort of knows everyone. Its easier to meet new people that way. - Something I dont like is that if someone spreads a rumour about someone or there is drama within a friend group then EVERYONE will know. Especially with there only being one high school in my town, once one thing is said about someone or something everyone will eventually hear about it. My second reason is that there is nothing to do. The only places to shop here are Walmart and one clothing store that is way to expensive, and the only city to shop in is Nanaimo which is an hour ish away. - A question I have about moving is, was it hard to meet new people?

I have lived in Port Alberni since 2018-2019 ish and I only made friends earlier this school year is September. Another question I have is was it scary?

For some students, writing in a journal will be a practice they continue even after their education, but for others (like you and me) it's not particularly useful. There's a great strategy that writers use to just get their thoughts out on the page. It's called freewriting. Basically, you just write anything and everything that pops into your head without stopping. Don't pause, don't erase, just write. Once you're done, you can clean it up a little if you think it's really bad or misses the point of the task, but there's a good chance it'll be sufficient. This is a great skill to learn because it helps you get through assignments that are just graded for completion quickly. It can even be useful for brainstorming essay ideas (which you'll have to do a lot of in university). It goes without saying that, like journals, this strategy doesn't work for everyone, but I'd encourage you to give it a shot. And remember that you don't have to write about ""interesting"" stuff, whatever's on your mind will be more than enough. It could be school, money, friends, work, love, anime, lunch, the tree across the street, or becoming a teacher - it really doesn't matter too much. Even just saying that you thought about or engaged with one of the things mentioned above (plus anything else you might think of) will give you a starting point at the very least. Also, don't forget that there's nothing wrong with talking about the mundane stuff! Just a fun little side note: you probably know it but in case you don't... there's an entire genre in Japan called ""slice of life"" that exclusively deals with the mundane aspects of life. These are widely loved, award-winning series, and nothing ever happens in them! The climax of an entire arc can be something as simple as getting out of bed, finding the library, or buying milk at the grocery store. Ever heard of this genre?

1047514903,1047554096,10/23/2020 16:20,47914,7," Hi Owen those are some great reflections and questions! I think you delved into the essence of inspiration really well and approched it from different sides too which allows you to see and understand how multidimentional the term ""inspiration"" really is. I also really love how you interpreted our ""wants"" to be made up of both a passionate component and a malicious one - I completely agree with this idea and I believe that to want something can mean many different things depedning on your drive, motivation, goals etc. When relating ""wants"" to school, Ive definetely experianced both sides, good and bad of being driven by your desire. The statement ""I want to succeed in my studies"" can mean so many different things. For instance, i've found myself motivated to do well in my classes because I want to acheive perfection and surpass everyone else which is not a sustainable mindset. Although it is not direcetly malicious, it doesn't stem from a postive place. When I've worked on changing my mindset to wanting to engage and really understand the material that i'm working with, that is when I've found that I've been able to suceed in my classes. That mindset is far more sustainable and comes from an intrinsic drive instead of an extrinsic one. For context, being motivated instrisically is doing something because it gives you satifaction, joy, feeds your curiosity etc. Extrinsic motivation revolves around recieving some kind of rewards or external graficiation for your work like being paid. When consirdering the different factors that drive you, for example wanting to get into a specific university or even why you want to go to university, its always good to examine if you're pushing for something due to an intrinsic vs extrinisic motivator - in the long run, intrinsic motivation will take you further. Just something to think about! "," 2022-02-26, 11:59:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I belive that once you commit one act of selflishness, it becomes much easier to repeat it. In terms of beocming inspired to be selfless, I like looking to other people and getting inspired by them to help me figure out all the different ways that you can live as a more selfless person. For example, last year I started volunteering with a homeless shelter in downtown Victoria. It wasn't something i would have thought to do but i overheard one of my friends talking about their experiances working in a women's shelter in Vancouver and that inspired me to check it out! When it comes to being selfless, it also helps to start out with things that you are interested in. I have many friends who love working with children and are part of big buddy programs - while i think kids are great, I'm not super passionate about that area so i focused on homeless since my hometown had a large homeless popluation - that was another reason that inspired me to get more involved in Victoria! While I don't work a lot with kids, I do volunteer to judge the regional science fair that comes to uvic every year which is made up of grades 3-12. This is something that i get a lot of joy out of because: I love science and experiemnts I love meeting people who are just as inspired by science and want to learn more about it How do you think you could get inspired to commit acts of selflessness or what are somethings that you are passionate about that could tie in to this topic?

I would think many people are able to be most creative when they think outside of the box that they know well. But I also suppose that when you get inspiration from your own experiences, then that probably helps with creating content truly meaningful for you and that you can perhaps take deeper. Its interesting that one of the quotes above says that ""you plan everything"" and another says that ""creation is always an accident"" - just goes to show how polar opposite peoples opinions can be on this and that neither is right or wrong. Creation and inspiration comes about differently for everyone and what works for one person may not work for another. And sometimes its a mix of things. What about you? How do you think you find inspiration - like for example when you decided to design your quilt - where did you get the inspiration for that and for your design?

1047514156,1047554104,10/9/2020 17:42,47916,11," Hi Vanessa! No worries at all. It is important to just focus on one conversation at a time. So let me know if you want to continue with the inspiration conversation. I have heard it is competitive because there's only so many slots available and many applicants. I am currently trying to better my resume for applying to clinical psych, so I share those worries. I'm not entirely sure about getting in only on the 2nd or 3rd go. I've known of several people who got in in their first try. One of the key pieces is getting research experience because that is one of the main things that potential supervisors look at. So it is good that you're thinking about it so early in advance! I think building a relationship with profs depends too because I've built relationships with profs through going to their office hours regularly and getting their help, and that shows that you care about learning. In universities with bigger class sizes, that is one of the key things you can do is make yourself known by going to their office hours, even if they just recognize their face. With my own thesis supervisor, I didn't really know her but she was just eager to have students do research. So profs can just be very engaging in that sense. I have personally experienced a prof that I liked say no to becoming my supervisor and to be completely honest, it did not feel so good, even though I know she said no because she was already supervising another student and she only had room for one student. It was hard not take it personally but I just had to remind myself that it isn't personal. If a prof does say no, I am sure it would be for something totally unrelated to you. As I'm sure you know comparison never helps, so I hope you don't go into it thinking everyone else is more capable. Again I feel that because when people contribute in class, I would always think ""wow I would've never thought of that"" but we have to remember that we all have our strengths, and even a prof seeing your effort and determination are strengths!

1047541369,1047554084,9/17/2021 12:41,47907,5," Great question. There is a lot of research and theory around change management in the workplace because people really do not like change. I imagine in part it is a left over trait from evolution. It likely served as a way for humans to perceive a threat in the environment. If something was different than their routine, then something may be trying to eat them perhaps. While this served a purpose for our ancestors, it now plays out as an annoyance rather than helpful. I would also think there is a psycology component to this. The human brain operates on pattern recognition, so when something does not line up with the previously understood pattern the brain has to adapt which takes energy and imparts some stress. I can tell you change is hard and scary even when you advocate for change like myself! For example, we used to use one brand of cardiac monitors at work, than we were given a different brand and I was PISSED! I hated it, complained about it etc.....but now I prefer the new cardiac monitor to the old one! From that experience, when I find myself hating a change I try and reflect on that experience to remind myself change is good! :) "," 2022-02-27, 07:58:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

Big cities can definitely be crowded and oh the traffic... hard to get used to something like that. But there are ways around that! To answer your question about meeting new people - good news, it was really really easy. The nice thing about starting an undergraduate program is that everyone else is in the exact same boat as you are; everyone is starting a new program, nobody knows each other, many students would be new to the city, and most importantly, everyone has the same thought about whether they will meet new people and make friends. Luckily, most post-secondary institutions make it easy to meet new people. They might hold events where you go just to meet friends. They may have optional activities where you can meet new people and find friends that you have things in common with. If you decide to live at the school (ex. in a dorm), then you will make a lot of friends there too. In my opinion, it would be much harder to make friends coming into a high-school midway because the students there would already know each and already have made their friends. But with a post-secondary institution, everyone is looking to meet new people and so it is very easy to make friends! I moved to Montreal from BC and yes, it was scary sometimes before I went. But more than anything, I was really excited. I was worried about being away from my family for the first time but that went away once I arrived and got settled in. It is definitely an adjustment but it's such a great learning experience. There is always a lot of support at schools for anything you're feeling as well. The financial aspect is another factor to consider, but again, there are many support systems out there for that and we can talk about that in a later topic (""Paying for School"") if you'd like. I hope this helps. I feel like I could go on forever about feelings of moving away but I'm trying to keep it somewhat brief! Do you have any other questions before we move on to Part 2?

1047500301,1047554059,12/24/2019 9:56,47877,3," Hi Kitty, It really depends on specifically where you live. It's definitely busier overall. I've lived in Greater Vancouver since I graduated. Greater Vancouver is basically one big city (Vancouver) surrounded by a bunch of smaller cities (Coquitlam, Surrey, Port Moody, Delta, Richmond, Burnaby, New West etc...), and they're all connected by transit (buses, Skytrain). In the city of Vancouver, it's really busy and there are lots of people. I really don't like it because it feels like someone is always in your space. Sidewalks are always really busy and you have to navigate around other people all the time. It's a bit different when you are in the other cities like Burnaby or Coquitlam. They're still big, and they're attached to Vancouver by Skytrain, so you can be in the city in about an hour. But it's not as crowded so you can have your own space. I like it because you aren't around people all the time, but you can still have access to things when you need them. For example, my friend and I took the Skytrain yesterday to Metrotown to see a movie. Metrotown is the fifth biggest mall in Canada and I would hate to be near it all the time, but it's there if I want it. You definitely don't have to live in the big city to go to University. I go to SFU (which is in Burnaby) and people who come here live in Burnaby, Coquitlam, New West, Port Moody, Surrey - really from all over because transit makes other places a lot more accessible. I also lived on an island just off the coast of Vancouver for a while. It was a typical small community where everyone knows everyone, lots of nature etc. But it was an hour by ferry/bus out of Vancouver and two hours from SFU. There are quite a few people who never leave unless they need to go see the dentist or a specialist, and when they need it, they just go to the city (so kind of the best of both worlds). Sorry, that was long! I guess what I'm saying is going to University doesn't have to mean living in a big city. Some questions: You mentioned that there's not a lot to do in small towns. What kind of things/activities would you like to have access to? Are there things about living in a small town that you would like to keep? You mentioned nature. Are there other things?

As we go through life and make new experiences, our passions will change. It is similar to the way that your favourite foods change over time because you have had the chance to experience more. You mentioned that you are able to break the organization of your life in safe and supported ways. How do you go about doing this? Do you have a support network that you rely on for these break outs?

After I graduated I made a decision that caused me to break my routine in the biggest way I ever had, I decided to move out with my friends to Kamloops, far away from my family. It has brought me so many new experiences and I learned so much about myself, stepping outside my bubble of home, family and friends was really hard though. My main suggestion for breaking out of your bubble is to do it alongside someone you trust. When I moved away from home, I did it with my best friend who I had known since we were young. Her and my family were my support system. My second suggestion is to have a conversation about your decision with someone you are close to, like your parents. I talked a lot about my plans with my parents, got all the advice I could from them on how to take care of financials and all of the details. I couldn't have broken out of my comfort zone without the help from my family and friends, so don't be afraid to ask for help ever! Be brave, but you don't have to be alone.

There are some benifits about living in a rural are even if its smaller, since the area is smaller there is way less people and there is not much traffic which is nice. I know a lot of people and I see them quite often, and when I get new classes for school I know most of the kids in my classes. There may be some good things but its not all good. Since where I live is so small there is not very much to do and we dont get much stores or places like skate parks. We also dont get a lot of opportunities for stuff like jobs besides working in fast food. When you move to a urban city is it a lot to take in, since urban cities are big and have lots of stuff will it take a bit for someone to realize how much there is to do and how much opportunity there actually is compared to rural cities.

1047548830,1047554042,10/15/2021 14:31,47895,5," I can see how shorter wait times and less traffic would be nice benefits of living in a rural place (one time, it took me 1.5 hours to drive to work when normally it takes 40 minutes)! It must be quite frustrating on the other hand to have limited stores and shopping centres though- I think that's one thing people in bigger cities take for granted, the convenience of having lots of stores and brands available. I can't really speak to moving to a larger city from somewhere rural- the closest I've got is moving from the suburbs of a big city (Vancouver) to the downtown core of a bigger city (Montreal). While I imagine the change won't be quite as drastic as maybe where you're from, it definitely was still a noticeable change! Like you said, there's just so many more people, and especially in the downtown core, it felt like the streets were never quiet. I remember the first few weeks in Montreal I would be woken up at night from the police/ambulance/fire truck sirens, though I eventually did get used to the noise. The other thing about living downtown vs in the suburbs is that everything is much more condensed downtown- I could walk 5 minutes to the grocery store, or 7 minutes to another grocery store, then in the same area was a whole bunch of restaurants; another 5-10 minutes walking distance away were boutiques and shopping centres. I would say that the biggest thing is to give yourself time to adjust. Those first few nights in downtown Montreal had me stressing over how hard it would be get a decent night's sleep with all the noise, but eventually the noises just became background white noise. So don't underestimate your ability to adapt to change! And also remember to take in the positives- having everything within walking distance was a huge bonus that I didn't fully appreciate at the time, because I was too focused on how loud and annoying it was at night.

Hehe it's nice to know you like animals as well (shake hands), although sometimes they could be hard to memorize and study, they are the reason why I choose Biology after all. I wish I took psychology back in high school, it wasn't until the 2nd year that I discovered psychology and realized all the fun I was missing out on. I enjoyed the freedom of creative writing, but English was not my strongest point (sigh). I've gone over pretty much all the groups from invertebrates to vertebrates. In particular, I had the chance to learn about the families and species of various birds (ex. Anatidae, Trochilidae, Tytonidae) and fishes (ex. Agnathan, Chondrichthyes, teleosts), plus I had to memorize the different orders of insects (ex. Diplura, Odonata, Orthoptera). There is a very cool course on horses that includes behaviour, anatomy, physiology, reproduction, nutrition of the horse, as well as common disease pathology, prevention and treatments. But I haven't had the chance to take it (yet) due to schedule conflicts. Anyways I'll stop right there, where do you want to go for university?

Thanks for really putting some thought and effort into this, it makes it so much more engaging for both of us! A couple more things that have always worked for me: rewrite the notes and key points in different words rather than just reviewing. It seems like it's something about how my brain is engaged differently when I have to think about it and then try write it again. I woul dtake notes from the last few weeks of classes and distill them into a page or two that had all the important stuff I needed to know for tests. don't leave studying until the last day before the test! But if you do, then make sure not to pull all-nighters. You're way better off to study the most important points as efficiently as you can, get your 8 hours of sleep, and then review again when you get up. I would set time limits for myself for studying each topic if I had a few things on the go. Like an hour of one thing, then a half hour break, then come back and review the key points for like 15 minutes, and then study an hour of something else and take another break. I find this helps you to focus on key points and not get lost in details or start to get bored. Some of the things in there I have never really tried, like relating things to images or things my life. O rmaybe I was doing that in my head on my own, but was never a strategy I tried to use. I have a pretty good memory for remembering text, I guess like a photographic memory but not at super human levels. Sometimes in tests the image that I would see was actually of my summary notes page - I could remember where on the page a certain piece of information was and almost see what I had written. I have access to the Compete Conversation button and I am pretty sure that you're not supposed to see it, which makes it strange that the instructions tell you to press it and do the survey.

After watching the video above ""The Creative Process"", the idea of genuinity sparking interest stood out to me. Subconsciously, our behaviour changes when we talk about things that personally relate to us. As I was watching the video, it came to my attention that when we speak, discuss genuine interests, even our body motion changes. In my case, that is cars. To many other people, they are a form of transportation (from A to B), but for me it hits different. This also relates to the fist film maker, in which her idea focuseson intention, and answering the question ""why?"". I relate to that, subconsciously we would do anything that makes up happy, but being aware of the right and wrong diverts our main intention of happiness. What about you? What ideas stood out to you in the video? Do you have any question about the ideas discussed? I am curios to what you think! I hope to hear from you soon!

1047547586,1047554056,10/4/2021 12:50,47862,5," Hi Aurayliah, I would say that I do not have to study for tests or exams that often. As an art student, as I am getting my Bachelor of Arts, there are not a lot of tests that I face, except my final exams, and I don't really need to study for assignments either. English doesn't really qualify for a lot of testing, so studying is not often needed. There is not really an exact time every week that I study because it is not really needed for my major or minor. When I do study, I try to study straight for an hour and then take a half-hour or 15 minute break (I find that I need mental breaks, hence the 15-30 minute breaks). I don't often study more than three or four hours because, after awhile, I lose focus and stop absorbing information. When I study, I like to re-write my notes over and over because writing helps me memorize, and I also read my notes out loud numerous times. Another thing I do is listen to music, I can memorize easily with music. I think to find the best studying method for you, you have to try a few methods because everyone learns differently. I am an auditory learner, so I need to hear and write things or I won't remember them. But if you are a different learner, say hands-on, then listening won't help you. My advice to you would be to test a few different types of studying to see what your mind likes the best, and remember that finding that method can take time, so be patient with yourself. I hope that helps, if you have more questions- let me know! -Megan "," 2022-03-01, 14:39:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

I can still be independent but also can visit when I please. In my opinion, the location is almost as important as the institution.

Vet school can be very competitive, but if you have a good worth eithic and drive, than it is more than a feasible goal. Also, do not stress too much about finding the perfect school, there are many people who transfer after a few years and do very well.

1047514156,1047554104,10/9/2020 17:42,47916,1," Hi Vanessa! So determining a study schedule/habit and note taking techniques that works for you is really important because unlike in high school, the time you spend in class is focused on the lectures. So there is a lot of time outside of class that you will have to dedicate to studying and completing assignments/papers. Most times, professors will share their lecture slides with the class through an online portal, and so what has worked for me is that in class, I would focus on writing down what the prof says as opposed to writing down what is on the slides. This saves you having to write everything and you can focus on pieces that are not on the slides. Then after class, I would combine my written notes of what the prof said and the lecture notes into a word document. I also make flashcards. I would then keep adding to the word docuement and keep making flashcards after every lecture so when it is closer to the midterm, I will have all my notes compiled already and I can focus on studying. I also make sure to ask the prof any questions I encounter after compiling my notes so that I am fully understanding the concepts as we progress along the different topics. In terms of how heavy the courses can be, this does depend on the class, but what I think makes it different from courses in high school is you do not get class time to work on your assignments or to study for tests/exams. So a lot comes down to your own time management. At the beginning on the semester, you will be given a syllabus for each class that will contain all your due dates for your assignments and the dates for your exams. I suggest making sure to write that on a physical calendar or a digital calendar so you know all the important dates and can plan accordingly when you need to start assignments or when to start studying. So one of the good things about uni is that you create your own schedule. There are required courses and a specific number of courses that you have to complete, but you usually create your own schedule every semester, meaning you can decide how many courses you take at a time. I personally took 5 courses per semester in order to complete my degree in 4 years, but it is not uncommon to take less courses per semester. Although it would extend the time you complete the degree (it is very normal and quite common to complete a degree in 5 years), it will allow you to dedicate more time onto each course or if you are also planning on working during the school year then your worklaoad wont be as heavy.

But, I live in Prince George and the traffic is not too bad during rush hour times! I think just planning on leaving aroud 10 minutes earlier to get to a destination during rush hour times is more than enough extra time to get there. It is great to have those close connections with being in a smaller town. However, being in a bigger place even if you do not have as many connections there are much more opportunities for jobs in an urban area. I cannot speak for all larger areas but Prince George is full of hikes, trails, lakes, and many outdoor actvities! It is definietly place for outdoor lovers to be. Drama in a smal town is the worst. That's not to say that will not happen in a bigger city but I think surrounding yourself with people who prefer to stay outside of the drama is a key to that too. There is defiently more opportunites to do a variety of things living in a bigger place Living in a bigger city is an adjustment but once you get use to it, it is not stressful at all! Infact its not much different from living in a town its just on a bigger scale! I do not have a large group of friends, but I have always been someone who has a smaller group of very close friends. You will have lots of opportunites to make friends whether it is through school, work, or hobbies you have. I would say no the line-ups are not big!

1047541369,1047554084,9/17/2021 12:41,47907,1," I have opened the rural to urban conversation. So I grew up and spent majority of my life in Hamilton Ontario, next door to Toronto. I was born and bred a city boy. It wasn't until I retired from pro paintabll that I found a passion for rural life because I started hunting and fishing a lot more. The city is great when you are young. It caters to a virbant social life and allows you access to lots of fun things like bars, clubs, variety of food, and just way more people in general. Plus, if you make someone angry its unlikely you're going to see them again lol The down side to the city is the sheer number of people means you will just be another face in the crowd and that can make it hard to find friends. I find people in the city tend to keep to themselves and their own social group. Its also a lot busier, so it can be hard to find some chill time. And the traffic jams are the WORST.... Moving to rural BC was a fantastic experience for me, but I was ready to have a more chill life and wanted easier access to hunting and other outdoor activities that were diffiuclt to access in the city. I mean I friggin have elk in my yard eating my bushes and buggling, don't get that in the city!!! Just skunks and racoons :( Rural though has limited access to stores etc. Since moving here Canadian tire has become my go to store, but in the city it was kind of a last resort store lol So that is challenging. Thankfully theres online shopping, but that makes it hard to assess the product to see if something you like... the other challenge is health care, the resources are limited and if you need specialized care its either not here, the wait is to long, or you gotta travel real far to get to it. That being said, I wouldn't ever move back to the city, except to go to medical school I love rural living! :) PS: theres a million more gyms in the city compared to rural lol "," 2022-03-02, 17:36:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I wished I'd learned these tips before I attend college in Canada since I was taught to passively follow what the teachers write on the board and repeat the same information on exams. In addition to the video, I also want to share one thing I learned from the course that is very important to me when I learn programming is the concept of the illusion of competence. For example, if I passively follow a tutorial without revisiting the code to understand it, I'd think to myself that I understand the material but in fact, I won't be able to write it on my own without looking at the source code. Therefore, I think it is important to have a personal project for yourself where you test yourself and allow yourself to make mistakes to learn from them. I hope this helps you with your programming journey.

Another thing i like is how close everything is. i only have to leave my house 15 minutes before i have to be anywehre because of how close everything is another thing i enjoy is the people.

Three things i like about living in a rural area are that I know most of the people in this town, so I have many people who genuinely care about me. Secondly, living in bigger cities is very scary to me because I would feel lost all the time. Lastly the cost of living is lower in rural areas than in either urban or suburban ones, and I am closer to nature, and I spend time outdoors a lot. Two things I do not like about living in a rural area are that opportunities are harder to achieve, like for myself, I play hockey and from a small town like this you do not get to be seen by scouts a lot, or get to play in bigger teams. Also, there are fewer job opportunities here due to their small size and available jobs are likely to pay less than those in bigger cities. My question is how long did it take you to get used to it or are you still unsure? Also do you like urban living?

1047550342,1047554102,11/7/2021 4:55,47928,3," Hi Anne, I chose Denys Arcands quote, If I want to do something truly authentic  I should stick to what I know, to whats happened to me. I only work from inside of me, from what I am truly experienced in. It is important to be authentic as often as possible; doing things that make oneself happy. This may be because you are doing something that you do often, and that you understand well, or something that is new and that you are excited to try. It is common to do things that you enjoy over and over again, like watching the same show multiple times, eating the same foods, reaching for the same sweater; things that are familiar give us a sense of safety and comfort, because we have watched, eaten or worn these things before, and we know the way they will make us feel. However, it is important and valuable to try things that are out of your comfort zone. Going out of your comfort zone, trying new foods or watching new shows will allow you to expand your areas of interests. From these new experiences, you can make new connections, like new friends who share your newfound interests. With this quote in mind, in the future I aspire to try new things as often as possible to find new things that interest me, while still sticking to what I know, and doing things that I know will make me happy. You are totally right! One can plan for the future all they want, but things will always come up that are unplanned, and sometimes the unexpected things can make experiences better than you couldve planned for.

1047514152,1047554099,10/9/2020 17:42,47927,5," Hey Ronin, really interesting thoughts! I like the quote you chose, because for me as well, really big changes came with choosing things I knew little about in advance. Moving to Canada, moving from urban Vancouver to a small town in the Kootenays, other choices were things I decided to do without having all the knowledge on how it was going to go. They were risks in a way, but both of them, along with other big changes that came with decisions I made over the years, have enriched my life and broadened my perspective. I like your point about expanding our minds. I feel that it's good for me (or everyone) to maintain a level of change and progress in life, because it keeps our minds flexible and receptive. It's kind of like stretching your arms to either side to find limits from both directions, and getting this confidence in yourself within those broad bounds. I also like what you said about exploring your town and getting to know it in a deep way. I find that in my life I have periods when I'm looking to step out and explore something new, and other times when I'm looking for stability and familiarity. I think both can stem from curiosity and inspiration, they're just different manifestations of those. For example, my choice of moving to the Kootenays was born out of a desire to get to know a new place, that's very different from other places I've lived in and explore a different way of life. Later, I had a little fatigue from being transient, which made me want to stay in place, enjoy my familiarity and rootedness. Both these ""wanderlust"" and deep understanding of things can be really good sources of inspiration. About your question - yes I definitely have gone through a process of exploring my town and getting familial knowledge of the places and people in it. This was true especially because it wasn't where I grew up, so I had lots to discover. And life in the Kootenays is quite different than other places I've lived in, so there was lots for me to check out and see if it spoke to me. Getting to know the place and the things I could do in it, and the people, was inspiring and exciting because it made me feel more at home, see the complexities and details in things. Something cool that I've tried doing is embrace what the situation offers. I recently moved to Israel, which means I won't be able to do some of the things I like (ski touring, climbing...), but, there are things that this new place does offer - like swimming in the ocean. So I'm trying to be open to this change and make the most out of the situation. I think getting near to the end of high school is an exciting time in this sense - you can choose many different things and go after what's interesting or inspiring for you and go pursue it, which is really cool!

Was there any study or note taking tips mentioned in the videos above that you are already doing or are wanting to try? To be completely honest, I may not be the best person to answer the question about school-life balance because I was very focused on my academics during my time in uni. Not to say that it is a bad thing because time and effort does pay off with good grades. But when applying to grad school they do also look at extra-curriculars. I feel like the extra-curriculars like research would still count as school so if we're thinking social life and de-stressing activities then striking a balance can be hard there too. I did have a roommate when I was in uni so it helped make it feel less lonely but I too am an introvert. I think making sure you stay connected with family and friends can help. And some friendships just come naturally too when students have the same class, so don't be afraid to approach your classmates, even if it is for a school related question. From there, a friendship can grow too. Most schools also have clubs not just for different majors but also for different interests, for example my school had a music club and a board games club or even ones for a cause (ex. WUSC which supports young people all over the world). And you are right, we can discuss this futher in the self-care and well-being conversation!

I think you never really stop learning how to study and what works best for you since we're always striving to improve how to better retain information and recall it on tests and assignments. :) Here are some really cool ways I wanted to point out from the videos on ways to study and pointers on how to study well and effectively. 1. Spaced studying - Leaving 1-3 days in between studying different topics. 2. Going back to previous topics studied frequently. 3. Drawing connections with your notes, asking yourself questions, and explaining concepts and ideas to yourself. 4. Using examples, apply your knowledge to real-life examples. 5. Using visuals to understand more difficult topics with multiple steps or concepts. 5. Consistently practice recalling information and highlighting what you do not know so you can try to focus on those over what you already know. 6. Make yourself practice tests and scribble on a blank piece of paper what you already know. From some of the bullet points that I have mentioned - what stands out to you in terms of (1) what you already do and (2) what you might consider trying? Let me know what you think!

Keep it up - it'll be super useful once you begin university. Regarding the slice of life genre, I totally get it. I didn't like it at first but I'm finding that the older I get the more I enjoy it. Teacher stuff: this is a great thing to talk about with your teachers! They've gone through the process themselves so they'll be able to talk you through the details. The standard route, though, is a four-year bachelor's degree plus a one year BEd in BC (or a two year BEd in most other provinces, I believe). However, it's also possible to become a teacher with shorter degrees, but this will be reflected in your pay and you won't have the most competitive profile. For now, one of your goals should be to study hard so you can get into university and work towards earning a bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, I don't know much about becoming a teacher in another country, so you'll want to refer to a guidance/career counsellor for that. Generally, I believe there's some sort of small extra certification that's needed, but this is likely something you'd want to talk about with people who have had more relevant experiences.

It was easy to meet up with friends as well since we were all so close to each other. Finally, as you said, the lack of traffic was definitely great. I moved years back to a busier city and there's constant noise going on. I never had experience with fighting in my neighbourhood. That must've been scary. The lack of malls and entertainment got to me though. Also, when I got a job, having to bus 45 min for every shift was really annoying. I've only gone to Victoria once! I'd love to go back.

The two strategies which I use the most currently are spaced practice and reterival practice/active studying. When I am studying I like to start studying for midterms about 2 weeks before the exam and study a little bit each day because then Im not cramming to study the night before (this has happened before and I did not do well on the exam aha). The retervial practice is a great way to study as it is a way to demonstrate what you know and if you can apply your knowledge to problems instead of just memorizing answers. The videos proposed study techniques are really good ideas to consider because I found the transtion from high school studying to university studying came with a heavier work load and of course more difficulty.

I will start with answering your question first, the points you mentioned you liked about being in a rural community is definitely different in the big city. Living in a big city unfortunately involves dealing with occasional/ often traffic depending on the city you reside in. However there are lots of big malls and activities available that depending on your interest you can access. The issue of having lots of homeless people unfortunately still persists in the big cities sometimes in even bigger scale which is heartbreaking but the solution to that issue I believe lies on the government and the economy not citizens fault so never feel guilty about that. But that is not to say that our contributions won't help I love encouraging people to help out the homeless community as much as possible and It's very considerate of you wanting to help. in regards to moving to a big city, definately will need some time to adjust. Transportation will be something that you might have to think about that you didnt have to think about before. But there are many ways of transportation public transit (bus &amp; skytrain), having a car if financially capable to do so. There are many things that I'm sure you would like about moving to the city such as a new start, more people to socialize with, more job and educational opportunities, more things to do, etc. I hope I was able to answer your question.

During biology class, I found flashcards pretty useful but I want to learn more strategies that can help me more. The strategy that sounds most effective for me is studying over a long period of time. The thing I have struggled with over the past year is the timetable at our school. We have longer classes but they run for a shorter amount of time. This doesn't really give me enough time to soak up the information well so studying for a little bit a day over weeks sounds like it will be useful. The most difficult strategy for me would probably be visuals. I feel like it would be super useful for me but it would be hard for me to get used to. I will try and use these strategies but I have a super hard time focusing and retaining information. I also get unmotivated really easily so I will try my best to do these skills.

This really helped me feel that I was never alone and that I could maintain connections with my home. I also had my varsity team which acted as a second home for me, so I was able to adjust very quickly. I would really recommend finding people at your new school who have similar interests as you, via clubs or sports. By making your own community via your friendship group, you can create a sense of home. This new home can really help keep you grounded in a busy urban setting. I personally enjoy urban living, but like you, I love the outdoors. My compromise with this is that I make time to enjoy the outdoors, usually by traveling with friends outside the city. This way I can enjoy the outdoors of the country, while still attending school in the city. It may not always be possible to travel far, so I also take advantage of any nearby green spaces, which more cities are focusing on providing. Urban living is quite expensive, so staying on top of your finances will be key. The easiest way Ive found to get started on this is to work on a budget and analyze where you are spending your money. This can help you cut costs, and when it comes to living in an urban area every bit counts. I look forward to hearing back from you! "," 2022-03-04, 15:58:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I had a great experience studying criminology at SFU so fingers crossed that you also get accepted there! Also, let me know if you do and I can share more about my experience there. In terms of potentially switching to psychology, know that your first year of university is very flexible. So, for example, if you're not 100% sure about criminology (or sociology), take some psychology courses in your first year to see if that's something you find more enjoyable. I definitely encourage you to reach out to an academic advisor and let them know your concerns so that they can help you plan best. Very cool that you want to be a forensic psychologist! I took a forensic sciences class at SFU, which was super interesting. In fact, a lot of my interest in criminology is because I used to watch Criminal Minds and CSI all the time! I also love spending time outdoors and LOVE my dog. I love hiking! If you decide to go to the University of Alberta, make sure you make your way to Banff and Jasper!

I agree with those aspects of living in a rural community, that feeling of closeness is something that is really unique to smaller places. I also agree that sometimes this means you don't have access to the diversity of resources you might be looking for. Regarding housing, I would say that really depends on where you go for post-secondary education. Where I am, housing prices are quite high, especially closer to campus. Direct-entry first year students are guaranteed residence for that year, I believe, if they choose to live on campus and that comes with its associated fixed set of costs. People do live off-campus, especially in upper years, but owing to the high prices you may need to live with roommates. Ultimately, there is a wide range of factors to consider with off-campus housing including rent, utilities, potential roommate issues, and transport, but it does offers flexibility. On-campus housing, as I mentioned, should be guaranteed for direct first-year entrants and is more set; housing in later years operates on an application system based on timing. Regarding living costs and working, the time you have to work really depends on a variety of factors. If you are being financially supported (family, loans etc.), that gives you a little more breathing room. Taking an above-average course load, I was able to work part-time in different positions around campus but it took a fair bit of time managemnt and the ability to do this really again depends on your major, course load, and time management. It is also important to consider your physical and mental health as you do this. Working a full-time job or close to that with a full course load may be difficult, especially as you transition to university in your first year, and I would encourage you to explore your options for financial support such as scholarships, provincial funding etc. In all, handling living and housing costs solely from employment while entering first year with no other support may require a fair bit of planning and diligence, but bursaries, scholarships, provincial grants/loans etc, can help. Do let me know if you have any further questions, we can move to the next part once they are addressed! Eashan "," 2022-03-07, 11:21:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

Since there's a lack of... noise, it is usually very quiet and you can get a good nights sleep much easier than living in a loud city. Everything is also a little close to eachother if you're used to walking, so it's nice being able to take a five minute walk up to Quality Foods. I cannot think of any other good reasons, but no one really likes the smell in a part of the town. There's a paper (?) mill there and it makes everything around it smell like crap sometimes, especially in the summer. Things also tend to close earlier in towns, like 4-5pm early. Because of that, there isn't much to do unless it's Tuesday movie night and there's a good movie at the theatre. Did you find it harder to socialize in a urban area?

Before watching video: -My definition of studying is absorbing information from a topic you have learnt/are learning. -When I study, I read over the information usually multple times and try to really understand what it means. I try to get a good sense of what it is talking about. The more logical things are, the more they stick to me. I always try to ensure I know the material without looking back onto the notes. -Some teachers recommend cue cards or a study guide, but I have never really bothered with that. After watching video: -The study skills I have used before are No cramming and Ask, explain, and correct. These skills have proven incredibly useful to me and have allowed me to absorb lots of information. The first skill I haven't used as much as I have learned it in the last year, but the other method I have been using for quite some time. -I think the strategy that is most effective is the No cramming. While the others feel like strategies, this one feels like a neccesity. People have many effective strategies when it comes to studying, but I feel like it's impossible to effectively study when cramming a lot of information on a night before an exam. -The most challenging skill for me would be the visual skill as I do not draw and prefer not to write things down when studying. -I will most likely try out the switching strategy as it is fairly simple to do and seems effective.

1047550124,1047554090,11/3/2021 18:55,47922,5," Before video: Studying is putting your time into a subject to gain more knowledge about that subject. When I study subjects that require memorization, I read over the material until I can remember it without needing any help. When I study subjects that require application, like physics or math, I do examples or I just watch YouTube tutorials and try to understand what's going on. Sometimes I would have a study session with a friend, and we would quiz each other on the material. The strategies that I've been taught to help study are to use cue cards and read things repeatedly. Video questions: The study methods that I use are recalling material, examples, and asking/connecting. These methods really help me when it comes to learning and understanding the subject. The most effective studying method shown in the video is not to cram. It's evident that cramming before an exam is ineffective; you won't have enough time to absorb the information. The only thing I would add to these strategies is to have breaks. The strategies I would want to try out is switching since its the only method on the studio I havent done yet. Hey Shaun, I accidentally sent a message without writing anything, which is why you saw that post. The studying skills that I need to work on are switching and not cramming. I frequently procrastinate and I want to begin reviewing material throughout the day rather than reviewing only at night. For subjects like chemistry, I review material more than I do examples and for math I do more examples than I recall materials. How are your studying methods like?

Going somewhere with unfamiliarity's opens up more risks to take. By moving away from Canada, you can't do the same things you used to like such as skiing and climbing. But it lets you discover new things that Isreal has to offer. You might discover something you didn't know even existed, but you really enjoy it. I'm glad we both share the same mindset of how important curiosity is. Curiosity helps us grow, build relationships with others, adapt more effectively to change and create more innovative solutions. It lets you expand your mind. It's why I'm so excited to see what my next chapter is. Unfortunately there's no point of curiosity if you don't have the motivation to seek it out. That's why I think our next conversation should be setting goals and building habits. Thanks. "," 2022-03-07, 21:40:",Mentee,Posts in From Rural to Urban

I think that it is only slightly harder to socialize in urban areas (especially if you go to a commuter university-- which is bascially when most of the students live off-campus) because everyone is so caught up in their daily lives/tasks...BUT I also think that once you start socializing and conversing, people tend to be quite non-judgemental, easy going and friendly!! My high school was relatively small, so going to a university with a large student population was definitely a big change for me...I wonder what you think are the biggest challenges (and benefits) you might face if you go university in an urban area??

You can't get that in an urban setting, luckily in Vancouver nature is not that far away where you are. Things I didn't like growing up remotely is there was no movie theatres, no fast food (good thing I guess), the only thing we had was a Band Store lol Moving to Vancouver was a breeze, I always considered Van my 2nd home and more or less my home base when I comes to BC. I like how you can jump on a ferry &amp; get to the Island fairly quickly. Both PA and Vic are 3 hrs from start to finish!

I would advise you to reach out to your school early on, book an appointment with a financial advisor. I am guilty of not bringing my own food and spending a lot on food on campus. We have a Starbucks and Tim Hortons. I had a part-time job, it was stressful juggling the job on top of the school. I would recommend doing part-time school if you would like to have a part-time job. Plan your calendar early on, important dates for school and personal life really helped. Taking days off to yourself is important to reset and start fresh. There are a lot of things I have purchased that were wants and not needs. I believe that it depends on your income. If you have extra pocket money, it is okay to buy your wants sometimes. It can be a reward for your hard work. I think I needed to budget my money more. For example, how much should I treat myself a week on school food or restaurants near the school? What is the estimated amount of money I can spend? For my credit card, I have set monthly alerts, I am pretty sure there is also the option of automatic payment. I would check the payment date and keep notes/have an alert on my calendar for school payments after choosing my courses. Note: if you are on a student loan, I would recommend applying 2 weeks before choosing courses. (For student loans, you need to reapply every semester) The textbooks are extremely expensive, there are facebook groups, other third party webs that sell used textbooks. Some courses, textbooks are not required. Make sure to check your course outline. Hope this helps! Linda "," 2022-03-08, 10:25:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

1047547565,1047554190,10/4/2021 6:55,47954,1," Hi Chantel, How are you doing? I hope you already started working on the anchor text for this module. I was just watching the video in the anchor text and the idea that stood out the most to me was the first one by Mina Shum. I totally agree with her that eveything we do has intentions- sometimes we are aware of them and sometimes we are not. Nonetheless, I believe not everything is planned by us! You might have noticed that you had a plan A but actually ended up with B which, indeed, proved more fulfilling in the future! But, this understanding that what I'm doing is intentional will help you motivate yourself in college. I have this sticky note on my study desk that says 'you're doing what you love.' This reminds me that I have always wanted to be where I am today and what I'm learning today so everytime I get exhausted/ tired by all the studying I read this and tell myself how grateful I am for all this. But, sometimes flowing with the time is the best idea you know. Can you think of some time in your life when you thought the sitution was worse and was never going to improve, but it actually all settled down in the end!? When we through a pebble in a pond, the mud at the bottom of it comes up and we can no longer see the bottom of pond because of this mud strom. Slowly and gradually the mud settles and we can again see the bottom! You will face this situation many times in college. Like, you'll have a ton of work to cover but you'll feel that nothing is getting completed! You'll be exhausted! But, we can deal with it in two ways, first calm yourself down- think it's just the mud and will settle with time. Second, change your way of studying, if you're making mindmaps for all the concepts (which is amazing!), make for only the important ideas and focus on reading other notes over and over again. We can keep ourself flexible in college to adjust according to needs. It's okay to struggle but we sometimes need to just wait and change our approach. I know I went a little off-track but I want you to know that what works for you might not work for your friends and what works for your friends might not help you! So, stay aware about how you are progressing and when you do well in college so that you master the skill of getting into your creative self faster than ever! You will have very very unproductive and uncreative times when you just can't think something amazing as much as you try and That's okay too! We don't need to take hard paths to do achieve something extraordinary when we have easy ones too. Take some rest and pick up your work again after a short break! It took you long time read I know!!! But I hope you found something helpful from my experience. Nonetheless, only you yourself can understand what is best for you and I'm here to help you find that. Please share what stood out the most to you and any other comments you have from my response. I'm so looking forward to hearnig from you and knowing your ways of going into your creativity!!

Making a study plan is always good! I also used to write notes a lot, but something I've learned in the last few years is the importance of active recall and spaced repetition, meaning, quizzing yourself on things and then checking if you got it right and studying over time (ie not cramming! haha - I know this can be hard). I've kind of moved away from writing notes as when I was doing this it was mostly passively writing notes and not actively engaging with the material, and I now use mostly flashcards - I make tons of flashcards.

What do you do when you study? For math, I do the practice questions from my textbook or go over my notes. For science, I like to use flashcards and re-write my notes to memorize the content. For social studies, I will look over my notes and textbook, and sometimes do practice questions from my teacher. Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? I've tried the spaced-out study method, and I found it did work, but sometimes a little bit of cramming is useful the day before the test. I have also tried the interleaving method, which I like, because if I feel overwhelmed, I find it helpful to switch subjects to give my brain a bit of a break.

The method of retrieval practice seems to be the most useful to me as Ive done this, and I found that laying out everything I know is helpful.

I really like accessibility to different shops, restaurants, things to do etc but certain things like traffic can be annoying and in a city its not always practical to drive your own car so you get used to dealing with public transport if you're not in a place where you can get around everywhere on foot. And sometimes I guess it can be annoying how places can get very busy. But I would say cities I've lived in like Vancouver and Montreal are a lot more manageable than some other big cities.

Cities have too many sirens and traffic, including foot traffic and there are people everywhere. I like to be able to find spots that no one has ever been before, and I have all to myself, and be able to sit in silence without the buzz of the city. Two things I don't really enjoy are: The lack of activities and things to do, and sometimes it can become very repetative. One question I would ask is do you ever get overwhelmed? I feel like i would have a hard time navigating myself through the city and have a bit of a sensory overload when there is too much noise around me."," 2022-03-09, 14:03:",Mentee,Posts in From Rural to Urban

Your insights made it easier to follow along with the film, at first I thought I was watching the wrong one, until I saw a type writter and the subway system. I still dont really know where i want to go for post-secondary yet. I do have my family, my friends and my boyfriend here, and back in elemantary i refused to switch schools because I didnt want to leave all these people I knew and go somewhere where I dont know anyone. I was also faced with the choice of moving out of Port Alberni to Alberta during elementary, but we never ended up going through with it. I think back on this a lot because it makes me wonder how things could have or would have gone if I was willing to switch elementary schools or even move to Alberta. Looking back on it now, even the transition from grade 7 in elementary to grade 8 in highschool was a big and scary. But I am in grade 10 now and I am not close friends with one person from my old grade 7 class. So as much as I am nervous for post-secondary, I am also kind of excited. Because I am getting oldering and it is a new opportunity. I dont really know how I feel about moving to a whole new place mainly because I like Port Alberni and how beautiful it is here, but I am aware that there are better places I could go than just the post-secondary here.

Getting to school (or even just getting around the city) using public transportation is quite simple as there are many buses and skytrains.

I hope everything is going well for you my man. You made some great points about living in a rural area. Being in a small town is so community-like and it must be so nice to be surrounded by so many like-minded people, rather than the big city life and the number of different people you bump into on a daily basis. The traffic and commute from place to place I bet is the cherry on the top. I have to deal with so many annoying drivers when I go to school or work, so it must be sick that you never really need to worry about that! I do feel that though, the struggles of being a small community and having very few stores to choose from for sports needs, shoes, or computers. I bet you would have to make the day trip out to the city to do all of that, which is super time-consuming too! There are lots of pros and cons about city and rural living, but it sounds like the community you belong to is a community that cares a lot about you and all other young kids within it! Finding houses, condos, apartments in the lower mainland isn't really difficult because everyone uses social media as a way to show off their listings, like Facebook marketplace, craigslist, and other apps that are designed to find the home best fit for you. Unfortunately, Justin, finding housing is not hard, but finding affordable ones is becoming more difficult to find. In Vancouver, a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom condo/apartment would be upwards of $2000 or more every month with everything included (internet, laundry, parking, hot water). This is where you kind of got to spend some time playing around with these apps by finding first, which city/area is best for you and how close it would be to your school or work. I hope that answers your question, Justin. Please feel free to ask me any more questions about housing or these apps that people use to find housing because Id love to help you out! If you do not have any more questions or you feel like everything was answered, let me know which conversation you would like to start next and we will go from there! Hope to hear from you soon man!

I would also love the quietness and more importantly less traffic in a rural area.

For example, for a 9:00 am class I usually have to wake up at 6 am :(.

This of course all changed once I started going to UBC (a huge school with I don't even know how many students, but a lot for sure). It was definitely overwhelming, but the best part was meeting so many new people and always having so many opportunities to participate in activities/events.

I didn't get the chance to listen to the full Blur album but so far my favorite song is Fade Away :) I realized that, similar to me, most of the students' friends went to a different university than them, so it felt like everyone was eager and happy to talk to each other...I find that's the best part about university--in high school, it's mostly awkward to talk to people you don't know but in uni, people don't mind at all!! I also get what you're saying about needing to go to an urban setting in order to get the trade education you want...I'm not going to lie, it may be a bit challenging at first to get used to some of the changes of urban living (such as costs, increased public, housing etc.), but I think you might end up appreciating both, rural and urban living, after a while :D One of the pros of having lots of public around is that there are also lots of resources available to guide you...for example, my university offers counselling, career etc. services to students which is helpful.

1047550124,1047554090,11/3/2021 18:55,47922,7," Alright very good insights and introspective comments! Reviewing one's own abilities is a super important part of developing one's skills, including one's studying skills. In general, my approach to each class is different. I try to pinpoint what is the main type of studying that I need to practice in a course. Usually I will come up with one (or more) of the following options: memorization, application of memorized information, and application of formulae. First and second year biology is mostly memorization and gradually shifts to application of memorized information, however some classes are actually application of formulae. This makes it tricky because sometimes you may have a class that is in a discipline (such as computer science) where you expect it will be the usual application of formulae, but ends up being just memorization or application of memorized information. So my approaches to each class will depend on which one I identify as the most important part of that class. So for memorization, I use a flashcard-like note-taking system (like Cornell note taking except without the notes summary and following the rules of good flashcards by Dr Piotr Wozniak. Then I put those flashcards into Anki, a flashcard program that uses spaced repetition to give me the cards I need to review each day (basically a flashcard scheduler). Application of memorized information requires the memorization stage to be set and then you can do lot's of practice questions. Meanwhile application of formulae does not require the memorization stage to be set and lends itself best to just doing lot's of practice questions. In computer science, I will imagine that most classes will be ""application of formulae"" classes, but some will likely also be the other two types. Feel free to use my strategies as I have layed them out for you and ask me any follow up questions if you are interested in the specific parts! Also lastly, I find an extra great tip is to put all your assignment deadlines from all classes into your Google calendar and then print that sheet off. Crossing off the assignments as needed is super satisfying and it is so powerful to know 2-3 weeks ahead of time how your homework assignments and midterm dates will clash.

To get comfortable with the traffic, I'd say be a passenger first to observe how people drive in Vancouver and see how the driver deals with certain situations as well!

It's because there are not a lot of activities to do in Duncan, so people resort to spending time with other people. 2. I am constantly exposed to nature which for me is wonderful. I am very much grateful to live where I do because it'll that reason. I have gone to tiny diverse schools, allowing me to experience alternative education, and learning about people from all walks of life. 3. I have easy access to many required things, and they are merely walking distance away. The things I dislike are very important and terrible things. 1. Racism. I have grown up in a place where many indigenous people still live. Everyone else is pretty much white, and on the daily I witness acts of hate and racism towards the local Indigenous people. 2. Many things that may be necessities are not around, and sometimes we have to wait for awhile before we can get access to those things. One question I have is related to nature.

For example, it would be a nightmare to take math notes on a laptop, but typing is much easier in other courses!

1047514148,1047554080,10/9/2020 17:42,47906,3," Hi Catherine, Regarding your questions: One question I have about living in a big city is how much preparation and time you should account for when planning your commute to school or around town. Since you mentioned that you will be going to UBC , I'll narrow my answer to that but generally it should still be applicable to other big cities as well. It highly depends on where you will be living in Vancouver. For example, if you are choosing to stay at the UBC residence, then there is going to be very little commute to the uni however keep in mind that UBC campus is HUGE and a lot of times the classes are back to back with just 10 mins to get to the next class and usually as the first/second year classes are more introductory (not very specialized), they can be in different parts of the campus. Some students bike to their next class, others leave a bit early from the class to get to the next one. Another thing to mention is that first year classes normally have 200+ students so it can be very packed so account that into your timing to ensure you can grab a decent seat. If you are planning to live near Kitsilano or downtown Vancouver, then it is just one or perhaps 2 buses you will need to take. In my experience from living in Van, I recall that the buses get VERY FULL at times that go to UBC campus (especially mornings), so they would skip stops because they can't load anymore people so prepare for that and best to give yourself enough margin to account for that. If you will be staying in Surrvey, realistically the commute would be quite tough - would need to take multiple buses, sky train etc. And the weather in Vancouver is mostly wet so preparing for that weather and dressing properly is also very important. Commuting around town is similar - lots of places are accessible via sky train and it is much faster to commute using that than driving yourself. There are TONS of malls that the sky train stops by so that is easily accessible as well. It is very common for people to take the bus as well to get around Vancouver because gas/driving/parking fees can be expensive and stressful. The nice thing with Vancouver is that there are LOTS of public commute available and the time between each bus at the stop is very small so if you miss a bus, or need a bus, they come by quickly and frequently. Also what are some things you should keep in mind for commuting and using transit generally? My rule of thumb with public transports in to be vigilant at all times. Carry minimal items with me - for instance, I keep a small wallet with just basic cards that I need in case I may lose it or anything, that it would be easy to replace. Keeping a good quality umbrella with me, and dressing for the weather and for changes in the weather because Vancouver weather is unpredicatable at times. Let family/partner/roommate whoever you will be living with know your basic whereabouts as well. Keep a power bank or charger with you in case your phone battery runs out. There is no one way to get to a place, so prepare in advance looking at different routes/modes of transportation to decide what is best for you. Few comments about the things you like/dislike about living in a smaller town: I can definitely understand and resonate with the comfort of knowing everyone in the town and feeling safe in the familar space. From my experience at bigger univerisities, I found that it is important to mentally prepare for social downtime, especially if you would be living off campus. There are activities and events for first year students to mingle and socialize, so definitely take advantage of that to meet like-minded people. Bigger cities are expensive but there are lots of different entertainments and activities that are for students to enjoy especially since there are usually lots of businesses that give student discounts - so that might come in handy too. Going with public transport instead of your car is much cheaper as well. Getting a roommate instead of your own place also helps. Hope this is helpful! Enjoy your spring break and talk to you soon :) "," 2022-03-16, 11:30:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

This is one of my favorites becasue I learn a lot from it too and because having good study habits right off the bat is going to make quite a few aspects of post secondary easier for you. Check out the 6 study habits video and also if you like take a peek at the Crash Course one as well. Then, let me know what you found interesting/new in the video and what stood out most for you. We can also go over some of the questions above such as: How do you study now? What do you find easiest/hardest about studying? What do you find works/doesn't work in terms of studying? What's a new tactic you would try? What's your ultimate goal when you study? I'm also more than happy to talk about what i've learned about studying over the years and what I find works best for me when studying specific subjects areas (math vs biology vs english)! A large component of developing good study habits is TRIAL AND ERROR which can be a bit annoying but at the end of the day it really pays off and often alleviates a lot of stress to which will make learning and your degree path more rewarding.

On one hand, finding inspiration or an idea to build on can truly come out of the blue, when youre thinking to yourself at night or travelling home. But its rare that someone who doesnt want to create something can get an idea they want to, and have the skills to build on. Once that initial spark is ignited, the flames must be tended to. The fire needs to breathe, and it will only grow if given enough fuel. But if left to fester without proper care, either the fire will eat itself alive or consume everything in its path. To me, inspiration is that spark that starts. But how to handle that spark- if to let it grow into fire, or run through a copper wire, or perhaps even snuff it out, that drive is true creation.

Although it is true that it just comes naturally, you have to be open to it coming and know a bit about how to act on it. For instance, there is no reason for me to get inspiration to open a skateboarding shop when I don't know how to skateboard lol. Inspiration is such a tricky thing, because even when it does suddenly come to you, it can just as quickly leave you :( leaving you with a pile of work in progresses along with it going. You not only have to have inspiration, you also must have passion, and drive. You have to want to complete the things which you have started even when inspiration has left you. its a lot of hard work too"," 2022-03-16, 17:24:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

I got into contact with a teacher who studies psychology at my school and set up a time to talk. We talked about what it is going to take to get into psychology(openmindedness, patience, etc.) and a university, in Toronto, that would be good to look into in a year or two if I'm still interested in psychology then. We continuted to talk on to other paths I could take, like teaching, and how psychology knowledge could take enhance your understanding of your students. Second off, I got time to sit down with my boss and discuss becoming a ""crew trainer,"" which is one step above ""crew"" and one step below ""shift"" or ""swing manager"" and what respondsibilities it will take to become one and contine to maintain being one.

Studying for me is usually at a later time at night, I have always seemed to procrastinate and hold off untill the final days instead of spliting it up. I know to most that sounds like a bad thing but I find that for myself it works out quite well. In school we are always taught to study for about an hour a day and to not procrastinate. I personally think that your studying should be based around you. For example I tend to read things one day and a couple days later I will forget almost every drop of information i had read that day. This is why i feel that holding off untill the last couple days works for me just so all the information is still fresh in my head. Some of the best skills and strategies I find very useful that the video used are taking notes and being able to manage the time that you use for studying. I think it is highly likely that I will try managing my time better. Hope you are having a Great week! "," 2022-03-17, 12:37:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

1047550124,1047554090,11/3/2021 18:55,47922,3," Compared to Prince Rupert, Vancouver is always super busy especially during 7-9am and 4-7pm. The quietest time is probably around 11am. Sometimes it takes me 40-50 mins just to drive the 12km to UBC. Meanwhile taking a bus there would take about an hour and a half. One thing I noticed is that it's better to take a bus when you are travelling during rush hour because the cars generally won't move faster than the buses during that time. It can be noisy if you are along the main roads, but otherwise it's not too loud on the regular streets. To put the size of Vancouver in perspective, the whole of Prince Rupert could fit in just downtown Vancouver. Downtown is about 1/10 the size of the rest of Vancouver not including Greater Vancouver like Richmond, Burnaby, and Surrey (all of which is connected by the Skytrain). If you get to live in Vancouver you definitely will have a lot to explore! After moving there from Chilliwack (which is about 3 times the size of Prince Rupert) I found how awesome it was to have literally sooooooooooooooooo many food options. Whereas usually in Chilliwack, there would be only one restaurant for a certain type of cuisine. Being a coastal city, Vancouver is also super rainy, which is why a lot of people invest in waterproof shoes or just wear short boots all the time (I've opted for the latter). People also tend to use umbrellas a lot rather than rain jackets which I found really weird, coming from a small town. I still prefer to just use my rain jacket, because I really don't like carrying an umbrella around. Last year during the summer, things were INCREDIBLY hot. Usually in July and August it is quite hot, but last year was something else. I would highly recommend spending some time in Vancouver over the summer to explore a bit and get some bearings on what the SFU/Langara campuses are like as well as the surrounding area. Also, try to familiarize yourself with the transit system and see if it fits your needs before buying a car or anything like that. Well have a fun spring break!

1047514152,1047554099,10/9/2020 17:42,47927,1," Hello Shay. After watching the video about how to study effectivly, I can come to the conclusion that I can see which studying tools I use and the ones I don't. Dont procrastinate. The first stategy I use often is the switching srategy. Whether it's in the real world or with the books I often switch my thinking between subjects. I try to find how different ideas are connected, and the ways they compliment each other. I'm very good at finding multiple solutions to a common problem. I have the right understanding on how much time I need to spend studying and analyzing a topic before I can move on. Another studying srategy I utilize is the elaboration strategy. When I'm at school I'm constantly asking myself how and why things work. It helps me figure out every little detail which grants me a greater understanding of the material. I also find myself explaing out questions to my peers. It shows me that if I can teach the material to other people than I have a good grasp on the material. What I realy need to work on is my procrastination. I often find myself stressing about upcoming events. In the time leading up to those events I just tell myself that I'll work or study later. I continue to push my problems to the future until there's no where left to push. I really struggle with finding motivation and discipline to sit down and just study. There's always so much distractions that seem more invititing and require less brain power. I have been trying to work on limiting my time watching media in order to solve this problem. My question for you is if you utilize these studying strategys. What do you find works and resonates with you? Do you struggle with procrastination, and how would you try to get out of the habit of procrastinating. "," 2022-03-17, 22:59:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

1047514152,1047554099,10/9/2020 17:42,47927,5," Hey Ronin, Really awesome points that you mentioned here, and sounds like you're really attentive to yourself and what works or doesn't for you. It's such a key part of being effective. It also seems that you have genuine interest in lots of things you do, which I think makes it much easier to accomplish what you go for. If you choose goals that you're passionate about, or at least can create some internal hype about - it really helps. I also find that teaching others is the absolute best way for me to drill in the understanding of something. Even if I don't know it **all**, but well enough to help someone understand a concept, while I also solidify my grasp on it. It's golden. About procrastination - I hear you! I think it's the story of our time and age, with the overflow of content that targets our attention and engagement mechanisms (I can talk about this for days, let me know if you're curious). And the tasks we actually have to do have a hard time competing - they don't give us as much positive feedback, rewards are sometimes delayed (studying hard now but getting a good grade only in a few months). This can make motivating ourselves more difficult. So I find that managing your own ""reward policy"" is helpful: instead of trying to sit myself down for hours, I do short 20-30 minute work sessions (on the internet they call these pomodoros, you can look it up). I take 5 minute breaks between those, in which I either intentionally do something enjoyable, or just let myself off the self-control hook. I use a timer to prevent getting sucked up into the abyss of online content. This way, there is a small reward for working for 30 minutes - I get a nice break during which I can do something nice - which I DON'T feel guilty about. How nice? I also find physical movement very important in stopping those procrastination snowballs. When you've been sitting for a long time and reach for your phone to ""check what's going on"", that's your brain looking for stimulus, because you've been idle and staring at the same thing for too long. I find that doing some exercise either indoor or outdoor, taking a shower, going for a short walk, whatever really - really helps me break up those long slogs and reduce the need to look for more interesting stuff. Also, I think procrastination has a lot to do with how the task makes you feel, and I have lots to say about that - but let's keep it for the next post just to not go super long.

I think it had sort of the same vibe as Langley; not a small town but also not very city-like. I like living in a rural area for the most part. Prince Rupert is a very tight knit community. Everybody knows everybody else and their business. I like that there are lots of work opportunities available for young people because we have so much industry up here. There are also many city jobs up here which gives students a chance to make more money in their first few years of working My parents like to say that living in a small town is difficult because you have everything you need but not everything you want. Its practically impossible to take first aid courses up here because there are only 3 people certified to teach in the whole of Prince Rupert. That is why I had to travel to Kamloops to take my National Lifeguard certification. Additionally, it can be difficult to break into social circles if youre new to the community because most people who live in Prince Rupert have been here their whole lives. I wonder if it is like this is all rural communities or just mine. The rural to urban conversation was a bad one to end on because it is in two parts!

I am sos orry to hear that you see acts of racism quite frequently, and also have some difficulty accessing some necessities. Granted, when living in an urban area, racism is still present, but of course you do not see it on a daily basis. Also, living in an urban city like Vancouver or Burnaby, for example, there is also quite easy access to many resources and amentities, even if not within walking distance, they are still very accessible by transit which would be within walking distance! That was a great question you had about my ability to access nature. I live in Surrey, where there are many small parks that include forests, as well as two beaches where you can walk right into the ocean (mostly in the summer, otherwise it's too cold). If you are willing to travel though, there are also a lot of large parks and beaches in Vancouver that are much more abundant than in Surrey. Additionally, there are lakes and trails that range from drives of 40 minute to a few hours, and if you are willing to do those drives, those are great places to experience nature. In other worse, yes nature is accessible here in the urban areas, however they might not be as close as what you're used to living in a rural area.

Small colleges are always a great option, I beleive to start out in post-secondary because of the small campus, small class sizes and more one-on-one time with your professors to get help. I would do a search on what is available around your area and look at what programs they offer. Any college should offer an associate of science degree which is a 2 year science degree that you could transfer anywhere after you complete it.

I like to use review and practice and that's what I use but I herd flash cards work well. as well practicing work is also a good one that I do. making links strategy they said in the video and intervals were cool where you switch topics I thinks that's what that are called pls correct me if I'm wrong the one about asking questions to your self and writing down the things you know spoke to me. as well afterwards going back to make sure it's correct of course and then you know what to study. I think I should take notes in math now but I don't know how I would so if you have any tips for taking notes for math that would be great. The page set up really helped. My questions to you is how do you study there is a lot of information you learn in a day how do you remember it all? This subject really helps me we don't really learn how to do this in school so it's cool to see something new. ," 2022-03-21, 22:16:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

1047516507,1047551609,11/27/2020 16:54,46782,47," Ya I always think it would be beneficial for schools to teach us how to study before it becomes a necessity! Everyone has a different method that works for them so it's great that you're trying out different techniques now instead of later on when the stakes are higher. I think the way you study should be tailored to fit the subject you're studying for. Flashcards are great for subjects that are all about memorization like anatomy (I love the website quizlet to make digital flashcards!!), but might not work so well for classes like math or physics where it's more application-based. In those types of classes, I like to write out my notes in a way where I break down problems into steps. So if I was taking notes for a specific unit in math, I would list every type of problem I need to know for the test, then write an example problem of each type where each step is showcased very clearly. That way, I can get really comfortable with the steps of each problem and see where my gaps in understanding are. When it comes to taking notes in class, I think it's easy to get carried away with writing down everything the teacher says, which can actually distract me from truly listening to what they're saying. Instead, I like to be very selective with my notes, and listen for cues that tell me I should be writing something down. For example, when a teacher says 'the key to this is...' or 'students often get confused about...' or 'the take home point is...' I know that's something I should probably take note of. This just takes practice, but over time, you'll come to notice those types of cues that will help with note taking. If a class has a ton of information for me to learn each day, I think it all comes down to repetition. I have to constantly be reviewing those topics and checking my understanding so I don't get lost as the class moves forward. One thing that helps me is to practice explaining concepts to friends that are in the same class. Sometimes we all just sit down together and take turns going over things that didn't make sense to us in class. I'll also make review sheets where I look at my notes from class and try to condense them down to the most important points. I think of all these strategies as 'active studying' which always works better for me than 'passive studying' which is basically just reading over notes. I can get distracted much more easily when I'm passively studying so I try not to do that too often. "," 2022-03-22, 11:50:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

1047516507,1047551609,11/27/2020 16:54,46782,63," I agree! I think admissions should definitely focus on more than just grades. Physio schools usually accept any Undergraduate degrees as long as you have fulfilled the prerequisites (usually prereqs are anatomy/physiology, a couple psychology courses, English, etc. but it depends on the school). One thing I wish someone had told me in high school about applying to physio is that UBC requires Physics 12 or a first year university physics course. They are the only physio school that requires it, but I ended up having to take a physics course last Summer because in high school I only took physics in grade 11. I took biomechanics in university and that didn't count as a physics either - UBC is pretty strict with their prereqs! So if you think you might want to apply to UBC physio, it would probably be a good idea to take that course while you're still in high school. A Social Work degree would definitely be acceptable for physio and I think it's a great idea to have an undergrad that you could get a job with after 4 years. That way if you change your mind or if it takes a couple tries to get in to physio, you'll still have a great career set up for you! So as long as you can take those prereqs while in Social Work, I think that would work well. "," 2022-03-27, 11:29:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

Everybody knows everybody and there are a lot of connections to different people, so it's easy to feel comfortable in the community. 2. It's easy to find jobs because there aren't a lot of people in the area 3. It's easy to make a big group of friends since everybody knows everybody. Two things I don't like about living in a rural area are: 1. There isn't much to do since there aren't many buisnesses and activities to do and when there are, they're very limited. 2. As much as there is areas to feel comfortable in, there are also places to feel uncomfortable. A large amount of poverty and homlessness plagues my town and many other rural places. Question about moving from Rural to Urban: I have always felt more inclined to be in bigger cities and I hope to someday live in one, but as someone who has lived in small towns their whole life, I have little idea of what city life is like.

I actually grew up in a small town outside of the city, and it was so nice to recognize people instead of constantly seeing new faces and having no sense of familiarity.

To answer your question, I like living in the city because everything is so close by. For example, if I need to pick up something from the grocery store, it is a 3 minute drive, or if I want to get food take-out, there are tons of places that are a short drive away for me to choose from. Also, I like to travel to Vancouver sometimes just for a change of scenery, and I like that I can drive to the skytrain and go to Vancouver that way, or I can just drive directly. In other words, everything is pretty transit accessible when living in a city. There are also many things to do in the city, such as visit arcades, go to the malls, bowling alleys, different art classes, etc. What I dislike about living in the city is how busy it is! The traffic is quite bad during rush hour (2:30 pm - 6:00 pm), and if you are living in a city like Vancouver, it gets quite loud at nighttime on Fridays and Saturdays, as everyone is out partying! If you are planning to transit and live in the city, if you have to travel during rush hour, it is important to schedule enough time to get to your desination, and sometimes this could involve leaving 2 hours early. So, there are definitely pros and cons to living in an urban area! How are you feeling about living in the city after considering these things?

You make some great points about living rurally, as those are often the factors people like and dislike. As someone that has lived in a few cities, I would describe urban living as loud, bustling, and crowded. Personally, I do not favour living in the city because it is hard to find peace and quiet, or even just a minute to yourself. Even in small cities, as the one I currently live in once was, everything is in a constant state of movement because there are more people coming into the city, which means a lot of building and construction. I think the main thing to consider about living in the city is what is most important to you, because the positives that you see in rural living are very hard to find in urban living. And though cities have activities and fun things to do, you will see much more homelessness and poverty in cities because urban living is expensive and it can be hard for many people to find jobs or live comfortably. One last thing: if youre searching for more movement, or an increase in the general pace of life, then cities are great, but if you are looking for something comfortable with a moderate pace, then a city is not the place to look.

Usually the pomodoro technique is based on 25 min study intervals, separated by 5 min breaks. I find it useful because 25 mins doesn't feel too long, but if you're really focused you can get a lot done. If I'm having a hard time concentrating and feel like I've just been staring at a computer screen for hours without being productive, I'll just do 5 rounds of these intervals and I find it gets me in a good work flow."," 2022-03-30, 18:02:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

Backup plans and diversifying your skills are very important. When you have the time, you could also consider looking into concurrent teaching programs. One of my friends is doing one at UBC. Not every university has them and not all majors are accepted for it, but essentially you take both the bachelor's degrees you need (the one in your specialized area - English in this case AND the one you need to become a teacher) at the same time. For example, my friend is in physics and education, so he takes some of each every year instead of doing four years straight of physics before starting his education degree.

It means looking at it from different perspectives and researching the topic further to better understand the material. What do you do when you study? When I study, I look over all the material multiple times, and ask questions or research them if I do not understand it fully. After that, I get someone to quiz me on the subject to make certain that I fully understand the material given. What have you been previously taught about how to study? I have always been taught to make sure I understand what I am studying and not simply memorize it. I have also been taught to look over the material again right before bed so that it will be fresh in my mind for the morning Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? I have tried a number of these strategies, and have found that, so far, most of these have not worked particularly well for me. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. I did find that relating real life knowledge to the material helped me understand it better, and using real life examples also helped. Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the case? I Would find that spreading out my studying over time would make it more difficult for me to understand and remember for later. Do you have any questions about these strategies? Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? I think that if they added getting someone to quiz you rather than writing down what you can remember at the time. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? I do not think that I will be trying these strategies because they would not work for me and my learning style.

Eventually, I learned that i study best when I am able to set up questions and answer them to test my knowledge.

For example, some grant you guaranteed acceptance into the education program with this path. Although this isn't an absolute, most people I've spoken to find education programs to be quite easy compared to their specialized area of study. My friend views education classes as a break because his physics classes are so much work! Many concurrent programs let you take a mix of these classes, which can help you balance the workload. It really depends on how sure you are of this path.

I enjoy the multitude of things to do in cities, and there is more oppertunity to meet many different types of people from all walks of life. I also just genuinly feel very uncomfortable in cities.

When I study now, I tend to go over tests and worksheets, reviewing my steps to going over work and practising further on the subject. This or reviewing notes is how I study. The hardest thing for me about studying is just repetition. I tend to get bored and find it monotonous and believe there are more fun/entertaining things for me to do. What works for me is simply memorising the notes/content we have learned specifically the day/night before the test. The sense of urgency/ lack of time gets me to finish it faster/ more efficiently. A new strategy I can use for studying is going over it with a friend, teaching them (even if they already know it), just to verbalise it in my own words. My goal for studying is to memorise each and every step it takes to solve any certain problem needed for the next day, for every type of problem. These problems can be math problems, with specific steps to a long winded solution, English or any real problem that I should remember. This and recalling the theory in a test is my goal (memorising the content). Thank you for all of your insight during this program! I have learned alot and definitely feel it has gotten me a little more mentally prepared for my future. Im still hoping I get into UVic and see what it is like living in a new environment.

I like living in a small area because its a lot harder to get lost after a few visit, the people in the community are usually very nice and understanding, and having family in the same area as you makes seeing them much easier. Though I like living in a small area it also has its down side. Like there can be a lot of traffic that feels like it will never calm down and the fact that everyone knows everyone which is not something a person with social anxiety will enjoy. (I dont really have any questions) I would also like to thank you for being my mentor and talking to me about all these topics.

To answer your questions: 1) My favourite part of living in a city is probably my ability to hang out with friends. In the city we can do anything at any time, even just drive around in the middle of the night sometimes, and it's definitely a lot of fun to have that option. 2) I would definitely prefer to live in a rural areas- I'm a total homebody so I just need a quiet place to be- and I am actually in the process of planning to move to a smaller town, just a couple hours away from my current home. 3) If I could change anything, I would live in a quieter area so that I can have a balance between calm and crazy!

I actually don't live in a very big city (not as big as Vancouver anyways), but it is one of the more popular smaller cities in the Lower Mainland. It sounds like it may be a good option for you to live in smaller city like Surrey, Langley, Delta, or New Westminister (if you are wanting to stau=y in BC), as these are definitely not as busy or crowded as Vancouver. In these areas, there are a lot more suburban neighborhoods that are quiet and family-oriented. Living in one of these towns also gives you the opportunity to travel to a bigger city like Vancouver when you want to! This way, you don't have to be there 24/7, but you can visit when you feel like doing some of the cool things that are offered in Van! Since I live in Surrey (a fairly busy city), it hasn't been too bothersome for me. I actually quite like it. There is a lot here, and it is just a 30 minute skytrain or 40 minute drive to Vancouver. I don't think living in Surrey has caused any big changes to myself as a person or in my life, especially because I was born in Surrey, so it's all I've ever known! I definitely don't think I would be able to move to a very small suburban town though. I am too much of a city person. :)"," 2022-04-05, 18:32:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

One of things I like about living in a rural area is that I knew everyone and IDK how to explain why. Another thing I like about living in a rural area is that it's so quiet in the morning because I love waking up to birds chirping in the morning. My last thing I like about living in a rural area is that it's right next to the beach because I love walking down the with the sun setting. 2. I actually only have one thing I don't like and that there are very few stores where I live so my parents have to drive 80-90 kms just to go grocery shopping. 3.

1047550080,1047554026,11/2/2021 18:21,47861,11," Hi Andrew! It is so interesting reading your answers to the questions! From what I read, it is vastly different living in a rural area than urban area. For starters, I do not know everyone in my area, much less my neighborhood. Even though I live in a quiet neighborhood, it still can be pretty noisy in the mornings as there is a main street not far from where I live and I can hear all the cars in the morning commute. However, I can imagine it is much noisier nearer downtown. It is also interesting that there is no near grocery stores near you, and you have to drive a long distance just to get groceries! This is very different from my experience as I do not have to drive that far. In response to your question, from my experience the nearest main street isn't directly outside my doorstep but I can still hear the cars driving by. I think people just slowly get used to the sounds of morning commute after living in the area for a long time! But I agree with you that first-timers may not be able to stand the sounds of morning commute. That being said, it sounds relaxing to have quiet mornings and it would be a nice change of pace to hear the sounds of birds chirping in the morning for an urban habitant. That being said, I also have a question to ask you! If there are no near grocery stores for you, are there any public services/stores near where you live?

1047514152,1047554099,10/9/2020 17:42,47927,3," Hi shay, I really enjoyed hearing about your study habits. As someone who struggles with keeping attention, it's really helpful to see other ways of tackling the problem. I tend to burn out by the hour mark so I like your way of splitting up time. As someone who always has their phone on them at all time, it can sometimes be really hard to pull away from it. It's very addictive. I think the 30 minute breaks will greatly benefit me, as your not outright stopping using your phone, but rather limiting the time you can spend on it. I like what you also said about physical movement. Whenever I know I need to study but just don't have the motivation, I tend to just get up and walk around. It feels like a reset for your barin and gets the gears turning again. The last point I wanted to touch on is my interest on the tasks. I find that a lot of school work just doesn't motivate me. It's tricky because even if you are not interested, you still have to do it...that's school. When I get work from school that I do enjoy, things change. Suddenly I'm motivated, energized and want to get the job done. I see this mindset in my grades. I just wish I could put in the same amount of efort into the things I don't really enjoy."," 2022-04-06, 21:54:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

All of these photographers pulled from what they have experienced to show images in a new light, and give to images feeling and life. The idea is to find what you are the most passionate or interested in, and finding a personal level to the career. Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea I think that a lot of people work jobs that they don't like for the sake of possible failure or instability, and it's important for people to find careers that inspire them and make them want to wake up and work everyday. Otherwise, they will have a career that doesn't make them happy and makes them dread going to everyday. You only live once, and I personally wouldn't want a career that I don't have a reason to wake up for. How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future. This will of course apply to my future, as I need to make money and think about my education in correlation to career choices. This generally makes me think more about taking a gap year to do internships or try different career paths, before paying a lot of money to study something I am not that into. I also understand that you don't need to go to university for every career, and I don't want to go to university for the sake of doing it, I want to have a reason or an inspiration.

T___T Long story short, my laptop decided to go into an early retirement and no longer turn on, which meant I've been navigating everything via my iPad for the last week. I just took the plunge today and am writing this on my new lappy (goodness are laptops expensive nowadays!) I sincerely hope you've been well during this time... Well, at least I hope you've been better than my old laptop LOL. I do have one more interview on Tuesday so I hope to get back to you with good news next week! Fingers crossed, and thanks again for your patience during this crazy time in my life x). Anyways, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CAPSTONE AGAIN. Seriously, I'm so glad your work is gaining attention, because not only did you put in a ton of effort (and scored 100% which I will forever be proud of!!!) but I think this is an excellent way for you to network, connect with likeminded students who may be your peers in the future, and get valuable experience with presenting. Seriously, shout out to that teacher for getting your project in! And just think... This is just the beginning with your Capstone. Imagine when you do future research projects, presentations, etc. I can't wait to read your future publications one day. ;)) Speaking of practicing presenting, while I'm not sure how prevalent presentations are in more STEM based courses, I had a professor who made sure to have final presentations in every one of her class. There was a dress code (business casual), time limit (&lt;10 minutes), slide limit, and besides her own marking, she would have random peers in our class evaluate our presentation skills. While this was absolutely nervewracking, she made a point that she wanted to prepare us for the future when we would have to stand in front of professionals and present our work - better to gain experience practicing with our peers as students. That's why I think this is a great opportunity to be in that environment of people coming up to you and asking more about your work. You'll do great! ?? So glad to be back!

It helps oneself feel closer to the nature and beautiful architect surrounding the environment they live on. As someone who has lived in a small town where fortunately, First Nations culture is very much embraced throughout the town, I've fallen in love with the energy and welcomeness that First Nations people express. Starting from a young age I've taken Sm'algyax classes. Not only have I learned to appreciate the language itself, but through it I've learned that the land is a sacred, vital part of our lives that we must protect. I agree, traditional and scientific knowlegde can work together to protect the land from manmade pollutants and threats. Traditional knowledge can offer information about the land and environment accross many generations and geographies of actual residents in the area. This information and be used to expand past, present and future scientific studies to benefit the land and environment. "," 2022-04-10, 23:41:",Mentee,Posts in Ways of Knowing

1047549915,1047549055,10/30/2021 18:39,45996,5," Hi Kaya! It's great to chat with you again :) Thanks for sharing what stood out to you. I think it is definately valuable to spend time considering what you want to do before jumping in to university. I think that is one of my biggest regrets from one I applied to schools back in grade 12. I wasn't 100% sure about what I wanted to do, even though I had a broad idea about what I wanted to do. I think it's that you're taking time to consider trying lots of different internships to get a sense of what interests you. But, I think it's also normal and natural to be interested by lots of different things and want to change your mind later on as well. I am very late into my degree but I have been considering careers completely unrelated to the subject matter I learned. While I loved what my degree focussed on, I am interested in a variety of different careers and I think I have invested time into developing transferrable skills and soft skills and gaining experiences that would be applicable to a variety of careers. So there doesn't necessarily have to be any fear attached to the idea of not loving or being 100% attached to a career propsect when you're entering university. However, you do bring up valid concerns about wages, and the costs associated with a post-secondary education and it is a good thing to consider those before starting a degree. I think one idea in the video that stood out to me was: ""I think to even parktake in creation, you start with an intention.. You have a want...a desire that needs to be filled"" . I think this stood out to me in a broader sense, not neccesarily related to simply creativity, but making decisions. When you choose to do something ,there is an intention behind it. When I chose to pursue a post-secondary education, my intentions were broad but there was intent behind my decisions. I wanted to pursue a career that required a post-secondary education, I didn't feel ready to enter the workforce without further specialized education, and I wanted to be a part of an environment and community that challenged me and pushed me to grow and learn constantly. My intention matched my desire. I think it's interesting to reflect on how our intentions, desire, and wants influence our decisions. "," 2022-04-11, 00:26:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

There isnt really a place where there is lots of shops/stores to go, its mostly all just department stores and fishing stores.

1047551774,1047554022,11/26/2021 12:40,47863,5," Interesting! Coming from a small town myself, I share some of those views as well. I didn't appreciate the small town vibe as much when I was younger because it was all I had ever known. I had this golden view of the city, thinking it was so much better than rural life, but that hasn't been the case for me. Getting around isn't as easy, but it's not too, too difficult so I wouldn't worry about that too much. There are a lot of people though, and, at least in Vancouver, you're not too far away from that natural scenery that you like. There's definitely a lot more to do, but that depends on what you like doing, haha! I complained about being bored a lot when I was in high school, and then I went to Vancouver and realized that I really just enjoy the usual indoor stuff (anime, video games, etc.). Now, I don't mind the quieter rural life at all! Of course, it's nice to get out once in a while, but I don't need to do that often so a small trip into the city (from a rural town) isn't too big of a deal to me (this includes things like shopping). Do you think you'd like to settle down in a city one day or are you quite comfortable with rural life? Most people I know love the city life. Some places are still alive during the night (for parties and dancing, etc.) but that's not my cup of tea. Lots to explore, but it's really up to you and how interested you are in exploring these things. I do think city life favours those with lots of extra money to spend on all these activities though.

They were pretty informative, and theres definately strategies that were mentioned that I'd like to be comfortable with doing before post secondary. So usually my studying is pretty similar to the tips mentioned in the video. Avoid cramming, use words and visuals, and ask lots of clarifying questions. The video also mentions a method where you write down everything you already know, then compare it to your class material. I think that will be super usefull in my upcoming units! Really excited to experement with that new technique. I haven't been ""taught"" how to study, so learning new approaches and takes on this kind of stuff really helps. In addition to studying, I looked into ""The Pomodoro Technique"". To my suprise I already study in that kind of format by using a timer and taking short breaks in between work blocks. It's worked well for me and I've reccomended classmates to try it as well. The note taking video was also informative!

1047516499,1047540775,11/27/2020 16:54,40437,7," Hi, I'm happy your back. Sorry about your old laptop though :( Updates from the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair: 1) there was HUGE student interest in my project, there was over 200 project and so many people were talking about mine. When I would meet new people, they would ask what my project was and I would tell them and they would say things like ""oh you're the one who did that? People are talking about it on the other side of the room!"" ""Oh, I heard about your project."" Etc... 2) I won bronze! I liked that I gained respect for my ideas from people who understood my ideas. I also enjoyed proving myself, people realized that they shouldn't underestimate me or my idea just because I don't go to a private school or I haven't done IB/AP (my school doesn't offer it). I like the idea of a presentation final project but it depends on the class. I can imagine some of the presentations would be boring. It would be great practice though. Ways of Knowing This is not what I was expeting for this topic. What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? You can study something as much as you want, but living the experience/living in the place is completely different. You could read everything about a place but when you live there for a bit you learn about the people, the customs, the hidden places, where to go/where to avoid. I think when you live somewhere you can understand it on a much deeper level. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor No? How might know the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? It might encourage us to be more thoughtful about how we use it. From my understanding, indigenous people were very good at running the land they lived on and the habitats around it, perhaps we would benefit from incorporating some of those into our lives. Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Scientific knowledge is viewed as better and more advanced but I think that they can often be viewed together. One type of knowledge isnt better than the other, both have pros and cons and they can be better when combined. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledge working together? They conflict with each other because people think science has no traditional knowledge. People like to reject the past when thinking of science, yet traditional knowledge tends to contain science without clearly stating the science behind it. ( I heard this somewhere, Im going off memory, might not be 100% accurate) Indigenous people would/will only peel the bark off certain sides of the trees because certain sides (i forget which) are needed more to protect the tree and if you damage the tree on those sides it will have a higher chance of dying. The reason some sides are more susceptible is that weather is harsher from certain directions, the sun shines from east to west (more growth where the sun shines), etc Where does this program find these videos?

I realize that my last message might've been a lot to go through at once so I propose we go through this module one question a time, together. The first question is: ""Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it"" I grew up in Aldergrove, BC, which is a small suburban community in the Lower Mainland. Since graduating high school, I moved to Vancouver where I spent the last ~8 years as a student at UBC. So it's pretty safe to say that I have minimal experience living in a rural area. However, I did have the chance to live in Williams Lake and Fraser Lake, each for a month, during rural electives that I did in medical school. The first thing I liked about these communities is how tight-knit and friendly the residents were. For example, pretty soon after moving to Fraser Lake the grocery clerks and gym staff in the local plaza all got to know me on a first-name basis and made me feel welcomed. The second thing that I liked about living in these rural communities was the close proximity to nature. I went on beautiful hikes and spent lots of time outdoors, which was really refreshing compared to living in the hustle and bustle of downtown Vancouver. Lastly, another thing that I enjoyed was pace of the communities. Things moved at a slower pace, it felt like people weren't always rushing around like they tend to do in bigger cities. Anyways, I hope that helped spark some curiosity for you. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and opinions! Cheers, Damon "," 2022-04-19, 17:32:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

So I'm in the middle of a chemistry unit, and my peers and I are learning a LOT of new information. So sometimes studying alone isn't efficient. Many of my classmates are timid when asking questions in class, so being in a small group is a bit more encouraging. In the case that one of us doesn't understand a concept, theres a chance another one of us will, and they can explain the concept instead. In theory this works pretty well, but only if EVERYBODY is on task. If one group member isn't working everybody ends up distracted lol. "," 2022-04-19, 17:43:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying

If you recall a few conversations ago, we talked about getting into research at the start of undergrad: Certain schools distribute research awards across their faculties, where students receive a stipend to conduct research with their professor(s) and a chance to present their findings (Like UVic's JCURA). There are also awards like the NSERC / USRA that are nationally awarded in Canada, which can help fund your research as an undergraduate student too. As you start your studies and begin reaching out to potential professors / P.I.'s, keep awards and grants like these in mind! Not only do I think you'd be a strong candidate to win these research awards, but having formal presentation experience + an established interest in research can help you stand out as a prospective research assistant to your future professors. Just keep your head up and keep trying (as securing funding for anything can be so iffy)! I think no matter where we go, we always run the chance of meeting those who undermine others. But you've got a strong foundation and you've got something to prove! You just keep doing what's important to you, and I know it'll pay off. :) Haters can just stay in their lane lol. - - What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? I totally agree with your answer on this one. I said this during one of my interviews - It's one thing to study a patient's chart, but it's another to actually handle it. Living on the land exposes you to lived experiences, whereas studying the land can only immerse you so much. However, there is value in both experiences, it's just a matter on what you are trying to achieve. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor. ""No?"" LOL. Your answer cracked me up, but honestly, I don't think I have any stories either. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? Totally with you on this one! When I visited Halifax a few years ago, I noticed their trees were so much smaller than on the westcoast. While I'm not entirely certain on the history behind the reason, it would definitely make me think twice before cutting one down for resources (From memory, I remember being told it was due to logging / an accident that affected the trees? Correct me if I'm wrong tho.) Do you agree that scientific knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than traditional knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I think ""scientific"" knowledge is more accepted than ""traditional"" knowledge when it comes to standard science / studies. I think there is more openness to different types of knowledge, and with that comes more opportunities to collaborate with others and advance our studies together. There doesn't have to be a divide between ""science"" and ""tradition"", when we can start building a history utilizing both. Why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show scientific and traditional knowledges working together? When you think of scientific knowledge, you think objectivity, you think quantitative, and you think replicable. You can't express sig figs differently from one person to the next, because no matter how you experience science, it's typically stable. I hope that makes sense. However, with traditional knowledge, this comes with experience. This comes with stories, with trials and errors, and the feelings that take part in that. I feel there is a conflict between the two, because as you said, people may reject one in favour of the other - In reality, there is truth behind both and nobody is necessarily in the right or in the wrong. In the video, they often expressed ""living"" and ""being"" as themselves in that land. I thought that was very insightful.

I watched the video and here are my thoughts: I think the director was trying to communicate how different living in the country is to the city by showing people helping others and living independantly without trying to rely on technology. It also showed the two different attitudes the people had. I did relate to some of the things in the video, like, my grandparents lived on a 40 acre plot of land in a more secluded rural area, and I spent the majority of my childhood out in the woods, so I relate to that aspect, but my parents house was in a more urban area so I'd say I got both experiences. This was when I lived in Alberta. Watching the video I felt a bit lazy knowing that I could be out on the countryside living my best life, but also I still enjoy aspects of being in the city at the same time. My feelings about the video did actually make me second guess wanting to live in the city, because looking back on how much fun and all the core memories I made out in the wild, makes me want to live on a farm and enjoy a sky full to the brim with stars to gaze upon.

1047547565,1047554190,10/4/2021 6:55,47954,1," 1. Studying for me is storing the contet that I learnt in a lecture in my brain forever- both for academic and knowledge purposes. 2. I enjoy studying a lot especially when I have a calm, aesthetic place to study. I usually play some music and prefer studying alone. I mostly prefer calm spaces for revising concepts. 3. Well, I have always been taught about studying for all day! I was constantly told by my high school teachers that we should study material over and over again, highlight things, and practice concepts by writing them down. From this video: I have studied about the first strategy, the one about spacing between the study session- it's called distributed practice. I also tried this technique for myself and it did work in reducing my anxiety before the text. Beginning revising concepts way before the test is very very useful because you feel less work-load and burnout, also you get a chance to revise all the content a day before text because you don't have any new concepts to study right before. Studying in advance is indeed hard because we need to maintain a disciple and consistency. I do struggle with motivating myself for studying a week before test, because you know, procrastination. But, I get over this problem by reminding myself of how light, and stree-free I will feel later before test by covering up the syllabus already. This strategy do work for me and you should try it too! This video was a new learning for me as well and I will try other strategies too this coming term! I used words and visuals a lot in my high school, but I almost forgot about that technique in university. So, I will try it again as mentioned in this video! Let me know if you have any other questions about my study strategies, I'll be happy to answer. All the best! Have a great rest of the day! "," 2022-04-28, 15:04:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

How are you going to improve creativity/ your work in general if you only work from where you're best at? I get that it says to create something truly authentic, but I think it can't be authentic if you aren't introducing new ideas to it. It is like mixing paint, if you keep adding black to darken it and white to lighten it, it will never get vibrant colours or hues, and eventually will just start looking the same as the other colours you mixed. But if you add other colours to it, it will be a product of several colours and shades, with even more authenticity. I hope that made sense. Usually I get writer's block if I am working on an assignment with creative writing, or just like an essay or paragraph in geenral. I never know how to start it, or end it, but I can perfectly type out the middle part of it. I don't understand why we need an entire paragraph for a Introduction, and another for a Conclusion. Like, an introduction sentence I understand writing, but a entire paragraph? And another just to rephrase the introduction???

How does it feel for you to extend your abilities and do things that you haven't done before? Do you have any examples you'd like to share? I love doing things that I don't know, sometimes I get assignments that allow me to do something different, for example this last semester I was able to create a dress as a piece of art for a project rather than do a presentation or paper. I think getting out of my comfort zone and extending my reach to learning things I don't know is how I get inspiration. I'm also like you and don't know how to start an intro or conclusion. But I'm realizing now that my intro is just a rephrase of my body in an essay, so I just rephrase each topic sentence for my intro now, that's something that's helped me out recently. Writing a conclusion is similar but normally shorter than the intro in academic writing. I always do these two parts of an essay at the end after I've written the body.

1047516499,1047540775,11/27/2020 16:54,40437,13," Hi Rachel, No worries! I was actually off all of last week, helping my dad plan and board his solo vacation! While I've done it before pre-pandemic, some countries having restrictions and certain requirements (i.e. uploading time-sensitive information onto country travel databases) makes it a different process! Just something to keep in mind if you or someone you know plans to travel soon! Hm... I'm not sure how available stipends or grants may be for freshmen (that's something you'll have to explore within your uni and discuss with your undergraduate counsellor), but if I were in your shoes, I would first look into building familiarity and rapport with a professor. For example, this is how I approached my professor for research: While in their class, they had mentioned to everyone that if any student was interested in... Say, social determinants of health, to speak with them personally. I sent them an email, introducing myself as a student in their class, who was interested in their lecture regarding the social determinants of health, and if there was any possibility of volunteering with them during their research. During these emails, my professor asked what research I was interested in, my research experience, etc. When I met them in person in their office, I presented them with my resume / CV, and explained further in detail what I was looking for, what I could contribute, and if there was a position that could possibly be a good fit for me. While you know the end to this story (unfortunately COVID disrupted the research!), I definitely think establishing that network early on for potential continuity would be highly beneficial. In other words, being able to conduct and continue your research every Summer throughout the course of 1-4 years would be neat, wouldn't it? It could possibly open doors for publications, presentations, and build that experience needed for a career in research and academia. I guess to summarize, while I don't think it would necessarily hurt to ""cold email"" professors regarding working with them, it would be advantageous to have that familiarity of being their student, and definitely having that awareness of going into research that you're truly interested and passionate about. But if you're just keen to get started, maybe we could look into UNBC's research faculty and see professors whose research interests align with yours? :D -- Thanks for asking about my job updates! So unfortunately, for the job that I was asking you many questions about (the rural opportunity), they weren't able to process my application any further past the interview. While I was super excited about it, there were certain factors that were included in the work that I wasn't ready to commit to yet (for example, having to drive solo for 2+ hours on the mainland when I've only ever driven on the Island!). As they say, when one door closes, another opens. Just hoping this next door is the right fit! I'm down to move on to Part 2! I'll see you there, my mentee!

You will need to let me know which one you would like to begin with and I can unlock it.

1047547291,1047554050,9/30/2021 8:54,47903,7," Hi, For me I don't usually enjoy change in my routine, it sets my entire week off. I need to plan a day or two in advance in my list pocketbook if i have something unusual or different to do. But as for extending abilities-- I like to try new ways of doing things, or a different method i guess. For example, in class we hvae a Bullet Journal where we are expected to do daily, montly, yearly(?), assignment, and budget tracking. It is alot for me to write down, especially since I already have my pocketbook which is kind of the sameish thing. It took me almost a schoolweek to get used to writing in two books about my day, but now since it is routine I find it easy. I like the aspects of the bullet journal that allow me to track my assignments, becasue then I can make another list for the assignment(assuming it's big) and do it step by step. So, that was a good extension of practice(?) or would it be method. idk. I wish i could have assignmments like yours lol, last year I was in a textiles class, and i liked it alot. although fabric and thread is quite expensive, i usually found really cheap at the thrift shop. I enjoy having free reign in the presentation of assignments, but withe the same sort of criteria. Usually in an essay, I write a whole lot of nothing in the opening paragraph, and like one or two long sentences in the concluding paragraph. thesaurus.com has saved me more than once lol. I don't really find it a challenge to get inspired, i just strugle wiht starting lol. I have so many journals, notebooks, and like pinterest boards that I find i have so much i cant figure out what I want to do. Im inspired quite often, usually in school when im bored, and will write it down or something. if you want we can move to another topic, I have no preferences this time. Jesse.

We can talk more about this in the 'Wellbeing and selfcare"" section as well and hopefully share with each other some of our experiences and how we handle certain issues :) However, it's great that it sounds like you're already self aware and attentive to what is going on around you, as this is a skill that may not be as easy for others.

My favourite class this semester would have to be careers, but our school system is pretty odd since we only have 2 classes a day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) and we have four 10 week terms throughout the year. Throughout the year my favourite class was definitely Pre - Calc or Fitness and Conditioning for obvious reasons.

I just started doing track and field/cross country this year because I wanted to do a bunch of stuff during high school since I wont get another chance to play high school sports, I started playing Volleyball in grade 8 with a few of my friends since we've never played any sports on a team together. Basketball for me has always been fun, especially since i would get to play with all my friends, high school basketball was a great experience but covid did mess it up a bit. lol that was a bit longer than expected Some questions I got are: How much more different is University than High School?

1047556157,1047556709,3/24/2022 0:03,48964,1," 1. I really like that living out of town feels safe. I live about 20 minutes out of town, so there are never really any crimes out where I live, except for the occasional theifs or druggies trying to hide in an urban area to escape the cops. Its also nice because parents will feel safe enough to let their children walk to school without them by about grade 1 or 2 (with exceptions), and there's always a house nearby if anything were to go wrong. 2. Everyone knows everyone. Because where I live is such a small area, everyone knows everyone from something. whether its your friends, cousins, uncles, friends, grandpa or someone who plowed your driveway. This also makes it feel alot safer, but also like you arent just some outsider because we have community. 3. I also just really like not having to smell the pulpmill everyday. Our town is a logging town so it was built pretty much right next to our two major pulpmills that we have. Which makes in town, pretty stinky. You do get used to it after awhile, although somedays not even that will make it less bad. 1. Something that I dont like, although it contradicts a point about me liking where I do, Is that we were out of town too far. It takes 30 minutes to get to school, (which is alot of gas) and when I was younger I always just wanted to go hangout downtown with friends like other kids, but my parents wouldnt let me because it was too far. 2. Because it's a pretty small area theres also not alot to do where I live. We have a school (k-7), a community hall, a skating arena (closed all summer of course), a small diner, and a general store. There is a really big forested area on the west side of our community but unless you had a dirtbike, or wanted to just go build forts with the ""bush kids"" that wasnt much fun either.

1047556157,1047556709,3/24/2022 0:03,48964,3," Thank you for sharing all of that! I grew up/am living in an urban community and what you've shared gives me a glimpse into rural life that I'm so ignorant about. Really appreciate that. To note, I know you're aiming for UNBC so my experiences may be a bit more ""urban"" than the community there but should still give you an idea of some similarities and differences. I'm at UBC in Vancouver and have lived in this area my entire life. Urban life: Unfortunately there's a lot of things I have to do to feel safe such as not being out at night by myself or locking up everything/taking it with you (even if you're just gone for a handful of minutes). For example, I've had friends (thankfully not me) who left their backpack out of sight for 10 minutes on campus to go do something and when they came back, it was gone. It's not super common but does happen. Community is an interesting one - I definitely have communities (such as within my church, class, friend groups, etc) that I know most people and feel completely safe, supported and cared for in. I also remember the first day walking into class with 191 other students and going, ""oh my goodness - it's high school all over again. I don't know anyone, this is too much and I have to socialize????"". Added fun - this was just coming off of COVID (2021) where we were just starting to see people again. I know my personality comes into play a bit (partially introvert and socializing is a lot of work) but there were a lot of us feeling lonely, having difficulty connecting or even finding someone to eat lunch with. After a year, I can definitely say I have a good group of friends in class now and know many others. I'm continuing to work on getting to know everyone else :) (an aside - for undergrad b/c you don't always have the same classes with the same people, it can be even harder to connect with people. I thankfully had one friend that I spent most of first year with and the years past that I made sure I had the courage to get to know at least ONE person in each course. School clubs also really do help with getting to know people, particularly when you're attending one regularly.) Distance! It's interesting our comparisons of what's considered ""far"" to travel. I grew up with most things (church, school, parents' work) within a 15min drive but now anything within 30min driving or 60min transit is a decent commute. I know people who have shorter or longer commutes to school/work. Right now my transit to UBC is about 45-90min one way though driving could be anywhere from 25-40min pending traffic. I actually often prefer transit if the route is handy as I don't have to pay attention while driving/GAS AND PARKING IS EXPENSIVE. They're also trying to make our city easier to cycle in. I did cycle 45min to work for a bit which was a nice workout. I also find it incredibly funny because to that particular workplace I would have to leave at the same time (1hr before start) for either transit, cycling or driving because the way traffic/parking worked. A quick note on entertainment - we definitely have a LOT of stuff we can do. Can get costly but there's definitely a lot depending what you're interested in. There's been days where I'll go hiking in the morning, hang out/play sports in the afternoon and watch a movie at night. To your last question - yes. Being in a big city has been overwhelming at times. I have definitely felt lost, insignificant, lonely/don't know anyone. At the same time I feel incredibly enriched with all that I have at my fingertips - all the different communities of people I've gotten to know, skills and experiences I've been able to develop and opportunities to try different things. I can also say it definitely helps to focus on the small (like hanging out with a small group of friends/family) when feeling lost in the big. Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear more about what personal challenges you might face moving/being part of an urban environment. "," 2022-05-09, 14:06:",Mentor,Posts in From Rural to Urban

This year I finally figured out that I'd rather much choose to get a Psychology degree because I find a huge interest with how the human brain, emotions, why we do certain things, and how mental health and etc, affects everyone. I got interested in Pyschology because I wanted to know why I felt the way I felt, and the way my therapists would talk to me about how things all ended up the way they did for me. I wanted to help support people and for them to know more things about themselves, and there are also a lot of people from my hometown(a reservation) who need support but the government don't do much. I've taken online courses on Psychology in my grade 11 year, I enjoyed it a lot. I want to be able to help people like my therapists or counsellors that have done so for me, and my peers.

I think that can fit into mental self care. Of course, self care doesn't have to always involve doing an activity. It can also be knowing your limits and setting boundaries, setting time aside for yourself outside of work/school, or getting enough sleep. For me, I take care of myself by either meditating, dancing, reading, or engaging in my other hobbies. Have you tried anything like that to take care of yourself mentally other than counselling?

When I study, I try and shut out all distractions around me and focus on whatever I'm trying to study. I've been taught to focus and take frequent small breaks small breaks to avoid being overwhelmed. Elaboration is the most useful to me because talking things out really helps me. The most challenging one for me is retrieval practice. I dont know a lot about a certain topic unless I am looking at something related to it.

I am surprised that you ask whether the city is as bad as people make it seem. What types of negative things do you hear about city life? I personally love living in a city, and when I lived in Vancouver for a while (an even bigger city), I found it to be even more fun than where I live now. Although there are cons to moving to a city for school such as leaving some friends and family behind, the traffic, and the cost of living, there are many more benefits that I believe outweigh the cons. For example, there is so much more access to goods and services. There are endless events, exercise classes, gyms, stores, sports coaches, mental health resources, restaurants, and job opportunities in a city. I also think there may be higher quality and more accessible education (ie access to a top-ranked university) and medical care. Additionally, I have really enjoyed meeting people in a big city because you get to hear about diverse perspectives and backgrounds and there are always new people to meet if you are looking to make friends. Although of course living in a city may not be as relaxing and private as a rural town, I think it can be a great place to try living (at least for a while) to see if you like it. It can also be a great place to live when younger because it is easy to meet like-minded people as you become involved with your school/work/community.

1047550326,1047557264,11/6/2021 13:25,49676,9," I played basketball and track and field/cross country in highschool but played soccer competitively outside of school and in school. I also did some other sports like martial arts and swimming but those were done competitively outside of school only. I totally understand when you say sports are a big part of your life. Sports shaped a lot of my life I found that it taught me about good work ethic and helped me explore different parts of myself. My highschool was known for our sports teams, making it a very competitive environment. I would definitely say that it was successful but if I could change anything it would be to really cherish those moments when I was out on the field instead of getting caught up in some of the drama that was happening during that time since I dont play sports anymore. Its really strange going from playing so many sports to none. School during the pandemic was not fun. I found that the school work was harder and being isolated from the campus made learning bleaker. Going back in person was a lot more fun since I got to see everyone and we could all struggle together instead of alone. How did you find highschool during the pandemic? Since starting at UBC I never actually gave any thought about transferring. However, now that Im graduated and looking to apply to med school Im considering schools that are farther away like Australia and Toronto since I feel like it is something I am able to do now. But part of the application process for applying to medical school is writing the MCAT (medical college admission test) and distinguishing yourself through extracurriculars like volunteering. So I currently volunteer with a crisis line, the Canadian Red Cross, a tutoring company, and this. I also work as a background actor. I try to spend around 16 hours a week volunteering but it depends on my schedule. I knew since grade 5 that I wanted to be a surgeon so I always knew that Id have to go to school to achieve that. But I know that some of my friends struggled with deciding if the university was indeed for them. I actually had one of my friends drop out after the first year to go traveling and figure out what he wanted to do and he ended up coming back to school to get a business degree so he could open up his own business. Some questions that I have are: How do you think sports have shaped your life? Do you work or volunteer? Are you conflicted at all about going or not going to university?

I had a very similar experience to you, I am the type of person who is interested in everything and can see myself having a career in all of it as well. I did not choose psychology to be my career path until the 11th grade when I also took a psychology course at school. Before then I believe I wanted to pursue a career in either political science or medicine. For me personally pursuing psychology was giving me the opportunity to learn about the taboos of mental health that no one at home talked about. I got to learn about why certain people's brains aren't wired consistently to others, why my emotions are valid and although in your undergraduate degree you won't be learning about how to help others it gave nice examples of what to look forward to in graduate school. Personally, I knew that I wanted to pursue law school after my undergraduate degree even with my interest in psychology.

When I sudy, I usually just read over whatever it is im studying. I'm aware there are more effective ways to study but I'm usually too lazy to be honest.

I've probably used the ""Answer"" study techniques before but it's been so long since i've properly studied that I wouldn't be able to tell you how they worked for me. Out of all of them, the words and visuals technique would most likely work the best for me, because i'm very visual orientaited when aposed to reading and writing; things that invlove work. The recall what you know would def be the hardest for me, because i have an absolutely horrendous memory. Just sitting and trying to remember something is not something I can do.

1047550326,1047557264,11/6/2021 13:25,49676,11," Highschool during the pandemic sucked, it was all online and even when we came back to school it wasn't in anyway the same it was before besides the fact that we are at school. for me online school didn't work at all, i wasn't motivated to do anything over the pandemic. When we came back to school we would have one class all day for 5 weeks, so it was good but bad because some classes would suuck if you didn't have any friends in it. but this year they switched it to two classes a day for 10 weeks which is definitely better, but i havent used a locker since the pandemic started, we also dont have any bells anymore. High school is alright now i guess but it'd be a whole lot nicer if the pandemic just didn't happen. Australia seems like it would be super nice, but i heard they got some wild spiders down there so i ain't messing with australia because spiders are gross. How is volunteering for this type of stuff, do you enjoy it? how did you get into background acting, was it more like a right place right time type of thing? School for me is something that i have to do if i want to do what i want to do, because if i dont do school then i cant play sports competitvely, i think your friend who traveled for a bit then went back to get a business degree is what i think im going to do after high school, but i also want to make a lot of money so i could open up a gym in 10-15 years with one of my friends who's studying kinesiology at viu. I think if i didn't play sports i'd not be in a good place right now because in prince rupert there are a lot of stuff that goes on that people dont know about and a lot of bad influences, but i've also grown up with older siblings who didn't really get the chance to play sports or do much extra curricular activities so they would get into the wrong group of ""friends"" who dont go to school and get in trouble. So in a way sports helped me stay away from all that type of stuff whether i noticed it or not, sports allowed me to hangout with friends everyday and create many more lifetime friends. sports also taught me how to work hard and push myself physically and mentally I had to do volunteering as a fundraiser for my basketball team because my school is big broke. i also did volunteer reffing for the minor basketball league (grades 3-8) here, i reffed every other weekend from september to the end of november. For work i offloaded crab last summer and i was supposed to go on a crabbing trip but it was to late. This summer i plan on going on as many crabbing trips as possible and offloading as much as possible. Crab fishing has been really good for the past year and a bit so i want to make sure i take advantage of it. Going to university has been a bit conflicting for sure but i recently decided to work for a year and head off to Van Island next year for school.

1047551823,1047554062,11/29/2021 14:06,47859,3," Hey Iris, i read the text and watched the video titled ""The Six Habits of Highly Successful Students,"" To me, studying is looking back on previous class notes and information that is on an upcoming test or quiz. When I study, I usually will look back on my notes and worksheets and re-read them over, and then I will try to memorize any formulas or definitions by repeating them to myself. Previously I have been taught about many ways of studying such as flash cards, practice tests/quizs, etc. Spaced Practice- I have never used this Interleaving- I have never used this Elaboration- I dont think I have used this on purpose, but I often make connections and explain it to myself Concrete Examples- Examples are always in my notes (math, science, etc.) Dual Coding- Some of the time in notes there are graphs or images or charts, I usually refer to those. I have never specifically written about an example graph and written an example graph based off notes. Retrieval Practice- I use this very often. I dont usually write all the information down, but I personally assess what I know and what I could use some work on The strategy that seemed most useful to me would be retrieval Practice, since retrieval practice is the strategy, I have used and continue to use to this day. I think the strategy that would be most difficult for me would be spaced practice, due to my inconsistent work schedules and I dont usually have an abundance of topics to study. Which studying strategies do you use? Did you go through any trial and error to find the right strategy for you? "," 2022-05-18, 14:55:",Mentee,Posts in Strategic Studying 
1047547931,1047554046,10/8/2021 20:46,47899,11," Hi Hannah, The ""answer"" technique works really well. It requires A LOT of discipline, more than most people have, especially coming out of this strange post-COVID time. The only thing is that I tend to use just my short-term memory, so I ignore the whole ""not cramming"" part. I start making my notes about two weeks before an exam and then study for a week straight before the exam. I'm pretty sure that's called cramming LOL. Unfortunately, none of the information actually sticks long-term, but I guess if you're just doing it to pass the test, it works. I'm glad you don't have to stress over finals, congratulations! Also, a little jealous. And yes, that Greek final was not fun, but I'm glad it's over. I was interested in most of the topics, so I really enjoyed going over things and relearning facts. That's probably key to it. The sad part is in high school, there's probably only 1 out of 5 subjects people are interested in learning, and that's what makes studying so boring and unmotivating. Lastly, that's too bad you didn't learn anything during the pandemic, but then again, now that I think about it, I don't think I did either. I tried to write a book during lockdown (which was a project I was working on since 2019) but it never actually worked out. I always hear about people doing great/creative things during lockdown, but I guess we both are odd ones out! Anyway, it's great to learn more about you and thanks for the question.

1047551823,1047554062,11/29/2021 14:06,47859,5," Hi Adora, Thank you for taking the time to watch the video. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on studying techniques. During high school, my study technique is similar to yours. I relied heavily on taking and re-reading my notes. I also spent most of my time trying to memorize information by repeating it to myself. I did well on my exams. However, once I reached university, I struggled. Like the video says, re-reading, highlighting and summarizing information are not the most effective ways of studying. From my own experience, these are time-consuming tasks that can actually lead to burn out. At the university level, exams are not always straightforward and fact-based. Often you are tested on critical thinking and application. Unfortunately, my old study habits were not built to do well in these situations. I actually attended studying workshops at my university to learn more effective ways to study. Note-taking is usually my first step in learning information. When writing notes, I like to use elaboration, concrete examples and dual coding. Once my notes are complete and I had the time to review them once, I like to move onto asking myself questions about the information. The process of asking myself questions is a method of retrieval practice. Retrieval practice is the idea of getting information out rather than forcing information in. In other words, you want to test yourself to see what you know and what you do not know instead of repeating and memorizing information. It is important to not use your resources and materials when you are answering the questions. If you find any mistakes or confusion, you can refer back to the resources and materials after. Each time you answer a question, you want to keep the answer hidden. I am glad that you use this often in your studying. To get the most out of retrieval practice, I highly recommend writing the information down. You are practicing explaining the information in writing, which prepares you well from exams. When you are using retrieval practice, you want to combine it with spaced practice and interleaving. You want to schedule when you study and review information. Usually, I like to add 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and then 21 days. Let's say you start studying on May 19, you would then study on May 20, May 23, May 30 and June 20. I find that spacing the studying sessions helps me to avoid cramming and to ask for help early on. Interleaving is the idea of mixing information in different order when you are studying. In the past, I used to study topics separately, but now I mix them up so that I learn to build connections between topics. Let's say you are studying for a math exam, you would benefit from mixing up operations/formulas when you study rather than studying each operation/formula on its own. Metacognitive feedback is also important in retrieval practice. It is the idea of thinking about your own thinking. You are evaluating how well you understood and recalled the information. I usually rate my confidence in answering a question on a scale of 1 to 5. This lets me know what I am weak at and what I need help on. I can then write down questions to ask teachers. I would say trial and error is unavoidable when you are learning and finding study techniques that work for you. It can seem stressful and overwhelming at the beginning. It is worth it, because once you find a system that works for you things will get easier. You will become more efficient. In the end, you learn how to study smarter rather than harder. From my own experience, I tried flashcards and they were never helpful for me. The process of making them and carrying them around felt time-consuming and ineffective. I rather like to create practice questions and write down my answers. I usually do all of my studying by writing things down, I find that I learn and remember things better this way. Recently, I found a convenient and useful application called Notion, which has a template for retrieval practice. The creator calls it active recall, but it is the same idea. Here is the link: https://www.maray.ai/posts/my-favorite-way-to-learn-and-retain-knowledge. You will need to download the Notion application on your desktop, phone or tablet. The application is free, you do not need to worry about subscription fees. I find that this creator did an excellent job at organizing a study schedule and a retrieval practice system. You can decide whether you want to write your practice questions by hand or type them in the template. "," 2022-05-19, 14:15:",Mentor,Posts in Strategic Studying

I'm 22, I live with my boyfriend, I read a lot of books, and right now I'm working at a coffee shop for the summer. I just had a read through your profile, and it seems as though we've got tons of interests in common!

At the moment however, my career goal is to get my PhD in English and become a professor. I also love to paint, crochet, hike in nature, cook, and write poetry. I am a member of the alphabet mafia (I'm pansexual, and maybe somewhere approaching genderfluid but that remains to be seen). I also loved social studies and all things historical and mythological in highschool, although that interest has changed somewhat in university.

But it sounds like sports have really been a lifeline for you and has provided you with some structure. Also, thats so cool that you want to open your own gym. Getting a business degree will really help with that and it sounds like opening a gym will really align with your interests in sports and fitness. Plus working for the year will give you a chance to save up for school as well. Btw, crabbing sounds cool hopefully its a good season. Ive never done it before but I looked it up online and it looks like a lot of work lol. Volunteering is a lot of fun. It can get difficult juggling everything since its can get hectic but Id rather stay busy then bored. As for the background acting, I auditioned for an agency on a whim but ended up getting signed. So right now Im working on this movie called Totally Killer. I usually spend my summers hanging out with friends and going on little roads trips and flying down to Hawaii. I sometimes get a job but its never been a priority, I kinda just go with the flow during the summer. I plan on going to med school with my best friend, so hopefully we make it into the same school, otherwise Im making new friends when I get there.

I'm still not entirely sure if nursing is for me though, that is why I decided to start by doing first-year science so that I can explore that as well.

I LOVE Vancouver! It does rain significantly more than my hometown, but I really enjoy the changes in weather. We are so close to everything, mountains, snow, hiking, beaches, all while being in the big city! I also like that it doesn't really snow here (only on the nearby mountains of course). We got a LOT of snow where I used to live and it made driving and getting around in the winter very hard. It is so beautiful too, the cherry blossoms in the spring and all the maple trees in the fall give the best backgrounds ever haha. It's really easy to get around in, I just moved to live by the skytrain, and I feel like everything is SO much closer now! But you don't have to only use the skytrain, there are so many buses and they come really often (especially compared to small town transit haha, if there even is any!). There's also a ton of fun things to do all the time, but it is definitely a lot more expensive than rural living unfortunately... There are a TON of different options of healthcare careers. Even within nursing, there are registered nurses, nurse practitioners, licensed practical nurses, home care nurses, nurse educators, the list goes on! If you haven't already, I would consider looking up the different responsibilities of each, because there are just so many different things you can do! Outside of the nursing scope, healthcare is a HUGE field. It's a great idea to keep your options open until you truly know, that's what I did! I think there are pros and cons to both university and college programs, I have done both and I have enjoyed both. I went to a small program in the Kootenay's called the Rural Pre-Medicine (RPM) program at Selkirk College. It's a three year program that sets you up for entry into a variety of different fields, including medicine, pharmacy, optometry, chiropractics, etc, so these were all careers that I had considered. I ended up choosing medicine because that was what I was originally interested in, and I liked the idea of the independence that came with being a physician, while still getting to work in a team-based atmosphere. I also liked the subject matter more. The RPM program was really nice because the class sizes were really small, I got to save money, and they helped prepare you for big exams like the MCAT (medical college admissions test) and for the MMI (multiple mini interview) that you need to get into medical school. My first year of medical school was great! I really really enjoyed it. There is definitely a learning curve, because it's a little different than an undergrad program, where your studying habits need to change to adapt a different style of learning. That being said, it's SO fun to be able to practice in a hospital, and put the things you're learning into practical use. You also get hospital or long term placements in first year of nursing, so I'm sure it would be a similar experience to getting your feet wet in a hospital career. There are plenty of places for introverts in healthcare, so no worries about that at all. It can be draining to work with patients all the time, but I think if you're passionate about it, it's well worth it! There are also different specialties other than nursing that interact more or less with people as well, like lab techs, medical pathologists, radiologists, etc. If you're interested more in what the day to day could look like, I definitely recommend speaking with a nursing student. You could also ask them what exactly the patient interaction level is, but I would imagine it's on the higher side. Hope you're having a great day!

I agree, creating something based on what you know, allows for the best experience and creates something truly authentic.

1047546975,1047557260,9/27/2021 17:28,49673,3," Hey Maddy! No worries about the structure of your message - it's great! this doesn't have to be formal in any way, it's all about just writing out your thoughts. :) I definitely agree that creating from what you know really does create something authentic and I think other people will resonate with that authenticity as well! But I actually disagree with the guy a little bit lol ~ as a writer myself, I often write about situations or things I haven't personally experienced, but I always draw on the emotions that I have felt and that I think would be relevant in those situations, since as humans we can all relate to the same emotions. For example, I have never played hockey but I think I could write about someone who did and had to give it up because I know what it's like to feel dissapointment and resentment and yearning and I could draw on those to write something that is still authentic. Of course, there are definitely things I would never write about that aren't my experience ~ like POC experience for example ~ so there are lines about what is and isn't ok to create from. But yes, it's definitely best to draw on what you know first, because that will create the most true to you and genuine result. And I think people can tell when you're creating from your heart, versus trying to use someone else' voice. People resonate with what you create when it comes from you and it makes it all the more special and important, because you have something only you can share with the world from your own unique persepctive. I really like what Mina said -I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled. I think we as humans have this innate desire to create things - with whatever materials we can! For example, I always find myself folding napkins into origami cranes whenever I'm waiting for food in a restaurant. I think creating things and making art gives us a sense of purpose and helps us express ourselves, whether that's art or writing or building in minecraft or cooking or something. Okay, enough rambling from me haha! Do you have any creative outlets or any creative projects you want to try out? Thanks &amp; looking forward to your thoughts!

Do you have any favourite places or must-see places in Vancouver? Thanks for the tip about looking up the duties of different nursing careers, I've only ever done that for LPNs and RNs before so it was cool to see the different range of duties among different professions! In the past I did consider going the LPN route first, just to test it out/see if I like it, but I feel like I will probably get a decent idea of if I will enjoy working in an environment during my first year in any nursing program. I have also looked into a few different specialties other than nursing like you mentioned, and I like those kinds of jobs too; I think those would also be a good option for me if I found nursing to be too draining lol. I love the idea of working in a team-based hospital environment so I'm also excited about that. Do you know of any healthcare scholarships or where I could find some?

1047555384,1047558462,3/7/2022 13:35,50541,11," Hey Hannah, Must see places? Definitely check out the beaches! They are SO great! I personally love kits beach, theres lots of beach volleyball, running, parks, and general fun stuff to do! I love to run and hang out with friends/have picnics there. It's also super close to 4th, where there is a lot of good food options. There's great food everywhere, enough that you can definitely try something new every time! Rain or shine is really popular for ice cream, and I definitely reccomend trying out some different sushi or poke places because they are SO tasty! There are some great local hikes really close by that you can get to by bus in North Van, so I definitely recommend those as well! In the summer, the night market is very fun (or so I've heard, I'm going for the first time tomorrow haha). That's awesome that you're being so proactive and checking everything out, I think having experience in those areas will also help in any future applications or interviews, because it seems like you are much more invested in the program, which admissions wants to see. Healthcare scholarships... That's a tough one, there are entrance scholarships to UBC, and bursaries and general scholarships that open a little later in the year. Medicine has a few rural healthcare specific ones through the REAP program, but I'm not sure if they have any ones for nursing. I'm sure they exist, I just don't exactly know where they would be, sorry! I can do some loking and get back to you though! There are sites like scholarships canada and scholartree where I found a few healthcare scholarships, signing up for an account is really easy, and then searching through there, but they are generally bigger scholarships that have a lot of people applying. I funded my entire undergrad and some of medicine through scholarships, and my biggest tip is the local ones in your hometown. There is a lot of money available in rural areas for rural students, it just is a matter of finding them. They all add up, so even the smaller ones or ones that you don't necessarily fit the criteria for are good to apply to, because usually there isn't a lot of applicants. For example, I think I applied for scholarships from the credit unions in my small town (as well as the mill actually offered scholarships!), so I would be sure to check those out! I'm sure there are also existing healthcare scholarships for rural northern students too. Healthcare-related places to volunteer... Honestly most of my healthcare experience came from working. I worked as a student receptionist for a wellness/medical clinic, and that gave me some experience in the area. I know some friends that worked as pharmacy assistants as well. There are options for volunteering at hospitals too, but those differ from place to place (You can work with hospital staff, spend time with patients, do some administrative tasks with staff, etc). I feel like a really good place to get involved and volunteer in healthcare is through policy making or supporting causes in healthcare you believe in. A lot of people don't realize that that counts as healthcare volunteering as well. Finally, there's a lot of work you can do in palliative care or with the elderly. You can volunteer in palliative care clinics, which is very sad, but can be very rewarding work. I did have to do a little bit of training for that, but it was a fairly short and free course. There are also volunteer positions available visiting folks in long term care homes, and that can also be really fun! Really, you just have to look into different options, they mainly depend on WHERE you're trying to volunteer, so I can't exactly tell you a specific place or answer unfortunately, but they are out there! Hopefully that helps a little... Hope you're having a great day! Kira "," 2022-05-27, 09:49:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

It was also good for school because even though the commute was far, I didn't have to move away from home and live on the campus. When you graduate from school do you plan on staying where you are or do you have any thoughts of moving to a bigger city?

Background acting is really laid back. I've been doing it for a little over a month. It has long hours since I'm on set for 12-16 hours at a time but I get paid well for it, plus unlimited catered food lol. There is also a lot of downtime so I get to study and relax. Totally Killer is a horror/comedy film where the main character's mom gets murdered so the daughter travels back in time to kill the killer (Kinda like Scream meets Back to the Future). So far all of my road trips have been planned so we maximize our time, but we all take turns picking destinations and keep it a secret so only the person driving knows where we are headed. What places do you want to take a road trip to first? I've been all over Australia during my highschool trip, but I would definitely want to visit more of the beach and do more hiking. The beach I am most looking forward to visiting would be Whitehaven beach. Ya I got to go on my grad trip with my grad class. After our prom, we go out camping for the weekend. It was a lot of fun.

I think I would also like things like being close and knowing everyone. For me, living in the big city also has its upsides and downsides. One of the big downsides is that it is hard forming connection with everyone so although you may know a lot of people they are just surface connections. One good thing about living in the city is its always busy. What I mean by that is that there is always something going on or something to do. If you want a more relaxed liifestyle the city is probably not it! haha. One of the prompts is to share an experience when starting school. I went to a french immersion school meaning everything we did was in french from PE to science to social studies. It was really hard at first but I eventually got used to it. Then I continued french immersion into highschool and it was slightly different becuase now there were only a few courses that were in french and the rest were in english. I met a lot of good friends and I still keep in touch with a lot of them. I graduated with a french diploma which I am very proud of. During the time I was in it, I didn't really like it. But, looking back now, I think it opened a lot of doors and oppurtunities for me.

Here's what my university lists as career possibilities for psych. Are there any that look interesting?: https://www.sfu.ca/career/WCID/fass/psychology.html My psychology courses were kind of varied. There were child development courses, courses about aging, sleep cycles, social psychology, neuroscience etc... Psych courses are pretty diverse. I also took lots of elective course in anthropology, archaeology and crim. I also had to take credits in English and science. I did a dinosaur course which was really interesting, but a lot of work. Seeing as you're interested in law enforcement: my crim courses were about the structure of the Canadian legal system, the problems with it, analyzing major court cases in Canada and other stuff like that. There are also courses about criminal behaviour, youth in the criminal justice system, but I didn't take those because I was focusing more on psychology. I've always kind of struggled with knowing what I want to do. I don't really even know now. I wanted to be a psychologist for a while. I've thought about being a teacher on and off. Then I thought about archiving after I worked at the museum. I also thought about law enforcement and the military when I was first starting university. So... I don't really know because I have so much that I want to do. I've been working at the Student Union Building at my university since September and I recently got a full time job there for after graduation. It's not what I want to do forever, but it is a good place to be while I figure out what I'm going to do. Have you looked much into how to get into the careers you're interested before?

Since you mentioned that you typically go with the flow in terms of exams, I'm wondering what you think about the study tecniques that are shown in video #1, and which one might help you the most at retaining information? For me personally, I think that the no cramming tecnique is most helpful. I always start assignments and studying for tests at least a month before they're due, and I feel most prepared this way compared to when I'm forced to cram because of lack of time! And for video #2, I've always found that the simple outline method of note-taking has always worked best for me, because I'm a bit scatter-brained, so using a linear style keeps me in line! Have you had the chance to practice note-taking in highschool? Which tecnique do you think would work best for you and your learning style?

1047500301,1047558304,12/24/2019 9:56,50998,13," A lot of people I've had classes with in Psychology have been Crim students who are taking Psychology classes as electives. The first year or two of unievrsity you can be a bit flexible with what classes you take and you can apply to transfer into a different program if you decide you prefer a certain subject. So if you go to university, you have time to decide. It sound like you might be interested in biopsych courses. Psychology as a degree is quite variable - you can focus more on social psych, developmental, or more biopsych. Here's an example of a biopsych course that I took which focuses on hormones, chemicals and their effects on behaviour (which sounds a bit like what you're interested in): https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2021/spring/psyc/381/d100 Looking at course outlines for classes from different subjects might be cool if you're interested. it could be a cool way to see what's studied in differen majors. But you will have time to decide once you get to university. Working in the field is for sure cool! I actually do best when I'm not in class or doing research at a desk, so I totally get it. Something else you can look into at in University is co-op. How co-op works here is that you take classes for one semester, apply for jobs through your university, work for one semester, and then classes the next. It's a way to get work experience, pay for school and also experiment with different careers. My co-op advisor was the SFU co-op contact with the RCMP, and quite a few students do co-ops there every year. I /think/ most universities in BC have co-op.

1047555384,1047558462,3/7/2022 13:35,50541,19," Hey Hannah, No worries on it being a while! SO sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I have been shadowing at the hospitals here and haven't been checking my email!! CONGRATS on the graduation! Super exciting! You're gonna be a great valedictorian! I was also valedictorian for my class, and no worries, I wrote the speech the day before, haha. SO no matter what you do, it'll be great! Just try to remember to take some deep breaths beforehand, and it always helps me feel better to remember that I'm talking to my friends! Not a crowd of strangers! Either way, good luck! Course selection is an exciting but daunting process. 5 courses is definitely a lot. Of course, I think it's possible, but given that it's your first time in university, it depends how much work you want to devote to it! It is always nice to have the option to drop courses too (especially before the date that they get on your record). My course schedule was pretty insane, with 6 courses a semester, but that is to say that it was definitely doable with a LOT of time management. I definitely recommend getting a planner, because there aren't reminders for things like exams or assignments, and often the only time they are mentioned is in the syllabus at the beginning of the year. What I would do (and still do!) is as soon as I got my syllabus, I would put ALL the dates in my planner that same day, so at least I could look back and have them all written somewhere! Again, maybe this was just something that was helpful to me, because I like to have all my school and life organized haha. Sincerely hoping this advice isn't too too late (SO sorry if it is). I did finish my exams, thank goodness. There were a lot of them this year! My number one trick is (unfortunately) to start studying early and in short bursts (I find this is what works best for me). But, when in need, cramming does the trick, just not for long term (and that is NOT my official advice if REMBC asks). Definitely take breaks, focus on self care, exercise, sleeping, and eating healthy are all SUPER important in study sessions. I like to motivate myself with snacks, or studying/reviewing while walking or exercising, so that I can kill two birds with one stone. The night before/day of an exam, I try to not study at all, and not stress, you'll make it through! Vancouver rains A LOT. I will say that you do get used to it (eventually), and it makes it even better when the sun comes out! The summers are BEAUTIFUL though. I personally don't love using an umbrella, but it works in a pinch, and is easy enough to carry around with you if you don't trust the weather app (which you probably shouldn't). The main reason I am not a huge umbrella fan is because if it's windy, which it can be, they are useless. They flip so easily! They definitely have their time and place though lol. So I tend to prefer a good long raincoat, and I did splurge and get one that is really really waterproof (I would also get some waterproof shoes!), you WILL be sorry otherwise. You can't really avoid the rain, you gotta just make the most of it, so getting some good gear (even second hand or thrifted, because depending on what you're buying, it can be expensive!) will make your experience SO much better.

I have a family of five and a dog, my family includes my father Chris, my mother Trish, my older brother Pearce (He's 23), my twin brother Ryan, me, and my dog Massey. For a while now I've been interested in the path of criminology, and maybe pshycology, so I signed up for eMentoring to gain some information and knowledge on the subject. I'm still not fully sure what information I'm looking for, but I'm sure I'll have some questions written down for when I write to you next. If you have any specific questions to ask me about myself, and why I'm interested in criminology, I'd be more then happy to answer anything:) . But for now I do have three questions for you and that is, When were you introduced to criminology?, Why did you pursue going into post secondary for a course in criminology?, and What were the hardest things to get through in that course?.

1047547559,1047562397,10/3/2021 21:11,51520,5," Hi Brooke! Thanks for sharing more about yourself - it's great that you're being proactive about learning more about criminology. To answer your questions: 1) I first learned about criminology when I was in grade 12. I live near SFU and they are very well-known for their criminology program, so I looked more into it and found it very interested; 2) I actually got accepted into UBC's psychology program, but ultimately chose to study criminology. It's hard to reflect on why I decided to do that, as my current path is geared more towards psychology (I'm hoping to pursue a Master's in counselling psychology!) but I will say that I learned a lot throughout my criminology degree and am a much more critical thinker today; 3) I would say that the most difficult part of my degree was the amount of reading and writing I had to do. It's a big jump from what I was expected to do in high school, but it got easier as time went on. Also, Brooke, since you are choosing to do the eMentoring program on your own - are there any specific Conversations that you wanted to touch on? Or do you prefer to just have a back-and-forth chat?

I ended up talking about my experience working at guest services at a mall, when a guest had fainted. I had to communicate with the security gaurds, maintenance, and my fellow guest services coworkers about the situation via radio. As a team, we communicated well and worked through getting the guest an ambulance, cleaning up the floor area, and alerting alarmed guests about the situation. It was quite the experience, but sometimes the craziest experiences can lead to the best stories to tell during interviews! I would love to hear any experiences you might have with interviews! :) And as a follow up question, how do you think having responsibility as a skill may strengthen your resume?

I have shadowed different doctors, including the OR (surgery), obstetrics and gynaecology, and Pediatrics so far! I've really loved Pediatrics, the cases are so complex and interesting, and of course the babies are adorable. I actually shadowed in my hometown, because u wanted to see what rural medicine looked like, and it was great! Hoping to do some more shadowing when I come back from my vacation in a month (I'm currently writing this in the LAX airport on my way to Costa Rica!)

Currently, I am not 100% sure what I want to do after graduation however I am thinking about pursuing a pharmacy-related degree. Aside from academics, I enjoy music (singing, piano, classical guitar), crocheting, knitting, and kayaking (in calm waters).

My favourite quote is probably from the TV show Ted Lasso- ""be curious, not judgemental""- I think it's very easy these days to jump to conclusions when we see the news or just in day-to-day life, so it's a good reminder to stay curious and always ask ""why"" instead of jumping straight into judgement.

1047547559,1047562397,10/3/2021 21:11,51520,11," Hi Brooke, no worries! I hope your summer has been off to a great start :-) The weather has been gorgeous so far. Sure, a back and forth chat works for me! I'm aiming to get back to you within 3 days of receiving your messages, but absolutely no worries if you're unable to get back to my messages within the same time period. To answer your questions: 1. One of the most interesting classes that I took was Forensic Science. I think it would be very useful to take chemistry and biology in high school to give you a better understanding of what you would learn in Forensic Science! I did not take physics in high school, but I could see how that would be helpful in the Forensic Science course because I remember learning about forensic ballistics in that class! 2. I took Pre-Calculus 11 and 12 in high school. I didn't find that that type of math was very useful for my degree. I'm not sure exactly what math courses are offered in high school nowadays, but you will definitely be learning about statistics if you pursue a criminology degree. 3. I wouldn't be the best person to ask about the program requirements! To learn more about SFU's admission requirements, have a look at this page: https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission.html 4. I think Law 12 is an excellent class to take in high school, because it gives you a good foundational knowledge of the law in Canada. I hope that helps!

I dont personally like replying to messages days after recieving them, but my family has planned a lot of camping trips where there is barely to no service. Thank you for answering some of my questions about about high school courses, it is very helpful for planning ahead in course selection. Im very glad that Law 12 is something you recommend, it gives me more reassurance that I made the right choice for what classes I want to take for my Grade 12 year. But since you found that Pre-Calculus wasn't very helpful for criminology would you say that Foundations 11&amp;12 would be a better choice? For Science classes what grade level would be the minimum I should take for Chemistry? Beacause you see I'm not the best at Chemistry, but I will take it to to the required grade level (even if that means to grade 12) so I can get into the Criminology course. But other then that I'm perfectly fine with Biology, and somewhat with Physics. So far that is all the questions I have for you, Thank you for all your help so far.

I would definitely encourage you to talk to your high school counselor to help you make a decision about which math class to take as I'm not too familiar with the course content of Foundations 11 and 12. I also highly encourage that you connect with universities about their admissions requirements specific to their criminology programs, as they may require that you take a certain math in high school. Moreover, the Admissions department would also let you know what grade you need earn in chemistry. As for the top 3 to 5 things I wish I had known about criminology in high school, I'd say: 1. I wish I took more time to learn about what possible career paths I could take and really gain a better understanding of the populations I'd be serving. 2. I wish I learned more about where graduate studies in criminology (so, completing a Master's or PhD) could take me. 3. I wish I connected with people who have already completed the program so that I can see where they degree led them."," 2022-07-07, 15:47:",Mentor,Posts in Start Here!

Super cool that there's a family trip in the works, even cooler that your exchange student gets to join!!! Are you all close? I've never been to Vancouver island (yet, I plan on going later this year!!) so you'll have to tell me all about it. BC is such a beautiful place to explore! Hopefully you're getting excited to move, I'm looking forward to hearing how you like Vancouver! Costa Rica was BEAUTIFUL, very very fun. We basically spent a month hiking and beaching with some amazing scenery! It's really cool, almost ALL of the plants there are ones we would pay hundreds of dollars for here (like orchids and gigantic monstera) but in Costa Rica they're literally like growing in the ditch, or considered weeds or something! The animals were super super cool too, we saw lots of monkeys, frogs, sloths, toucans, parrots, dolphins, and lots more! We also got to hike a volcano and visit waterfalls and hot springs which was super cool. I definitely recommend a trip at some point in your life if you're interested! Shadowing is really cool, it's basically your opportunity to experience different specialities. I've so far only shadowed surgery, Pediatrics and obstetrics, but I'm hoping to do more soon. I'm really interested in Pediatrics, so that's kind of where I'm leaning right now but I am trying to keep an open mind! You're not really supposed to do anything when you're shadowing, just observing and asking questions! It kind of depends on your preceptor however.

Outside of school, I enjoy spending time camping with my family, playing/walking my dog, and travelling even though I have never been outside the country before. I have spent lots of time on the east and west coasts. I like to swim. I used to be a part of a swim club but, I have not been there since covid. In the winter I like to cross country and downhill ski even though I am not very good at it. I can play the violin, I enjoy reading when I find a good book that I like, and if I had to choose sushi and greek salad are probably my favourite food. Have a great rest of your day, Nicole "," 2022-08-04, 15:37:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

Thank you for sharing! My favourite subjects have always been math and science as well :) Starting in grade 11, you will likely get to chose from more specific science classes (for example, chemistry, biology, physics). Do you have a favourite? To get started, I'd like for you to pick the three 'conversations' that interest you most from the list below. This will help us have a roadmap moving forward.

Just take your time, explore your options, and reach out to program advisors if you feel like you need any more information. And remember that you are not alone! This is something every college/university student has to do and it is okay to not immediately know which path you want to take. If you have any more questions relating to this topic, please ask :).

A waiver is something you may be able to get that sort of excuses you from this requirement. I believe you can only get this waiver if you already know a second language and you complete a test/exam to show that. You could also talk about this sort of thing with your high school advisor, since this is a high school requirement!

1047541384,1047561414,9/17/2021 17:05,52974,13," How I can turn the things I want into goals... (1) During the school year, I would like to find a balance between my school work and taking time for myself. I can do this by using a planner. I can fill it out every Friday afternoon and the first thing I will put in it is my self care tasks. This way there will be time for my self care tasks and they won't get forgotten/overlooked. (2) By the time school starts, I want to be able to get up at 6:45 am so I have time to get ready. I can do this by starting to go to bed a little earlier each night and waking up a little earlier each morning while I am still on summer break. I would do this until I am able to go to bed by 10:30 pm. This would be so I get used to this sleep schedule. By the time school starts then I will be used to going to bed by 10:30 pm and waking up at 6:45 am. (3) I would like to have a more definite idea of what I want to do after I finish high school. I can do this by really starting to pay attention to what interests me and what I do not like. I can research the classes I can take in university based on my interest and I can look at the jobs I can do with the degree that interests me.

You have some great ideas on how you can turn the things you want into goals, I especially like your idea of using a planner, because it often also reduces anxiety around having so many tasks to do. It should help you stay on top of personal, professional, and academic persuits! :) I also think it's a great idea to do some more research into the classes you can take and post-graduation job opportunities!

School starts in 2 days so I was very busy getting secondhand furniture and unpacking stuff! Starting to settle in now which is good :) I think being self aware of how your feeling, and what things might brighten your mood is very important. My recommendation would be to reward yourself when you get stuff done - big or small. It can help you realize that you are making progress, even when you feel like you aren't. The rewards could be anything that you like that feels motivating (food, games, exercise, seeing your friends, time on your phone). It can also help with not feeling guilty about schoolwork (because you've already done some - or maybe even finished it). I find a lot of recommendations that people may have are easier said than done, but some of them will work for you. There are lots of study tips online that might help when the time comes. It's important to remember that a lot of these things take practice. You might have to try them a couple times before seeing whether they actually work for you or not. Ideally you will develop skills that means your work is getting done, but you also have time to take care of your needs. Balance makes school a lot more sustainable long-term. Let me you if you have any other questions. Hope you're enjoying the last days of summer! Madia :) "," 2022-09-04, 13:40:",Mentor,Posts in Well Being and Self Care

I'm really trying to be better this year, but time will tell... lol Last month, a guy that teaches study skills recommended a book to me (Help Your Kids With Study Skills). Although it says ""Kids"" it is really relevant for any students. I would definitely recommend if you want any idea (I think it was around $10 on Apple Books, but you can get hard copies on Amazon as well). In the past I have noticed that breaking bigger projects into smaller chunks, especially when you are just starting the projects, makes them a lot less inimidating! This paired with taking lots of breaks can make work feel a lot more manageable. I definitely struggle with starting, sometimes I will sit for hours trying to start something but being unable. I find that starting a timer can really help. Even if it's just for 5 minutes - a super manageable amount of time. Then take a timed break and start another chunk. This method may not work for you, but it's definitely worth a shot! Your school might have people that can help with study skills like time management as well! (And colleges/universities definitely do) That was a lot but I hope it makes sence! Madia :) "," 2022-09-07, 09:24:",Mentor,Posts in Well Being and Self Care

Q: How do the goals and habits you had in high school compare to the ones you have now, as a post-secondary student and young adult? A: Some goals have changed drastically, while others have remained. For example, I've always known that I wanted to work towards a career as a medical doctor, and it remains a goal of mine. I heard a quote once that went something like ""be ridgid in your goals, but flexible in your approach"". This is something that I've really had to practice as there have been many times when things havent gone as planned. Despite this, my goal of becoming a doctor prevails! Some goals that I no longer strive for are (1) moving to Vancouver Island and (2) learning the guitar. I've replace these goals with (1) staying in the town where my mom lives to live at home and save on costs, and (2) keep practicing the piano, an instrument I already play but would like to master! Q: How did you decide what your major/ career was the best fit for you? A: Originally, I planned on majoring in biology as I read online that it was the suggested major for students wanting to persue medicine. As such, I applied to UBCO with this major in mind, and took all the necessary first-year science courses. When it came time to formally choose my major (in 2nd year university), I thought about some of my favourite aspects of my classes. I realized I really enjoyed all the chemistry-based lessons. I made an appointment with the school academic counsellors, who suggested that I consider majoring in biochemistry. After some research, I decided it would be the best fit for me. I know this can be an intimidating decision to make, I'd be happy to answer any more specific questions you might have! - Sarah "," 2022-09-09, 08:57:",Mentor,Posts in Finding Inspiration

10161,1047561227,1/10/2017 17:16,51050,21," Yes, I definitely can! I feel like over the years I have definitely experienced different challenges - like, even this year lol. I think that transitioning to adulthood is pretty drawn out in modern times for many people. I think something I noticed right away is how difficult it can be to make friends, especially if I you're not in school. It definitely still happens, but not with the ease of elementary and secondary school friendships. I think putting yourself out there, and joining clubs can really help you meet people. I also find that the friends I've made as an adult are much more like myself. Another challenge I have faced, is living with my parents and not having the independence that I need. Now that I've moved for school again, its such a relief to have my own space, and be able to decorate it in a way that I like. And not having to constantly worry about keeping someone else's space clean. I am lucky in that I get along with my parents very well, but it's definitely gotten to the point (especially after the pandemic) that I really need my own space. There are also the obvious challenges of having to take on different jobs - paying taxes, working full-time, and renting/buying housing. It can be pretty difficult learning how to manage your money, and possibly stressful too! I've been lucky in that I haven't had to rent anywhere before this year, but I think that means I am a little more stressed now than I would have been if I was used to it haha. As of now these things are all that come to mind, but I'll let you know if I think of anything else!

Personally, I don't even know if you can just be happy to live your life everyday, and if it does exist, then I hope to reach that point in my life in the future.

What I can do to improve my grades is to consistently study hard, focus, and get rid of possible distractions since I sometimes lose focus. I'm going to atleast study or review for a good 30 mins everyday after to school to remember and fully understand lessons. In regards of spending money, I hope and try to not desire anything for now. I have to start spending practically and not on impulse. I also have to be very responsible with my money because I'm afraid of my dad seeing how much I save, therefore, I will build a habit of spending less and less a month.

I like planning everything out, but I need to get better at actually following through with what I write. My week is planned out, but I do not always stick to the planner and take time for myself. My assignments are always completed by the due date, but I need to get better at taking breaks in between. What do you value in life? Some things I value in life are doing well in school, always trying my best, spending time with friends/family, taking care of myself, and helping others. How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? I would like to be able to give back to my community and help others in need. I am currently a part of an Interact club at my school. The Interact club is service above self, how we can help out in the community and how we can help out internationally. What are your dream careers? My dream career would probably be a job in the medical field, such as a doctor or being a medical researcher because I think it would be very interesting to learn more about how the human body. I would also be able to help others and in a way give back to the community. -Nicole "," 2022-10-16, 17:21:",Mentee,Posts in Career Exploration

1047550355,1047561228,11/7/2021 12:15,51212,19," Hi Sharmaine! It is so nice to hear from you :)! I understand that a scheduled day of the week may be too difficult to keep up with, so we can stick with the standard 1 week to reply and you can do so whenever. I can agree with your list of things you want in life and they are each very important. I am sure you will get to a point where you are genuinely happy and passionate about what you do! I think it is important to sit with yourself and explore different career options and find one that sparks that passion. You do not necessarily need to find a passion in high school, or at any other stage in your life. Sometimes, people find something they are passionate about along their journey, and that is okay! Now, where do I find inspiration? That is a great question! I think something that is inspiring to me is thinking about my past and where I am today. For instance, there was a certain point in time where I just wanted to be where I am today. And now, of course, I have other goals. But, thinking about how I was able to acheive my previous goals inspires me and motivates me to acheive my new ones. This applies to all areas of my life such as school and hobbies. Great job at identifying your goals and thinking of steps you can take to make it happen! One habit I have built is finding the perfect time of day to be productive and work towards my goals. For me, that is waking up early and getting things done - for instance, studying. This has helped me work towards my goals because I have found that I study best at this time of day and starting early makes me feel better about my progress. This does NOT mean that you need to be an early bird and work in the morning. I would advise you to figure out what works for you - some people work best at night, and others allocate their afternoons to work. Finding a routine will help you set time for all the things you need to do. This reply was on the longer side - if I missed anything or if you want me to talk more about one of the points I mentioned, please just let me know and I will elaborate. I hope that was at least somewhat helpful :). I wish you the best of luck with school and out-of-school activities and remember to take care of yourself :).

Remember, while it helps to write down your plan for the week, it's okay to not stick to the plan 100% of the time. Try not to be too hard on yourself about this. After all, the planner should be a tool for achieving better self-care :) The Interact club sounds like a great volunteer activity. What kinds of things does the group do around the community? Remember to reflect on these experiences as they will teach you very important lessons, and describing these reflections may come in handy on a university application (or in an interview) one day. Over the time we've spent getting to know eachother, it's become clear that you have a goal and that you are willing to work hard to achieve it. It's incredibly admirable that you feel a passion towards medicine and helping others, especially as a high school student.

We help around our community wherever there is something we can volunteer for. Last year, since the club did not start until late in the school year, we could only do one thing. We had a bake sale fundraiser so that we could buy helmets for a speed skating club. So far during this school year, we have volunteered to help with a silent auction where we helped people if they were looking for something specific and made sure nothing went missing. We made dignity boxes for women that were donated to a youth centre. Dignity boxes are boxes that have some necessities people may need (ex. toothbrush/paste, hairbrush/ties, and shampoo). For the Christmas season, I was able to help with our town's Christmas tree light up, help prepare dessert and serve food so people could have a Christmas dinner. There was also an Old Fashioned Christmas our club could help with, but I was unable to attend this event. To figure out what we do next in our community we look for things that we can do to help and that we are interested/passionate about. As of our last meeting we were coming up with ideas from our project we can do globally. Happy Holidays, Nicole "," 2022-12-28, 19:49:",Mentee,Posts in Start Here!

I can totally understand why you have an interest in persuing a medical career! These experiences/ interactions with the community will definitely help you when you find yourself in an office with patients one day. I thought you might enjoy taking the Work BCs Career Discovery Quizzes at https://careerdiscoveryquizzes.workbc.ca/#career-quizzes On this site there are three different quizzes: (1) Abilities, (2) Work Preferences, and (3) Interests. When you get some time, work through at least one of these quizzes as an opportunity to really explore your options. Then, choose one of the careers from your quiz results and share your answers to the following questions... 1. Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? Developing the skills needed for a career takes time and dedication  so if you follow a career path because someone else wants it for you, or because you heard it pays well, you may not have the passion you will need to persevere. 2. Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? On average, you want to be able to balance satisfying work with opportunities for social connection, creative and physical activity, and simply enjoying your life. 3. Will this career offer me financial security? Although there needs to be more to career choice than money, at the end of the day, you will need to be able to pay your bills with the salary you can earn from your chosen career. 4. How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? Job security refers to the likelihood that there will be jobs available in this career area  now and for the foreseeable future. You will need to think about and research!  whether there is a current and future need for the work you want to do. 5. Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Some career paths will require you to relocate, others will allow you to return to home to work. Its important to think about how location will factor into career decisions.

1047541384,1047561414,9/17/2021 17:05,52974,9," Hi Sarah! I did all three of the quizzes and the job I choose to answer the questions on is a Specialist Physician. 1. Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? I would say that I have a strong personal interest in this type of work. I have been interested in pursuing this type of work for a while. I think that it would be a very interesting job where you get to interact and /or help others daily. When I clicked on the specialist physician it said that specialist physician work in a specific area of health care, including clinical medicine, laboratory medicine and surgery. If I chose to pursue this job, there are many options. Once I had a more definite answer on what I wanted to do, I could choose a job that fits me and that I have a strong personal interest in. 2. Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? I think this job may be difficult to maintain a work-life balance because if you are a physician you usually have to be on call sometimes and if there are not many people who do the job that you do where you are located you may work long hours. However, with time I may be able to work out a more balanced lifestyle. 3. Will this career offer me financial security? According to WorkBC, the annual provincial median salary is 256,202. Based on this salary I think it is enough to offer me the financial security to pay all of my bills and allow me to have all the necessities I need. 4. How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? According to the job site from 2021-2031, the expected number of job openings is 3,002. I think there is a current need and there will be a future need for specialist physicians because there are always people who need to see a physician and you need to be able to replace the physicians that retire. I also think there will be a need for more specialist physicians because as the population grows the number of specialist physicians would need to grow. 5. Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Since I live in a rural place I would probably have to move to a more urban centre to be a specialist physician. Our hospital does not really have any specialist physicians because it is too small. People here are referred to larger places (ex Prince George).

I like what you said about there being 'many options' if you decide to persue a career path as a physician specialist. This is so so true, and from what I've heard, most specialists decide their specialty years into being a medical student. In a way, I think this takes pressure off of having to plan out your future too precisely, as no matter what specialty you choose, they share the common first steps of getting an undergrad degree, and then attending medical school. That being said, I am curious - have you thought about what specialties you would like to learn more about? Are you leaning towards any one particular area?

However, I would be interested in learning more about the different specialties there are. As of right now, I am not leaning toward any particular area. I think I need to learn more about the different specialties and find out what I am interested in / passionate about. Nicole "," 2023-01-17, 19:29:",Mentee,Posts in Career Exploration

If not, I will start the next conversation topic! Thank you, Sarah "," 2023-01-20, 12:59:",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

Do you have a preference on what conversation we move to next? Are you curious about finding an after-school part-time job? If so, maybe we can start with getting hired. Some other ideas include: funding your future, agency in the world, strategic studying, dis- &amp; misinformation, or even a general discussion :) "," 2023-01-24, 12:05:",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

This is something that I am really passionate about, as being more strategic means you can have a more balanced lifestyle :) !! As a warm up to this conversation, take 2-3 minutes to write down as much as you can about your career and perrsonal aspirations."," 2023-02-01, 17:34:",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration

From all I know about you, you would make a great vet! Have you looked into vet school at all yet? From my experience trying to get into medical school, it's usually best to start planning these things as early as possible! I think people from BC usually have to go to Saskatchewan or the United States for vet school, because we don't have one here. I also know someone who moved to Alberta right after she graduated high school and did her required university courses there so that she could appy to the vet school at University of Calgary (you have to be a ""resident"" of Alberta to apply to that vet school).

1047501110,1047564281,1/24/2020 15:57,51680,47, It is all good! I hope you enjoyed your Christmas break as well and have enjoyed winter as well! I have kinda looked into vet school and everywhere kinda around me and I think my plan is to go to Saskatchewan. But if I'm being honest I'm not 100% sure on any of it yet. ," 2023-02-16, 16:21:",Mentee,Posts in Career Exploration
1047501110,1047564281,1/24/2020 15:57,51680,49, That's fair! It takes a little while to figure out!! Just wondering if you'd like to move on to another module or if you want to continue with career exploration? :) The other modules are in the green wheel up at the top and I'm happy to talk about whatever you find most interesting or helpful!," 2023-03-13, 15:25:",Mentor,Posts in Career Exploration
