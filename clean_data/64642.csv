Hi Jen! How are you so far? Can’t believe it’s already April. Did anyone you know play April Fools pranks?
A: No haha. It was just a regular day. A good day to recharge my battery from the Easter weekend. Did you do anything or are you not a Easter fan?
Q1: I think I know what you’re talking about. My friend went to Japan and I saw that her hair stylist recommended like a balayage but at the bottom. It looks really cool. Did the hair stylist not bleach your hair? I can see how the colour would be different if they didn’t bleach it or if they didn’t want to bleach it too much. When I went to a silver grey colour, my hair was fried. After a few days, it became super frizzy because I had to bleach it a ton. I used to keep it long until a few years ago when I accidentally cut it shorter than I usually do. I realized I liked it better because my hair dried so much quicker + it was a little wavy when it was shorter + and it had more volume. My hair is super thin and it gets oily quickly soooo having shorter (a little longer than shoulder length) hair helps me with those issues. I never style because I don’t know how. I like being low maintenance. My friends usually style their hair to have some waves. I’m lucky cause after I entered university, my hair went from super straight to naturally slightly wavy. Idk what happened.
A: I think she mentioned it, but I wasn't paying attention because I wasn't really ""braining"" at the time lol. She did use a tool to put stuff in my hair however. Oh nice :D It can due to hormones and I think the environment you live as far as I know?
Q2: What would you say represents your generation? I’m at that weird spot where I could watch movies on cassette tapes, but I also used a lot of CDs.
A: Good question, I guess maybe the XBOX 360 and old video games :p
Q3: I already want to go back to Japan. I want to check out Korea and Taiwan first. After that, back to Japan. The good thing I realized is that, compared to traveling to other places, Japan is relatively cheap. The conversion rate right now is great for us.  The hotels aren’t as expensive compared to Canada. The cost of one meal here lasted me an entire day (3 meals) in Japan.
A: Yooooo, awesome!
Q4: I don’t remember. I think Shrek had really good songs that fit their scenes.
A: Lol, my bad. I was gonna mention the cover of ""Hit Me Baby, One More Time"".
Q5: Ahah so have I. I’m prob gonna pass on watching it, but the memes are really funny. Recently, I keep seeing memes about a game called “You’re not my neighbour”.
A: Lol.
Q6: Yesterday was my last day with the kitties : ( very sad. Their names are Bonnie and Clyde. Bonnie is the black cat and Clyde is the grey one. Bonnie likes to run out and roll around in the hallway when I open the door lol. I get a workout whenever I have to drag her back in. She also bites and scratches. Very moody cat. Clyde is super sweet. He was shy at the beginning. By the end, he was following me around and meowing at me. I’d sit there and read a bit before I left. He’d always sit beside me and chill.
A: Awh :( That sucks. Love the names though!
QOTD: Do you have pets? If not, then would you ever get one?

Hi Jen! Hope you’re doing well. How did your mani-pedi and hair appointment go? Did you get a balayage? I cut my hair a few days ago myself : ) it’s pretty short now about an inch below my shoulders. I love how quickly it dries after a shower lol
A: Hi! My mani-pedi went well :) My hair appointment went good as well lol. It's kindaaa like a balayage? (it was done at the bottom of my hair if you were confused haha) It's like a orangey-brown color (I think it was supposed to be honey-blonde but the hair dresser said my natural hair was too dark to do so, lol. It was orange when I came out of the salon but it started to change so it's now like a caramel brown? Not complaining though, haha!) but cool about your hair! Do you always cut your hair short and do you style it at all?
Q1: Yeah, I think that’s what makes it a popular merch item tho cause not many people use CDs or vinyls. That way, it’s supposed to be “special”
A: Hmm yeah, good point! I like to think that each generation has something special that represent different things that happened in their life.
Q2: Weirdly enough, I was more worried about my law exam than my cost accounting exam. I did horribly in cost accounting but way above the average for law. So weird. It’s really making me wish I went into Law than accounting ahaha.
A: Ahhh, exams. That sucks, though. I wish you success :)
Q3: I got a monitor arm too and installed it over the weekend. Now I can fit two monitors on one desk. It’s super handy and makes it convenient to look stuff up while I’m doing schoolwork or gaming. Or even when I’m watching youtube, I can google other stuff.
A: Yo, that sounds cool!
Q4: It reminds me of when I was in Japan. They had a miniature world. I didn’t go cause the area was inconvenient but the pics online are cool.
A: That's awesome! Would you ever go back to Japan? I've heard lots of good things about Japan and I'm thinking to go see for myself someday, but it must be really expensive!
Q5: I think 4/10 is an appropriate rating. Definitely wouldn’t watch it again. It’s kinda sad how the series went from being so good to what it is now. I’m open to hearing it if you want to explain it!
A: I forgot about most of the movie except the song at the end ROFL (if you know, you know)
Q6: Did you watch the remake of Avatar the last Airbender? I didn’t watch it myself but I watched a review of it on Youtube. It’s honestly so disappointing. I watched the movie years ago and that was absolutely terrible. I know some people said it’s at least better than the movie but that’s not hard to do considering how bad it was.
A: Ah, I don't think I've watched the remake yet but I've seen memes of it going around XD
Q7: I’m babysitting my neighbour’s cat for the next week so I might send you a pic or two when I go see them : )
A: For sure! Please do :)

Intro: Hi Jen, I’m doing well. Thanks for asking! Got any plans for this week? I got a few assignments due on Wednesday but I’m meeting a friend on Friday for some udon. He also came back from Japan about a month ago, so this is our chance to catch up. Last year, I got a CD + Vinyl set from a game I played. My friend got me a vinyl player for my birthday so I could use it (I think I previously mentioned it). But the set still isn’t here. I’m pretty sure I ordered it almost an entire 12 months ago ahhhhh
A: Hey! I got a mani-pedi today, and I'm gonna get together with my friends tomorrow and then I'm gonna get my hair done!!! Oh that's cool! Hope you had a good time :D Niceeee, I don't see a lot of people using CDs or vinyls anymore, lol.
Q1: Thank you! Still no information on my results. I’m hoping it’ll be good (or passable at least loool).
A: Keeping my fingers crossed for you!
Q2: I GOT THE OFFER WEEEEEE. So excited. I’m doing the onboarding right now. I won’t start until May so I got plenty of time to prepare. Only downside is that their office is like an hour away. Yeah, it’s an accounting thing. Even though I found an internship for this summer, I guess I still gotta do the applications for a job starting next year lol.
A: Congratulations!! Sorry to hear about the distance, though.
Q3: I never watched Ninjago. My friend got me the lego Harry Potter game. I haven’t played it yet. I think it was Lego day (???) if that’s a thing a few days ago? Maybe last week? The lego store near me was handing out pins and there was a huge line.
A: Fair enough XD. That's neat! I don't think I've been to events like that lol.
Q4: I 100% agree. I haven’t watched the third movie, but the first and second one was so well done. I felt like it had a good blend of humour and plot. The villains were impressive, and their motivations made sense. Someone told me they heard good things about Kung Fu Panda 4 before I went to go watch it. Girl lied. I’ve only seen criticisms about the same thing you noticed. I feel like the villain in the fourth movie barely used her powers. Her motivations didn’t make much sense. Her plan was really weak. 
In the later half of the movie, every villain from the previous movies shows up but they didn’t even do anything. Sooo disappointing. Even after so many movies, Po didn’t change. I think a good animated movie that shows the main character growing up would be How to Train Your Dragon. I haven’t watched the last movie from that series tho I have heard what happens.
A: Yeeeah, I went with my younger sister a couple days ago and we though it was meh. I give it like a 4/10.
Q5: Oh, wow but is the story complete? Season 3 is short. I guess the long episodes kinda make up for it. Some shows I’ve watched, there are 12 episodes in one season, but they make each episode around 10 minutes.
A: It is, but fans seem to speculate that there's more to the story than what's been shown. (kinda difficult to explain lol)

Intro: Hey Jen! How have you been?
A: I'm alright, you?
Q1: After I finished my midterm, I went out to do some errands, so I ended up passing out as soon as I got home. All I can say is wow that test was something all right. On the bright side, I’m finished my exams! On the downside, the assignments are never ending.
A: Oh yeah, congrats on your exams and sorry to hear about your assignments. It can be difficult.
Q2: Also, I’m hopefully getting good news today. I did my interview on Tuesday then on Wednesday morning, I got a background check request. I was a little surprised because I’ve never gotten that request before getting an offer. Usually, it’s only after that they check from my experience. I got a call from the company around 2 but I was doing my midterm. They should be getting back to me today. Fingers crossed that it’s an offer.
A: I hope you get it!
Q3: I'm also looking at the BIG4. Idk if you've heard of them but they're top accounting companies. They're hiring right now but positions for next year. Like some don't even start until next year September which is crazy to me lol. That's so far in advance. Who knows what I'll be doing around that time.
A: Nope, I don't think I've heard of that haha.
Q4: Ohh yeah I think I heard about New Jeans doing a collab with them. I’m not 100% sure because I’m not a big fan of their music. What other shows did you use to watch when you were younger? I read the Owl house for my children’s lit class. I didn’t know there was a show for it.
A: Yeah, like I mentioned before, I have not heard much about them. I think I've watched Ninjago, LEGO Friends and I think that's all I can remember for now. I will update if I can think of anymore lol. I actually didn't think they had a book until now haha! But yes, there's a show but only has 3 seasons :( 3rd season only has 3 episodes and they are around 40 mins.
Q5: I know! No regard for the cats at all. It reminded me of my old place. I used to live near an old man with a blind dog. The dog ended up that way because he fed them chocolate : ( which I heard you’re absolutely not supposed to do.
A: That sucks, I'm sorry :(
Q6: What did you think of it? My friends and I were kinda disappointed in Kung Fu Panda 4. I won’t spoil anything in case you want to watch it in the future, but basically we thought it had a lot of untapped potential. Compared to the previous films (idk if you’ve watched them), the fourth movie was disappointing.
A: It was pretty good. I don't really mind if you give spoilers or not, don't think I'm gonna watch it due to a lot of videos I've been seeing on people giving reviews and it's not exactly good reviews either. But it could be because I feel that the 4th one didn't necessarily live up to their legacy as much as the other 3 did.
Q7: Do you have a favourite youtube channel or any channels that you recommend?
A: I don't currently, sorry :( I will update if I can

Intro: Hey Jen! Finally replying on time loool. Wow, that must be some cold. It’s been here for so long. Hopefully, it’ll be gone sooner than later. I remember my sister had a persistent cough for nearly half a year. Luckily, it’s healed now but my mom and I were wondering wtf was going on. She said it was cause people at school were constantly sick so she kept catching the same cold over and over again.
A: Yeh. Sorry to hear that. That must have been terrifying.
Q1: Did you also watch Powerpuff girls? Or Danny Phantom? Icarly? 
A: I think I distinctively watched Powerpuff Girls, but like in clips and short videos and also through a k-pop band named ""NewJeans"". I've heard of Danny Phantom, but never watched it. iCarly, watched it briefly but not a lot. But I mostly watched what was on cable at the time as a kid. And also recently I've been watching videos and clips about the Owl House and it's pretty cool.
Q2: Yeah, I think milk products are bad for cats (despite shows always showing them drinking milk). It wasn’t like a little bit or anything but the lady kept going back with spoonfuls of cake. Plus, their cake box was covered in cream and the cats were eating out of that. It was kinda awkward cause, in my friend’s review, the owner replied and kinda blamed us? Saying we should’ve protected the cats. We did try to stop them and we told an employee after but they kept doing it.
A: Goodness, people these days.
Q3: Did you watch Dune yet? I’ve been seeing the popcorn bucket everywhere lol. Are you planning on getting it? I’m going to the theatre on Sat to watch Kung Fu Panda 4.
A: Yes! Me and my best friend went on Thursday :D No, we didn't get the Dune bucket lol. Cool, hope you have fun!
Q4: What have you been up to recently? For me, I decided I wanted to get back into writing. I’ve been working on a short story and, if it turns out well, I might try to get it published!
A: Not a lot currently, haha. Good luck with your book!

I looked at the calendar and it was somehow Friday already then, I accidentally fell asleep and here I am ahhaha. My mom went back to her hometown to visit her grandparents so I’ve been doing all the cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. That might be why I’m so tired. I love grocery shopping but it can be so hectic.
A: It's okay I understand, same to you.
Q1: How’s your cold now?
A: Still here to stay for a while lol.
Q2: OMGGG everyone I mentioned Miffy to never watched it other than my one friend lol. I mean I also really liked watching Pengu.
A: ROFL, you just unlocked another childhood memory of mine :D Thank you!
Q3: How was the dinner? I went for dinner at the Japanese place and wow it was expensive. Since it was a tapas, you were supposed to order a lot of smaller dishes and share them. We did but the portions were so small while they were also expensive. I was still hungry when I got home. Also, I got a drink and it ended up being like $18 for one.
A: It was good. Sounds expensive!
Q4: When I went to the cat café, I saw some people feeding the cats their cake. After our hour was over, I told the employee and I saw her telling the owner when I left. Later, someone I know who works there reached out to me because they saw it was me in the security videos. I asked why he knew and he said he watched them because someone left a really bad review. I checked google reviews and omg the girl I went with wrote a very long review with lies about how the cats were matted, the employees could see the person feeding the cats cake (they couldn’t), and how when we told them about it, they didn’t care. I had no idea she was going to write this. I’m not close with her either so I didn’t know how to bring up the review. Kinda awkward.
A: WAIT WHAT? Isn't cake bad for cats if my memory is correct? Eghhh, that doesn't sound good.
Q5: Yeah! A balayage is always classy. Everyone I know that dyes their hair for the first time end up making it a habit lol
A: Haha lol
Q6: Uhh there’s also urban outfitters but I feel like the clothes don’t fit my style well. They’re a little too grunge? There’s oak and fort but tbh I feel like the quality isn’t good and the style is too oversized for me. H&M can be ok but I tend to avoid it cause I used to work there ahah. Flashback to my retail days. It takes me like 40 min to get downtown, so I don’t go often. I guess there are more stores in that mall but it’s all super expensive stuff. Brands like Maje, Canada Goose, Kate Spade, etc. Luxury stores. I’m not too into luxury clothing.

Life can be so hectic, sometimes it’s hard to find a time to sit down and focus. Thanks for the pic of the painting! Super sweet of your friend to make that for you. One of my friends was super into clay for a bit so she made us all little animal figurines. It’s not painting but I thought it was nice of her.
A: Still coughing but I'm going to get it checked out pretty soon. (not sure how long it's been since it started). Lol, nice
Q1: Thank you! I got them from a seller from China. They handmake everything according to your nail size. I tried the cheaper ones from the store but they’re always too big for my fingers. Would you get your nails done again? I think, for now, I’ll stick with nail polish. I really like the polish from a brand called Romand.
A: Lol :)
Q2: Ooo I recommend a balayage. It’s easy to take care of cause it looks more natural when it grows out.
A: Lol, balayage it is! (family and friends also suggested it haha)
Q3: We had American Eagle in the mall near me but that also closed down! Ahah I’ll check out Bluenotes. Thanks!  My local mall used to have a bunch of different clothing stores, but they always quickly closed down. Now, in one mall, half of it are jewelry stores. Now I usually check out Aritzia or Zara. I used to go to Topshop before they also closed down.
A: Whoop- that's not good. Is Aritzia and Zara the only good clothing stores nearby? Have you went to any malls downtown if there's any to speak of?
Q4: Are you a fan of Miffy? My friend’s birthday is coming up. She’s a huge fan of Miffy so I got her a bunch of Miffy stuff. Like a phone lanyard, a humidifier, a card, a postcard, a speaker, and a wall charger all Miffy themed : ) Really hoping she likes it.
A: OMGGGG YESSSSSSS! I watched it a lot on Netflix as a kid. It's not there anymore but ahhh the memories.
Q5: Later today, I’ll be going back to the cat café with some other friends. I’m excited to see the kitties again. For dinner, we’re going to a newly opened Japanese Tapas place. I felt bad cause I had to make this reservation and cancel like 3 times cause my friends were busy ahah.
A: Lol, hope you have fun! Me and my family are going out for dinner as well haha

Hey Jen! Hope you’re still doing well in regards to your cold. Luckily, the weather is warming up. Thanks for your understanding. Life can be so hectic, sometimes it’s hard to find a time to sit down and focus. 
Thanks for the pic of the painting! Super sweet of your friend to make that for you. One of my friends was super into clay for a bit so she made us all little animal figurines. It’s not painting but I thought it was nice of her. 
Thank you! I got them from a seller from China. They handmake everything according to your nail size. I tried the cheaper ones from the store but they’re always too big for my fingers. Would you get your nails done again? I think, for now, I’ll stick with nail polish. I really like the polish from a brand called Romand. 
Ooo I recommend a balayage. It’s easy to take care of cause it looks more natural when it grows out. 
We had American Eagle in the mall near me but that also closed down! Ahah I’ll check out Bluenotes. Thanks!  My local mall used to have a bunch of different clothing stores, but they always quickly closed down. Now, in one mall, half of it are jewelry stores. Now I usually check out Aritzia or Zara. I used to go to Topshop before they also closed down.

Intro: Hey Jen! How’s your cold? Hopefully gone. My friend got covid again recently. I was surprised to hear that people are still catching it nowadays. Aww that’s so sweet of your friend. Do you also like painting? Sorry for my late response. I was pretty busy this week. I did two interviews and I went out with a friend to celebrate our grades after our first round of midterms. Since it’s been a while, I decided to put on some fake nails (pic added). Ignore the background lol.
A: Still have a little bit of a cough but otherwise not bad! Yeah, it's MJ (Michelle-Jones so you don't get confused rofl) from the Spiderman triology (and I was pretty much a fan at the time haha) I'll see if I can send the photo, I don't think I should have any problems as long if it's platform-appropriate lol. And as for painting, sometimes (if it's a good day!). No worries at all! I don't message a lot frequently due to life haha.
Since it’s been a while, I decided to put on some fake nails (pic added). Ignore the background lol. The nails were super cute but I found it super annoying to do stuff with. Washing the dishes was a little difficult. So was chopping stuff. Then when I was out, I couldn’t grab my card from my wallet lol. I was worried about them popping off as well even though I used glue. Two did end up popping off before my day was over. After the day was over, I ripped the rest off.
Q1: The nails look gorgeous! And yes, I understand how you felt, I had them done one and while they look spectacular, there was stuff I wasn't able to do (like you said, getting your card out of your wallet) and also they came off within a few weeks.
 Q2: What kind of highlights do you plan on doing? My friend is dyeing her hair soon as well. She’s going for a purpleish colour with a tinge of red and a brown undertone. I want to dye my hair too but with me out of a job right now, I think I might just let my bleached out grow out entirely so I go back to black hair. My friend said I should try bleaching it myself but I’m a little scared. I think I’ll leave it to the professionals.  
A: My best friend recommended me to get warm honey blonde or a balayage :) And yeah, probably better to leave it to professional hairstylers lol.
Q3: I haven’t checked Ardene’s in a while, but I’ll take a look! I remember there used to be a location near me but they closed down : (
A: That sucks :( Maybe try looking downtown or in a local mall? If not Ardene, maybe American Eagle is a good alternative? (my best friend told me about it)

Intro: Happy Feb! Any plans for this month? Oh noo : ( Sorry to hear about your cold. How are you feeling now? Happy Lunar New Year! Thanks for your patience : ) I finished my midterm and I’m feeling fairly confident.
A: You too! I just have a stuffy nose but I'm gonna steam. Congratulations on your midterm! And I'm gonna hang the painting my best friend made for me during Christmas since I didn't get the chance to lol :)
Q1: Yeah, I think it’s to encourage companies to accept students. Hiring a student means having to invest a lot of time and money on them which I guess most companies find annoying. There aren’t that many internships here in the first place compared to a place like Hong Kong. I was talking to my cousin recently and he said he’s done like 4 internships so far which is typical there yet he’s still struggling to get an interview.
A: I'm sorry to hear about your cousin. I wish him good luck
Q2: Yeah exactlyyy. It’s comfortable to be at home with your own bathroom and your home clothes ahha. I know offices talk about having a fun office with maybe a personal gym and in office food but, I mean, I got food at home. Most internships I found are in person sooo I guess I have to go in either way.
A: Fair enough XD
Q3: Hmm yeah, I suppose so. I like to buy almost fully wool sweaters so those tend to be on the costlier side. I find that they’re a lot better with smells + temperature regulation.
A: Have you looked in Ardene? Their prices isn't too bad, I think
Q4: Is there anything you don’t like eating?
A: Good question, I'm not really picky but I tend to stay away fromv cheese 90% of the time lol
Q5: Let me know what you think of it if you ever get to try it : )
A: For sure!
Q6: Ooo happy early birthday! Looks like March is a really popular month for birthdays. I know at least 3 people with birthdays that month.
A: Lol, thanks! I may or may not get highlights. And cool!
Q7: Not fun at all. Luckily the weather is warming up quite a bit here. How’s it going for you?
A: Yeah. And the weather here isn't too bad
Q8: Do you have any plans for Valentine’s Day?
A: I guess so lol

Mentee commented at,"3:00PM February 2 
Intro: Hi Jen! How’s it going : ) Thanks for your patience during these last few weeks. It’s been super hectic for me.
A: I'm alright so far. Happy February! :D
Q1: Yeah, everyone told me if they need to ask me to continue working part-time, it’s kinda weird. I didn’t really get it but sometimes it’s better to see what your friends say to gain another perspective. I sent them an email, not going too much into why, but declining their offer. Nowadays, I’ve been scouring the internet to find some internships in the summer (which is why I’m a little late responding). It’s been kinda difficult because a lot of places require you to be part of the official school co-op program. Since mine is a diploma you take after undergrad, there is no co-op program option for us. I heard it’s because the government subsidizes part of the cost if the hire is doing co-op.
A: Oh?
Q2: I’m also kinda lazy and I really want a work from home position. In the past, around covid. I feel like there were way more options. Now, a lot of companies are trying to go back to entirely in office or partial in office. Since I don’t drive, what could be easily a 7 min drive ends up requiring me to leave 45 min earlier.
A: Oh yeah. I'm guessing you also want to be closer to amenities as well, yes?
Q3: Right?? It’s so annoying to dress for that weather ahah. Either you’re always sweating or you’re freezing. I’m excited for the weather to become warmer so I can finally dress up. I don’t have a lot of winter clothes (cause sweaters are expensive) so I end up always wearing the same thing.
A: Yes XD And also, I don't think sweaters are too expensive (depending on where you look.)
Q4: Hmm, then are you a fan of tofu? I love it but my sister hates it. I cooked it earlier but she refused to eat any of it.
A: I think I had tofu when I was a kid but then stopped eating it as I got older lol.
Q5: Hopefully! If you like mango, I recommend the mango Korean shaved ice. That’s the classic flavour but they also have strawberry, green tea, chocolate, etc.
A: Great!
Q6: Did you hear about the new Kung Fu Panda movie? Are you planning on watching it?
A: I heard about it, but I don't think I'll watch it because me and my friends are planning to save some money to go see Dune in the next month and then my birthday in the same month haha (won't give full details due to platform rules.)
Q7: It’s been flooding where I am. I went out last weekend to celebrate my friend’s birthday. We went to one café but they ended up being closed. So, we went to fried chicken place but they also ended up being closed. By the time we got to the third restaurant, we were absolutely soaked.
A: Yikes, that doesn't sound fun.

Intro: Hi Jen! Hope you’ve been well. What adventure did you go on? Yep! The snow turned to slush. Other than being splashed by two cars, it’s been all good. I’ve been spending the past few days catching up on school.
A: Hey, lol. How's it going? I went on a plentiful (not travelling though lol). Oh yeah, hope it's going well.
Q1: Thank you so much! That’s how I see it as well. The business wasn’t for me which is 100% fine. I applied to a few internships for the summer and I reapplied to my old job. However, out of nowhere, the place I had just quit called me again cause they want me to work at least part time. Now I’m also confused on what to do. You know what, after thinking about it (mid writing this) I got flashbacks so yeah, I think I’m ok where I’m at right now. Ahah. It was really nice of them to offer though. Gotta enjoy my youth rn.
A:  Yeah, understandable. If they are trying to get you to work there again (that is part-time), then that's probably not a good idea. No former workplace would do that. I would say just say... enjoy what life has to offer, even though life will throw stuff at you sometimes. <----(this will be my quote of the day!)
Q2: Hmm, I think Spring ends up being around 5-14 degrees? So some days, it’s cold and other days it’s hot. Usually, it’s hot and cold throughout the day. In the mornings, it’s chilly then you sweat after 12.
A: Oooh, interesting. I think I get the part where it's chilly in the morning but slowly getting hot in the afternoon hours haha
Q3: I heard Uncharted is really good. It’s also based on a game.
A: Yeah it is lol. And yeah, I heard it is based on a game
Q4: That’s true. I did get the blazer at a good price. Can’t wait until it stops snowing and raining then I can dress up again. I don’t vibe with winter fashion. Which season do you think is best for fashion?
A: Yeah, and if it stops snowing where you are, dress it up with sneakers maybe :p And I honestly don't know. I think any of the seasons are good so I can't really decide for myself lol.
Q5: Only one meal for your last meal?
A: Lol, I guess so at the moment. It usually comes up to hard decision-making but if somebody asks me to choose something I like versus something I don't like, then that's easy enough XD
Q6: Can I choose neither? I feel like snow cones have no flavour while cotton candy is too sweet. Instead, I like Korean shaved ice which is similar to snow cones but they add condensed milk to the ice.
A: That's okay! I haven't had snow cones in years to be honest with you lol. I have cotton candy once in a while XD. Korean shaved ice sounds interesting haha, I'll have to give it a try someday :D
Q7: Ohh I think the androgynous look is amazing on others. I can’t make it work for myself.
A: I mean, you never know! But fair enough.

Intro: Hi Jen. Thanks again for the long wait XD oh boy have I been busy. The snow here is horrendous. It’s thicccc. I had my power go out for a bit. I saw a lot of posts about people getting stuck in elevators.
So, I’ve been pondering my current work status. Going back and forth with a lot of my friends. At work, I found that the work culture wasn’t the best for me. I was also initially told about being able to work from home then I was hit with the no new hires need to work in office for 3 months.
I also applied to change my loans to part time in November. Found out a few days ago that it was rejected and I either have to pay back thousands of dollars in loans or go back to full time. My deadline is tmr so quick decisions.
I don’t want to get too much into it, but I made the decision to quit this morning. Then they came back, and we had a discussion. They said they wanted to give me a promotion eventually cause someone is retiring in the team. I didn’t see myself staying long term though because I found that the company had a lot of communication issues. Since, after graduation, I was thinking about moving on to a larger company, my grades needs to be top notch. Right now, I’m still with them until Friday. Think I’m going to quit and focus on my grades right now. Because I have to add more courses to my schedule and make some adjustments, I’m two weeks behind in two courses now. Gonna hustle and try to catch up.
 
A: Nah I get where you're coming from, I had a little adventure of mine lol. Yeah, I've been hearing about the snow. Hope you're okay though. As for the job, I'm sorry to hear what happened. But at the same time, if it's something that doesn't quite coordinate with you, then I'm happy for you. I wish you nothing but the best of luck for finding your path. (not in a mean way, but I think you know what I mean by that, lol.)
Q1: That is really cold. Even though it’s snowing hard here, the temperature ranges from around -6 to 6 or so.
A: Yeah lol. What's it like during the spring?
Q2: What are you watching on Netflix lately?
A: Haven't watched Netflix a lot lately, but my friend told me that No Way Home and Uncharted was on Netflix now :D
Q3: Backing up on the blazer lol. Well now that I don’t have my office job, should’ve probably held off on the blazer.
A: I mean, if there's an event or party coming up, you could pair it up with jeans or some fancy pants haha
Q4: That’s a beautiful quote : ) Mine shall be: Enjoy the little moments in life OR Tackle life as it comes. Don't stress about the rest! I feel like these two are apt for the current situation.
A: 👍🏽
Q5: I do like the combo of preppy yet grungy look. I think I mentioned it before that I kinda hop between the two. Not too familiar with the tomboy look.
A: Lol, the tomboy look is usually constistent with a baggy hoodie, jeans, loose cargo pants, and mostly just baggy clothes (basically just the androgynous look)
Q6: Bonus question: Not to be morbid, but what would your last meal be? I’m watching this series called Last Meals by Mythical Kitchen. The chef goes through different dishes that the guest said they would eat as their last meal, and they have a long conversation about life. 
I think it’s a three-course meal + dessert. My first meal would be a really good Italian pasta with a mixed drink. I love red sauce pasta. Hold the meatballs, instead I want the meat mixed in with the sauce. It has to come with soft garlic bread. 
My second would be a poke bowl with heaps and HEAPS of salmon and tuna. You have the taste of sushi, but a way larger portion. I also have to eat rice for at least one meal in the day. As for the drink, I think I’ll stick with water.
My last meal would be something with a chicken salad (because I love chicken). Not sure what the main dish would be. What about you?
 
A: Ummm, probably butter chicken? Not sure, honestly. I will come back to it if I can think of anything else lol.
Q7: I like mermaid stories better. If we’re talking about real life situations, I think being a mermaid would be awful because I’m scared of the ocean lol. There’s a lot of trash and I’m scared of big ocean creatures. In conclusion, if life was a story then mermaid. If not then princess. Both seem like a lot of work.
A: Yeah, true lol

Hi Jen. Thanks for waiting! Sorry about the late response. I’ve been coming home completely exhausted after work. Plus, I also have class sooooo I’ve been all over the place recently. I got a nice break today tho lol for some reason my prof didn't show up for class. 
A: No, that's okay, I understand :)
Q1: Is it snowing where you are? We got hit with a sudden onslaught of snow today, so I get to work from home tomorrow! Yayyyy
A: Nah, not really lol. It's pretty cold though. The lowest we got was -15 or 16
Q2: How have things been for you? Anything fun happening?
A: No, not really.
Q3: What’s your fav thing to do when it gets late? Mine is to go get dessert with a friend and chat there. I find that it’s relaxing and a good end to the day.
A: Watch YouTube and Netflix or spend some time with family
Q4: What’s the last purchase you made that you were kinda iffy about but you’re glad that you bought it? Mine is probably a blazer from Aritzia. The quality is way better than I thought.
A: Not sure, I'll try and update next time if I think of anything lol
Q5: What do you think about silk products? Like silk shirts. I heard they stain easily but they're a great elevated fashion piece.
A: They're not bad
Q6: I think my biggest accomplishment would be finally travelling. Is that considered an accomplishment though? I don’t think I accomplished anything important by going. If not that then maybeee finally quitting my previous job to find something that’s related to my degree? I had been pushing it off for so long but I finally made the step to pursue it.
A: Cool!! I mean, it could! It doesn't matter how small or big the accomplishment is, only if you enjoy it. <---- (this will be my quote of the day)
Q7: Honestly, a big reason I didn’t want to find a new job was because my old job was so convenient. But, I mean, it had to end eventually.
A: Yeah, that's true
Q8: Bonus Questions: What are your fashion predictions for 2024? I’m seeing blazers with a more fitted silhouette and more sheer clothing. Maybe more work-chic? Chunky boots are always gonna be popular but maybe more delicate shoes might come back into fashion. What do you think?
A: Not sure, maybe more preppy or tomboy-ish looks? I think that's what's been trending since post-2020 rofl
QOTD: Would you rather be a princess or a mermaid?

Intro: Hey Jen! Happy 2024.
A: Hi Lisa, you too. (✿^‿^)
Q1: Do you like staying out late? Personally, I love it but now with my new job, I have a bed time :( Haven’t been able to stick with it but here’s hoping I do by this weekend ahah.
A: Kinda, it depends. Good luck w/ your new job :D
Q2: I healed really quickly from my sickness but I have soreness in my throat still. I still went out and saw some of my friends in the past couple of days.
A: That's good 👍🏽
Q3: Lol today, I walked to the local shopping mall to pick up a book order at the bookstore. 3 hours later, they sent me another email to pick up a different book. Speaking of books, indigo has a good deal going on right now. Buy 2 novels and get a 3rd one free. It combines with my 10% plum plus membership so it ends up being a little under 40% off (since it’s the lowest priced that’s free). I got 18 books with half of them being pre-orders. I got my eye on a few more but I’m not sure if I should go for it. 
Since collecting books are so expensive, I typically limit myself to buying only the first book of a series or maybe the first few (if it’s a manga series and there’s like 20 books). With this deal, somehow my brain is going I’m basically losing money if I don’t buy ALL the books I want right now ahah.
Honestly, I should finish reading the books I already have. That way, I can donate more books and empty out my shelves.
A: I mean, it's up to you and how much you're willin' to spend XD.
Q4: Let me know how Dune 2 is!
A: Sure! There's still a few months until it hits theatres (which is around March lol.)
Q5: No worries! I meant my skin. It hasn’t been too dry yet.
A: Good to know
Q6: I shouldn’t have talked about the weather lol Now it’s going to be raining all week.
A: XD
Q7: I loved Smile and Amulet when I was younger.
A: Wohoooooo :D
Q8: Thank you!
A: Anytime!
Q9: Do you have any New Year resolutions? What are some things you’re looking forward to this year?
A: I don't really do New Year resolutions because I know that I can't really do them all in one year, so I just put them off :)
Q10: Do you feel like 30 minutes is considered a long walk?
A: It depends on how much energy you have during the day :)

My friends keeps sending me not so subtle hints that she wants to go to Asia this summer. I really want to go but I’m still financially recovering from my last trip. My friend also doesn’t have paid days off until next year. Plus, I feel like this summer is too close to when I started my new job. I feel like Feb 2025 would be a good time job-wise, weather-wise, and money-wise. 
Thank you!

Intro: Thanks for waiting! How was the party?
A: That's okay. The party was fun but ended up coming home later than ever lol. How was your holiday and sickness?
Q1: Yeah, I wish I had watched Ponyo or something I know is really good since my friend isn’t typically interested in animated works or Studio Ghibli. I think she’s really into action films. What genre do you typically go for? I like action as well but not if action is the driving factor of the movie. I feel like the plot needs to be really good. I think I like drama, comedy, and fantasy. Maybe tragedies too. Weirdly enough, I read a decent amount of romance but I don’t like movies in that genre.
A: Lol cool. I don't really know about what genre, just whatever piques my interest :D But I am planning on seeing Dune 2 with my friends :)
Q2: Thank you! Maybe it’s due to the weather but it’s been cooperating somewhat this winter.
A: Oh for what? (I might've forgot maybe lol sorry and also my brain is still on holiday mode)
Q3: Did it snow heavily or was it a light sprinkle? It hasn’t rained a lot here but when it does, it absolutely pours.
A: I think it was a light sprinkle. And yeah I feel you, it rains a ton where I live currently.
Q4: Since I’ve been mostly homebound the past few days, I’ve been catching up on my reading. I read Tender is the Flesh, some Junji Ito stories, and Erha He Ta De Bai Mao Shizun(2-4). I tend to buy books at a faster rate than I read them. I’m glad I was able to check these off the list. Now I’m trying to decide if I should now read the books I got recently or the novels I got years ago. My issue is that I have a sizeable number of novels I got when I was in my teens that I haven’t touched. My tastes have changed since then. I feel bad if I donate those books without even giving them a chance, but I also don’t want to try to read a ton of books only to drop all of them in succession. Or what if I donate all of them and end up missing a gem that I would’ve loved.
A: Lol, sounds nice. I mostly read graphic novels when I was in middle school. (e.g, Amulet, the Smile book series)
Q5: What sweets does your mom make? Not sweets but I’ve been wanting to make some homemade dumplings.
A: I think I’m looking forward to the new year. Other than being nervous about my new job, I think a new year means new opportunities. Also, it’s another year of birthdays. I loveeeeee buying birthday gifts. I think it’s fun trying to think of something that your friend would love. I want to go on more vacations in the future too. What I don’t like is thinking about how I’m slowly getting older. What about you? Do you ever feel like time is moving too fast or too slow?
A: Awesome! You do you :D And yeah time is going pretty fast, but when summer comes around, it gets a bit slower
Q6: You’re right. Faux leather does tear easily. That’s why I’m eyeing some real leather pieces. Pricey but I’ll probably get them after I get my big boy adult job paycheck ahaha.
A: I mean if it's not really expensive as YSL or Gucci, I guess they are a bit expensive but I don't really know. But good luck!
Q7: I do like the style of cargo pants. I was looking at a few from Aritzia. I haven’t seen any with elastic cuffs though. Belts are a good idea. I was looking at one from yes-style that looked cool. It had a metal buckle.
A: That's great :D
Last but not least, Q8: Happy new year! Hope you had a fantastic 2023 and cheers to another amazing year :) It has been absolutely wonderful getting to know you. Hearing your opinions and thoughts no matter how big or small they are has been invaluable to me. I hope, throughout this journey, I've been a helpful companion as well. Let's both work hard and strive to continue learning, exploring, and loving the world around us. For any hardships you may have had in 2023, I hope 2024 brings you the strength to overcome them : ) and that you continue to be surrounded by your friends and family.

Hey Jen! Sorry my response is a little late. I caught a really bad cold (prob from my sister lol) a few days ago and I'm still healing from it. I basically slept most of the last couple of days. I should have a complete response done by tonight or tmr by the latest.

Intro: Merry Christmas, Jen! I’m a little late but there’s still the New Years. Happy New Years in advance! I hope this year was good to you and that it gets even better next year : )
Thanks! You too :D
Q1: Are you doing anything for the New Years?
A: Yep, my family-friends are throwing a party lol
Q2: Ooo how was the movie? I kinda wanted to see it as well but my friends didn’t. We watched the New Studio Ghibli movie instead, but they didn’t like it. I think compared to the previous movies by the same studio, the new one wasn’t as good.
A: Surprisingly, it was pretty good! I thought it wouldn't be good, but oh boy it was super well done :D Haha, fair enough. It probably wasn't their cup of tea. Most new movies nowadays don't really live up to the hype anymore so I get where your friends are coming from.
Q3: Yeah! For some odd reason, the right side of my face has a tendency to get drier than the left side. Sometimes when I wear makeup, it peels a little. It’s there and the area between my eyebrows that tend to be dry.
a: Augh.. that doesn't sound good. I hope it gets better
Q4: Thank you! Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your outlook), there’s no available work at the moment. That means I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with friends and playing games. Fantastic way to spend the holidays. I’m surprised that it hasn’t snowed here yet. It also didn’t rain much either. It’s been an odd year when it comes to the weather.
A: I mean.. at least you can take a break to catch up with friends, hangout, etc. It actually snowed a while ago where I currently live, but it didn't stick around long lol.
Q5: I don’t think I do. I am craving cream puffs right now for some odd reason. Maybe because I saw a bunch out for the holidays? Candy canes are a good treat every now and then too. Do you have any? Maybe hot chocolate?
A: Hot chocolate is good! My mom also makes sweets during the holidays as well :D
Q6: I used to shop at Guess a lot when I was younger. My mom loved Guess too. I had this beautiful biker jacket for many years. Sadly, it ripped (because it was faux leather) a few months ago : (. RIP my beautiful jacket. I’ll remember you as my first leather jacket forever.
A: Awh, that's sad :( I'm sorry. That's why I don't really like to buy faux leather products (including clothing) because I keep hearing that it tears apart a lot.
Q7: I tried. I only found two that were alright (the two that I currently own). One is still a little long and I have to wear platforms for it to work and the other one is fine but a little big on the waist. I found that it’s difficult to find pants with a shorter inseam. Aritzia has that option which is why I tend to go there for pants. I used to go to Topshop too until they closed down in Canada a few years ago. Brands like H&M, Zara, Oak and Fort, etc don’t usually have petite options.  
A: Have you tried cargo pants? Not sure if they're your cup of tea, but most of them have elastic cuffs on the bottom so I think it should be okay for petite frames :) And as for waist part, have you tried wearing a belt? I found it helps half the time. You don't have to set it to the tightest belt hole.
Q8: That’s alright. I’m slowly branching out from jeans by going for trousers. I like how versatile they are because you can dress them down or up. With jeans, it’s not usually allowed in a professional setting.
A: Lol, fair enough

Hey Lisa, merry Christmas!!! (at the time I'm writing this haha) and the volunteer work me and my friend did was greet people in Walmart and collect money on behalf of Salvation Army. And also me and my friends went to go see the Wonka movie :D
Q1: Thank you for the positive reminder! Was a boost to my mood while I was desperately cramming for my exams haha
A: Woohoo!! Glad it helped :D
Q2: I heard Garnier is good. I used to have a hyaluronic acid serum. I switched to Beta Glucan cause my toner already had some hyaluronic acid. What do you usually look for in skincare? I try to find products that are very hydrating since my skin easily gets dry.
A: Lol. Same like you, I try not to look for products that make my skin dry. Even though I have oily/combination skin, I still want to keep it hydrated and healthy anyways.
Q3: The cat is super cute! Now that my exams are over, I’m meeting all my friends. Until school starts back up, that’s 3 times a week that I have something planned with friends. (If I reply a little slow, I probably went out with my friends and passed out as soon as I got home lol I get tired some social events really easily). Since I have so many different groups, I’m trying to get all of them to go to the cat café so I have an excuse to go back.
A: Sounds fun, lol!
Q4: Studying was ehhh. I’m still feeling exhausted from the exams since they were basically back to back AND they were 3 hours long. AAAAAND I had to travel 1.5 hours there and 2 hours back. My finance exam, I studied for about 14-16 hours, 10-12 for my tax exam, and 5 ish hours for my data viz exam. Going out 7 days in a row is sucking my energy away. Unfortunately, now I have to catch up on work.
A: Oh woah, that sucks. I'm sorry. I hope your sleep schedule gets better. I wish you luck on your work :)
Q5: The party was fantastic. Buying ingredients and cooking our own food was a lot cheaper than ordering take out. Had a present exchange : ) I got a cool ditto plushie.
A: Haha, that's awesome! Glad you had fun :D
Q6: Are you lactose? I have difficulties with cheese too.
A: Yes, I think so. 
Q7: 0 or -5 is FREEZING. I’m busting out my winter jackets when it hits below 10 degrees. At -5, I’m staying home or I’m completely bundled up.
A: Haha, lol.
Q8: Hmm I think I like winter? Spring is still kinda cold here since it’s always raining. Then I’m constantly sneezing because of the pollen. The weather is too unpredictable with cold mornings and hot afternoons.  Winter is consistent. It shall be cold and remain cold.
A: Fair enough haha, I guess it all depends on where you are and the environment around you. Some places can be hot during the winter season, whereas it can be cold.
Q9: I know some people tend to look for graphic tees with minimal design, others love flashy designs, some only go for no image + writing, while others do only images, etc etc. I know of mom jeans… never heard of dad jeans. That’s interesting. I usually wear skinnies but I some two straight leg/wide leg jeans. They’re cool. I do have some troubles styling it. I’m short so it feels like the pants are eating up my entire frame.
A: Lol, I looooove graphic prints. I get most of them from Ardene, H&M, Forever 21 and some from Guess :) Dad jeans are kind of a thing from Levi's haha. And also have you tried looking for shorter ones? I think some jeans have different inseam lengths for different heights (not 100% sure)

Hi, best of luck with your finals :D Doesn't matter when you respond but however next week will be mixed w/ some events for me as well because one of the days I will be joining my friend (since we're volunteering) and will be getting together for gift exchanges at some point lol. So my response time will be not-so-active either since my mind is currently on lazy mode rofl. But yeh, take your time. I'm still around but don't rush yourself :) Don't forget to stay hydrated and don't forget to eat!!!
Positive reminder of the day: You are smart and cool :)
Hope to talk soon! ʕ·ᴥ·ʔっ

Hey Jen!
Just a heads up, I'm now during finals season. My last final is in a week so I might not be able to respond in the meantime, but I'll try my best! Otherwise, I should be able to respond by the 19th if that's alright with you : )

Hi Lisa, apologies for delaying my reply lol. I promise I'm still around! Was a bit busy, and yes we finished the tree :D
Q1: Hmm, what kind of face wash is it? Vitamin C serum absolutely counts. I heard it’s really good for reducing acne scars.
A: I use Garnier (the hyaluronic acid collection)
Q2: Group projects for you too? Thank you! I’m all done with my group projects including my in-class presentation. As of now, I’m officially done with all my classes. I got my finals in a week then 2.5 weeks of sweet, sweet vacation.
A: Not sure what you are talking about lol. And cool :)
Q3: Good news! You are now talking to someone who has a full-time accounting clerk position starting in January. I got a few offers, so I emailed around and asked if my first choice would take me : D. Surprisingly, today I got another request for an interview for a game studio (still an accounting position). I thought I might as well do the interview and see how I do though I’m most likely going to stick with what I got now.
A: Congratulations :D
Q4: Yesterday my friend bought me dinner as congrats for the job so I took her to the cat café. (Pic included). My fav cat is getting adopted. I’m happy for her but also a little sad that I won’t see her anymore : (
A: That sucks, I'm sorry :( It must've been fun while it lasted. I'm glad you got to bond with her before. But she looks so cute!!!
Q5: Today, I’m going out to study with a friend. Tomorrow, we’re having a Birthday/Christmas/Hot pot party at my friend’s place again. I’m excited to give out my gifts. Usually, I don’t send out Christmas cards. I got a few requests this year, so I bought a box. I struggled to fill them out since I see my friends so often, I had no idea what to say. For one of them, I added, “You usually have cool pants.” Ahahah. Do you usually give your friend Christmas cards?
A: Cool :D How did it go? (the party and the studying)
Q6: I also heard about Disney cruises being well-known for their quality. Don’t know if I would want to be on a Disney themed cruise though.
A: Ye, but I've never been in one though lol.
Q7: Do you prefer a specific type of graphic tee or jeans? I used to only wear skinnies. Now I’m branching out to other styles like flared and wide leg. Right now, flared pants are my fav style. How do you feel about clothing patterns such as gingham, cow print, etc?
A: For patterns, I don't mind it I guess, lol. Not sure what you mean about specific graphic tee though XD. As for jeans, I wear mom jeans, loose/baggy jeans and I've been looking to try dad jeans (yes, that's kind of a thing from Levi's lol) and I've seen most people wear jeans with Converse or Nikes haha
Last but not least, Q8: At what temperature do you pull out the winter jackets? What is the best type of cheese?
A: Typically below 0 or -5 lol. How about you? Uhh as for cheese, I tend to avoid it whenever because I can't really eat it, sorry :(
QOTD: Do you like snow or do you prefer spring weather?
Take care!
You too, have a good one :D",3:35PM December 11

I’m excited to see my friends tomorrow for the Christmas party. Otherwise, I usually don’t celebrate it. I think I use it as an excuse to exchange gifts with my close friends. One of my friends has their birthday a day before Christmas. Sometimes I feel bad cause it seems overshadowed by the holidays.

Intro: Hey Jen! How’s it going?
A: Hey, happy December Lisa! I'm well -- gonna put up my tree today lol :D
Q1: I found a new leather jacket from AllSaints : ) It hasn’t been delivered yet but I’m excited. I finally got a delivery for my skincare that I ordered MONTHS ago too. Do you use any skincare products?
A; Cool! Lol, does face wash + vitamin c serum count?
Q2: I wanted to reply yesterday. Sadly, I’ve been incredibly busy with school. For my first group project, we had one member who did it last minute and, unfortunately, couldn’t figure out the calculations. I had to work on their portion the entire day and overnight. We did eventually finish. Then on Monday, we had a new group project. My classmates have difficulties with the program, so I ended up having to do that myself yesterday.
A: Lol, no worries. I did just about the same thing XD. My week was pretty hectic too. Good luck with your projects!
Q3: On the bright side, I got another call for an interview. I have it tomorrow. I’m pretty excited. I feel like I might actually find a full time job at this rate haha. I actually went back on Indeed to check a position I applied for weeks ago. There were 2000 people that applied for it. Isn’t that crazy?
A: Congrats! Good luck :)
Q4: I also went to my friend’s house for a dinner party (though I ended up having to do my project after going home). It was super fun. We were going crazy on the switch. I’ve also never been to his house before so it was interesting seeing the inside. I called an uber to drive me home. The driver was super sweet, and we chatted throughout the long ride.
A: Haha, cool!
Q5: Yeah, maybe because I’m such a night owl. I usually like doing assignments near the end of the day. It feels peaceful when it’s super quiet, it’s dark out, and you’re tapping away on your keyboard. Do you ever get this feeling?
A: Lol, nice! Nah, I guess not.
Q6: Ooo do you have a specific cruise in mind? I think I wouldn’t mind it, but my friend says cruises are for seniors.
A: Not sure lol. I heard Disney cruises are pretty dope. I've had a few cruises come to my city over the summer haha
Q7: If you could get a pet, what would you choose?
A: Probably a puppy for now haha
Q8: No worries. I’ll give a quote this time. “Okay,” – Lisa, 2023
A: Lol.
Q9: I like to read! Though I’ve had to put that to a stop cause of school and the whole applying to jobs situation. I like to research places before I apply to them, so it takes a chunk of my day.
A: Cool!
Q10: I like the men’s t-shirts and sweatshirts from H&M. I got one where, on the back, it says in teeny tiny print, “why are you standing so close to me” or something along those lines.
A: Haha nice
Q11: Uhhh Idk how to explain it. I think someone said my style was similar to Korean Preppy Grunge? Or a little similar to Dark Academia fashion but all black and a little more grunge? I like to wear casual blazers and leather jackets. A lot of my clothes are cropped polos or plain t-shirts. Pants are usually slacks or skinny jeans. What’s your wardrobe like?
A: Haha, good question! My wardrobe is pretty mixed ranging from Hawaiian shirts, graphics, jeans and cargo pants :)
Q12: Bonus Questions: What is something you’re looking forward to that’s coming up? Do you keep a stash of emergency gifts?
A: Not really lol.

Intro: Hey Jen! How have you been? Find anything good for Black Friday? I got my leather jacket. It ended up being kinda ugly on me soooo had to return that. Now I’m on a hunt for the best one again.
A: Awh, sorry it didn't work out.
Q1: Omg since I last talked to you, I actually got a call from a company for an accounting position. I did an interview with their HR on Thursday and with two managers on Friday. The decision comes out in about a week and a half. It’s all going real fast.
A: Wishing you the best of luck!
Q2: How do you like H&M? I was going to drop off some clothes cause I added a blazer to my donate pile. Then suddenly, I got a msg today from the Facebook marketplace from someone who wanted to buy it the same day. This whole week is full of surprises.
A: It's pretty good! I got a sweatshirt from there that says ""Paris, Place Vendôme""
Q3: I’m pretty tired though. I’ve been working on my group presentation for hours. We have to make a bunch of statements. We divided the work but I have my group members asking me for help. So, I ended up having to do that on top of my own work.
A: Augh, what a pain. I hope you get through your stuff :)
Q4: Now I still have to finish a tax assignment before I could go sleep : ((. I’m going to a friend’s house today so I’m worried I won’t finish it in time if I leave it till after.
A: My solutions don't normally work but I'd say do it before you go (maybe like 2 hours before? Depends when)
Q5: Have you ever gone on a cruise before? I think I’d like to go one day.
A: Hmmmm, I don't think so lol. I might go next year or the year after. How 'bout you?
Q6: I wish I could get a pet. My mom isn’t the biggest fan of animals. I know that, once I get my own place, I’m definitely getting a cat or two and one dog. I want the dog to be a golden retriever or some kind of bigger dog breed. As for the cats, I want an orange cat and the other one can be whatever as long as it’s not hairless. I thought about getting a hamster, but I want a pet to cuddle with. What about you?
A: Hmmm, I don't know honestly. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Who knows, lol.
Q7: I used to wear denim jackets. I still have a few but I don’t think I look good in them. They’re very casual. I think I prefer more structured outfits. They’re kinda a category above sweatpants, sweatshirts, and yoga pants which I would never wear.
A: Haha, that's fair. Structured outfits as in what? Kinda curious as to what it is lol.
Q8: If you ever feel like you’re in need of some vampire, definitely check out vampire diaries. I never finished it tho cause uh 8 seasons is a lot. I don’t have the attention span. I also really liked The Office. Never finished all the seasons for that either.
A: I'm probably gonna have to politely decline since I'll get bored eventually. But thanks for the offer! The Office is comedy gold XD

Intro: Hey Jen! How was your weekend? I had my interview with the second company today. I think it went well since the role is similar to my current job. I learned that their headquarters is in New Jersey, USA, but when I googled reviews of the company, most of the employees were located in Asia. So, maybe some of their higher level employees are in the US and the rest are in Asia? Then, before, they didn’t hire people from Canada but now they are. They recently signed a deal with a few companies to help them develop a Language Model for generative AI, so they’re looking for Canada + US based writers.
A: Cool, congrats! It was good I guess. Hmmm, interesting.
Q1: I saw some people making bets on whether it’ll snow this year or not. I read somewhere that this year has been the driest it’s been in a while. Now that I think about it, it barely rained this year and, when it did, it was only drizzling.
A: ROFL
Q2: Oh, I don’t know any thrift stores that pay you for products. All the places I’ve seen only take donations. That’s interesting. I know H&M has a recycling program where if you donate a bag of old clothes, they give you a $5 coupon.
A: Lol, I don't really think they pay you if you donate? At least, not where I'm living right now XD. Haha, interesting! I didn't know that about them. I've only been to H&M a few times on holidays rofl.
Q3: The ocean is beautiful in the sun. I really want to learn how to fish and to get on a boat with my friends. Maybe it’s less glamorous in person, but I really want to sit in a boat with my friends and just chill.
A: YES SIREE! (just maybe don't get a speed boat if you're planning to chill in the lake ROFL)
Q4: Do you have plans to visit one of them? Or are you not a fan of amusement parks?
A: I have been to a few -- not exactly a fan of rollercoasters though!
Q5: THEY ARE SUPER CUTE. Unfortunately, the day I went, there were two younger kids there who were kinda harassing the poor cats : ( so the cats were avoiding most people. I dropped by again over the weekend (looked at them from the outside) and they were a lot happier.
A: Awh, I'm sorry about that. I guess they're just kids, so maybe they'll learn not to do that next time lol. Do you have plans to get a pet or no?
Q6: Over the weekend, my friend msged me cause he was at a nearby mall. They were having a special promotion where you could get $50 for every $500 you get in mall gift cards. However, he was there alone and there was a limit of $1000 per person. My friend needed $2000 because he was going to buy an iPhone with it. My gosh, the wait was soo long. My friend waited for a total of 3 hours and I was there for 2 hours.
A: YIKEEEEES.
Q7: Black Friday deals began. I ended up spending $1500-1600 over the weekend. I’m completely broke now. My leather jacket recently ripped. That was the second leather jacket in the past year that ripped on me, so I decided to get a real leather jacket as an investment. Then the rest were some clothes from Aritzia, Nintendo games for an incoming party, some Christmas gifts, and some stuff from Amazon. I wanted to buy the Sony WH-CH520 headphones in blue but they’re sold out : (
A: Ooof, sorry about your jacket. Just curious though, have you worn denim jackets at all?
Q8: Did you buy anything? Did you start buying Christmas gifts yet?
A: Haha, I don't think so lol.
Q9: Is it Twilight??? No way. I admit it’s uhhh something but it’s so iconic. Every time I think of sparkly skin, I think of Edward. Did you ever watch Vampire Diaries? I was obsessed with that show when I was younger.
A: Yes, it is lol. Apparently, most people think it's cringe now than what's been said before. I think I've heard of Vampire Diaries but didn't watch it because I was too young at the time it released XD.
Q10: My fav colour is black!

Intro: Hey Jen! I’m doing alright! I’ve finished with my interview so I’m waiting for a response now. The person said it would take 1-2 weeks for the SECOND interview. I also did a writing test for another company after passing their first stage. They look like they’re expanding to Canada from Asia, but I think I might tell them I’m no longer interested in the position. I want to find a position with a direct supervisor so I’m able to use them as a reference later on.
A: Hey! Glad the interview went well. Kinda curious though, have they always wanted to expand further or were they not able to?
Q1: Ew until the end of March? That’s too much snow. I got Timberland boots a few years ago but I’ve only worn them maybe 3 times. They’re so stiff and hard to walk in. I thought about selling them, but it looks like there’s not a good market for them.
A: Yeah unfortunately. I think it was only that one year though. I don't know what's gonna happen this year but so far.. nothing really happened, lol. And I'll likely be moving next summer so I won't know after that anymore. And as for selling your Timberlands, have you tried going to a thrift store near you? I don't necessarily know if they'll take them in (probably depending on the condition that they're in) but I guess it's worth a try, but good luck! (Also i
Q2: I didn’t know there was a second “It” movie. I remember when the first came out and everyone was talking about it. I remember one horror movie that came out (I think) this year called The Terrifier 2. Apparently, it was so scary that some people fainted in the theatres. I usually don’t watch horror movies, but I do love psychological thrillers.
A: Oh.
Q3: Oh, the Seven Wonders of the World would be:
The Great Wall of China
Chichén Itzá
Petra
Machu Picchu
Christ the Redeemer
Colosseum
Taj Mahal
They’re all famous historical sites. Apparently, there was another list but this one is the updated 2007 list.
As for me, regarding the ocean or space, I think I’d like space better. The ocean kinda freaks me out since you can see the top layer but you can’t see anything below it.
A: Oh cool! I'd love to see the Taj Mahal with my friends and family someday :) I only like the ocean because I like how it's pure, blue and shimmery when the sun's out lol.
Q4: Definitely Universal Studios. When I went to Japan, we opted for Universal Studios instead of Tokyo’s Disneyland. I wouldn’t mind checking it out in the future, but I wasn’t a Disney kid when I was younger. I think Universal Studios has more exciting rides like the Spiderman one. Universal Studios also has Hogwarts.
A: Fair enough lol. I haven't been to either, so I'd sorta see why haha.
Q5: I like Dua Lipa’s songs. They’re always catchy. The one you recommended is from the Barbie movie, I think.
A: Lol.
Q6: It’s getting cold now. I went out on Monday to see cats with my friend (I’ll add a pic of my fav cat). By the time we were done and I had to walk home, I was freezing cause I brought a light jacket. I need more Autumn-Winter transition jackets. Like the ones that aren’t super thick but they’re not thin either.
A: AWWWWH THEY'RE SO CUTE :D
Q7: Bonus Questions: Do you think Centaurs or Mermaids are cooler? What about Vampires vs Werewolves?
A: Centaurs, definitely. As for vampires or werewolves, unfortunately I'm gonna have to say neither. (mainly because of a certain film-series ruined it for me and mostly everybody -- cough cough. Can you guess what it is?)

I want to find a position with a direct supervisor so I’m able to use them as a reference later on. 
I used duct tape! I think it’s time to replace it tho. It’s getting kinda grimy. 
Ew until the end of March? That’s too much snow. I got Timberland boots a few years ago but I’ve only worn them maybe 3 times. They’re so stiff and hard to walk in. I thought about selling them, but it looks like there’s not a good market for them. 
I didn’t know there was a second “It” movie. I remember when the first came out and everyone was talking about it. I remember one horror movie that came out (I think) this year called The Terrifier 2. Apparently, it was so scary that some people fainted in the theatres. I usually don’t watch horror movies, but I do love psychological thrillers. 
Last but not least, Q8: Bonus questions: Which of the Seven Wonders of the World do you want to visit the most? Do you prefer the ocean or space?
A: I'm not sure what you mean by the ""Seven Wonders of the World"" haha. Probably the ocean, lol.
Oh, the Seven Wonders of the World would be:
The Great Wall of China
Chichén Itzá
Petra
Machu Picchu
Christ the Redeemer
Colosseum
Taj Mahal
They’re all famous historical sites. Apparently, there was another list but this one is the updated 2007 list. 
As for me, regarding the ocean or space, I think I’d like space better. The ocean kinda freaks me out since you can see the top layer but you can’t see anything below it. 
Definitely Universal Studios. When I went to Japan, we opted for Universal Studios instead of Tokyo’s Disneyland. I wouldn’t mind checking it out in the future, but I wasn’t a Disney kid when I was younger. I think Universal Studios has more exciting rides like the Spiderman one. Universal Studios also has Hogwarts. 
I like Duo Lipa’s songs. They’re always catchy. The one you recommended is from the Barbie movie, I think. 
Song of the Day: 3D by Jungkook. 
It’s getting cold now. I went out on Monday to see cats with my friend (I’ll add a pic of my fav cat). By the time we were done and I had to walk home, I was freezing cause I brought a light jacket. I need more Autumn-Winter transition jackets. Like the ones that aren’t super thick but they’re not thin either. 
Bonus Questions: Do you think Centaurs or Mermaids are cooler? What about Vampires vs Werewolves?

Intro: Hey, Jen! Hahah certainly was a surprise when I got like 10 emails about your reply. I thought my outlook was glitching out. Anyway, I hope you’re doing well! It’s been incredibly windy here too. Power has been knocked out in some areas. It happens every now and then but the sound of the wind outside was real loud. It makes me worry about my window net. When I moved here, there was a sizable hole in the corner, so I patched it up by taking paper in the shape of the hole, covering it with tape to make it sturdier, then taping it to the edges of the hole (both sides). I was worried it would fly off in the wind every time this happens, but it’s been sturdy so far.
A: Hi! Yeah sorry, haha. I had internet troubles the other day XD. I guess I'm doing fine, how about yourself? Did you use duct tape or clear tape? Cause I don't think clear tape would be sturdy enough lol.
Q1: I hope it properly snows here this year. Every time it snows, it rains a bit after or it’s like rain snow. It turns all the snow on the ground into slush then into ice. It’s so inconvenient to walk through. Plus, the bridge near me starts dropping ice on the cars. It’s a total mess. When I was younger, I moved to a nearby city but I wanted to continue attending the same high school. Every day I’d bus there and back. This one winter, the snow was so bad and the bridge was closed. I had to go around, and everything was jampacked. It took me 6 hours to get home.
A: Yah, same here (except where I am living right now, it usually snows around late-December, early January? Well around 2021, the snowfest started around after Christmas and didn't end 'til the end of March but it changes every year rofl
Q2: I saw so much Christmas décor, but not a lot of leftover Halloween candy on sale : (. The best time to get candy is always after Halloween.
A: That sucks. Sorry.
Q3: I might go next year! It all depends. I’m hoping to have a full time job by next year to beef up my resume though. I have an interview on Monday for a writing position. Wish me luckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I also did the first test for a government position. Really exciting. Hoping I pass 😊 I prob won’t get the results soon though since it’s a long weekend.
A: Hey well, good luck :D
Q4: Have you seen any movies based on Stephen King’s novels? I brought three of his books, but I’m too scared to watch any of the movies.
A: Yes I have! I don't know if you've seen or heard of ""It"". I've watched the movies, but never read the books. I think I still own the 2nd ""It"" movie on DVD, but don't know where it is in my house, alas.
Q5: Is that a typical answer?? I think I’d go for a lower paying job in a field I’m really interested in. Maybe if I’m ok with the higher paying job, I’d go for it. If I dislike it, I’d never even if it paid me a lot. I think I’d end up quitting before a year there. I’d also heavily consider whether it’s work from home too. If it was, I’d accept lower pay. Not having to spend around 3 hours a day and $120 a month on transportation adds up.
A: I guess so from different people, but I'm assuming they'll choose the same answer as you.
Q6: I’d bring another person. If I’m gonna be stuck on an island, someone else must suffer with me.
A: ROFL
Q7: I really wanna see Stray Kids. I know they went to Seattle last year. Who do you want to go see?
A: Not sure, honestly.
Last but not least, Q8: Bonus questions: Which of the Seven Wonders of the World do you want to visit the most? Do you prefer the ocean or space?
A: I'm not sure what you mean by the ""Seven Wonders of the World"" haha. Probably the ocean, lol.

Intro: Hi, Jen! How was your weekend? Do anything fun now that Halloween is over? I went out recently and all I see are Christmas décor. I know the next big holiday is Christmas but, jeez, I think it’s a little early.
A: Nah, not really. Just some brutal windstorms once in a while lol. It gonna get chilly and also probably expecting snow soon lol. As for the stores, yeah, they always get festive with getting out the Christmas stuff (usually during or after Halloween has passed which is typically when the clock strikes on the 1st of November at this point ROFL)
Q1: Ooo I love fireworks. There was a big fireworks show a few months ago. My friend invited me but I did have exams around that time and it was downtown. It gets so crowded and everyone takes transit home so that gets backed up.
A: Oh, that sucks. Hopefully you can go next time if it ever happens again!
Q2: Hope you’re feeling better now!
A: Honestly, I'm not doing bad :)
Q3: I highly recommend it. I personally thought the book was better, but the movie wasn’t bad by any means. The party scenes were really flashy and fun.
A: Thanks for the recommendation :) I will have to look into it eventually!
Q4: If their healthcare is so expensive, I’m surprised people go for regular checkups even if nothing is wrong.
A: Lol, maybe incase if the individual gets diagnosed with a medical condition or otherwise. They would also learn some ways on how to take care of themselves with said condition. (Note: I do not work in healthcare, so this may not be 100% accurate. All depends where you are and how they handle healthcare. Thanks!)
Q5: No, it’s ok! I think her fanbase can be crazy at times. I’m basically the same where I have some songs saved on Spotify, but I don’t usually listen to them. I’m not up to date with celebrity news. I would assume that mega celebrities tend to have the worst fanbase tho.
A: Lol, true
Q6: A giraffe would be cool as a ride. Makes me wonder how fast they go. I think riding a tiger would be much cooler and a lot faster. Maybe warmer too.
A: ROFL
Q7: I LOVE the Game of Life. Omg. I don’t know anyone else that likes it cause all my friends hate it. Monopoly is fun too, but I like the one where they use a credit card instead of cash.
A: Lol
Q8: All the songs by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepson are fantastic. I remember being obsessed with Fireflies when I was younger. Did you know Jepson’s father was a public school principal? My friend claimed he went to the same school that he taught at.
A: Lol, fun! I actually didn't know that ROFL
Q9: (人•ᴗ•)｡*ﾟ+✧･ﾟ✧<- this is adorable
A: Thank you! Lol
Q10: Sadly, I don’t think I’m going to Korea anymore cause of my friend’s new job, so I’ve been browsing the internet a lot looking for opportunities. Recently, I’ve been interested in random online certifications you can do online. Did you know the Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons has an online maritime radio certification? You can also get a boating license online for $50 or a drone pilot license for $10. I think I might collect a bunch of lifelong certifications for no reason.
A: Oh, that's too bad. Hopefully someday you will!
Last but not least, Q11: Bonus Questions: Do you think it’s better go for a job that you don’t as much with higher pay and more opportunities or a lower paying job in a field you’re really interested in? What three items would you bring with you on a deserted island? (and it can’t be a boat)
A: Probably a job I don't like with higher pay ROFL (typical answer lol) and as for the second question: 1) food, 2) water 3) something to do (it could be anything at this point, I ain't complaining lol)

Intro: Thank you for your patience! I had a pretty eventful last few days. Today, I was out for the majority of the time playing badminton, playing the Switch with my friends, grabbing dinner, going shopping, then grabbing dessert. I just got home but I’m exhausted. I’ve also been applying to more businesses. Technically, I’m doing accounting, but I really want to find a role related to English. Fingers crossed!
Happy Halloween to you too! Did you do anything fun? I saw on my Instagram that most people were partying. I was so jealous since I was stuck at home taking my business finance course.
As for the car requirement… well I think it’s just the location I’m in. A lot of people don’t drive so some jobs require a driver's license because they don’t want an employee who relies on public transportation. I do get it but it makes finding positions a lil difficult.
A: Eh, it's okay. I don't mind it, hope you had a good time lol. Yeesh, I'm sorry.
Q1: Happy Halloween to you too! Did you do anything fun? I saw on my Instagram that most people were partying. I was so jealous since I was stuck at home taking my business finance course.
A: Meh, I treated it as a normal day. But I did go out with my parents to watch fireworks though!
Q2: Oh no : ( Did you get meds for that? My sister has had a cough for a month now. I think she should see a doctor, but uhh that responsibility falls on my mom haha
A: Nah.
Q3:  What did you think of it? The tickets are pricey but I like it.
A: It was fun lol.
Q4: Word of the day!: Erinaceous – like or relating to the hedgehog. Crazy how there’s a whole word dedicated to things similar to one specific creature.
A: LOL
Q5: I don’t have a machine : (. I bought a small hand kit from H&M a couple years back and I’ve been using that. Though I’m not good at it, having the sewing set has been incredibly helpful.
A: Oh, well that's something I guess
Q6: See, I like the IDEA of a fancy banquet with the glitter and the glam; HOWEVER, the thought of attending them fills me with dread. It always seems better from afar. I think that’s a lesson from The Great Gatsby if you’ve seen the movie or read the book.
A: ROFL, fair enough. I don't think I've seen the movie or the book
Q7: Oh, I mean in the States. In all the media I’ve seen, they go for regular check ups but I found it interesting that Canada doesn’t do that.
A: Naw, I don't live in the States and I don't think I have but I guess their healthcare is more on the ""expensive"" line than Canada is. The problem is mostly the government and their lack of esteem. (I'm gonna try not to get too political here rofl but otherwise, yeah.)
Q8: Song of the day: Gorgeous by Taylor Swift.
Speaking of Taylor Swift, are you a fan? I heard she’s coming to Vancouver for her tour. I do listen to her music but I don’t keep up with her personal life. My friend wants to go to the concert so we’re going to try to snag some tickets when they release next week. Imagine my surprise when she told me the tickets are on sale soon but the concert itself isn’t until the END of next year. Gosh.
A: Meh, not anymore. I listened to some of her songs in middle school, but outgrew that phase in highschool (Long story short, I listen to her songs once in a while, but I'm not a hardcore fan and I can't necessarily stand her fanbase either. I'm not really sorry for that part though.)
Q9: Nu pratar jag på svenska! Kommer du att ta reda på vilket språk jag talar på? Ce n'est pas grave si vous ne savez pas puisqu'il y a toujours du français 😊
A: ROFL, okay
Q10: Bonus questions – What’s the best board game? If you were gifted a giraffe, what would you do with it if you couldn’t sell or give it away.
A: I'd probably use it as free transportation ROFL. And the best board game would either go to Game of Life or Monopoly to be honest.

Intro: Hi, Jen! I’m baaaack. Thanks for your patience : )) I got all my grades back. Honestly, I think I did as expected on one, better than expected on another, and worse than expected on the last one. So, to average out, I did ok. I’m 100% alright with that as ok is better than bad ahaha.
Now that I’m outta that slump, I’ve been loosely job hunting. It’s been hard because everyone only wants full timers, or you need a class 5 license. I don’t even have a regular license. Right now, I applied for two accounting positions which I think I won’t get cause they did ask for people with experience. I applied anyways cause why not. Then I just applied for a concierge position. The hours are awful (for me). They want 8am to 4pm and I go to bed at 8am sometimes.
My friend recently got hired for an accounting position which is fantastic. I’m super proud of her. But now I feel like I should be trying to gain more experience because I’ve been at my current job for almost two years now. I’m eyeing some receptionist roles, but my friend told me she had gone to a bunch of receptionist interviews and they’re super picky with hiring. 
One thing for sure – I will never go back to retail. No more Christmas songs for me, please.
A: Hey Lisa, happy Halloween (at the time I'm writing this lol). Congratulations on your tests! And Class 5 licenses usually depends on the field of work you want to go into. I 100% don't know much about it, but I wish you luck!
Q1: How’s your throat? Everyone around me has been sick for weeks. I think there’s a cold going around. I’ve definitely heard about lululemon people but usually they’re like lululemon teens rather than the moms. Is her dog super friendly? I remember loving going over to my friend’s house in hs because he had a dog. I wasn’t allowed a pet so I enjoyed the times with his dog. His name was pronounced as “Askim” so whenever people would ask my friend what his dog’s name is – he’d just say “Askim” as in Ask him.
A: Lol, I guess it's fine now. I think I have a chest cold/infection, idk honestly lol. Yes, her dog is usually friendly once you get to know her :D Lol
Q2: Ripley’s aquarium of Canada sounds cool. I love aquariums. Have you been to the Vancouver Aquarium? They have animals and insects along with the aquatic animals. I didn’t realize that wasn’t common until I went to one in Japan and they only had water creatures.
A: Lol, yes I have been to that aquarium twice XD.
Q3: Word of the day!: Hullabaloo – a loud, continued noise or mixture of noises.
A: HAHAHA LOL
Q4: Are you good at sewing? I got a new tank top, but the strap ripped as soon as I tried it on. I sewed it back, but I don’t know if I did it correctly.
A: When it comes to the epitome of sewing, I'd say I'm average at it even though I don't sew much anymore. As for the broken strap, I would try double-stitching with the machine (if you own one), as it usually does work on some occasions.
Q5: Movies set in the past always have the best costumes. Sometimes I wish balls were still a thing so I could wear a fancy gown.
A: Lol. Imagine this if you will, but I don't know if fancy banquets count, but that's probably the closest we'll probably get in today's world haha.
Q6: Glad to hear everything went well in your appointment! One thing I always found interesting about the doctor is that, in Canada, we only go when there’s already an issue but in the States, they have regular checkups? Like do you just go there, have them ask a bunch of questions, then leave? What if you’re doing fine? Do they charge you if nothing is wrong but you went for a checkup anyways?
A: Apologies, I'm not sure what you are trying to imply. Are you talking about what healthcare is like in the States or in Canada? If it's the States, I have never went to the States for a medical appointment. But in Canada, I don't think so. Most of the time, Canada's healthcare is ""free"" I guess. (except meds though.)
Q7: I did not know that the unicorn was Scotland’s official animal loool. That’s super interesting. I didn’t know you could have a mythical creature as your official animal.
A: Well, I guess you learn something new everyday haha

Hi, Jen! I’m baaaack. Thanks for your patience : )) I got all my grades back. Honestly, I think I did as expected on one, better than expected on another, and worse than expected on the last one. So, to average out, I did ok. I’m 100% alright with that as ok is better than bad ahaha. 
Now that I’m outta that slump, I’ve been loosely job hunting. It’s been hard because everyone only wants full timers, or you need a class 5 license. I don’t even have a regular license. Right now, I applied for two accounting positions which I think I won’t get cause they did ask for people with experience. I applied anyways cause why not. Then I just applied for a concierge position. The hours are awful (for me). They want 8am to 4pm and I go to bed at 8am sometimes. 
My friend recently got hired for an accounting position which is fantastic. I’m super proud of her. But now I feel like I should be trying to gain more experience because I’ve been at my current job for almost two years now. I’m eyeing some receptionist roles, but my friend told me she had gone to a bunch of receptionist interviews and they’re super picky with hiring. 
One thing for sure – I will never go back to retail. No more Christmas songs for me, please.

Intro: Hey, Jen!
Thanks for your patience : ) I was able to catch up on work and finish my FIRST exam. I still have two more coming up so thanks in advance again for your continued consideration : D
I think I did fine? I’m a little nervous cause the prof gave us 3 hours to do it. I finished in 1.5 hours but I saw that everyone else was still writing (we were on zoom), so I sat there for 40 min. I was worried that if I left so early the prof might suspect me of cheating or something. So, 40 min passes, and everyone is still writing it. At that point, I was thinking to myself “I think this is enough time to clear me of suspicions” and then I left.
Yesterday, I couldn’t sleep so I was browsing YouTube. I saw a song called the Pi song. I managed to memorize 56 digits of pi. I will never need this skill ever, but I did it.
A: That's okay loll, I was hanging out with my best friend who came back to town from college this weekend (sorry for the small delay XD, I also have a sore throat as I am writing this at the moment haha.) and we just took her dog for a walk and joked about ""lululemon moms"" (if you don't know what they are, I think they're basically moms who have a coffee in one hand and walking their dog with the other, rofl. But idk if there are any in this case, lol) Oh in that case, congratulations (if you passed, idk if you did)
Q1: Thanksgiving lunch sounds delicious. I love cranberry sauce.
A: Lol.
Q2: I did wear a red dress. Now that I’m looking at it, the dress design is so outdated. For my year, like a third of my grade had a similar design. It’s like long, sleeveless dress, with flowers on the bodice going down onto the skirt but not covering all of the skirt, and a cinched waist. Now, I feel like a lot of the prom dresses are silky, sophisticated, and chic.
A: Nice, I think you might be right but I think it changes every year depending how long that trend will tend to stay lol.
Q3: Thanks for the heads up! I was looking up flights to Toronto recently. I didn’t realize they were at a relatively affordable price. For some reason, I thought it would be much higher. I also learned that there’s this train from VIA rail that goes all the way across Canada. I thought it would be a cool experience but wow it’s around 6k-10k. That’s more than my trip to Japan!
A: Rofl, I think it depends on what class you are registering into. (e.g, business class, economy). But yeah, if this is your first time going, I recommend checking out the CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium of Canada and the Toronto Islands :D
Q4: A flying bird would be an ornithopter. Good example : )
A: Thanks XD
Q5: Word of the day!: Jabberwock – gibberish or nonsense.
You might have heard of “The Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll who featured it in his second Alice in Wonderland novel. 
A: Yes, I have! I beileve it might've been seen or mentioned in the Disney version of the movie.
Q6: I don’t mind carrots, but I think they taste better when they’re raw.  
A: Oh! Well, you do you :) No judgement here!
Q7: Yum. Looks like noodles are both our choices of a quick meal. I always make sure to add some eggs in.
A: Rofl!
Q8: Yes, ahah The Spanish Golden Age!
A: Lol! It did take place in Spain.
Q9: I think I said it was a bowl as well because mine had a ton of spaghetti in it. Most of us agreed it was a bowl except for one person who claimed it was a plate.
A: Oh haha, hilarious! It does give that illusion, and I almost thought it was a plate myself rofl
Q10: Winter is coming BUT WHERE IS MY AUTUMN. Every year, the autumn season seems to be non-existent. Summer doesn’t end until the end September and we get some hot days in October. November comes around and, at that point, it’s basically winter. My fav season : ( gone.
A: Fall does still exist, but yeah, the clock seems to be ticking faster than ever now.
Q11: Did you ever have to take home economics? We had to sew in that class. That year, we were making boxer shorts and mine came out absolutely awful. That day, I learned how terrible at sewing I was.
A: I did take sewing up until Grade 12 because I didn't like the teacher very much so I stopped in my senior year. I did take Foods class though and it was really fun!
Q12: Never seen the movie - Little Women. I want to read the book though.
A: It was pretty good to watch, suffice to say. They did a good job with the costumes and the settings. It made it seem like it really did take place in the Victorian Era if I do say so myself.
Q13: I don’t have a favourite flower. If I had to choose, I think tiny cacti are cute.
A: Lol, okay!
Last but not least, Q14: How did your appointment go?
A: Ah, it went well. Just talked about some health issues goin' on recently, nothing new lol.

Intro: Hey Jen!
Happy Belated BELATED Thanksgiving haha. Did you celebrate? I was pretty happy not having to attend class on Monday but my teacher still made us watch videos to make up for the missed class.
A: Lol! We didn't celebrate much, but we had a Thanksgiving lunch :D 
Q1: Red suit with pearls sounds real sophisticated. I wore red to my prom too : )
A: Nice! A red dress I'm assuming? Correct me if I'm wrong XD
Q2: Is Toronto dangerous? Or, at least, dangerous enough to not want to walk alone? When I went to Japan, there were so many alleyways, but they never felt dangerous. Honestly, there were so many alleyways, I was surprised. I was always taught to avoid them, but everyone was fine walking through them there.
A: I don't think so. I can't really say as I haven't been there since 2013, but I might be going again next year? But I heard that crime has increased a bit prior to the past couple years. But yes, I think you should be okay during the day, but if you do plan to roam around at night, it's probably wise to bring a buddy with ya in any case! (bonus if you know any friends or family who live in the area!)
Q2: Word of the day!: Ornithopter – a device that flies by flapping wings.
A: So like a flying robot bird?
Q3: Do you usually put anything in the sauce? I just cook some chicken and add it in. I’m not sure if it’s good with any vegetables or not.
A: It depends. Sometimes if we have guests, we usually make it not-so-spicy. But if it's us and some family-friends, then we go all crazy I think lol. And yes, you can try it with vegetables! Carrots can be a good starter.
Q4: What’s your to-go food for when you don’t feel like cooking but you want to make something quick and easy? For me, I always go with noodle soup. Just throw some vegetables in a pot, add some noodles, and you got a full meal.
A: Ooooh, good question. Usually if I'm chillin' at home, I will make some instant noodles. Kinda like yours but I start off with a kettle of water then once it's boiled, I just put the stock and stuff in, and then I pour the water and let it sit for 10 minutes. But if I'm heading out, then I would just put leftovers in a container, toss it into the microwave, then whammo! Ya got yourself a on-the-go type of thing. (unless I'm going out to eat with family or friends in this case, XD)
Q5: I think I’d like the Victorian Era or whatever the golden age of Spain was called. I like their fancy dresses. Or the golden age of Greece since I heard it was incredibly advanced despite the time period. Like, they even made a working aqueduct. They also had the Library of Alexandria. Philosophy was flourishing and they were making great strides in mathematics.
A: Oooh haha! For Spain, I believe it's called The Spanish Golden Age :) The Victorian Age is most likely what it's used for the UK lol.
Q6: Lool what about the image I added? Is that a plate or a bowl? It’s such a silly question but everyone is so divided about it. Every time my friends and I go out, we (jokingly) argue when we see something in between. Once we went to a fancy Italian place and asked a waitress the question. She got everyone working to come by and give their vote.
A: XD. It looked like a bowl to me if I'm being honest lol. But it looks like one of those saucers (the ones you use for teacups).
Q7: Song of the day: Moonlight by Kali Uchis
A: I've heard this artist before!
Q8: Hmm. I don’t usually play any sports but I don’t mind badminton. I feel like it’s easy enough and not toooo tiring. I love hibernating in the winter. You know that feeling when you get outta bed to go to the bathroom before rushing back into bed, under the covers, and it feels like warm hug? That’s the best part of winter. Winter where I am is barely winter. When it snows (which it usually doesn’t), it’s all slush. Nasty, nasty slush that turns into grey soup after a few hours of people walking in it. Then it freezes overnight and it becomes ice. Oh god and the Christmas music. THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC. Working in retail, you’re going to hear the exact same song 100000x times. I suppose it’s fun struggling to walk on the ice when you’re with a friend ahha. What’s your favourite thing about winter?
A: Lol, well never fear, winter is on the way! And yeah, I only did sports in gym classes lol. But I do try and go out for walks once in a while if it's nice but when winter arrives, I'll probably be stuck at home 24/7 rofl. I KNOW THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING ON REPEAT IS SO ANNOYING, it makes me want to drop the groceries and just go home D:
Q9: Bonus questions : ) What was your favourite and least favourite subject in school? If you had to choose a duotang colour for science, math, literature, French, and history – what colour would be associated with them? For me, history is always green because I think of land. Math is red. Science is blue. I think English would be yellow or black. French would be brown.
A: Good question, my favourite subject would be cooking and guitar and my least would have to be photography and gym. And I don't think I've used duotangs very much back in highschool since we pretty much used binders, sorry!
Movie of the day: Little Women (2019) It's super good :D

Modeling would be cool too. My friend from high school started modeling about a year ago and it looks like she’s loving it. One thing I love is how it she’s exploring different styles and getting to visit a bunch of different areas. One of my coworkers in the past is a fashion content creator too and I always see her going to like fashion shows and fashion week events.

Q: What did you wear to prom? Did you do anything fun after the event? When I graduated, after prom, the school got together with other local schools and rented a rec centre. The were a bunch of stuff you could do (like carnival games or they converted the top floor to a casino with fake money) and prizes to win. I won driving lessons that I never used haha. We stayed until 7am. It was so fun.
A: I wore a red suit with pearls on it :D After the event, I don't think so because it was on the day before Father's Day so I spent it with my family :) And that sounds cool, we did something similar with the ""casino"" games but there was a lot of food!",7:50PM October 10

Intro: Hey, Jen! How was your weekend? Over the weekend, I hung out with my best friends. We went to a popular brunch place. The wait was an hour but it was 100% worth it since there were a lot of stores around for us to pass time. I’ll add a pic of the food. I went about 4 years ago and I’ve been wanting to go back since. I’m happy I got a chance : )
A: Ay, what's good? I guess it was pretty neat looooong weekend. By the way, Happy belated Thanksgiving!
Q1: We were also talking about maybe going to Korea next year. I do want to travel more since I’m still young but I’m honestly still kinda broke since Japan was only half a year ago lol. I’m probably going to have to pick up some extra shifts if I do decide to go. I’m not excited about the long plane ride. I have a friend in Korea so I msged him to be kinda like “Hey, surprise. Cya next year”. I haven’t seen him in almost 2 years. BUT THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE’S COMING BACK TO CANADA maybe around the time I’m going to Korea. There goes my surprise lol
A: Niceeeeee! Sorry about the suprise though XD.
Q2: I’ve never checked it out (since I’ve never gone to Toronto), but I think I’d be worried about looking like a tourist. At my school, we always see a ton of international visitors posing in front of the buildings even if they’re (honestly) kinda ugly.
A: It's pretty cool overall! Definitely check out the CN Tower :D Just do be careful when strutting down the streets alone though, and always carry a map on you! Oh, oof to that.
Q3: Word of the day!: specious – superficially plausible, but actually wrong.
A: Almost sounds like ""spacious""
Q4: If you make butter chicken from scratch, that’s already impressive. I use pre-made butter chicken sauce from a jar.
A: I actually don't think I make it from scratch, I think we make it from out of a bag (since making it from scratch can be VERY difficult to do so and requires a LOT of ingredients and patience!)
Q5: Ooh being a graphic designer sounds cool. My friend actually does graphic design. She told me that her friend in the same program recently got hired by, I think, Unity technologies? She also worked on magazine covers for her professors. Maybe you could pursue graphic design in the future.
A: Not sure, it'll probably change again by next year (as it usually does rofl; when I was in early high school, I wanted to be a model, but I don't know just yet, but life is life!)
Q6: That’s alright! I’ve only made resolutions when they forced us to in elementary school.
A: Rofl, I don't think I've had that happen in elementary school.
Q7: Other than working on my hobbies, I like looking at the sky. I think my fav memory of the sky would be during the winter in the morning. It was super clear and blue with a hint of purple and pink. I recently learned that I like completing those wood DIY kits. Eating good food makes me happy too. Especially food that you’ve been craving for a while. You take the first bite, and all your cravings are satisfied.
A: Cool :D
Q8: Bonus Questions: What’s one of your recent food cravings? Do you have a favourite time period? What’s the defining difference between a bowl and a plate?
A: Idrk, I usually eat whatever's at home (unless we got some occasions goin' on) rofl! Time period, you say? I'd give in to either the Medieval Ages or the Iron Ages. Wait what? Yah wanna know what the difference is between a plate and a bowl are? Uhhh, that be kinda tricky. Bowls would be for like soup, cereal, etc; while plates would be for spaghetti, salads, and stuff.

The were a bunch of stuff you could do (like carnival games or they converted the top floor to a casino with fake money) and prizes to win. I won driving lessons that I never used haha. We stayed until 7am. It was so fun. 
Ooh being a graphic designer sounds cool. My friend actually does graphic design. She told me that her friend in the same program recently got hired by, I think, Unity technologies? She also worked on magazine covers for her professors. Maybe you could pursue graphic design in the future. 
That’s alright! I’ve only made resolutions when they forced us to in elementary school. 
Other than working on my hobbies, I like looking at the sky. I think my fav memory of the sky would be during the winter in the morning. It was super clear and blue with a hint of purple and pink. I recently learned that I like completing those wood DIY kits. Eating good food makes me happy too. Especially food that you’ve been craving for a while. You take the first bite, and all your cravings are satisfied. 
Bonus Questions: What’s one of your recent food cravings? Do you have a favourite time period? What’s the defining difference between a bowl and a plate?

Intro: Hiiiii Jen. No worries! You’re not late at all. You actually reply really quickly ahha.
A: Lol thanks
Q1: Oooooh, that does sound fun. What design did you get for your nails? I don’t go to salons but I love collecting nail polish. My fav brand is Romand.  What did you think of the campus? I’ve been to a few campuses and I’m always amazed at the difference. For example, UBC is basically a huge town on its own. SFU is basically in a mountain. Looking down and seeing how deep the floors get is insane. BCIT looks kinda like a fancy high school. KPU is a little basic and reminds me of a like nice government building.
A: Good question, I don't think I know but I have some photos I think lol. Yeh, it's pretty insane when you think about it that way XD. Wait until you go to UOT lol
Q2: Still feeling a little sleepy, but I’ve had a good few days : ) It was my younger sister’s birthday. I got her two makeup sets from Sephora.
A: Nice, hope she had a good one :D
Q3: My books came today which I was excited about. I had to reorganize my shelves. My newest bookshelf is deep and wide (basically each section is a big cube). The only issue is that if I put books behind the front books, they get blocked. I thought about putting some sideways on the inside and then putting books on top so they peek out from behind the front books. I’m kinda scared it’ll make the section too heavy and break the shelf though. What I ended up doing was leaving the first book of a series in the front and moving the rest behind it. That way, I can at least see what series I own even if I can’t see the entire set.
A: Oh cool
Q4: Word of the day!: Kip - unit of weight equivalent to 1000 pounds
A: Yo, that's cool
Q5: Could be! I didn’t really gain access to technology until high school, but I think the plastic shoes came around a few years ago.
A: Lol
Q6: Have you thought about getting a second-hand Macbook? That might be more affordable so you don’t have to save up for multiple years. One thing I miss about my previous laptop was that it could transform into a tablet. That made it sooo much easier to read my notes cause it felt like I was reading a book.
A: Lol, maybe not now. Maybe [potientially] in the future, but who knows until then? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q7: Yeah, I have heard it! I think I had it on repeat when it first came out but I don’t listen to it anymore. I really like how Western artists are doing music collabs with Korean artists. One I love and have still saved is Bad Decisions by Denny Blanco and BTS. That’ll be my song of the day : )
A: Lol okay, you do you :)
Q8: I suck at cooking too but I’m worse at baking. I loveeee butter chicken. Do you usually make it from scratch?
A: Lol, looks like I'm not the only one! As for the butter chicken, I think so
Q9: The most memorable thing I did is going to Japan. Maybe cause of the length, the fact that I hadn’t traveled much before, and being there with my closest friends. If I had to choose a non-travel related answer (cause all travel tends to be memorable), I think it would be the Christmas party at my friend’s house. It was potluck style. I brought my Instax camera so we were having fun taking silly photos. Additionally, I brought my switch to play games. Everyone had a blast. We played games all night and left at 6 a.m. when the buses started running again. As soon as I got home, I passed out. What about you? This is a good question.
A: I think the most memorable thing would have to be Prom. It was pretty fun <3
Q10: Bonus questions: If you could live a single day working any job you want, what would it be? Do you usually make New Year’s resolution lists?
A: Ooooh, as long if it's not an office job or a job where you don't sit or stand all day long lol. So it'll probably have to come to either a graphic designer or music producer I think! For New Years' resolutions, I don't necessarily like doing them in general because I know I won't do them all in one year depending what life decides to throw at me, so I can't really say much about that, sorry!

Intro: Hey Jen! Hope you had a good weekend.
A: Hey, sorry for the late reply, I've been in and out of town for the past two days (2nd and 3rd). I went to see my friend in college and we had a lot of fun! She did my hair, nails and makeup and we walked around the campus and she gave me a tour! So it was fun times all around :D
Q1: Here are my weekend updates. Not an exciting weekend for me, unfortunately. I spent most of it doing schoolwork. I completed everything in time and got my group project submitted. Though, now I’m feeling burnt out. I was really nervous about my tax quiz since I wasn’t confident with my answers. Luckily, I got my grades back today, and I got everything right. 
I’ve been really sleepy recently too. Not sure why. Maybe used up too much brain juice? Haha.
A: Oh snap. Sorry to hear the weekend was dreadful. Congrats on your quiz though :)
Q2: Which Mario games do you like? Rn, I play Mario games like Mario kart with my friends, but my fav is Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. It’s such an old game, you might not know if it. It was released in 2003. Compared to the other games, it had a lot of good locations to explore and good narratives. It was also really funny. Lastly, I like how there was an emphasis on being both Mario and Luigi.
A: I think the only one I've played was Unfair Mario, it's an online game lol.
Q3: Word of the day!: potvaliancy – a surge of bravery accompanied by drunkenness
A: Oh, interesting word and meaning :o
Q4: Yea I remember seeing mixed reactions from the Batman casting. I heard that the overall census after the movie was that it wasn’t a bad casting. Though, I wouldn’t know since I haven’t watched it yet lol.
A: Yeah I guess. Idk
Q5: Bottoms in general. High waisted jeans, high waisted trousers, etc. Low waisted skirts look cool, but I could never pull them off. I’m not surprised that you haven’t heard of plastic shoes. I think the only people I’ve seen wear them are influencers lol.
A: Oh ok lol. And yeah probably because I [mostly] spent my childhood without technology until I was in middle school so that's maybe why.
Q6: Is it like beat saber? I’ve seen that game a lot. I remember playing piano tiles when I was in high school. That was a fun music game. Same with Deemo.
A: Yep! You're right :D
Q7: Ooo I like Asus products too. Aw man : ( That really sucks. MacBooks are popular too. My friend told me to get one for school but I ended up choosing the Microsoft laptop because it was on sale. Plus, I’m in accounting and Excel doesn’t work well on Apple products.
A: That's okay lol. And yep, MacBooks are popular, and yes expensive too, normally depends on the model and price. If it's the [slightly] older MacBooks, then they'll probably be a little cheaper (I could possibly be wrong)
Q8: Were there mermaids in Percy Jackson? I read that so many years ago, I don’t remember anything.
A: Kinda hard to say right now lol so I guess probably not?
Q9: ""Left and Right"" by Charlie Puth (feat. Jungkook) I love this song : )
A: Lol! Have you heard it before?
Q10: Is Pixar the same as Disney? I like Tangled, The Incredibles, Wall-E, and Ratatouille. Out of the four, I think Wall-E has the #1 space in my heart – not sure why since I don’t really like sci-fi.
A: I think so since Disney pretty much owns it. And cool lol
Q11: Bonus Questions: What’s a dish you love cooking? What’s your favourite time of the day and why?
A: I [kinda] still suck at cooking, but I do have a few favourite dishes: Butter chicken, chilli chicken, salmon with eggplant and mushroom sautéd (idk what it's called lol). And my favourite time of the day is the afternoon because I guess it's pretty chill :)

Intro: Hey Jen! Hope you had a good week so far.
A: Yes, I guess so!
Q1: Here are some updates from me! I think I went a little crazy and went overboard buying new books lol. I ended up getting 16 but I got them from a site that sells them at a discount.
A: Wow :0
Q2: I was browsing switch games for a bit. I got Overcooked to play with my friends in the future. I’m going to wait for a sale but I really want this semi-new game called “Warioware”. I’m up to 113 hours in Baldur’s Gate 3 now. I’m in the last act (the game is split into three), but it feels like I’m nowhere close to the end. 113 hours is already insane. I kinda want to switch over to Stardew but I'm really stubborn and I hate leaving things unfinished. 
A: Nice. I like games like Mario lol
Q4: Lastly, I got an email from my tax professor congratulating me on my good work thus far despite the difficult material 😊That really made me feel better about school.
A: That's good
Q5: Oh, I meant my spiel about how hard my classes are ahah. I know that some people who aren’t in college or uni yet get a little intimidated.
A: Lol
Q6: Whatever you end up choosing, I think you’ll make a good choice. School is whatever you make of it anyway.
A: Ye, I guess so XD
Q7: Word of the day!: mizzle - to rain in small drops
A: Nice one
Q8: I’m not able to whistle half of the time. Sometimes I can. The whistle comes out crisp if you know what I mean. The other half of the time, I somehow can’t make any noise.
A: Oof, I guess sometimes not many people can do the skills they were able to do anymore.
Q9: Is that bad? I wanted to see the new Batman because he played Edward. I found it so funny that he played as a vampire and now he’s a “bat man”.
A: Ahh, no. I think it's just my opinion. Not so sure about everyone else, but it's just mixed feeling from audiences (if you know what I mean.)
Q10: Song of the day: Dead! By My Chemical Romance. (Thanks for the updated song recommendation. I didn’t realize JVKE recently came out with another banger!)
A: Ye!
Q11: You must be happy with the 90s and 2000s fashion making a comeback. I really like the high waisted bottoms trend. I loveeee chunky shoes too. As for least fav, I saw a lot of fringe jackets at Zara. They’re not my favourite. Same with see-through, plastic shoes.
A: I guess so, yeah. Wdym? Are you talking about jeans or just random? I didn't know plastic shoes existed lol
Q12: I’ve often seen subway surfers, but I’ve never heard of beat blade.
A: Lol, Beat Blade is a game where you basically [slash] music tiles (and trying not to lose for the most part) with music playing in the background (and you can choose what song you want, but most of the songs are probably locked and will have to unlock to play more songs. And also you can choose your own avatar!) (Disclaimer: I am not trying to promote the game at all, just explaining the details!)
Q13: That’s cool! I’ve never seen a laptop with emoticons built in. Granted, I don’t have much experience with laptops lol What laptop do you have? I got the Microsoft Laptop 4 almost a year ago to replace my original Surface go. I only use it for when I go to campus. As you can tell, I really like Microsoft products.
A: I believe mine is the ASUS Chromebook CX1. I used to have a MacBook but I accidentally spilt my iced coffee on it :( But there's not much I can do about it unless I save up to buy another one (which could take a year or two, depending)
Q14: I like fairies more than mermaids but only if the fairies are like the folklore fairies – similar to the fairies in Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night's Dream”. One author I really like in the genre is Holly Black. She writes a lot of fairy stories where the characters are enchanting yet dangerous, compelling, and dramatic. Mermaids are cool too. I can’t help but think about the other creatures that would exist in the deep sea though. Have you seen the pictures? They’re kinda scary looking.
A: Nice. The closest thing I've seen to mermaid lore is ""The Little Mermaid"" (I guess you might've heard about it already) Well now (I guess) I read a bit of the Percy Jackson series lol
Q11: Bonus questions - Would you say you’re more of an organized person or a messy person? What’s your Myer Briggs type (if you’ve done it)?
Last but not least, Q12: Whoops. Forgot to answer what my favourite holiday is. Even though I haven't celebrated it in years, it has to be Halloween. I love seeing people getting all creative and who doesn't like free candy? What about you?
A: I dunno.. probably either Halloween because we get a looooot of junk, or Christmas :)

Intro: Hey Jen!
Sorry I’m a little late. I was going to reply yesterday but my day ended up not going how I thought it would lol.
Basically, all my assignments are due Saturday or Sunday night. My previous assignments thus far have been smooth sailing. This time, my tax assignment ended up taking me 3 hours to finish. Then my Mortgage and Interest quiz (somehow a quiz) ended up taking me almost 4 hours. I was so confused. Then my old penpal from Sweden msged me and we talked for a few hours to catch up. At this point, it was like 11 am. I passed out so hard, I ended up missing an early dinner with a friend.
I felt so bad. I called him in a hurry to apologize but I had to quickly go back on my computer to finish my mortgage and interest quiz again cause I got a third of them wrong. Fixing my formulas ended up taking me 2 hours. Now I’m taking a break but I have one more assignment due in a few hours and a group project to work on : (
Right after I finished, I msged my friend again and we made plans to meet next week. As an apology, I offered to pay for dinner for the three of us. It was supposed to be our first meeting in-person and he brought his gf. Really didn’t make a good impression there.
I was honestly so shocked because I’ve never slept through a meetup before.
A: It's okay.
Q1: I really hope my previous paragraphs didn’t deter you from thinking about heading to college lol. I swear, it’s usually not that bad but I’m just dispositioned to be bad at mortgage calculations, I suppose. I find tax a lot easier but I think it’s usually the way around.
A: Hold on, what?
Q2: When I was in English Literature and Language, I loved the majority of my classes. I’ve always loved writing. Accounting, on the other hand, doesn’t come naturally to me.
A: Nice, good for you for choosing what fits better for you. :)
Q3: Do you have an idea of what you might want to pursue? And which school?
A: I guess so, but I'll have to use the year off wisely.
Q4: Word of the day!: clishmaclaver – gossip.
A: Lol.
Q5: That’s cool! Half the time, I can’t even do regular whistling haha
A: Like not anymore or just don't really do it?
Q6: I think I’d choose to stop time too. If I could do that, I’d have so many more hours in a day. I’d be reading for hours every day. What would you be doing when you stop time?
A: Lol. As for me, I don't really know XD.
Q7: AirPods definitely count. I have a friend who never leaves his house without one in his ear. For me, lip balm (same as you). A few months ago, my skin got really irritated. It started peeling and stuff. Before that, I’ve never had any issues with my skin. Thankfully, my skin is fine now, but the skin on my lips continue to dry out and peel really easily. Hopefully, it’s not TMI. Other than that, I always have some emergency cash and mints on me. I also carry a little baggy of emergency medicine.
A: Lol, I don't blame him! Nah, not a lot of info. (only on somedays when my brain gets stuck in airplane mode)
Q8: I like Spiderman more. I’ve never watched anything with Iron man. Now: Spiderman or Batman?
A: I would have to say Spiderman too. I like Batman sometimes, but the new Batman movie sort of ruined it for me :/ (because it's the same actor from Twilight that kinda threw me off my seat, not literally lol)
Q9: Song of the day: Late Night Talking by Harry Styles.
A: 👍🏽
Q10: Hope you have an excellent Monday!
A: Same to you!
Q11: Bonus question - What’s your favorite and least favorite trend?
A: My favourite trend? Good question. Most of them would most likely be like 1990s to 2000s fashion lol. And as for least.. I don't know unfortunately. I usually try to stay away from bad trends whenever possible.
Q12: Second bonus question – What’s your favorite app?
A: Subway Surfers or Beat Blade (✿^‿^)
Last but not least: PS. The bear was super cute.
A: Thanks! It's ""built"" (don't know how to put it into detail) into my laptop (so there's the typical emojis and then the emoticons)

I think I’d choose to stop time too. If I could do that, I’d have so many more hours in a day. I’d be reading for hours every day. What would you be doing when you stop time?
AirPods definitely count. I have a friend who never leaves his house without one in his ear. For me, lip balm (same as you). A few months ago, my skin got really irritated. It started peeling and stuff. Before that, I’ve never had any issues with my skin. Thankfully, my skin is fine now, but the skin on my lips continue to dry out and peel really easily. Hopefully, it’s not TMI. Other than that, I always have some emergency cash and mints on me. I also carry a little baggy of emergency medicine. 
I like Spiderman more. I’ve never watched anything with Iron man. Now: Spiderman or Batman?

Intro: Hey Jen!
Pretty nice if you get a year off : ) It’s like some prolonged vacation.
Update on that actually; I don't know if I will or if I'm going off to college, it's just until I move next year.
Q1: Word of the day!: quincunx – an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners of a square or rectangle and the fifth at its center, used for the five on dice or playing cards
A: Makes sense!
Q2: Haha thank you! I don’t usually watch a lot of shows and I don’t usually talk to my friends about them; however, I’m always up-to-date on new shows if they’re related to like book adaptations. These days, most of the popular shows are. So I always end up surprising other people cause they didn’t expect me to know what they’re talking about lol. Wouldn’t call myself an expert tho. I know the most shallow amount of a bunch of random things.
A: 👍🏽
Q3: Song of the day: All my friends are turning blue - Loren
A: 👌🏽
Q4: I don’t think I have a cool talent. I used to be able to roll my eyes back to only show the whites? I’d do that to freak other people out but that’s not very cool – or good for your eyes. Do you have any cool talents?
A: I guess I can [somewhat] finger whistle if that counts in this case XD
Q5: Would you rather have the power to turn invisible, the ability to fly, or the ability to stop time?
A: Oh man, that's a tough one. I'd say stop time, I think. What about you?
Q6: What’s something you can’t leave the house without? (Not including your phone since that’s everyone’s answer)
A: Lol, good question. Probably my AirPods (don't know if that counts), lip balm, my fanny pack and some snacks (in case I get hungry and need a energy booster lol) What about you?

Intro: Hey Jen!
Is it also back-to-school season for you? If so, how are you holding up so far? My younger sister is trying to swap some of her courses around ahha.
A:  Not as of right now, don't know what's gonna happen yet. I may or may not get the year off until I move next year. It's pretty inevitable.
Q1: Zendaya’s outfits are really cool! I remember when she was on Shake it up. Did you ever watch that show? I recall seeing a few of her outfits on social media. My favs has to be the green dress she wore to the 71st Emmy Awards, the suit she wore for Vanity Fair, and the spiderweb dress for the No way Home premiere. She can pull off so many different styles.
A: I've seen snippets of ""Shake It Up"" but my sisters have watched when we used to have Disney+. I know right? She can ✨ get ittttt ✨
Q2: I think I had sake KitKat once and they tasted really odd lol.
A: Huh. Interesting.
Q3: Yep!! Everything is great. I find those hours work well for me since I’m a natural night owl. It basically allows me to enjoy the night time while still making sure I have an opportunity to get things done during the day. The only issue now is that I accidentally took a nap a few days ago. Naps mess me up. I can never fall asleep after them so now my schedule is kinda messed up again.
A: Nice 👍🏽 Sorry about your sleep schedule. Hopefully it'll be back in place again.
Q4: Word of the day!: Metanoia – the journey of changing your mind, heart, self, and way of life.
A: Cool!
Q5: Do you guys often talk through social media? I’m absolutely horrible at keeping in touch with people, since I’m not typically a huge fan of long conversations over text. I have quite a few friends that moved to another city. Or I guess I do this with friends in the same city as well ahah but basically, we rarely msg each other but once we meet in person, it’s like we’ve been seeing each other every day.
A: Ehhh, not as much. I usually try and give them some space whenever possible.
Q6: Oh no. I’m not offended at all. Don’t worry. That was just my two cents on celebrity culture. Sorry about that. Hope I didn’t stress you out.
A: Nah, no problem.
Q7: Uhhh I like the cartoons I’ve watched in the past. Stuff like Phineas and Ferb. Otherwise, I don’t watch much shows. Are there any you would recommend? I tend to gravitate towards angsty or comedy shows. 
A: Uhhh, good question. I don't think there's anything good on Netflix nowadays, but I've found some K-Dramas (I haven'r watched yet) and that's pretty much it I think lol. (the one I watched and mentioned before was ""A Love So Beautiful or Once Upon A Small Town, have not watched it, I think you might be the expert on K-Dramas lol)
Q8: Thanks for sharing your song of the day. I’d never say no to more Barbie songs lol
A: Okay XD
Q9: Song of the day: Free Animal by Foreign Air.
Q10: I got around to building the little bakery that my friend got me for my birthday : ). I’ll add a photo because I’m really proud of it.
A: Looks nice! :D Well done, I'll give it to ya there 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Bonus question: Thank you!! I actually saw a post of someone who had like mint tip dyed hair. That looked really cool. I’ll add a photo. What do you think? Red or this mint colour?
A: I don't see the red one, so I'll have to say the mint :)

Q1: Oh gosh, I did in the past. I thought it was mostly fine. They didn’t really interact, but everyone was chill. A little awkward (as you mentioned). I wanted to do a bigger birthday party and I invited some friends outside of my main group and they declined the invite cause they said it would be too awkward. I completely get it though. Thanks for the Birthday wishes : )
A: Oh lol. Ay, no prob.
Q2: Anything that stood out from Fashion Week? I don’t usually watch Fashion related stuff but I do sometimes watch youtubers that I like talking about fashion. One example is ModernGurlz on youtube. She does fashion analysis from movies and events and stuff like that. What do you usually watch on youtube?
A: Not much, I don't think. I sometimes pay attention, then otherwise I'm on a different tab internet surfing lol. But weeeeeird designs, y'know? But Zendaya's outfits are pretty cool imo. :-)
Q3: Do you like KitKats? I think out of all the chocolate types, they’re one of my favorites. Only the classic one tho.
A: Yeah, I don't like the Matcha ones tho lol.
Q4: Why do you guys take different routes?
A: I think that's usually the route we take for vacations, etc. We might switch the route up per se but not so sure right now as we are not traveling for a while XD.
Q5: Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being in airplane mode is pretty nice too. I should be in school mode by now but I’m still in relaxation mode haha. One thing I really like about my problem is that the classes are pretty late (most of them are 6:30-9:30pm). I’m trying to follow a schedule where I go to bed around 4-5am, wake up at around 11am, and I either do schoolwork or I work a bit until class.
A: Yikes.. Yikes. Hope everything's good.
Q6: Word of the day!: paterfamilias – the male head of a family or household.
A: Nice
Q6: Good to hear nothing is wrong! Friend problems can be common, so I just wanted to double check.
A: Haha, nice of you to check in otherwise. We don't hang out as much due to college and pretty much life itself (my friend is attending college out of town until next summer I think lol) but we still keep in touch though :)
Q7: Lol when I saw “Here I am”, the song from Camp Rock immediately popped into mind.
A: Nice XD.
Q8: I don’t think I have a favorite celebrity? I guess there are people that I am more biased towards such as Emma Watson due to her humanitarian work, or uhh not sure. At the moment, no one else popped into mind. I kinda live by the philosophy that you shouldn’t favour celebrities or, if you do, you should be able to separate their work and them as a person. As much as we’re exposed to a particular celebrity, they have no idea who we are, and we don’t know them on a personal level.
A: Uhhh okay, good to know I guess. I was gonna say my favorite celebrity was Zendaya but sure, I can respect your choice lol. It was just a fun and harmless question. I hope I didn't offend you in anyway. If I did, I'm sorry. You do you :)
Q9: No favorite sports since I’m very unathletic. If I had to choose one, I’d choose badminton since it’s easy to play. I don’t watch sports either.
A: Alright, that's cool. I respect that.
Q10: I’d dye my hair pink since I haven’t done that yet. I’ve done purple already and I really liked it. Once I go through a few other new colours, I might go back to purple.
A: That's pretty cool, I gotta admit XD
Q11: I think “weird” food is subjective. I’ve eaten like organ meat like chicken hearts, or pig blood, crab innards, or like raw beef which is called Yukhoe in Korean. But, you know, it does sound kinda weird but it’s normal in some cultures. I’m pretty adventurous. As long as it doesn’t contain the eyes or face or whatever (since eyes freak me out), I’m willing to try it. I guess if I had to single one out, it would be Shirako. I had that when I went to Japan. I’d explain what it is but I think my message wouldn’t send loool.
A: Uhhh nice?

Intro: Hi Jen! Thanks for your patience. How were you this past week? Do anything fun?
As for me, I spent most of my Thursday and Friday doing my schoolwork in advance and working. On Saturday, I had a nice dinner with a group of my friends for my birthday. We went to a big mall since they recently opened a photostrip place with a bunch of funny hats. I wore a banana hat ahaha. Then we had dinner at a Korean place and got thickkkk icecream (that reminded me of Turkish icecream) for dessert.
My friends got me a vinyl player, a DIY mini bakery house thing, and a face cleanser. I was so surprised by the vinyl lol since I only mentioned it a few days before Saturday and my best friend got one for me.
On Sunday, I went to see a movie called No More Bets with my mom then had another birthday dinner with another friend. He got me some chocolates. I ALSO have another birthday dinner with ANOTHER friend but I haven’t scheduled that yet. Honestly, I’ve been pretty busy. I find it kinda hard to manage my time because I have like a main friend group but a bunch of friends that aren’t in a group and don’t know each other. So I end up going out a lot to make sure I interact with everyone on a regular basis. I don’t know if I explained that well but do you get what I mean?
Plus I really love staying at home so I get tired so easily.
A: Lol, you should introduce them to each other someday (your choice lol), I did when I was w/ my friend group at Tim Hortons one time. It was awkward but it was fun in the end and that's what matters :) Oh and happy belated birthday 🥳 I've just been watching fashion content (eg: Fashion Week)
Q1: Your sister has good taste. I’ve been giving them out to my friends and trying to convert them all into Werther lovers. Speaking of cookies, I tried Gluten Free chocolate chip cookies a few days ago. They were very dry and a little hard; however, I loved them. My sister hated how dry they were but I think it’s delicious.
A: They're not too bad I guess. I like chocolate in either bars or those mini-bags. 
Q2: Have you been to Whistler at all? If not, do you want to? I thought about going with a group of friends last summer but wow the prices there are crazy. Pretty sure one night there for one hotel room was about $500.
A: Good question! I don't think I have lol. It seems fun so yeah! If I ever come to the Lower Mainland again, most likely! (my family and I usually take a different route to get to Vancouver haha)
Q3: Oh no. How are you feeling now? I’m sorry. This is probably really delayed but I hope you’re doing better. Was it just one of those days?
A: Not to worry, I'm okay now lol. Yeah it was. And also my head's still in airplane mode since I came home 2 weeks ago XD.
Q4: I walked around Ikea, sat on some chairs, had a small photoshoot for my friend’s new brand, and ate lunch there. If you ever get the chance, I recommend checking it out. I basically go there at least once every two months with my best friend. I know it’s a furniture store, but their Swedish meatballs are so good and it’s fun just walking around, checking out furniture, and being silly with another person. Maybe it’s the vibe.
A: That sounded like fun! Neato :D
Q5: Word of the day!: Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia – the FEAR of LONG words (Ironic, I know)

Intro: Happy Wednesday and Happy September!
A: Thanks, you too!
Q1: Hotpot as innnnn like a giant pot of boiling soup and you throw ingredients in to cook it. It’s kinda like a communal event cause everyone shares the pot and we scoop food out of the pot for each other. If I’m being honest, I don’t really like the food but I love the atmosphere. Everyone is focused on one pot, we’re sitting in a circle and engaging with each other, and (since we’re usually in a private room) we’re not worried about disturbing the other guests.
A: Oh?
Q2: Update on the keyboard. It’s pretty nice so far and the keys feel smooth. However, they do feel a little cheap (which makes sense cause I got a budget keyboard). I guess I’m too used to my old one haha
A: 👍🏽
Q3: I never had a “prestige” barbie doll but I do remember one of my old classmates who was obsessed with Barbie. She had a bunch behind glass displays. It all looked very luxurious.
A: Oh wow, I've seen doll collector YouTubers over the years, but that is pretty top-notch!
Q4: Do you prefer the soft cookies or do you like it when it’s crisp and crumbly? I don’t like the original chocolate chip cookies anymore but I love celebration biscuits. Recently, I’ve been craving Werther’s hard candy which took me by surprise because I feel like nobody likes it. My friends call it “old man candy” hahaha
A: AYOOOOO I like those too, I have 'em once in a while lol. And it depends where. If it's Tim Hortons, I guess it would have to be crisp and crumbly. But I don't mind either XD. And I dunno, I've tried those candies a couple times and it wasn't too bad. My younger sister likes them too rofl.
Q5: Now that you’re back home, how’s the air quality? Is it better than before? It’s cooled down a lot which I’m overjoyed about since it feels like the start of autumn. Last year, the summer basically lasted until October and then it immediately become winter. Autumn is (debatably) the BEST season.
A: Good as always lol. Oooooooh, sounds like Mother Nature's not having it haha.
Q6: Have you been to the whistler gondola? I assume it would be similar.
A: Nope! I haven't been lol.
Q7: A meter? Isn’t that basically beside the motorhome? Did it freak you out being that close?
A: Sorry I meant more than a meter lol. And not really, everybody was basically running to the window and watching it walk off.
Q8: Ooooo a fancy mall. Did you buy anything good?
A: Yes I did!
Q9: I was going to reply yesterday, but my day ended being a little annoying, so I waited until today. I was meeting a friend to eat at Ikea and to check out the brown bear cause I was also thinking of getting one. My friend recently got her license, and this was supposed to be her first time driving me. She drove to the mall completely fine, met up with me, we went to her car, and there was an issue with the handbrake. It refused to budge. We couldn’t figure it out, so we had to bus to Ikea.
A: Nah, I get it. I wasn't in a good mood yesterday (the 5th by the time you read this lol) and I didn't want to take it out on anybody. I luckily reached out a bit to Juliet (the one in charge of the whole platform.) Did you just walk around IKEA? I've heard of IKEA, but never went in one rofl.
Q10: We arrive and the brown bear was SOLD OUT. Legit, there were 50 last week. We hung out until 6. I had to go home for my first class of the semester. My friend left to meet with her aunt who was going to either tow or fix the car. I get home and realized that my professor actually changed the class time to later. THEN my friend msgs me to tell me that the car was completely fine when her aunt arrived. What is this luck – I swear.

Intro: Hi Jen! Looks like you did eventually get my messages ahah. And the failed-to-send messages got removed soo maybe they finally took a look after I accidentally spammed them.
A: Hey Lisa, okay lol. Good you got that out of the way XD
Q1: Yeah! For my birthday, I wanted to go to hotpot at this popular location called Haidilao. In the previous years, I’d have a big group so we could have a private room. This time, most of my friends will be in Japan : ( so we don’t have enough for the room. Got me scrambling to find a replacement since whenever we go out and eat, we try to find a new restaurant and avoid repeats.
A: Hotpot? As in ""hotspot""? Awh man, that sucks :( Sorry.
Q2: That’s smart. I do try to split my paycheck in half with half going into my spending money and half going into my savings. However, I also use my spending money for groceries and bills and such ahah. Maybe because the other half has the title of “saving”, I really don’t want to touch it. I do occasionally dip into it if my bills are too high for that month.
A: Lol, I mean most people use either just simple methods or difficult ones that are hard to follow (and just for the ""fun of it"").
Q3: Nice! Is it one of those keyboards that lights up, or is it one of those retro colorful aesthetic ones? 
I was eyeing those aesthetic retro ones for a while. It was tempting but I went with the light up ones cause I think they’re better for gaming. The one I got was also on sale. Since the retro ones have circular keycaps, I think there would be a higher chance of me not hitting the keys correctly? (based on a completely unscientific belief lol I could be 100% wrong).
A: True. I'm guessing. I don't think scientists have researched that yet (what you heard might be misinformation on social media most likely.)
Q4: I used to have a bunch of Bratz and Polly pocket dolls. I don’t know if you ever had them but Polly pocket dolls have like stretchy plastic clothes which I found much more entertaining than regular ol' fabric. I recently looked up Tamagotchi’s cause I had a bunch when I was younger. They are so expensive now! Do I still want one? Yes : (
A: I think so? I don't remember now, but I probably did at some point lol. I guess, but if it were like prestige Barbies or Disney dolls, then I think the fabric is nice, it's funny that it tries to look like the replica dress seen in movies haha. Oh, I think my friend had a Tamagotchi for Christmas one year, it looked cute! Yeah, I'm guessing now that we're more further into later years, it seems that trends are either starting to go up, come down or making comebacks.
Q5: Whoops. I meant the shipping price is insane. A while back, I went crazy for zines which are fanmade collections of art and writings for popular media. Mine was for the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint fandom. Most of the time, the shipping was pricier than the book itself. Usually, I’d pay like $30 for the book and $40 in shipping. I was also looking into buying official merch from China from someone who can order them for you. Not only does it take nearly 8 months to arrive, the shipping ends up being around $40-50 USD. Basically, shipping to Canada is $$$$.
A: Ohhh, you meant that the shipping was expensive! I get it now XD.
Q6: I’ve never had the Mini Dream donut from Tim Hortons. I do like Tim Horton’s donuts though. I used to prefer timbits over actual donuts. Now that I’m older, I appreciate the classic donut.
A: Lol, nice. You do you :) I started to like cookies more so I don't know XD
Q7: I’m glad you’re safe! The wildfire smoke is really scary. Weirdly enough, it seems like the fires are worse this year but I haven’t seen any smoke here. Last year, the air quality was so bad.
A: Yeah, even the smell of wildfire smoke was seeping through even with the motorhome windows closed :/ Yeah, I think it had since the start of pandemic I think. I dunno.
Q8: I had to Google what a SkyTram was. It looks super exciting.
A: It was! But it was kind of a long wait for the way down though lol. And we saw some chipmunks too :D
Q9: Was the lightning a few days ago? It was raining super hard here with lightning too. No hail though.
A: Nope, it was on August 17, so it was on the same night I arrived in Edmonton. And according to some videos, it was noted as a severe thunderstorm.
Q10: I’ve read about the giant dinosaur – never seen it in person. I’ve also never seen a bison in person but I’d want to. They look pretty cool. I bet kinda stinky too. ALSO, read about how fantastic the Banff hot springs are.
A: Nice. Lol, we saw the bison from inside, but it was a meter close to the motorhome I think. I guess, yeah.
Q11: I’ve never been tubing before. In fact, I had to Google it because I thought tubing was only a thing you did on mountains. I didn’t realize there was water tubing too.
A: Lol, I guess you learned something new.
Q12: I think I read somewhere that the West Edmonton Mall is the biggest mall in Canada. Do you think it lives up to the hype?
A: IT TOTALLY WAS. There was SO much stores from Guess to Gucci to Louis Vuitton. (and they had fast food places and mostly clothing stores like Ardene)
Q13: I like nectarines. I like most fruits but I like how nectarines are firm and taste kinda like a peach. Other than that, I like bananas because of how they’re basically prepackaged for you.
A: Cool!
Bonus question 1: Cool fun fact! I’ll take a look : )
Bonus question 2: Word of the day: Copacetic – in excellent order.
A: Lol

Sounds like you had an amazing time exploring a bunch of different things. How does it feel now that you’re back? I remember sitting around after my trip because it all felt a little surreal. 
I like nectarines. I like most fruits but I like how nectarines are firm and taste kinda like a peach. Other than that, I like bananas because of how they’re basically prepackaged for you.

Intro: Hi Jen! So I didn't get any messages about the original but it was also sitting unapproved for so long. I went ahead and rewrote it. Then that also required admin approval although I'm not sure what for? So I rewrote it for a second time and it's still not being sent. Honestly, I'm pretty confused. Let me just send maybe what I've been up to these past two weeks and you can let me know how your trip is going. Thank you so much for your patience : )
A: I'm not sure either, but it's probably just an upgrade to the platform, so that's maybe why. It's okay I guess, I get it lol.
Q1: I celebrated my friend’s birthday yesterday which was pretty fun. Sadly, the restaurant we went to was pretty mediocre so that was disappointing. But, I also got to try like a cooked banana? Lol. It was just a banana that had been grilled or something.
A: Oof, sounds kinda like a mid and weird resturant at the same time XD.
Q2: Another thing that’s exciting is that Ikea Canada finally has a brown bear plushie in stock. My friend and I saw it when we went to Japan. She loved it and had plans to purchase it when we got back BUT it was only available in Asia at that time.
A: Awh, cute!
Q3: Lastly, my friend has a little stall at this store for small business owners to market and sell their handmade products. It opened last weekend. Super exciting news for her and I'm really proud : ) My dream now is for her store to blow up in popularity so she can hire me ahahha
A: Nice, congratulations to her!
Q3: That’s true. Now that I’m older, whenever I make a hobby purchase, I can’t help but think about what else I might need the money for in the future like school or groceries or any other life purchases (like dentist fees and stuff like that).
A: I'd say split the money and make one pile with whatever you're willing to spend, and then create another pile for the important stuff. It may not be much, but I hope it helps a bit :)
Q4: Lastly, I finally got a new keyboard : ) I’ve been meaning to replace my old one for a while since I’d be using it for 8 years. At that point, the keycaps were popping off when I typed.
A: Nice! Is it one of those keyboards that lights up, or is it one of those retro colorful aesthetic ones?
Q5: I remember seeing the toys for A Fairy Secret, but I don’t think I watched it. I did watch the other fairy one called Fairytopia. I remember liking that one quite a bit along with Barbie of Swan Lake and the one with the Pegasus. I haven’t watched any of the new ones.
A: Lol. I used to have a lot of Barbie dolls (I still have figurines from me and my sisters' birthdays)
Q6: I remember seeing the toys for A Fairy Secret, but I don’t think I watched it. I did watch the other fairy one called Fairytopia. I remember liking that one quite a bit along with Barbie of Swan Lake and the one with the Pegasus. I haven’t watched any of the new ones.
A: Huh, maybe...
Q7: I got my grades back! I admit, it’s not amazing (60%) but that’s a pass ahah. Now I can live worry free until September. It’s uh probably a lesson for the future accounting courses too. I can’t be slacking off as much.
A: Congratulations.
Q8: Is there a reason you’d choose rainforest?
A: Probably because of how much nature has to offer and the views aren't too bad lol.
Q9: Yeah, I might try Etsy or I think I’ll stick with the official merch. They’re only available in China so I have to pay someone else to buy it and mail it over so it usually doubles the price ahah. But at least I know I’ll get something that’s better quality and made by the people who created the game. Plus, every time I check out Etsy, the shipping is INSANE.
A: Lol, you do you. What do you mean the shipping is insane? Do you mean that the shipping is too slow or too fast?
Q10: Hmm. I guess I like the plain ol’ donut with the chocolate dip top. I don’t remember the name. I don’t eat donuts all that often though. What about you?
A: I like donuts sometimes, but it'll have to be the ones in Tim Hortons like the Honey Dip and the Eclair lol. But my favourite cookie so far is the Reeses' mini Dream cookie from Tim Hortons :D
Also it seems like you wanted to know about my trip. But beware that it's gonna be a pretty loooooooong paragraph lol so please read at your own pace thanks!
So on the way when we were driving to Edmonton, there was a lot of wildfire smoke (and it was still there when we were driving back as well) and it had some dramatic effect but at the same time it was pretty scary if you ask me. But anyhow, we got to Jasper first and we walked around town and then went on the SkyTram and it was super cool :D Then when we got to Edmonton, we went to the waterpark and it was pretty cool! Then the next day, we went shopping in the West Edmonton Mall for most of the day (and for most of the trip, it was pretty much shopping, cause who doesn't like shopping? Lol) Then a few days later, after we ate dinner, me, my sisters and a few family friends were walking out of an Indian resturant and we saw what looked like a mini dust-storm just gathering dust. Then a couple seconds after, we saw lightning and we ran across the street as fast as we could back to the motorhome. And by the time we got inside the motorhome, it was hailing so much that we thought the motorhome was gonna fall apart. But luckily, it wasn't too bad the next day lol. Then we saw some bison when we were driving around. Then from there, we drove to Sylvan Lake and went tubing (it was so much fun! have you been tubing before?) Then the next day, we drove to Drumheller and we went inside the ""World's Largest Dinosaur"" which was a tourist attraction, and then we went to the Royal Tyrell Museum! Then we went to the Drumheller DooHoos trails and we walked up them, it was super epic! Then we drove to Calgary and we droved around and did some more shopping haha. We also did an escape room which was a wild experience! We also went to Canmore. On the drive back, we stopped by Banff and we went to the hot springs (which wasn't too bad!) We stayed for the last few days then we drove back home. (We came back by the night of the 28th). Overall, it was a pretty fun experience and would definitely go again if I do get the chance :D
Quote of the day: -""Don't forget about the memories you care about most. Keep them close so you can always look back on the stuff you did.""
QOTD: What's your favourite fruit?
Fun fact of the day: Did you know that Drumheller is named the ""Capital of the Dinosaurs"" and Drumheller had dinosaur fossils a long time ago? If you want more information, you can do some research!",2:50PM August 31

I’m not sure if they actually do. I think people around me just assumed Alberta in general has lower rent since some places in BC are sooo expensive.

Intro: Hi Jen! I am having an excellent summer without any (almost any) school-related worries :) I’ve been reading and playing games my days away. How’s your trip so far?
A: Hey Lisa! It's going good so far! Good to hear you've been having a good summer as well! :D
Q1: I remember that ahah. I was working at TD when that happened, and their system is based on Roger’s service so nothing worked. I got a ton of calls from people complaining and I completely agree with their concerns; however, some customers started making demands like “you owe us money for this” and “can’t you just call up another company and switch it over”. I don’t work there anymore, but I wonder if they created a backup plan for something like that especially since (at least from what I’ve seen), nobody uses cash anymore. If bank services went down, a lot of people are in trouble.
A: Yeah, I guess it's times like these where things get chaotic and out of hand to the point where situations get spiked for the worst.
Q2: Yeah, the money issue is why I stopped collecting some things. Now I have the mentality of “if it brings me joy and I can comfortably afford it then I think it’s a decent purchase”. Everything in moderation!
A: Yeah and also good to save up for important things or leisure-based stuff you want to do in the future since I guess it's quite expensive nowadays lol.
Q3: I loved Barbie movies when I was younger. Which one was your favourite? I think I liked Princess and the Pauper the best but that’s the one everyone likes.
A: I think it was Barbie: A Fairy Secret, Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale and basically all the classics I watched haha. Barbie: Starlight Adventure was okay I guess, I didn't like it (it was meh) much including the new animated Barbie movies (including Spy Squad)
Q4: I do know what you’re referring to. I think I’ve seen two different views on it – one that only reviews the game and one that looks at the controversy surrounding the game. The controversy, of course, is terrible. The game itself is pretty good.
A: I guess so.
Q5: Fun! My friend just came back from Mexico. I’ve heard nothing but praises from him. How far out do you usually plan your vacations? When I went to Japan, I think we got everything purchased about 4-5 months before we left. That’s on me tho. I had to get a new passport. At the time, due covid and all, the wait time was intense.
A: I feel you on the wait time. Nice! I don't know, I don't think I'll be travelling much after the summer but my family and I might plan to go to Mexico next year haha :p
Q6: Anything outstanding in Calgary? I haven’t been but a lot of people at my Uni came from Calgary. Lotta people talk about moving there for lower rent too.
A: I guess it's good. I don't think I've heard about Calgary having lower rent? Might just be me then lol. I'll check it out I think!
Q7: I got one of my grades back. Sadly, it was for the course that I wasn’t worried about. I’m still dreading to see my grade for my intermediate accounting course since the final was worth 65%.
A: Oh -- well you tried your best! I'm rooting for ya! 🥳
Q8: Hmmm. I think mountains? Are we talking like BC mountains? And rainforests like The Amazon? I think I’d quickly die a horrid death in The Amazons and there’s going to be a ton of insects which uh would scare me to death before the animals even get to me lol. Plus, I think it would be incredibly humid hot which I already experienced in Hong Kong. Maybe it would be good if you’re good with plants but I know nothing about them. What would you choose?
A: Probably rainforest lol.
Q9: On other news, I got my mail from Aliexpress yesterday. I. got. Scammed. Omg. I got two keychain knockoffs from a game I liked but they came completely different from the listing. Luckily, I got my money back but I was so sad. The image was different and blurry, it was scratched, the shape was different, etc. No wonder the listing quickly was deleted after I ordered it and they took forever to ship it out. I’m guessing they did actually have the product but ran out. So, they got someone to make a really bad imitation of it :((

Intro: Hope you’re having a blast on your vacation! Don’t worry about replying on time :)) I remember when I went to Japan, I basically ghosted everyone for three weeks ahah. Let me know all the fun details when you feel like it. 
 
A: Hi Lisa, hope you're having a good summer :) Thanks, so far I am! Haha lol, I will!
Q1: Are car scams common? I rented a car to go to Seattle but there was no issue. The only downside I can think of is at my old job, I’d get a lot of calls from people stranded on vacation because their cards don’t work. It was almost never an issue on the bank’s end, but the car rental companies could never process the transaction even if the customer paid the car deposit. I guess that might be a scam?
A: Oh, that. Yes, they might be common in North America but I doubt it's common in other continents. I could be wrong though. As for the tail-light on banks, one example could've be from ""Roger's Big Outage"" last summer in 2022 where Roger customers had data troubles and the credit/debit machines didn't work.
Q2: I do prefer physical books over ebooks though. When you have an ebook, it doesn’t feel like you own the book. However, I gotta admit, the convenience of having a book on your phone easily beats having to carry one around. There’s also the issue of running out of space for physical books. I donated around 25 a few months ago, but I ended up just getting more. Do you have anything that you like to collect? I try not to hoard but I really like collecting stuff - coins with special designs, my books, tea, wax stamps, etc. I used to collect candles and postcards too. I stopped cause, despite my hoarding tendencies, I also hate clutter. It’s a dilemma.
A: Oof, I guess that's the thing with ""You give, then receive."" I dunno though. Ummm good question. I don't really remember, but I think I used to do collecting, but then I stopped because I ended up wasting money.
Q3: Oh right lol. That gives you a chance to find a new “go-to” restaurant. I don’t think I’ve ever had clam chowder. I’ve always wanted to try it cause I keep hearing people mention it.
A: I guess it does. And yeah, clam chowder is pretty good.
Q4: I haven’t watched Nemo. It’s something that always shocks people. I’ve also never watched any of the classic Disney movies like Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White. Most of what I watched were foreign animated videos. For example, I did watch a version of Cinderella and The Little Mermaid but it was made by (I think) a Russian company in the 70s. The ending of The Little Mermaid was closer to the original too where she dies in the end. Some other stories I really enjoyed were King Thrushbeard and Thumbelina. 
A: Its a pretty good movie and it's kinda sad too (it's proably because of the music lol.) XD, I watched some ripoffs as well as a kid but I don't remember unfortunately. But mostly I had Barbie movies haha
Q5: Do you know what Hogwarts house you’re in? I’m not a diehard fan of Harry Potter but I like the thought of a universe with magic. Do you know about Hogwarts Legacy? I prepurchased the game cause I was so excited to play it. Honestly, as a rpg game, it’s not the best; however, the experience of exploring the Harry Potter universe was unlike anything else I’ve played.
A: I do not know unfortunately, sorry. I have heard interesting things about the game, but not really positive ones I don't think due to the controversy but I'm not going to say due to safety reasons. I've only seen a few positive outlights but otherwise it's all just some confusion :/
Q6: Ahah quality meme. I’ve seen it too and it’s one of my favorites especially since in the majority of the Zelda games (the recent ones), he’s a silent protagonist. He doesn’t talk at all. I’m pretty sure some npcs even commented on how he just stands there and stares in the Nintendo switch game.
A: Yeah I guess so lol.
Q7: Are you someone who hates spoilers? Personally, I don’t mind them since spoilers usually make me more excited. There’s only a select number of stories that I try to avoid hearing spoilers for.
A: It depends. If it's going to be a good movie, then yes. If it's not going to be a good movie, then no, not really. I won't really mind as I probably wont watch it anyways or if I watch it with my family or friends, we just comment on it and laugh hysterically.
Q8: Yeah, I used to love the PNE. I think I’ve gone maybe 6 or 7 times? I hear they’re expanding soon. I’ll probably go check it out once that happens. It’s been long overdue. I’ve gone so many times, but the rides were essentially the same all these years. The only difference is that, as the years go by, the lines get longer and longer. Maybe having more rides reduces the wait times.
A: Nice, I don't know if I'm going back there anytime soon, we were thinking to go to Mexico next year :) And yeah, no wait, no waste.
Q9: THEY DOOOO. DON’T APOLOGIZE FOR BEING EXCITED. Being there in person was SUPER exciting. It felt like I was transported somewhere else. Heading into Nintendo world, my friends and I audibly gasped. I added a photo, but I can promise you that it looked way more impressive in person. There was also a parade with people dressed up as different characters. It was so fun. 
Update: Whoops sorry I wasn't able to share the photo since uh the site thought I was sharing personal information ahah but if you google universal studios Nintendo land, you can see what I mean!
A: LOL NICEEEE and it's fine, I'll search it up when I get to Calgary lol. I'm staying in Calgary for a few days haha.
Q10: Bonus: Word of the day – morphogenesis – origin or development of a body part or organ
A: Interesting word I guess lol
Q11: I’ve been craving green tea ice cream for months. I also like cookie dough in the ice cream or chunky chocolate bits. I don’t usually eat it though. I’m pretty lactose intolerant, so I try to avoid stuff with a high milk content. I also hate the taste of cheap icecream but the expensive stuff is … well you know… expensive lol
A: Lol, I like the expression ice cream for some odd reason, I guess it's just craving XD
Q12: In other news, I got one final done and my last one is coming up. If you do reply soon, I might not be able to respond until Sunday or so. My final is so fricken late; it doesn’t end until 10 pm. I end up getting home so late. 
Take care and stay safe : D

Hope you’re having a blast on your vacation! Don’t worry about replying on time : )) I remember when I went to Japan, I basically ghosted everyone for three weeks ahah. Let me know all the fun details when you feel like it. 
Are car scams common? I rented a car to go to seattle but there was no issue.  The only downside I can think of is at my old job, I’d get a lot of calls from people stranded on vacation because their cards don’t work. It was almost never an issue on the bank’s end, but the car rental companies could never process the transaction even if the customer paid the car deposit. I guess that might be a scam?
I do prefer physical books over ebooks though. When you have an ebook, it doesn’t feel like you own the book. However, I gotta admit, the convenience of having a book on your phone easily beats having to carry one around. There’s also the issue of running out of space for physical books. I donated around 25 a few months ago, but I ended up just getting more. Do you have anything that you like to collect?
I try not to hoard but I really like collecting stuff - coins with special designs, my books, tea, wax stamps, etc. I used to collect candles and postcards too. I stopped cause, despite my hoarding tendencies, I also hate clutter. It’s a dilemma. 
Oh right lol. That gives you a chance to find a new “go-to” restaurant. I don’t think I’ve ever had clam chowder. I’ve always wanted to try it cause I keep hearing people mention it. 
I haven’t watched Nemo. It’s something that always shocks people. I’ve also never watched any of the classic Disney movies like Cinderella, the little mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White. Most of what I watched were foreign animated videos. For example, I did watch a version of Cinderella and The little mermaid but it was made by a (I think)Russian company in the 70s.

Intro: Happy Weekend : )
Hump days just means Wednesday. It’s a little bit of an old term so not many people still use it haha. If you think of a camel’s hump, it’s like in the middle ish so Wednesday is Hump day for being in the middle of the week.
A: Oh I see. I don't know much about old sayings back in the day lol.
Q1: That sounds fun! You can spend several days relaxing with friends throughout the journey. Kinda like a road trip. I’ve never been on a road trip but some of my friends have. Hopefully it doesn’t happen to you but one of my friends went on a road trip earlier this year. The car they rented kept acting up and they almost got in two accidents.
A: Oh, I'm sorry to hear about their rent car running into issues. Sometimes I feel like the company scam people from time to time but I don't know honestly. 
Q2: Yeah, it feels like everything is gradually increasing. I mean, I guess minimum wage has increased too but not as much as it should have. I remember working for like $10 an hour which sounds insane to me now cause $10 is basically nothing. Every time I think of inflation, I think of book prices. Paperbacks used to be $10-15. Now they’re around $25. Hardcovers used to be around $20. $25 if it was a fancy book. Now they’re around $40. Feels like I’m breaking the bank just to buy a single book.
A: I guess yeah. Doesn't make much sense to buy books physically anymore. 
Q3: What kind of cuisine does the hotel serve? If you really like it, I’d say it being your birthday is a good excuse to go back despite the prices. If you don’t really care for it, you can always fine a new place. After all, I think the location isn’t as important as making sure you can have a good time with friends.
A: They serve stuff from clam chowder to burgers to butter chicken :D It's unknown if I'll be living in my current hometown next year because plans keep going back and forth so I think we might move next summer lol.
Q4: Oh wow. I don’t think I’ve ever heard Euphoria by BTS before. Whistle is really old too. Is “Wow” an instrumental? That’s the only one I found. Speaking of instrumentals, I usually listen to the OST for this Otome game I play called Tears of Themis. Their entire soundtrack is a banger but my favs have to be “Summers Past” and “Marvelous Moments”. The game genre is romance and I feel like those two songs successfully convey the romance vibe. Another “song” I’ve been obsessed with is the song in the Star Rail Kafka trailer. Not only is her intro so cool but the background song is this EDM classical (Vivaldi) mix that sounds super cool.
A: Nice, cool lol. And yes, ""Wow"" is an instrumental soundtrack from ""Finding Nemo"" (dunno if you've watched it or not, but it's pretty much a classic in my book haha.)
Q5: Bonus: Word of the day – Apricity – the warmth of the sun in the winter : )
A: Huh, weird, usually it's pretty cold and snowy in the winter XD. (and just by looking at the word itself, it sounds like apricot and city lol)
Q6: I’m assuming you mean Draco Malfoy. Are you a fan of him?
A: Yes, him. He's okay I guess. But however, I'm not really interested in the Harry Potter multiverse most of the time anymore (but my friend is a fan of Draco!) but the movies are okay (I'll give 'em a good pass.)
Q7: Maybe it’s because I’m old and not up to date with social media and such, but I remember when everyone idolized the guy? Then he did some stuff and now everyone hates him, I think? I always found it weird how people strongly idolize strangers to a fault. I understand being a fan of a person, but some people go really far to the point of almost being a stalker. I think some people forget that these celebrities, even if you religiously follow them online, have no idea who you are. This problem is way more prevalent in Asia with crazy fans. I suppose that’s why agencies forbid their artists from dating because some fans feel like they own the artist. Personally, I think that’s a bit much. We don’t own anyone ahha. Instead, shouldn’t we be happy that someone we look up to found happiness maybe in the form of a partner?
A: Oh.. I'm sorry but I don't really have any comments. (Don't really know what to say for this.)
Q8: Are the people in Zelda considered elves? I never thought about that before.
A: It depends on who. Maybe not every one of the characters. (I'm not really an expert when it comes to Zelda and other characters mind you lol, but apparently what I looked up, Link has an appearance as an elf and the line in the animated TV show I hear him say is ""Well, excuuuuse me, Princess."" The line is pretty hilarious.) I have heard of Stardew Valley, but never played it however XD.
Q9: Yes! Have you watched Willy Wonka? I’ve seen the original and the remake with Johnny Depp. Such a fun movie.
A: I've seen the original, but I have yet to see the remake. (so please don't give me spoilers thank you!)
Q10: I love amusement parks, but not the haunted houses and I don’t usually like rides that mess around with g-force. I didn’t mind it when I was younger, but I went on the hellevator at Playland last year (have you been?) and my crusty, old body felt the force very strongly compared to my youth. I also do not like the wait time. At Playland, the wait for each ride were 1-1.5 hours.
A: Oh yeah. And nope, I don't think so, but I have been to PNE Playland either in 2013 or 2019 (not sure, I probably forgot, did you go to PNE?)
Q11: I checked out Universal Studios in Japan. It was fantastic – loved every second I was there. I didn’t check out Disneyland or Disney SEA cause I’m not a big Disney fan, but I was satisfied with Universal. Sadly, we only hit around half the rides cause of how busy it was. We even went on what was considered not as busy day. Like the mario kart ride wait time was 2 hours but it’s usually 4 hours. I think next time, I’m going to buy the fast pass.
A: THEY HAVE ONE IN JAPAN??? I didn't know that lol. Oh that sucks. I guess it's pretty popular nowadays XD. YES PLEASE BUY A PASTPASS IT WILL SAVE YOU SO MUCH TIME :D (sorry about that lol)
Q12: Hmm. I don’t think I have a FAV brand. I suppose I do like Toblerone. I like a brand called Milka too. It’s from Switzerland. It’s a little hard to find places that have it. Otherwise, I tend to enjoy chocolate with rice bits inside or chocolate with nuts and fruit. I used to love Hershey’s chocolate, but now I find it too sweet. Kit kats are delicious. I love Ferrero Rocher. Lindt is good too but expensive. To conclude, I enjoy a lot of brands ahaha
A: Lol, you do you! :)

I’m assuming you mean Draco Malfoy. Are you a fan of him?
Thanks! I bought purple shampoo. I’ve used it every now and then. Honestly, I don’t really care of my hair looks bronze-ish, so I don’t use it often. Maybe once a month when I remember it exists.

Intro: Happy Hump dayyyyyyyyyyyyy.
A: Hey and apologies, but what is that? And Happy [slightly] belated August :D
Q1: The food prices in Japan were crazy. I spent maybe $30-40 CAD per day on food there – that’s breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Here, I can easily spend $100 on one meal at Cactus Club. Not saying I should or usually do spend $100 on one meal, but it has happened before. Plus, they don’t tip in Japan so eating at a restaurant didn’t break my wallet. I think my most expensive meal there was at a Butler café with a $40 ish pasta. However, that did include the experience of being in a themed restaurant. It was definitely an interesting experience, but I don’t think I would go again.
A: That's pretty insane I think. Or is it the $100? 🤔 Either way, I guess that sounds pretty expensive lol. Oh, sounds interesting! Never been there myself XD.
Q2: Are you driving or taking a flight to Edmonton?
A: Since we are going with family-friends (and they're the ones hosting the holiday), we are going in their motorhome :D Even if it'll take days to get there, it's worth it, I think!
Q3: Thank you for the birthday wishes! It’s mid-September but I usually do a dinner a week or two before the actual date. When I go eat out with friends, it can be a little hard to find a restaurant since we’re a bigger group. We usually need to book a table beforehand. Do you do anything special for your birthday?
A: Nice! No problem :D Oh, the reservations are definitely difficult, I can tell you that lol. Me and my friends usually eat at a resturant too haha. There's a hotel that has a resturant so we eat there but not so much anymore since it's getting a bit expensive and already being there one too many times but I may or may not go there again later this year XD.
Q4: I haven’t watched ""The Greatest Showman"", but I have heard about it. I think DPR Ian isn’t as well known compared to some Korean musicians like BTS. Maybe you’ve heard of BTS? Blackpink is another popular group. I loved “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic. Haven’t heard “If I Lose Myself"" yet. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll give it a listen. One song I found recently and really enjoyed (thanks to Spotify) is TWIN XL – Lemonade.
A: Then I won't spoil it for you lol. Yes, I have heard of BTS and Blackpink but I only listen to them once in a while. But the recent music I've listened to by BTS was called ""Euphoria"" (not the show lol), and as for Blackpink, it would have to be ""Whistle"". Ah yes, ""Counting Stars"". Nostalgia at its finest <3 Oh cool! Never heard that before. The song (also courtesy of Spotify) there was one I've been listening to. It's called ""Wow"" by Thomas Newman (it's in the movie ""Finding Nemo"") and it's pretty good :D
Q5: Bonus: Word of the day – Draconian -> excessively harsh and severe (though it sounds like it means being related to a dragon lol)
A: Haha, it does! It also sounds like Draco (if you know who I'm talking about!)
Q6: My hair is bleached right now. That’s similar to blonde hair. I haven’t dyed it or bleached it to become blonde though. I think I’d look terrible ahaha. Usually, I get a balayage because I’m worried about my roots growing out and looking awful. I really want to entirely dye my hair a fun colour. Sadly, I also am not willing to go to the salon every few weeks for the upkeep.
A: Oh? I bet it looks nice! My friend got a balayage for Prom haha. Have you ever used purple shampoo at all? I don't necessarily know 100% if it works as I am no professional hair stylist (unless I do some research, haha.)
Q7: That’s cool! Did you get a chance to use the microphone yet?
A: Yep, me and my family had a karaoke (sort of) night at home XD.
Q8: I have 200 hours in the Sims 3 lol. It’s one of my most played games. In theory, just watching fake humans live their lives shouldn’t be that interesting. In reality, I can’t believe I played 200 hours of the Sims mostly watching my character write books on their computer.
A: Oh, impressive! I guess it's not that interesting imo, lol.
Q9: Thanks! One of my good friends from Sweden has ASD as well. I remember bombarding him with questions when we first met haha. I don’t have any questions right now, but I’ll let you know if any come up.
A: Oof lol. No problem :P
Q10: Unrelated but did you see the new logo for Twitter? It’s not bad enough to make a huge fuss over, but I like the old logo better. The X, in my opinion, makes it seem generic. The bird was such an icon and people immediately knew that it was related to Twitter. X, on the other hand, could be anything.
A: Yeah I did, didn't like it much lol. I believe that Elon Musk made the switch. It was, wasn't it? You're right, people knew right off the bat that it was Twitter. Not sure why the change was necessary :/ But unfortunately, not much we can do about it right now unless Musk steps down from the job or if he posts a new poll asking if he should continue to be CEO or whatever position he's currently in.
Q11: I finally got a chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3. Other than some lagging, I was wowed by the number of choices that the game lets you pursue. I spent 2 hours creating my character because I was wowed by all the different options. You’re speaking to a half-elf bard who used to be part of an artisan guild. I ended up playing 15 hours for my first session, so I passed out as soon as I finished. Now my sleep schedule went from messed up to super messed up. 100% worth it.
A: Ohhh, okay. Never heard of this game. It's somewhat reminding me of Zelda, with the elves and all lol.
Q12: I think my fav would be the animated spiderman movie. Though, I don’t have a lot of movies to choose from since I rarely go to the theater. I can probably count the number of times I went with my fingers. I saw that they were making a new Willy Wonka movie. Not sure if I’ll see it in theatres. It did look somewhat interesting.
A: Nice 😎 Oh yeah, it's the one with Timothée Chalamet and I believe it's coming on December 15 (15 days before Christmas!)
Quote of the day: -""Sometimes you might get a happy ending, sometimes you won't. It's all up to you on how it should be.""

Is there anything you believe had a huge impact on who you became? Other than K-pop, I think reading really shaped me into who I am today. Sometimes I like zoning out and it may look like I’m staring at a wall, but I’m recounting a really good story in my head.

Unrelated but did you see the new logo for Twitter? It’s not bad enough to make a huge fuss over, but I like the old logo better. The X, in my opinion, makes it seem generic. The bird was such an icon and people immediately knew that it was related to Twitter. X, on the other hand, could be anything. 
I finally got a chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3. Other than some lagging, I was wowed by the number of choices that the game lets you pursue. I spent 2 hours creating my character because I was wowed by all the different options. You’re speaking to a half-elf bard who used to be part of an artisan guild. I ended up playing 15 hours for my first session, so I passed out as soon as I finished. Now my sleep schedule went from messed up to super messed up. 100% worth it. 
I think my fav would be the animated spiderman movie. Though, I don’t have a lot of movies to choose from since I rarely go to the theater. I can probably count the number of times I went with my fingers. I saw that they were making a new Willy Wonka movie. Not sure if I’ll see it in theatre. It did look somewhat interesting.",9:27AM August 9

Intro: Happy weekend!
A: Thanks, same to you!
Q1: Aha that’s a weird meme tbh. I feel like they’re such different movies with different audiences.
A: I guess you can say that lol.
Q2: Ahhh if you ever get the chance, I hope you take the opportunity to try it! I usually don’t like to eat spicy food unless it’s Korean spice. I think their spice is sweet spicy which I like.  Hope you had a good time in Vancouver nonetheless! When I went to Seattle, I basically did the same things I’d do in Vancouver. We got bubble tea, walked around, didn’t pay for the touristy places, got a bunch of food, and left. The part I remember the most vividly is that we drove 30 min from the Space needle to go to a revolving sushi restaurant that also had locations in Japan. It was so disappointing. After conversion and tip, each plate (with two nigiri that were half the size compared to Japan), ended up being around $6 per plate when it was $1.50 in Japan :(((((((
A: Haha, thanks! That's nice! (at least I'll know what I'm expected to see + do) I guess Seattle is Vancouver but in the States lol. For real? 6 bucks in Seattle while it's a buck and fifty cents in Japan?! That's crazy. I actually thought it'd be the other way around :0
Q3: I went to the Parliament building too. I completely forgot about that. I went with my elementary school class so we got a tour. I suppose that would be similar to a castle. I think I remember being wow-ed by the inside. I saw a few coat of arms from different families and I was like wow I wish my family had something cool like that ahaha. I think it was 2011 when I went. I don’t remember much except the tour, there were horse carriages, and there were a lot of flowers. There was also a guy dressed like (I think) Abraham Lincoln standing outside. I talked to him, and he told me that I should go back to school since I had no idea who he was lol. In my defense, I was 10/11. I don’t think most kids knew who he was.
Speaking of the coat of arms, do you have any family heirlooms? Or maybe anything cool or fun that was passed down from your ancestors? It doesn’t have to be something physical. I know some families have traditions. I saw a video of this one family who would flip their cake in the air.
A: Haha, that's cool! I mean, I don't blame you. I didn't know who he was until maybe high school? I dunno. Hilarious story though. Thanks for sharing! And on that part, not 100% sure. I think whatever we had either went missing or something might've happened. But I'll try my best to update you if I find out.
Q5: Two weeks will come sooner than later. In two weeks, I’ll be done my finals and we’ll both be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. It’s still early but I’m somewhat planning my birthday dinner so everyone can make it.
A: Oof, or should we say one week? Lol. I leave for Edmonton next week haha! Even though it's a tackle, I hope you have fun planning your birthday dinner! I'm sure it'll be a blast :D And happy early birthday too! (whenever that may be!)
Q6: Guitar is cool. Did you play acoustic or electric? A lot of people that I talked to said their biggest regret choosing a large instrument was the fact that they had to carry it to school multiple times a week. It might be because I went to a small elementary school so there was no music room, but we weren’t allowed to keep any of our instruments there. Our music classes were held in the library.
A: Acoustic lol. Electric would've been cool but probably would've been too much money and electricity bills on their hands with equipments and all XD.
Q7: I don’t think I’ve ever watched the music video for “Rewrite the stars” but I have heard it somewhere before. I like it. I had no idea Anne-Marie sang it because I used to listen to her other songs. DPR Ian released a new song a few days ago, so I’ve been listening to his other songs. One I recommend is “Ballroom Extravaganza”.
A: Nice, I don't think I've heard of him before so this will be a new experience XD. Yeah lol. If you've watched ""The Greatest Showman"", it's Zac Efron and Zendaya who sing it in the movie haha. One song I listened to recently was ""If I Lose Myself"" by OneRepublic. (from my POV: I guess it's looking back on memories and realizing that sense of belonging somewhere, whether you're with friends or family.)
Q8: Bonus: Word of the day – Lollygagging-> Spending time aimlessly or simply fooling around
A: I've heard this word before lol! Sounds funny when you think about it though XD.
Q9: Ooo I suggest pink. I wanted pink after I dyed my hair red.
A: Lol okay :D Have you dyed your hair blonde before?
Q10: I think I’ve seen it before? Does the microphone have a big square section right under the mic – maybe with some buttons?
A: Yes, actually -- you're close! instead of pressing them though, you can slide the knobs down to adjust the sound, reverb, etc.
Q11: Cities Skylines is a management game where you can create a city from scratch. You can create roads, bus lines, city zones (like a residential zone, commercial, office, etc), water and waste disposal pipes, tourist attractions, etc. There are several DLCS that add to the base game like one adds natural disasters and such. I bet it sounds so boring if you’re not into this sort of game, but I love zooming into the sidewalk and stalking my little residents. If you click on a person, you can see where they live, where they work, and where they’re heading towards. It’s a little similar to The Sims if you’ve heard of that game.
One thing I learned from Cities Skylines is that it’s a good thing I did not go into urban planning because I can never figure out the roads. There are always traffic jams, or some roads never get used. I try to add bus lines but those also get too congested. I try to add a roundabout thinking it might help (idk why) and I don’t think it does.
A: Oh nice I think? XD. Yes, I've heard of the Sims! My friend plays it a lot, lol.
Q12: I hope I don’t seem like a crazy fan. I did realize I mentioned Korean culture multiple times. Since I was young, I was really into East Asian culture. I listened to K-pop (before It blew up in popularity), watched Korean dramas, and watched a ton of anime. I’m not salty about it but people used to tease me for listening to K-pop. Can you imagine? My best friend is crazy about it now, but 10 years ago, she thought it was dumb.
Basically, I grew up being influenced by a lot of Korean culture. Over the years, its popularity kept getting bigger and bigger. Since I’m living in a big city, I encounter a lot of pop culture. There are a ton of Korean restaurants and Korean stores near me. My friends are all into Korean culture now, so it’s a common interest.
A: No, no! It's totally fine, I was curious, that's all. You do you :) I don't watch a lot of K-dramas, but the one I watched on Netflix was pretty good. I have ASD, so I'm pretty curious about people I meet once I get to know them, haha. (so just keep that in mind!) If you want to ask me about it, fire away! (just please keep it appropriate so no trouble swings by!)

That’s really good advice. Maybe it’s because I’m in a big city, but there’s always this “go go go go” mentality that I tend to see. I try to be more chill about it, but it can definitely make you feel like you’re kinda falling behind. I try hard not to be a control freak, but I do like planning things. My way to get around that is to make “loose plans” while being open minded. I like tackling obstacles as they occur without thinking too hard about what COULD happen.

Hey! How has your week been? I finally finished my last midterm a few hours ago. I'm FREEEE until my finals ...
A: Hi! It was okay, nothing special for about a week or so lol. Congratulations! :D
Q1: Yeah, Oppenheimer. I didn’t watch it, but I saw a lot of people talking about it.
A: Lol, I would get why. To catch you up to speed: There were memes going around of Barbie and Oppenheimer releasing on the same day and people choosing whether they wanted to go see Barbie or go watch Oppenheimer. Hope this helped a bit lol.
Q2: We go to Downtown Vancouver pretty often since we’re around the area! I only go for the Korean food, otherwise I feel like it’s kinda bland? Maybe I’m too used to it. I thought my dislike of it might be because of the crowd since I’m also not a fan of Seattle, but I loved Tokyo. Your mentor might be right and I only liked Tokyo cause it was a novelty to me ahah. I think Seattle and Vancouver are really similar.
A: Oh lol! I've never tried actual Korean food XD. I mean, I think you can get used to too many things to the point where you don't get that 'flavour taste' anymore. Especially with me, I eat a lot of spicy food to the point where I don't think it's really all that spicy haha. Funny enough, me and my family were supposed to go to Seattle a couple years back but we unfortunately couldn't go due to personal reasons. But I was at Vancouver around the same time, so that was good enough anyways lol.
Q3: I really like the architecture of Japan. In Tokyo, they build up and there’s malls and skyscrapers everywhere. The area around Vancouver is so flat. Japan had so much personality too because not every store was part of a chain.  It made window shopping a unique experience since you never know what each store would offer.
A: That's pretty neat!!! I have never went but it's becoming popular! 👏🏽
Q4: Oh, that’s super cool! I wouldn’t mind checking out Germany. I think I’m open to exploring most places in Europe except for Paris because of all the uhh unfortunate travel experiences I’ve heard about. When I was in high school, I was close friends with a German exchange student. She said that she lived near a castle. I really want to explore the inside of a European castle.
A: Lol. I didn't explore a castle myself I think (my memory is pretty blank at this point), but the closest we've been was either Buckingham Palace in London (I am not 100% sure if I went or not, I'll probably have to double check and I'll update you!) or the Parlament in Victoria around 2013 (it was okay I guess lol).
Q5: Luckyy. I wish my brain was on vacation mode. I haven’t had like a responsibility free summer since I graduated from high school, since I took summer school every summer. It lightened my academic burdens during the school year, but wow I really want a few months to just sit around and pretend to be a mushroom.
A: Haha, it may be now, but in 2 weeks, ima be travellin' with family and family-friends doing silly things lol. OOF. I feel ya on the mushroom thing XD
Q6: Maybe. I’ve always been really bad at languages. I think my reading and writing is alright, but I always suffer when it comes to listening and speaking. In high school, I was so bad at the speaking and listening portion of French class that it caused my grade to drop by 10%. It sounds like you’re pretty gifted when it comes to learning languages.
A: Ah well, I guess it takes practice and motivation to get a sense of them lol. Just don't put too much pressure on yourself to do it all. Once you feel unmotivated to do something, you might not feel a spark to do it anymore. So that's why I wanted to do stuff at my own pace and my own time. It's just food for thought. And thanks :)
Q7: If you were winded by the flute, I’m surprised you always did the trumpet! I’d imagine that requires more air. Was the flute popular in your class? I was one of the only three flute players ahah. Half the class chose the clarinet then the rest were a combination of other brass instruments.
A: It did, lol. I only did trumpet for one year before middle school. Also I have taken a Guitar class XD (and also because the case was pretty heavy to carry around) I don't blame them with that! I think I should've done drums instead haha!
Q8: Ooo I’ve never heard of that song by K/DA. I do like it! Thank you for the recommendation. I really like their other song – “Villain”. Some English songs I’ve been playing on repeat are PALAYE ROYALE – Lonely, X Lovers - Dreams Where Ur Murdered, and eaJ - Car Crash. I’m going to be honest; I think some of them have some depressing lyrics, but I never pay attention to what’s being said. I like the vibes of the songs.
A: Oh lol, I've listened to most of their songs and they're pretty good if I'm being honest here! Gosh, I don't think I've heard these songs before. ""Rewrite the Stars"" is good as well! The message behind it mostly is that one person shows love to the other while the other one doesn't accept them. But deep down, they do but they don't want to reveal that because of the difficulties they might face. (That's what I think it is, but feel free to visualize a meaning of your own!) 
Q9: Bonus: Word of the day – Fudgel -> Pretending to work when you're really just goofing off.
A: Haha, most relatable word I've ever heard!
Q10: What colour are you thinking of dying it? I’ve done blue, purple, and grey/silver, so I’m thinking of doing red next. It’s just so darn expensive so I usually get it done once a year. My hair feels like straw now. 
A: I was thinking blonde or a light shade of pink, not sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Q11: I don’t think I could ever sing in public. That’s so nerve wracking. That’s a cool gift. Is it one of those big microphones that you see in concerts or one of those mini ones. I could never whistle tunes – tbh I don’t think I ever tried? Definitely can’t do it now. Are you able to do it?
A: It kinda is, to be honest. Ummm, it's a Bluetooth microphone from Amazon and it's rose gold XD. Haha lol, all good. I can't either, but I can do it [somewhat] inwards if that counts XD.
Q12: Hmmm. I’m not sure if I have a talent. I guess I like (and I think I’m good at) planning stuff. Idk if that’s a talent though. I usually plan the get togethers for my group of friends. I like managing stuff haha. That’s why I have an excel sheet for my clothes and I play management games like cities skylines. What’s your talent?
A: Lol. What's 'Cities Skylines?' (unless you're talking about skyline schedules XD.)

My fav hobby is reading. I spend most of my spare time reading. Though, when I was younger, I had more hobbies. Like I said before, I used to write, I also used to have a few penpals, and I used to draw. Did you have any hobbies that you eventually dropped? Anything you want to pick up?

Intro: Happy Monday!
A: Thanks, same to you!
Q1: Did you like the movie? I’d rate it a solid 7/10. The movie theater was absolutely packed with half the people watching Barbie and the other half watching the nuclear movie that also came out on the same day.
A: It was interesting, I give it a 6.5/10. Talking about Oppenheimer I'm assuming?
Q2: Vancouver Island is a good destination. I’ve been wanting to visit Victoria but none of my friends want to go with me. They said it’s too boring.
A: I guess it depends how you felt when you went the first time. Maybe they don't like the city culture there or maybe they didn't have such a swell time when they went there. But my old mentor said that once you had the experience, it wouldn't be the same if you go all the time because you already had the experience. Have they been to Vancouver? Vancouver is pretty neato! :D
Q3: Aha. I know some of my relatives live in Paris but most of them are in China. It’s pretty cool that you have relatives everywhere. It’s basically like you have friends all around the world. When I visited Hong Kong a few months ago, I met my friend’s aunt, and she (on the spot) invited me to her daughter’s wedding in Singapore. I’m super flattered but I wouldn’t want to crash the wedding since her daughter doesn’t even know me.
A: Ye, I guess so lol. Forgot to mention I have some in Germany as well from my dad's side XD. Oh, that sounds nice, If I were invited by a friend's aunt, I would've done the same, but I would've went anyways just to be nice lol!
Q4: It’s through this site called Goodreads. Do you use it? Basically, it’s a site to track and find books. You can set a reading goal for the year. I’m at 61 books so far with a goal of 75. It says I’m 18 books ahead of the schedule, so I might have to increase it. You can also message some authors which is what I did. It’s kinda embarrassing, but I messaged a few of my favorite authors back in the day and she was the only one that responded.
A: Oh nice! And no, I've heard of it but never used it lol. Sounds interesting!
Q5: I am the older sister to one younger sister. We’re pretty close. I usually cook for her and she buys me food on the way home from work/school.
A: Haha, cool! Sounds like you guys have a good bonding relationship :)
Q6: Not a trick question! Sorry, should’ve worded it better. I feel like you have to be good at lying to your friends to win in Among us.
A: No problem, I just didn't understand lol. My brain has been on vacation mode for a while XD. Nope, I wasn't, it would tie up to either my friends or my siblings lol.
Q7: Oui oui. I did see what you did there. How good is your French? Since I went into the arts at Uni and I didn’t take French 12, I had to take it in university. It ended up being one of my worst grades.
A: I took French from elementary school until Grade 9 lol. But then, I would re-learn just for the fun of it haha. Oof, I guess French isn't easy, hey?
Q8: Did you like playing the flute? I also learned it around the same grade as you. I thought about joining band after that but decided against it.
A: Yes and no. The yes part -- it was good, the no part -- is how much air you had to use and I would probably be winded by the end of the day lol. But the flute wasn't the only instrument, I also did trumpet for a while in Grade 5 haha.
Q9: Hibiscus is beautiful. Have you had hibiscus tea? I love the vibrant colour and the taste. It’s a little tart.
A: Oooh, I've heard of it but never tried it before haha.
Q10: I’ll make sure to double-check the links 😊 I used to listen to Try by P!nk nonstop when I was younger – it’s a good song. I like Golden Hour too. Never heard of Weightless before but I’ll give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendations!
A: No worries, also it just popped into my mind -- there's a song I've been listening to a lot lol. It's called I'll Show You by K/DA. The meaning behind it is for me (from my point of view) is that you feel as if you're not good enough. Then at the end, you decide to move on and leave it in the past and focus more on self-love and what it means to not judge yourself or others because you never know what they might be going through. But otherwise, it's pretty good, and I think you might like it! It has some Korean lyrics in it too :D
Q11: Bonus: Word of the day – Betwixt means “in between”
A: Makes sense -- it sounds like ""between"" itself lol!
Q12: Quote of the day: -""I’m Kenough."" – Ken from the Barbie movie.
A: Haha lol!
Q13: I guess wavy hair? My hair right now is a combo between straight and wavy – mostly wavy. I like having a lot of layers since my hair is thin. With it being wavy and layered, it’s like halfway to being a wolf cut but less extreme. Curly hair is really cute though. Have you ever dyed your hair?
A: That's cool! And nope, I have never dyed my hair. I may or may not next year lol! I have got it permed though haha! I got it cut though, but my hair is regrowing anyways lol.
Q14: I think I would rather do poetry. Years ago, I used to write poetry. I haven’t had the motivation nowadays, so that’s all in the past. The most important thing to consider is that I’m 100% tone deaf. Nobody needs to or wants to hear me sing. Have you been to karaoke before? I used to be able to whistle. I can’t do it anymore.
A: Cool that you used to do poetry! Awh, that sucks, I'm sorry. I'm 100% sure you sing super well! Even I can't as well lol. My voice is a bit deep (with some voice cracks once in a while) so I don't sing like 90% of the time unless my friends encourage me to haha. I have, but with my friends and family -- never in public! I also got a microphone from a family-friend :D I'll see if I can send a pic! Oh that's cool, when you were younger? Were you able to whistle tunes? If so, like easy songs or hard ones?

Happy Monday!
Did you like the movie? I’d rate it a solid 7/10. The movie theater was absolutely packed with half the people watching Barbie and the other half watching the nuclear movie that also came out on the same day. 
Vancouver Island is a good destination. I’ve been wanting to visit Victoria but none of my friends want to go with me. They said it’s too boring. 
Aha. I know some of my relatives live in Paris but most of them are in China. It’s pretty cool that you have relatives everywhere. It’s basically like you have friends all around the world. When I visited Hong Kong a few months ago, I met my friend’s aunt, and she (on the spot) invited me to her daughter’s wedding in Singapore. I’m super flattered but I wouldn’t want to crash the wedding since her daughter doesn’t even know me. 
It’s through this site called Goodreads. Do you use it? Basically, it’s a site to track and find books. You can set a reading goal for the year. I’m at 61 books so far with a goal of 75. It says I’m 18 books ahead of the schedule, so I might have to increase it. You can also message some authors which is what I did. It’s kinda embarrassing, but I messaged a few of my favorite authors back in the day and she was the only one that responded. 
I am the older sister to one younger sister. We’re pretty close. I usually cook for her and she buys me food on the way home from work/school. 
Not a trick question! Sorry, should’ve worded it better. I feel like you have to be good at lying to your friends to win in Among us. 
Oui oui. I did see what you did there. How good is your French? Since I went into the arts at Uni and I didn’t take French 12, I had to take it in university. It ended up being one of my worst grades. 
Did you like playing the flute? I also learned it around the same grade as you. I thought about joining band after that but decided against it. 
Hibiscus is beautiful. Have you had hibiscus tea? I love the vibrant colour and the taste. It’s a little tart. 
I’ll make sure to double-check the links 😊 I used to listen to Try by P!nk nonstop when I was younger – it’s a good song. I like Golden Hour too. Never heard of Weightless before but I’ll give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendations!

I guess wavy hair? My hair right now is a combo between straight and wavy – mostly wavy. I like having a lot of layers since my hair is thin. With it being wavy and layered, it’s like halfway to being a wolf cut but less extreme. Curly hair is really cute though. Have you ever dyed your hair?",2:11AM July 31
