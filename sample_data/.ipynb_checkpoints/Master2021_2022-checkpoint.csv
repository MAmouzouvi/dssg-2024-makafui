need to be taking better care of yourself? And how might the transition to post-secondary schooling
make self-care more difficult?Mentor 2022-04-14, 16:58: Somewhat similar to the story in the
article, when I hit Grade 12, I burned out. One example of what happened was on my final science
project I went up to the teacher to say I wouldn't have the project done on time (and this was me,
normally at the top of the class). When he asked why (and if I needed an extension), I was like I
sit down, am interested in the topic and just don't do it. And an extension wouldn't help - I would
just procrastinate more. I was exhausted, avoiding both schoolwork and what I was normally
interested in. I did eventually finish the project with support from my parents but showed me
something wasn't going right. I had to re-evaluate my priorities - studying and getting perfect
marks wasn't everything. I needed breaks, exercise, to socialize with others and have interests
outside of just school. Shifting to post-secondary both helped and made it more difficult. I
definitely had more freedom to do what I wanted (sports on campus/clubs/events/hang out w/peeps/etc)
but much less routine and with the continued (mostly self-) pressure to do well. I can say now
looking back that it took time but I am definitely in a much better place where I balance my work,
fun and rest. There are times where the balance will shift to one way or another (like now for final
exams) but in a way that still allows me to keep my sanity (like playing foosball with friends
during lunchbreak when you could be studying!). The TL;DR - whenever I find myself getting really
tired or losing interest in activities I normally like to do (like hiking, playing games) I stop,
take a break and reflect on what's going on. It may mean I don't score 100% or do all that I want to
but that's ok. I do the important things and keep myself well to do so much more. :) How about you?
Anything you've noticed in yourself or worries in transitioning to post-secondary?Mentor 2022-04-20,
20:46: Also in a bit of follow-up to my last very long post XD - is there anything you're worried
about (or noticed about yourself) for your well-being or being able to do self-care? I can add an
aside that I'm just about done my final exams and so excited to get back to exercising properly.
It's been a lot of time on my bum studying.Mentee 2022-04-21, 15:44:",,"Mentor 2022-04-09, 19:23: Hello Hailey! It's nice to e-meet you! My name is Kathleen and I'm going
to be your mentor! I'm 28 years old and currently a first year medical student at UBC (almost done
this year though!). Also completed my undergrad at UBC in biochemistry. I'd love to hear more about
you! What are your hobbies? Interests? Anything else interesting you'd like to share? Let me know if
you have any questions for me! Send them my way and I'll do my best to answer them. :)Mentee
2022-04-11, 13:26: Hi Kathleen, Its great to e-meet you aswell! I am hoping to apply for the
Biomedical Studies Degree program at UNBC after I graduate. Even though I have no clue what I want
to do after that. I also really enjoy baking as a hobby on the weekends. So I guess thats me. What
happens next? :)Mentor 2022-04-11, 20:15: Hey Hailey, Fair enough - trying to decide the rest of the
future is hard. Plus there's so many things you can do that you may not have even known about until
uni! Any particular reason(s) you're interested in Biomedical studies? Ahhh baking - what's your
specialty?? I tend to bake something until I get it right (like macarons that I now never do the
effort to make anymore) and then stick with a couple of favourites. Like matcha white chocolate chip
cookies. And a home version of marbelous cookies. (ˆڡˆ) Next up for us: 1) decide a schedule to help
keep us on track would it help to schedule a time we're both online and can message back and forth
in real time? or set up a day we know we can except a reply from the other person (for ex. You'll
always reply on Tuesday and me on Thursdays). 2) choose a conversation to start with Let me know
which conversation topics (see the circle above!) you're interested in and which one you'd like to
do first. Once we're ready, I can open it up for us to start! Sorry for the long reply :P -
KathleenMentor 2022-04-11, 20:16: Also sorry the formatting for the message went funky and doesn't
look as neat as I'd like it to xDMentee 2022-04-12, 16:59: Hii I usually just find recipes that i
find interesting on Pinterest and then try them. Im not much of a problem solver so if i get it
wrong I just forget about it and move on to something else. Except soft pretzels, those are
something i really like to make (and eat) and i keep trying new things with them. Whatever schedule
works for you and your life is fine. I have atleast an hour every school day that I can respond so
it really doesnt matter to me. I think Id like to start with the ""Well being and self care""
conversation first. Thanks :)Mentor 2022-04-12, 20:19: Perfect! I've opened up the first
conversation - pop in any questions/comments/etc in the chat for that section and I'll reply to them
there. The extension activities are there to support the learning if you're interested. Sounds like
you have a good schedule then - I'll just follow you! If it's one thing I've learned, you don't need
to be perfect at everything - it's really cool that you're trying different recipes and also have
one area you're that much more interested in! Now I want to eat something baked...Mentee 2022-04-13,
12:03: Hi, So I am currently working on my graduation capstone which is the main reason I have
become your mentee. For an assignment I need to fill out a ""Mentor agreement form"" which I have
already filled out and basically just need you to look over and give me the OK that I can use you
for it (If you are okay with it). I pasted the form below. Thanks :) AGREEMENT FORM Student Name:
Hailey B. Project Mentor: Kathleen Career Pathway: Thank you for volunteering your time to serve as
a Mentor for my Stress and Art Capstone Project at Correlieu Secondary School. My agreement is to
present my mentor(s) with my Capstone Project Proposal Form, which outlines my proposal. My Project
Title: My goal(s) for this project: I want to show how art can benefit you and your mental health to
help be successful in your day to day life, as well as my improvement. I hope to learn a little bit
more about myself and notice how I feel after I have done an art project, as well as continue to
improve my skills. My strategy to accomplish the project: Continue to work through conversations
with my mentor to help me learn more about stress and stress management, as well as working through
my assignments on Scides. All to help me complete my capstone project. For my oral presentation, I
plan to use the following materials: Google Slides Student Signature Date Parent Signature Date
Mentor(s) DateMentor 2022-04-14, 16:34: Hey Hailey! I'd be more than happy to support you in your
graduation capstone project. I think my only comment on that is I don't see a project title listed -
otherwise it looks super cool and I look forward to see where it goes! Let me know if you need me to
sign anything (if so, feel free to upload it to the porfolio and I should be able to access the
document). - Kathleen",,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-04-13, 11:49: SELF CARE ACTION PLAN Action 1 - I want to get a better sleeping schedule.
I will do this by trying to use my phone less before bed and have a set bedtime. Action 2 - I want
to try going outside more. To do this I will try to get at least 15 minutes (to start) of fresh air
outside every day. Action 3 - Less screen time. I will try to monitor how much time I am spending on
my phone and when I get bored I can reach for a book instead of my phone or the Tv remotesMentor
2022-04-14, 17:01: I love your self-care plan! I've definitely set the first one for myself as well
before. I find it really helpful to charge my phone outside my room so I'm less tempted to look at
it before bed and first thing when I wake up. If you're interested, I'd love to hear how it goes
over the next week :)Mentee 2022-04-19, 17:18: hey! thank you for agreeing to help with my capstone
as well as giving some insight on stress. It help me feel alot better to know that I am not the only
one who struggles. My capstone doesnt have a title yet as I am still unsure what to call it without
being misinformative. I am going to attach the form to my portfolio (hopefully) so you can sign it
:) Thanks :)Mentor 2022-04-20, 20:40: Hey Hailey! I'm not seeing the file uploaded yet - did you
want to try submitting it again? I believe you'll need click both ""Save to Your Portfolio"" and ""Send
Message"". The file should show up on the right under ""Portfolio"". Let me know if you're having any
issues with it. Fair enough - let me know if you need any help with the title. :)Mentee 2022-04-21,
15:30: Mentee 2022-04-21, 15:40: Thats great that your feeling better now that exams are done, I
hope you did well. I notice that I get really overwhelmed when I have a big workload, so i worry
that I will struggle when I get to university because sometimes I just shut down and dont do
anything rather than dealing with the stressful work to get it done. I am hoping that being super
organized will help me stay on track and lessen the stress. I have uploaded my file to the portfolio
again, so fingers crossed it workedMentee 2022-04-21, 15:41:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

work with you this semester! I see you like math and arts, thats really cool! I really liked math in
highschool but sadly I haven't been given the gift of being good at art haha. What conversation
sounds the most appealing to you and wanna do first?Mentee 2022-04-14, 12:08: Hello Maia, I don't
really know what to talk about first. Although just to pick a topic how about art because it can
lead to more topics. It sucks that your not good at art but i'm sure your good with many other
things that will be nice to learn about. I am excited to talk to you too.Mentor 2022-04-14, 15:45:
Hey Elyssia! Haha yeah im not good at art but I am good at acting and making sets for plays, so
maybe im good at painting sets. Does that count as art? im not sure haha. Anyways since you like art
and some math I think we could start with the ""Post-Secondary Considerations"" Conversation. That way
we can see potential programs that may be of your interest. How does that sound?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

an entire course about the topic last semester, so please feel free to ask me any questions you may
have! How did you feel about the video/article? I found that the article did an excellent job of
emphasizing that self-care does not need to be complicated and that we should focus on the basics.
For me, that includes adequate sleep, sports, healthy food, boundaries between work and free-time,
and spending time in nature. What about you? Do you have a plan you like to use for self-care? Do
you think that you will have any trouble keeping up with this plan after high school? I look forward
to your reply!Mentor 2022-04-12, 00:13: Hi Phoenix! I just want to check in a see how you are doing.

study? Have you been taught any studying methods? What about the strategies mentioned in the videos?
Studying can look different in high school versus post-secondary and I know that I had to alter my
study habits a bit. So even if you do not use the strategies mentioned in the videos, maybe keep
them in mind because they may come in handy later on :).Mentee 2022-04-17, 17:29: Hey Navkiran, So I
finished the videos on studying and note taking. They were pretty informative, and theres definately
strategies that were mentioned that I'd like to be comfortable with doing before post secondary. So
usually my studying is pretty similar to the tips mentioned in the video. Avoid cramming, use words
and visuals, and ask lots of clarifying questions. The video also mentions a method where you write
down everything you already know, then compare it to your class material. I think that will be super
usefull in my upcoming units! Really excited to experement with that new technique. I haven't been
""taught"" how to study, so learning new approaches and takes on this kind of stuff really helps. In
addition to studying, I looked into ""The Pomodoro Technique"". To my suprise I already study in that
kind of format by using a timer and taking short breaks in between work blocks. It's worked well for
me and I've reccomended classmates to try it as well. The note taking video was also informative! I
already use a lot of the tips mentioned but I feel like hearing them from another source re-enforces
my note-taking confidence. (If that makes sense lol).Mentor 2022-04-19, 11:31: Hi Charlie, I'm glad
to hear that you already use some of the helpful techniques when studying! It's also nice that you
picked up some new tips that you may use in the future. As for the Pomodoro Technique, I can say
that is definitely a popular technique that I see other students using at school. It works for a lot
of people! Do you have any questions about these strategies? Would you add any other strategies that
you use but were not mentioned here?Mentee 2022-04-19, 20:43: I think both videos were great. Don't
have any questions. But I would ""add"" group studying aswell. So I'm in the middle of a chemistry
unit, and my peers and I are learning a LOT of new information. So sometimes studying alone isn't
efficient. Many of my classmates are timid when asking questions in class, so being in a small group
is a bit more encouraging. In the case that one of us doesn't understand a concept, theres a chance
another one of us will, and they can explain the concept instead. In theory this works pretty well,
but only if EVERYBODY is on task. If one group member isn't working everybody ends up distracted
lol.",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-12, 12:27: Hi Charlie, I’m Navkiran and I will be your eMentor 😊! I am a second year
student studying biology. I noticed that you are interested in STEM, so if you have any questions,
definitely let me know and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability! Some of my hobbies
include art and baking. What are some things you like to do in your free time? Feel free to add
anything else you would like to share :).Mentee 2022-03-13, 14:02: Hi Navkiran! That's such a pretty
name :) I also love art. I'm more into work with graphite and paper but I don't mind dabbling with
paint and oil pastel. I glanced your profile, You said you want to be a dentist? What part of
dentistry inspired you to pursue a career in that field?Mentor 2022-03-13, 21:48: Great question!
What I really liked about dentistry was that it is the perfect combination of my interests, since it
incorporates art and science. I also tend to pay very close attention to detail, and detailed
handwork is the core of the profession. Also, I'm glad that we have something in common :). I have
never tried oil pastel, but maybe some time in the future I will get a chance! Feel free to ask more
questions if you have any. If not, have a look at the Conversation choices in the Navigation Wheel
above and check of the ones you want to discuss!Mentee 2022-03-14, 00:07: For sure! So most of the
questions I have are pretty broad, but if something doesn't make sense definately let me know what I
can clarify. Is there anything you wish you knew before going into STEM courses? I've heard they are
more challenging than other classes offered in post secondary.Mentor 2022-03-14, 16:31: I would say
what students find challenging varies, but I do agree that STEM courses are often said to be more
tough. For me personally, I sometimes find my STEM courses easier than electives just because they
are more interesting to me. So, I would say unless you hate STEM, the classes are doable, and even
fun! It is important to study what you like because it can be super hard to find motivation to study
for courses that you just hate! As for something I wish I knew before going into STEM courses, I
would say pay attention to what the instructor emphasizes and spend more time reviewing those
topics.Mentee 2022-03-15, 01:04: Makes sense. University tends to require more studying than
highshool. Do you have any tips or routines that help you effectively study? Or even tips for taking
notes? I often struggle to keep up with the teacher's lessons AND take organized notes.Mentor
2022-03-16, 00:05: Yup, I would agree that there is more studying in university-level classes. I
would say make sure you don't leave revision until the last minute. Revising in smaller chunks but
more often is more effective. How I take notes varies from class to class. Don't be worried if you
don't have one set method to take notes. For example, it would be a nightmare to take math notes on
a laptop, but typing is much easier in other courses! You'll find that the most common lesson format
is to have Powerpoint slides, and the majority of students follow along and write their notes on the
slides. If you have more questions about studying, we can totally discuss it further in the
""Studying"" Conversation, if you choose it from the options above in the wheel!Mentee 2022-03-16,
23:46: Alright that makes things a bit less intimidating! On the wheel it mentions ""finding
inspiration"", could we begin with that? I'm not too familiar with how the options on the wheel work
so if I need to do anything differently let me know! Also thank you for reminding me that was there
lol.Mentor 2022-03-18, 14:33: Sure, we can start with ""Finding Inspiration"". Before we move on,
let's make sure that you are familiar with how things work. Above this message box, you will find
some text, called the ""Anchor Text"". For this section, or ""Conversation"", it just explains how
things work. Give that a read and let me know if you are confused about anything. But generally,
there will be an Anchor text that goes with each of the Conversations (that you pick from the
wheel), and our Conversation down here in the message section will be based on that!Mentor
2022-03-25, 23:58: Hey! I haven't heard from you in a while - I was getting used to your fast
responses! Just checking in to see how you are doing :).Mentee 2022-04-05, 01:59: Hey! sorry for not
getting back to you! I wasn't logged into gmail over spring break, and I saw that mentors have to
reply within three days, I wasn't sure how active you would be either and I didn't want to hassle
you for replies on your spring break lol. I appreciate the check in too :) Anyways, did you take
spring break off? If so how did that go?Mentor 2022-04-05, 11:28: Hey! No need to apologise :). I
did not have spring break (there is reading week in university, but that has already passed!) so it
completely slipped my mind! I hope you enjoyed your break and are feeling rested.Mentee 2022-04-05,
20:17: Makes sense, what's a reading week though? I've never heard of anything like that. Also now
that we are back in touch, I think we left off on discussing a topic on the wheel. I don't recall
which topic though, so if we could start the ""studying"" conversation and begin from there that'd be
great!Mentor 2022-04-06, 10:35: Reading week is basically a week of no classes in university, which
gives you time to study for midterms and take a break part way through the semester! Yes, we can
start with the ""studying"" conversation. Before we go there, I just want to make sure that you have
read the anchor text above this message box - it is just some information about how these
conversations work. Give it a read and let me know if you have any questions. If not, I will open up
the ""studying"" conversation :).Mentor 2022-04-13, 15:45: Hi Charlie! Just checking in to see how you
are doing. This is a friendly reminder to make sure you understand the text above this before we
move on and let me know (in case you were waiting for me to open the ""Studying"" anchor text!).Mentee

able to find time for self care? Does University strongly impact your well being?Mentor 2022-04-08,
18:21: Hey! I hope you've been finding the self care unit interesting so far. I think self care is
extremely important. Sometimes it's hard to find time for it, especially during exam season in
university. I would say that university impacts my well being in a lot of ways- it's hard balancing
your school work, and you might find yourself stuck on something you can't solve. But even then, you
should think of your well-being first! It's normal to feel tired or burnt out. I take care of my
well-being by giving myself breaks throughout the day and week! I often find it hard to keep
studying, and instead of pushing myself I like to put aside my work and just go out for an hour to
let my mind rest :) Staying hydrated and well rested is also really important to me. Good luck with

digitally and traditionally, play video games and teach myself languages, right now I’m learning
Spanish, French and German. I also like to write stories, mostly historical and science fiction but
right now I’m writing a folklore horror. I only read sometimes though, and I mostly read comic
books/graphic novels, although I do like shakespeare! I also like to cook, bake and spend time
outdoors. For general interests I don’t really have any. I don't watch much TV, but when I do, I
like Brooklyn 99. I also really enjoy team fortress 2 and portal 2. As for classes, right now I’m in
science, pre calc math, careers and PE. Science and PE are really the only two I enjoy, the others
are ok. In science right now I’m learning about DNA and genetics which I’m super happy about. How
are you finding your classes? What do you enjoy most about University? Was there anything that
surprised you about the program? Hope you're having a great week! : )Mentor 2022-03-12, 15:15: Hey
Isabella, it's so nice to hear back from you! Your hobbies are amazing, I also love writing and
reading stories. Folklore horror sounds super intriguing, I'd love to hear more about it! I also
learned a bit of Spanish and French, and last semester I took a Spanish class in my university to
pick it up again. It was a lot of fun, and a great switch-up from all my Science classes. I hope
your classes are going well, they sound very interesting! DNA and genetics are definitely one of my
favorite units in science as well. I'm finding my classes okay, I'm taking Chemistry, Biology,
English, and Physics this semester. What I enjoy the most is being able to meet lots of people with
similar interests as me when we work in small groups or in labs. It's a great way to feel connected
and encouraged throughout the year. I think something that surprised me the most is how friendly the
professors are. Whenever there's something I need help with, there are always people available to
help me or resources the teachers can direct me to. I hope you have a great week as well! Do you
have any plans for spring break?Mentee 2022-04-04, 12:04: Hi Madeline! Sorry for not getting back to
you, I was very busy during the last days of school before spring break. I didnt have any plans for
spring break really, I mostly just stayed at home and did whatever. I did get to go shopping at a
big mall thoguh, so that was fun. Did you get to do anything for spring break? Or do you have
different breaks in university?Mentee 2022-04-04, 13:10: Also, can you open the Well being &amp;
selfcare conversation and the Career considerations conversation? Thanks : )Mentor 2022-04-04,
13:20: Hey Isabella! No worries, welcome back from spring break! I love going to malls, I hope you
had fun. We have different breaks in university, so our ""reading break"" was a week for us to study
for our upcoming midterms in February. Even though my final exams are in a week, I did manage to
enjoy this weekend. There are a lot of cherry blossom trees near my university so I went out for a
walk around campus. The weather has been really nice lately, have you had the chance to enjoy the
outdoors? Also, I'll unlock those two for you right now! I'm really glad to hear from you :)Mentee
2022-04-06, 15:42: Yeah! My house is built next to a river and on the edge of a forest, so there was
tons to do just outside my house. I wasn't able to swim of course, but there are a lot of cool rocks
and sometimes, if you're lucky, gemstones on the river. I found a chunk of quartz just a bit smaller
than a computer mouse. Your school campus must be beautiful right now with all the cherry blossoms.
Good luck on your exams!Mentor 2022-04-08, 18:11: Hi Isabella! Sorry for the late reply, this week
was our last week of class so I've been rushing to finish up assignments. I never knew you could
find gemstones by the river, that's so fascinating! I had to search up what quartz looks like, and
wow, I'm really amazed. I love collecting rocks whenever I go to the beach, do you have a rock
collection too? Thank you so much for the good luck :) I hope you're doing well in school right now
too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

old and I'm completing a post-baccalaureate diploma in counselling and human development at Simon
Fraser University. Previously, I earned my BA in criminology and a police studies certificate. I'd
like to know more about you! What are you hoping to study in university? Do you have a dream career
in mind? Also, aside from school, what are some things that you like to do just for fun? Let me know
if you have any questions about anything at all - I'll do my best to answer!Mentee 2022-03-02,
20:17: Hi Kimberly :) I'm so happy to hear that you went to SFU and earned a BA in Criminology! I
applied for that program and am patiently waiting to hear back, but I have already gotten accepted
into University of Alberta for sociology. In regards to that I have been deciding if I am going to
try and switch to a BA in psychology because it is more in the line of work and intrest I would
prefer! If you have any advice on that, it would be greatly appreciated:) I'm hoping to either study
Criminology or Psychology and specializing in Forensic Psychology. My dream career is to be a
Forensic psychologist, it has been something I have wanted to be for a very time! In my spare time I
love to go skiing in the winter, then water sports and spending time at the lake with my family,
friends and dogs!Mentor 2022-03-05, 14:45: That's so exciting! Congratulations on being accepted to
the University of Alberta :-) That's so exciting. I had a great experience studying criminology at
SFU so fingers crossed that you also get accepted there! Also, let me know if you do and I can share
more about my experience there. In terms of potentially switching to psychology, know that your
first year of university is very flexible. So, for example, if you're not 100% sure about
criminology (or sociology), take some psychology courses in your first year to see if that's
something you find more enjoyable. I definitely encourage you to reach out to an academic advisor
and let them know your concerns so that they can help you plan best. Very cool that you want to be a
forensic psychologist! I took a forensic sciences class at SFU, which was super interesting. In
fact, a lot of my interest in criminology is because I used to watch Criminal Minds and CSI all the
time! I also love spending time outdoors and LOVE my dog. I love hiking! If you decide to go to the
University of Alberta, make sure you make your way to Banff and Jasper! Also, Keegan, I understand
that this program is voluntary for you. Would you like to set up a weekly schedule so that we can
check in with each other once a week? What day of the week is best for you? Also, please let me know
if there are certain conversations in the program that you want to make sure we cover! Talk to you
again soon.Mentee 2022-03-08, 21:59: Hi Kimberly! Sorry for the late reply, I've been super busy
with school. I think that putting together a day once a week would work best for me. For me
Wednesdays or Thursdays would work best, let me know which of those work better for you. Thanks,
KeeganMentor 2022-03-12, 14:12: Hi Keegan, sorry for my late reply! It has been a busy week for me
as well. Thursdays work for me! When you have a chance, please let me know which conversation you
would like to start with. I realize that you have Spring Break for the next two weeks, so no
pressure at all to get back to me while you're on your break. Feel free to get back to me once you
officially return to school. However, if you'd like to chat throughout the break, that's okay too!

subjects, it can be really tough to study something you don't enjoy (flashbacks from first-year
lol). And yes, the memorization part is not always fun. I did consider going abroad for school as
well but I didn't want to leave home too far so I stayed (also because the international tuition is
just insane) In terms of career, Zoologist if I'm going into research, I would say I'm very
people-oriented, and I want to help others and make positive changes in one's life, so I'm also
interested in career options such as a therapist, teacher, Occupational Therapy etc. Are you
referring profession to the biology degree? (sorry in advance if I got that wrong) In general, most
of my grades ranged from mid 80 to mid 90, I tried to find my transcript to have a closer look but
it's not where I think it is. As long as you are in the 90 range, there's a pretty good chance of
getting into UBC. I took all the required courses, like all the 10, 11, 12 of English, Biology,
Chemistry, Math (I did both the pre-cal and AP cal), Physic, BUT I didn't actually take physic 12
because I was lazy, later I had to pay 500 dollars just to take the equivalent course at UBC since
it was a pre-req for one required course, WHAT A PRICE TO PAY ;-; My humble advice is to take as
much science courses as you can, especially if you are planning to do a science degree. In our case,
I feel like the career consideration is a good place to start, I've unlocked the conversation and
you now have the access to the info. Just follow along with the instructions and you will be fine.
Same as always, if you got any questions just send them my way.Mentee 2022-03-03, 20:41: Good! How
have you been? sorry again for late response caught up with transcripts and work. Zoologist seems
really fun actually! Especially with your love for animals. Im also very people-oriented and thought
about becoming a teacher, therapist etc :) and international tuition is insane so I'll most likely
stay here. Sadly I wasn't able to get Chemistry this year not physics since both classes were full
both smesters. Hopefully I'll be able to take them next year, as well as biology too because jeez is
that expensive ;-; A little off topic but what is housing like there? I was just wondering what it
was like today and thought I'd ask :)Mentor 2022-03-03, 22:49: Hello Sammy, I've just laid back for
the whole week cus I'm still in vacation mode from reading week last week. I remember you mentioned
that you are also considering nurse so I figured we are similar lol. Speaking of nursing, I did
think about it as a career but I'm not very sure whether I'm suitable for the job. Exactly! And I
hope you can get into the classes :) No question is off-topic! For me, I lived on campus since my
first year so I can only speak to the residence fees, but I'm pretty sure the surrounding places are
also at similar levels. Right now the 2 bedroom apartment is around 1100 pre-month (not too crazy
but still ;-;). So essentially the rents across different residences largely depend on how old the
building is and also the room type. Here is a website where you can check the price for all of the
residences on the left bar: https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/applications/fees-payments/ Let the
question rolling! (JK ;D)Mentee 2022-03-08, 00:38: Hey faith, I did look into it and I'm most likely
still able to get the courses next year :D (Woo!) and what is reading week by the way? I was also
wondering what your classes are like? Such as learning, assignment, tests, labs etc? Seems a little
stressful at times from what I've heard. That isn't bad pricing but, gosh still hefty price to pay
;-;Mentor 2022-03-08, 20:53: Hello Sammy, good to hear from you! The reading week is like a spring
break, I heard that the ""reading"" part came from the school wanting all the students to use this
time for reading and learning on their own, but I don't think that's what most people use it for
lol. It usually happens around the midterm session so it's also called the midterm break, the dates
can change every year and it's about a week long. The structure of each course can be very different
from one another. As you can probably imagine, the science courses are heavy on concepts,
memorization (bio) and logic, most courses focus on exams quizzes and projects, some can require
paper. On average, a science course can contain textbook reading, 1-2 exams, multiple quizzes, 1-2
projects and or papers. Compared to other science, bio has a lot of labs, nearly every course I've
taken this year contain a lab (like 3 hours long), sometimes I envy the art people. Whereas the arts
focus mostly on comprehension and writing, the upper courses mark heavily on papers (like one paper
on every module). There are definitely expectations, but I hope this helped ;D Also, don't forget to
try out the conversation on career consideration, I remember doing the work bc quiz when I was in
high school and it did help me when comes to understanding myself better.Mentor 2022-03-19, 12:56:
Hello Sammy, this is your lovely mentor speaking ;D How's everything going? Haven't heard from you
for a while and I miss you already... Just want to touch base and see hows your days have
been?Mentee 2022-03-19, 22:47: So sorry I haven't been able to reply. My Gmail hasn't been working
properly :( I hope your doing well :) That does seem a little stressful ;-; but if your good with
time management and stuff you'd be alright? Why are your labs around 3 hours? Guess for being
thorough and examinition from the instructor. what are your projects like for bio? and I'll for sure
try them out :) I hope you have a good day or night depending on when you see thisMentor 2022-03-20,
19:15: Hello Sammy no worries! It's good to hear from you, how have you been this couple days? It
was definitely pretty stressful for the first year, but I guess you will just get use to the
workloads as time goes. I have 3 3-hours long labs a week for this term, you can definitely avoid
this by not taking so many lab courses together, I just needed the courses for requirements. But
yeah sometimes it can get pretty boring to sit in front of a microscopy for 3 hours :/ The projects
can vary from course to course, they can be very different in terms of content and style. For
example, animal behavior course will require you to observe a animal of choice and make a ethogram.
Most of the projects are usually involving group work, experiments, paper and presentation. (So
similar to high school stuffs)Mentee 2022-03-25, 14:24: Hey faith :) I've been alright, you? what do
you examine under the microscope? Selected slides or just varies from lab to lab? and that doesn't
seem horrible, but like you said can be stressful. I definitely thought it'd be different room high
school work not gonna lie. i also did take the quizzes :) suprsingly I got jeweller, and therapy and
assessment. The subjects quiz wouldn't load my answers sadly :(Mentor 2022-03-27, 02:14: Hello
Sammy! I'm doing fine, it's near the end of the term and soon the exams are coming up, so I'm
switching to survival mode ;-; Sad to say that I do have some pictures of the microscopes slides
which I took from classes, but I couldn't find a way to attach them here :( And you are right, the
contents do differ across courses indeed, you could be looking at completely different things in 2
courses, anything is possible ;) Those career choices sound cool! Do you think the results would
suit you? I remember that you mentioned you enjoyed helping people so therapy is a pretty good
match, no? Also, tell me when you are ready to move on to the next conversation! You already got
this far, such being the case, just get the most out of the program :DMentee 2022-03-27, 14:13:
That's good :) and oh gosh good luck ;-; that's gonna be stressful. and I do think therapist might
be a good choice since I do love being around people, helping them out in anyway possible and
knowing me I would get my stuff mixed up between 2 courses :') and yep I'm ready to move to the next
conversation :)",,"Mentor 2022-04-01, 01:40: I unlocked the conversation for post-secondary consideration! Now you can
follow the steps and explode various options XD I remember when I was in high school, I was confused
about my future and which path should I take. (not that I'm not confused right now :/) I'm sure you
already have a general plan about the route you are going to take, if you want you can share it here
and I might have some suggestions. Or if you have any questions on this topic just ask me, I might
also have some stories as well.Mentee 2022-04-03, 12:38: Not gonna lie I thought I had an idea but I
do not :') I mean I do have a rough two pathways/career ideas to head into first being A biology of
some sorts (I literally forgot the name typing this ) and second being X-ray technicianMentor
2022-04-06, 03:56: Was it a marine biologist if I remembered correctly? And I did consider X-ray
technician as a career as well! These 2 careers are very very different from one another, so there
are many things that need to take into account when choosing the future route, including the length
of the school, tuition, job availability and more. Thus I would recommend you to start searching
online or ask around when you feel troubled about what to choose.Mentee 2022-04-06, 21:04: I have
been looking into both career paths already, but most likely into school and tuition currently
because I've right now looked into what course and grades required for both :)Mentor 2022-04-07,
03:56: Hello Sammy, how's life? YES! Definitely look into how much each program from different
organizations costs! Not only the tuition but also consider the living expense as well! Thus you may
want to consider choosing a school or program based on the locations with lower rent or cheaper
lifestyle, you can also choose places near your home so you can save A LOT of rent. In terms of
courses and grades, in my opinion, as long as you do all the mandatory courses plus all sciences, I
don't think there would be any problem. Not like post secondary, where we have all these annoying
course pre-requiements that need to be fulfill before we can do anything :(Mentee 2022-04-12, 01:03:
God have classes been dumb ;-; anyways how've you been? Of course! I plan to look into close
schools, rent, tuitions and book fees etc (I know books can cost up to $500 ;-;) And hopefully I get
the course needed next and if not I'll argue with them about trying to get me in because I know ima
need those course if I wanna do they stuff I want",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-25, 18:32: Hello Sammy! How's everything? ;D This is Faith and I will be your mentor
(Yeaaah!) I am 21 years old and currently a third-year student studying Biology at UBC (bio people
wink wink). I’ve taken 6 courses during this winter term so far, a whole bunch of biology including
fish, moss, entomology diversity course plus some psychology as well. I know I know, I admit that I
am a huge animal lover, so this year was a lot of fun for me. I enjoy painting, reading and mobile
gaming in my free time! (I see we enjoy similar hobbies!) Do you want to do some extra intro about
yourself? (ex. what are you up to right now? or which classes are you taking?) Is there anything you
want me to know about you? Remember I’m here to support you throughout your time in the program so
if you have questions, just send them to me and I will try my best to answer them！Mentee 2022-02-28,
18:00: Hi Faith! :) sorry for such a late response I've been caught with a few classes. (I'm also
such a huge animal lover :) ) I am currently taking psychology ( Love it!), creative writing (Also
love it) and CLC :) I'm also currently doing volleyball as a extra sport to keep my mind occupied
(Video games as well) Have you studied larger animal species yet? Such as, Larger marine life, Land
( Lizards, snakes, etc) I'm really excited for this! :) I hope you have a great day :)Mentor
2022-03-01, 04:53: Hello Sammy, it was great to hear from you! Hehe it's nice to know you like
animals as well (shake hands), although sometimes they could be hard to memorize and study, they are
the reason why I choose Biology after all. I wish I took psychology back in high school, it wasn't
until the 2nd year that I discovered psychology and realized all the fun I was missing out on. I
enjoyed the freedom of creative writing, but English was not my strongest point (sigh). I've gone
over pretty much all the groups from invertebrates to vertebrates. In particular, I had the chance
to learn about the families and species of various birds (ex. Anatidae, Trochilidae, Tytonidae) and
fishes (ex. Agnathan, Chondrichthyes, teleosts), plus I had to memorize the different orders of
insects (ex. Diplura, Odonata, Orthoptera). There is a very cool course on horses that includes
behaviour, anatomy, physiology, reproduction, nutrition of the horse, as well as common disease
pathology, prevention and treatments. But I haven't had the chance to take it (yet) due to schedule
conflicts. Anyways I'll stop right there, where do you want to go for university? I would guess that
you want to do a marine biology degree? (that's a cool degree) Also, which conversation topics do
you want to begin with? Let me know if there are any questions！Mentee 2022-03-01, 13:11: Hey! I'm
most likely going to continue my psychology course into the final year, as well as creative writing
(really enjoy both, and luckily English is one of my stronger points) And jeez that's a load of
animals to remember. What is the career are you interested in persuing? Or ar you still questioning?
I was think of attending UBC for my university. I also looked into some in the states ( a little ehy
I choose states is so I'm a little closer to my bf :) ) but it'll be more expensive so I'll most
likely stick to UBC though because the prices. Anything works! I was wondering what classes and
grades you needed to get into your profession?",,,"Mentor 2022-04-14, 13:51: Hello Sammy, good to hear from you, I've been working on some projects
from classes the last few days and trying to organize my schedule for next week. So I can say I'm
pretty busy lately. It's definitely relatable that some parts of classes are interesting and
enjoyable, but somedays it just doesn't work and you have to push through them, so good luck and I'm
sure you are doing great ;D I had to buy a lot of textbooks during my first year and they cost a
fortune indeed, but later I learned that you can go for the secondhanded books which are way cheaper
than brand new ones, and you always have the option to sell those books with good conditions after
the course ends. However, I've noticed that some courses required students to have the latest vision
of the textbook, OR lab books and notebooks in which you have to write things, OR one of those
digital textbooks that come with a personalized code, in these cases you can't really sell the used
books so you are just stuck with them, at least these ones are not that expensive (usually around 20
to 30 dollars, mostly under 100). And I totally agree with you to speak with the staff if you need
anything, if you don't ask, you'll never get it. Lets goo! There are many things students should
consider for choosing postsecondary other than final aspects, please take a look at the lists from
this conversation and let me know if there is anything new for you or you have any questions with:
Location of the campus Size of the school – how many students, Faculty to undergrad ratio Residence
and housing options Funding opportunities Part-time work opportunities Extra-curricular options –
athletics, clubs, activities Language and study support offered – the English language learning
support School teams and “spirit” Social climate (balance between “party” school and serious study!)
Workload expectations Hands-on learning and/or co-op opportunities Libraries and places to study

your mentor for this term. A little intro about me is that I am currently in fourth-year student
studying biology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I really enjoy doing research
and have worked at 5 different labs including my co-op placement. I like doing both translational
and clinical research. Some of my hobbies include weight training/weightlifting and baking. I'd love
to know more about you. I have opened this module for us to start with. Please feel free to
introduce yourself and go through this first module. Let me know what your thoughts are and if you
have any questions. I'm looking forward to the discussion with you! :) Cheers, ChristineMentee
2022-03-07, 16:44: Hey Christine, I'm really looking forward to learn more about you this term. I've
heard Vancouver is a really nice place to live and attend university. I'm not completely set on
going to Victoria so I would love to hear more about living and the going to school in Vancouver.
I'm also very interested in biology because it'll also be a huge part on my schooling when I go to
university. I also enjoy weightlifting, I wasn't very serious with weightlifting until last semester
because I was in a pe fit class with older people and I was able to learn a lot about
weightlifting.Mentor 2022-03-14, 20:26: Hi Rebecca, Sorry for the late response! School has been a
bit tough recently, but I am still alive! I'm not too sure why I can't see our previous messages on
here, but I will still address your last message here. Vancouver is definitely a very nice place to
live, especially for a student. Unfortunately, the rent and living expenses are definitely
expensive. Although we are notoriously known for constant rain, it is truly beautiful when it's
sunny out here! Transportation is also generally very convenient. I'm lucky enough to have a car,
but I always took the bus before that and never really had an issue. As for your interest in
biology, are you taking any related courses right now? I think the classes you take in high school
can be a pretty good indicator of if you will enjoy it in university or not. That's so cool that you
also enjoy weightlifting! How is your experience so far? Personally, my strength comes and goes.
When I don't go to the gym consistently, my strength drops by a lot. With school, it has been really
hard for me to go as often but I am definitely trying my best. On the topic of this discussion,
going to the gym is the main way that I practice self-care. As I know that I will feel better after
each gym session, I try to balance it with school as a way for me to destress. However, time
management is usually an issue for me and it can be hard at times to prioritize self-care
activities. When I am short on time, I try to break down smaller activities such as buying snacks
that I like or watching youtube videos during my study breaks. What are some ways that you practice
self-care and is this something you prioritize often?Mentor 2022-04-05, 22:26: Hi Rebecca, I hope
you are doing well and had a relaxing break! I was wondering if you have gotten my previous message

questions I want to ask. How do you manage your time on a daily basis to balance both your school
and home life. I've noticed that when I put all my efforts into school, my mental health takes a
huge toll, and I would have very little motivation to foucs on myself. But on the flip side, if I
spend too much of my time by myself and basically foucsing on myself and the things I enjoy doing, I
wouldn't want to continue my daily routine of doing work. So I would really apperciated some tips on
how I could balance the two. Thank you :)Mentor 2022-03-09, 13:52: Hi Lisa, Thanks for the
questions. First off, this is also a work in progress for me too, I am glad to share some things I
found helpful. Reminders are wonderful. I stare at my screens for a long time every day, so having
an ""intrusive"" reminder (like a pop-up on my screen) or a sticky note telling me to take a break
from schoolwork is super duper important. It could be 20 seconds of mini-breaks and 10 mins of
actual break time to either do some exercises, step away from the computer, blink the eyes, etc. It
also tells me it's the end of a workday and it's time to do something else. Set your hours. Decide
how long you would work for each day/week. I use a list each day to figure out how to balance my
time (for school, chores, etc.) Most importantly, actually, putting down ""having a break"" or ""15
mins yoga"" down as a task can be helpful -- it makes me think to actually make time for these
activities. Secondly, don't forget you can always rely on apps (check settings to see if you can set
your availabilities, work hours, etc.) And truthfully, doing that can let others know that you're
done with work today, please contact me tomorrow. 😊 It's not always easy, and I'll admit (I tend to
postpone/skip my breaks), so I'm going to try not to do that. And when I do (postpone a break), I
make sure to follow through with my next break.Mentee 2022-03-17, 16:31: The other extension was the

medical scans or treatments that would benefit her patients. I think Dr. Caron's self-awareness of
how to treat a patient; being attentive to the patient's trust in her and in general, the healthcare
system. As well, Dr. Caron notes that is not always beneficial to share her background with a
non-indigenous patient since it may not be received positively nor would it optimize the care given.
What are your thoughts on Dr. Caron's experiences? It could be on how she provide care to her
patients or what your thoughts on the past encounter Dr. Caron had with a fellow surgeon.","Mentor 2022-02-25, 14:25: Hello Lisa, nice to meet you! I’m Rachel and I will be your mentor this
semester. During the fall, I find that going on walks helps me relax especially during the times
when assignments are piling up. I'm hoping to continue that habit soon (it feels too chilly this
winter to go on walks...but I just can't resist the sunshine!) I’m excited to be part of this
journey with you, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out through MentorCity.
I will respond usually in about 3 days (or less!) Have a great weekend, RachelMentor 2022-02-28,
18:51: Hi Lisa, Do you have any questions on how the program works? I'm happy to answer any of them.
I hope you stay dry this rainy week! ☔Mentee 2022-03-02, 12:59: Hi Rachel, it's nice to meet you
too! I'm sorry it took me so long to reply. I was trying to come up with ways I could reply to you.
Even now, I don't know what to say lol. I guess my main question is what we would be doing on this
program? Like, are we just exchanging messages?Mentee 2022-03-02, 13:19: Hi, again. So I was told to
try doing this icebreaker activity with you :) I don't have a picture to share with you, but I have
this picture of my little sister which I think is absolutely beautiful. She started ballet class and
wanted to show me what she learned in school. I took some picture of her dancing and she looked so
happy. And because I rarely get the chance to see her, that picture of her looking all happy and
dancing means a lot to me. I have this cinnamon bun recipe that I really love to make. The cinnamon
is easy to make, so I can easily make it anytime I want. It's very fluffy and soft to eat. The cream
cheese has to be my favourite part of the cinnamon bun. It's such a sweet and savoury flavour, I'm
obbsessed!Mentor 2022-03-02, 19:03: Hey Lisa, I agree, often, I'm grasping for words, but each
response is a practice -- so I'm sure we both will get better at it! I'm glad you asked the
question, you're right that we mainly would be sending one another messages here (through
Mentorcity). We usually would be responding to an activity prompt (from the anchor texts/video).
From there, we can decide on closing a module (they called it conversations), we move on to the
next. This also gives both of us a chance to share our thoughts (what we learned, what we
agree/disagree with, what we are curious about etc.) Hope this answers the question!Mentor
2022-03-02, 19:20: Also, thank you for sharing your favourite and memorable things, Lisa. The
cinnamon bun recipe you mentioned is making me hungry. And since I'm thinking about food right now,
I would say ice cream is my go-to comfort food. Currently, I'm in the mood for some nice ice-cream
mochi (mango-flavored ones are superb). I recommend you to try it out if you can. 🥭+ 🍦= 👍 Talk
soon!Mentee 2022-03-07, 16:34: hey Rachel, do you think you could open the self care and well being
assignment so I could work on it please? thank you!Mentor 2022-03-07, 16:36: Hey Lisa, Sure thing! I
was just about to ask which assignment you would like to work on. Great timing!",,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-09, 12:02: As part of the self-care and well being activity, I have to create a
self-care plan. So this is my list: Self care action How I will make it a part of my life being more
active Doing yoga for 20 minutes every morning spend more time with family Go join everyone in
living room instead of hiding in my room Meditate meditating for 10-20 minutes every morning to help
brighten my mood and calm my headMentor 2022-03-09, 14:06: Self-care action Meditation Stretch &amp;
take breaks throughout the workday Sleep earlier How will I make it part of my daily life Do
mindfulness practices/breathing exercises (6 mins or 15 mins) (I recommend doing this practice by
the Mayo Clinic) Set adequate break times (I use WorkRave to help with this when I am working on the
computer). Spend at least 30 mins away from the screens before bedtime (this one is a tough one)
(when I can't fall asleep, I prefer listening to this meditation practice for deep sleep)Mentor

we get to work together!Mentor 2022-03-03, 13:11: Nice to meet you! Thanks for your introduction :)
What kind of music do you write?? That is super cool that you do that, I've played the violin for
years but have never written my own music. Wish I could do that! I'm sorry to hear you've been so
exhausted, that sounds really hard. I know for myself, I find it hard to feel motivated and
productive when I'm exhausted, which definitely has a big impact on how I feel and my
day-to-day.Mentee 2022-03-03, 13:17: I write music with my computer using basic beats and making
them into a remix then I put my own singing on top of it. I've always wanted to try learning the
violin myself but I haven't been able to quite yet. So far I've been producing on Soundcloud but
they haven't got much attention yet and there is way too much auto-tune.Mentor 2022-03-05, 13:34:
Wow Kara that is super cool! Yeah violin is definitely a hard instrument to learn- I feel like it
takes at least a year to be able to play much so definitely not a very fast growth curve from my
experience. I'm going to unlock our first conversation about well-being. I'll send you another

„Drunk words are sober thoughts“ -most sane people I’ve just heard a lot of people say it and I
don’t know where it’s from but it’s something I live by. I think everyone should have the same
mindset. It is a great way to see how a person acts on the inside and actually thinks. Someone
getting mad or saying something to you while they are drunk they’ve probably had it on their mind
for a while. Foods for thought: I like to cook and bake a lot, but I just wanna show you my
favourite food ever, because its the best food you could possibly have. So sorry if you’re vegan or
vegetarian. As you may see, it is lasagna. My favourite food ever since I can remember. It’s just so
good. I don’t really have a reason as to why it’s my favourite. But every year for my birthday I ask
for lasagna for dinner and it’s just become a tradition by this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about music, kinda depends on the mood, the vibe, the people around me lol. i wouldnt ever listen to

transportation systems. I go to school in Vancouver but I live in Richmond (which if you dont know
is a smaller city just outside Vancouver). Getting to school (or even just getting around the city)
using public transportation is quite simple as there are many buses and skytrains. I am not sure if

trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city?
What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? How did you feel while

Toronto to study Kinesiology and play soccer. I graduated in 2020 and started working as a
recreation facilitator at a long term care home, and I'm now working on applying to medical schools.
I see you're interested in sports, so I'd love to chat more about that. I really enjoyed my

there any topics you are interested in discussing as we go along? Best, Anna (she/her)Mentee

we are going to focus on the importance of self-care and mental health. Self-care as a student is
sometimes really difficult to do because we get caught up with school work and extra-curricular's. I
remember during my grade 12 year I was so stressed out with college applications and
extra-curricular's because I wanted to make myself the best applicant possible so that I could get
into university. In the process, I stressed myself out and eventually took on so much in my last
year of high school that I rarely had time for myself. At the time I didn't think self-care was that
important but then I realized if I am not okay and in the right state of mind and I am not taking
care of myself, I won't have enough energy to even get through the day. Finding time in the day for
self-care can be challenging but it is necessary! Has there ever been a time when you felt
overwhelmed? How did you deal with it? How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make
self-care more difficult? I know for me personally, my transition to post-secondary was really
difficult because there was so much going on. It was a new environment with a new schedule and I had
to make lots of adjustments from my end as I had to develop new habits, work on my time management,
and find time in the day to care for myself. How good are you at taking care of the basics of
self-care: Getting adequate sleep? Eating healthy food? Drinking water? Regular physical activity?
Taking breaks from work? I would love to know how you participate in self-care, as you work through
this module please let me know if you have any questions :) I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

noticed you also love listening to music so I thought a great ice breaker for us would be a musical
interlude! The title of the song I will be sharing with you is called ""Youth"" by Shawn Mendes and

and did not deal with it in a great way! This is extremely relatable! Can you please tell me a
little more about what you did when you were overwhelmed? How did you deal with it? and what could

sometimes it helps me get away from my thoughts and almost ""escape."" Sometimes I think a song really
resonates with how I am feeling! Do you find listening to music helpful when you are overwhelmed? I
usually like to go on a walk and listen to music, is this something you do too? If not, how are you
getting your daily exercise? What does your daily routine look like? Do you usually get enough sleep
at night? Drink water? Eat healthy? To be quite honest, I struggle with getting a full night's
sleep, drinking enough water and even eating healthy sometimes! If this is you too, we can
definitely figure out a plan together! I hope you are enjoying your spring break :) Talk to you

break went well. Thank you for sharing your struggles with nicotine as I am sure you're trying your
absolute best to quit. Making the decision to quit is already big within itself. I am also glad to
hear you are getting the necessary help and seeing a drug counsellor. You can absolutely do whatever
you put your mind to! Did nicotine provide you with some relief from stress? Is there something else
you do instead of nicotine to relieve stress? I know you mentioned listening to music earlier on in
our conversation! Has listening to music been helpful in relieving your stress? Whenever you feel
you would like to move on to the next topic please let me know :) Talk to you soon! -SheetalMentee

activities to help relieve stress. Did you inform your counsellor of your relapse? Are they helping
you through the relapse? Talk to you soon! -SheetalMentee 2022-04-12, 17:04: Hey, thanks for the

(especially when it's during an exam week). But tbh, recently I've found that if I don't pressure
myself too much and actually try to keep a good balance, I end up doing much better on my tests too.

definitely things you are just gonna have to straight-up memorize (like vocab), but definitely try
redoing questions your teacher gave, and ultimately the best way to study is to actually create your
own questions (but let's just do one step at a time). Do you have any exams right after spring
break? Speaking of spring break, hope you are having a good time, and it's important to just relax

Reilly, Totally understandable! I felt like I would study and study and then for some reason
completely blank out on a test. Usually, I found those tests where I blanked out were when I would
study maybe the night before or maybe a few days and tried to memorize as much as possible. But,
unfortunately, for the most part, doesn't work too well for me. I've noticed though (and you'll hear
this a lot in university if you haven't already in high school), you should study to understand and
not memorize. Trust me I know it sounds easier said than done, but it'll definitely help you study
better! If you have any questions about the extension activity, please let me know. Or even if you
have questions about more studying tips, school, etc. let me know and I'd be happy to help. Hope you

Please read through the text above, watch the video, and then send me a message with your thoughts!
If your teacher would like you to do the Extension Activities, please take a look at those as well
(you can find them in the blue links at the bottom of the text). As a psychology student, I hear a
lot about the importance of self-care. There's a lot of research pointing to how beneficial and
necessary it is, but I still find it really hard sometimes. I'm not always great at gauging when I
need a break, so one of my goals right now is to pay more attention to signs telling me that I need
one. Back when I was skating, sometimes I would get stuck on a certain element and be unable to
figure out what was going wrong no matter how long I tried. I would usually start feeling drained
and frustrated with myself, and that often meant it was time to shift gears and focus on something
else for a while. Self-care on a daily basis is similar! We have to learn to tune into and respect
our own signs so that we can work to the best of our abilities. Have you noticed any signs in your
own life telling you that you might need some self-care? What do you do when you notice them?",,"Mentor 2022-02-18, 13:09: Hi Neela! My name is Sophie and I'll be your mentor for the next little

break i,ve been keeping busy with work and fixing my gokart. For work ive been working part time as
a dishwasher aswell as helping my dad and his freinds for truck parts, as for my gokart my dad and I
had to replace the axle from when my dad wiped out on it. While fixing itwe also found that during
the wipeout we cracked the frame, so im bringing it to school to repair and reinforce the broken
frame. I'll also be putting a basic rolecage on it to prevent any future injeries in the case of an

since we started messeging i relised its all been me me me. So I was wondering how you've been and
what you've been up to. Have you had any difficult assignments recently or any you greatly
dissliked. I also notised that in your profile it says you moved from an asian contry, if you
wouldnt mind could you elaberate, you don't need to answer if you find this question to
personal.Mentor 2022-04-11, 13:17: Hello Kenton. We can just work through the prompts for this
topic, but it looks like you are doing quite well with your hobbies and stuff. For myself, I'm just
finishing my courses and preparing for final exams right now, because final exams take place in
April in most post secondary institutions. My assignments are mostly very long essays. Assignments
in post-secondary science are boring but not too difficult (unless you are doing maybe math or
engineering or computer science stuff). And yes I moved from Hong Kong to Canada a few years ago and
I am happy to share more if you have any specific aspects you want to know more about. I would say
it is a very crowded city, maybe like downtown Vancouver or Toronto or even a bit denser than that.
People are colder and much more work oriented. They are very efficient because everyone seems to
only focus on their work at hand and more traditional goals. Since we're on the topic of self care,
i would say I brought over some of the study habits and discipline over which helped me survive my
courses right now, but overall very bad for your mental health if you only focus on studying and
getting good grades 24/7. Recognized this during Covid lockdown, I'm right now trying to change my
habits and take care of myself better, but it is much easier to build these habits when you're still
in high school and have more free time.",,"Mentor 2022-02-19, 13:35: Hello Kenton, nice to meet you! 😊 I am Horton and I will be your mentor.

anything and I will do my best to answer them.Mentee 2022-02-22, 16:47: Hey Horton,as you know my
name is Kenton and I am currently in grade 10 at Hope Secondary School. In my free time i enjoy
playing video games (mainly Fortnite, Minecraft or Snow runner) I also enjoy dirt biking or working
on my truck or go-kart with my dad. Im planning on getting my learners permit in April when i turn
16. When looking for post secondary education what things would you recommend i look out for or keep
an eye out for?Mentor 2022-02-24, 17:05: Dirt biking and working on your truck sounds like really
cool activities! When considering different options for post-secondary education, I would recommend
you to focus less on the brand name of the institution, and more on the reputation of specific
departments within the institution and job prospects. For example, I attended UBC and BCIT. BCIT has
no reputation at all outside of Vancouver or BC, but I learned the most useful things from there.
However, employers outside of BC may not even know what BCIT is, and may prefer a UBC graduate.
Meanwhile, despite what UBC or the marketing departments of other universities try to tell you about
their world ranking or something similar, employers care more about experience (which you can get
from programs like co-op, so definitely check if there is an engineering co-op program, how
reputable it is, how many connections with employers) and the specific department (you need the
right degree from the right university, e.g. the employers may prefer UBC graduates if you are in
computer science, but may prefer another university instead for law or business, take the overall
university ranking with a grain of salt and focus more on the reputation in a department or
discipline specific manner).Mentor 2022-02-24, 17:12: But ultimately, remember you need to push
yourself to succeed. Getting into a prestigeous university with co-op program does not mean you are
more preferred than maybe a lesser known university. The co-op program, or reputation, or other
things are only paths available to you. If you don't network or gain experience throughout your
degree, the name of the institution in the end won't matter.Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:34: Thank you for
your message, it was very insightful and I will keep your points in mind when looking for schools in

just curious :) Chat soon, JapnaamMentee 2022-04-08, 13:31: No, I've always had my heart set on
being a physiology or a lawyer but not so much a lawyer anymore because the classes at my school
don't interest me anymore.Mentor 2022-04-10, 19:01: Hi Kaitlynn, Being a physician is a great career
choice! It can be very rewarding. I used to think about becoming a lawyer too when I was in high
school, but I knew that my dream is to become a teacher so that what I will persue. I will open up
the next part of the career considerations module (part 2). I will also send you a message on there
right after this one. Best, Japnaam",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-03, 13:08: Hi Kaitlynn, I hope you are doing well, and enjoying the last two weeks of
school before spring break! What are your thoughts on these two questions about self-care: 1. What
role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? 2. How might the transition to
post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? These are my answers: 1. I feel that time
management plays a big role in self care. We all lead such busy lives where we don't have time to
practice self-care. I feel that making sure that you fit in time for self care is really important.
It should be a priority rather than just something you do when you have time. 2. The transition to
post secondary definitely makes self care more difficult. You have so much to do with all of the
time with the assignments, commute to campus, and any volunteering or jobs you are doing, it can be
a lot. I remember in my first year I had no time for self care, I was doing school work all day.
However, you really need to remember to take care of yourself because it can lead you to feeling
burnt out. I understand that it can be hard to make time, but it doesn't have to be something big,
even just taking out twenty minutes to go for a walk, read a book for ten minutes, make sure you
sleep on time, and simply a five minute call to one of your friends can make a big difference.
Towards the end of my first year I started to realize this and I began to workout every evening,
spent more time with my family and friends, and made sure I was sleeping enough. I know that it is
hard to manage everything, but we need to take care of ourselves. Trust me, you will do much better
in school when you are not feeling tired and burnt out due to lack of self care. I look forward to
hearing your insight on these questions! Best, JapnaamMentee 2022-03-17, 16:46: I finished the
module that you last sent can you please open the next one?","Mentor 2022-03-20, 18:06: Hi Kaitlynn, I have unlocked the confronting discrimination module for
you. I will send you questions to answer in the coming days with my responses. I hope you are
enjoying the modules so far. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. Best, JapnaamMentor
2022-04-01, 00:39: Hi Kaitlynn, I hope you are doing well and had a restful spring break. When you
have completed the confronting discrimination module, can you please answer these questions, and
send me your responses? I would love to have your insight. I think this module is very important as
it is an issue that people deal with in their daily lives. I personally believe that facing
discrimination makes a person stronger. It changes how you view the world around you. I feel that
the more we educate people about issues of inequality, the more people can make a difference. Here
are the questions I would like for you to answer after you watch the video in the module: 1. In what
ways have Dr. Nadine Caron’s experiences with discrimination shaped her as a doctor? 2. What do you
think of Dr. Caron’s response to the ignorant and hurtful comment her fellow surgeon made? Were you
surprised by what her other colleagues did? What would you have done if you had been in her position
in that moment? What would you have done if you had been one of her colleagues in that moment? 3.
Why do you think it took the surgeon so long to apologize? What makes it difficult to admit our
mistakes? Is it especially hard to admit when we do things that are hurtful and discriminatory?
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about this module, or anything else. I
am always happy to help! Chat soon, JapnaamMentee 2022-04-04, 12:19: 1.it pushed her to work harder
for indigenous people and stand up for them and do what others couldn't. 2. I wasn't surprised, not
saying anything is better than saying anything at all. I was a little surprised by everyone els'e
packing up though, usually no one will follow the indigenous peoples because of racism. I'm glad to
see she is respected at work and I'm glad her co-workers followed. I would of done the same. 3. I
think it took so long because he couldn't admit to him self that he was racist. Yes it is hard to
admit when you're wrong because people don't want to be wrong everyone always want to be
right.Mentor 2022-04-04, 15:27: Hi Kaitlynn, Thank you for your responses. I completely agree with
all of your answers. I really like how you pointed out in the third question that it can be
difficult to admit that we are wrong sometimes. I feel that often times people don't want to admit
their mistake, but it can really make a difference. Admitting your mistake and asking for
forgiveness can make a big difference. I will open up the next module for you. We will be moving on
to the career considerations module, which I think will be very fun and interesting! I will be
sending you a message in that module! Best, Japnaam","Mentor 2022-02-18, 18:50: Hi Kaitlyn! My name is Japnaam and I am your mentor! I am in my second
year of university majoring in sociology and minoring in psychology. I also really enjoy reading,
doing arts and crafts, and binge watching Netflix. My favourite book is ""Educated"" by Tara Westover,
because it is so suspenceful. One quote that I really like is: ""The only person you should strive to
be better than, is the person you were yesterday"" - Matty Mullins I really like this quote because I
feel that a lot of the time everyone keeps comparing themselves to others in their lives, and they
constantly feel like they have to be better than others. I feel like this quote shows that you
should just focus on improving yourself and growing, rather than keep trying to be better than other
people. Also, a public figure that I think I really look up to is Humble the Poet. He is a poet, but
writes poetry is simple language so that everyone can understand... especially people like me who
can't read poetry! I really admire how he is always writing about how to be happy within yourself in
life, which I think is really important. He is very positive, which is a trait I want in my life. I
am pretty positive most of the time, but sometimes I need an extra push. Humble the Poet's Instagram
posts really help me to be more positive. Enough about me, tell me a bit about you. I am really
looking forward to getting to know you! What are your hobbies and interests? Do you have a favourite
quote? Also, you can message me anytime, if you just want to talk, or have any questions about
university. I am always happy to help! Best, JapnaamMentee 2022-02-24, 11:41: Hi nice to meet you

2022-02-28, 18:21: Hi Kaitlynn, It is so nice to meet you. Becoming a therapist is a great career
choice! It will be a very fulfilling career. I have now opened up the well-being and self care
module. Best, Japnaam",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-04-10, 19:08: Hi Kaitlynn, While keeping your career consideration in mind, becoming a
physician, think about the questions listed above. You don't have to send me the answers to these
questions (but you can if you would like!). Please do send me a message if there is something cool
you would like to share about these questions, or anything related to your future career. You can
also shoot me a message if you want to discuss anything, such as problems you see, or something else
in your career. I have also pasted the questions here for you to view: Do I have a strong personal
interest in this type of work? While you may have more than one career path in your lifetime, a
career is an opportunity for thoughtful development of particular skills. Developing those skills
takes time and dedication – so you need to have a genuine personal interest in the work that will be
required. If you follow a career path because someone else wants it for you, or because you heard it
pays well, you may not have the passion you will need to persevere. Will this career allow me to
achieve the work/life balance I want? Remember that self care is an important part of being an
adult. On average, you want to be able to balance satisfying work with opportunities for social
connection, creative and physical activity, and simply enjoying your life. Will this career offer me
financial security? Yes, there needs to be more to career choice than money – but money is
definitely a consideration. At the end of the day, you will need to be able to pay your bills with
the salary you can earn from your chosen career. How much opportunity or job security does this
career path offer? Job security refers to the likelihood that there will be jobs available in this
career area – now and for the foreseeable future. You will need to think about – and research! –
whether there is a current and future need for the work you want to do. Where will I need to live to
pursue this career path? Work is often tied to place. Some career paths will require you to
relocate. Some will offer the opportunity to return to your original community. Whether you come or
go, it’s important to think about how location will factor into career decisions. After you go
through the questions, feel free to send me a message if you have any questions, or would just like
to chat about something related to education or career life! Chat soon, Japnaam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a paperboy at 12 and then got a part-time job at a grocery store around your age and worked there
for 4 years. Maybe we can work on making you a resume at some point if your interested and you can
apply to some places in your area. Looking on google maps there are many places within a short drive
from your school such as Walmart, Starbucks, Canadian Tire, Shoppers Drug Mart. I believe many of
these places require you to be 16 but if you have your resume ready you can apply right after your
birthday. I definitely relate when you say you have trouble getting things the first time. I'm a
slow learner as well. Regarding your first job, it can definitely be more stressful the first few
months but once you get the hang of it it becomes easy. If your having trouble with something there
is always a supervisor for you to ask and usually other staff members to help you out. As long as
you are reliable (show up on time) and try your best, any good manager will be patient and help you
learn. I looked into it and your teacher is requiring you to do the modules below (aka
conversations) and you have until May to do them. Let's start with “entering the job market”. I have
unlocked the conversation so go through the material and we can talk about it more and then we will
move to part 2. From Rural to Urban (plus extension activities) Entering the job market (plus
extension activities) Paying for school (plus extension activities)Mentee 2022-02-24, 17:32: Hello
Evan, I am wanting to start to work on my resume soon and start looking for a job that will hire me
at my age and that I am interested in. I have worked for my brother doing landscaping but that did
not require a resume as I was just working with him. I am a little worried about my slow learning
still but im sure it will work itself out. I could turn in a resume after i turn 16 and get a job at
that time but my mom really wants me to get a job soon.Mentor 2022-02-27, 13:21: Landscaping is a
great thing to put on your first resume. It's also a pretty good first job in that it usually pays
really well because it's hard work. One of my friends who is graduating from university with me
would landscape all summer and make a bunch of money and then wouldn't have to work during the
school year so he could focus on school. Since it's your first resume and you won't have a lot of
work experience also put things like any volunteer activities or other extracurriculars. Basically
put anything that shows you are a hard-working, dedicated, dependable person. If your resume is good
you will get called in for interviews ahead of others who applied for a job which greatly increases
your chances of getting the job. There are lots of resume templates and examples you can find online
to help you out. Let me know when you are done with part one of ""entering the job market"" and I will
unlock part 2.Mentee 2022-03-04, 15:29: Hello Evan, I am starting soon on a resume and am going to
try to apply at the new wendys that is just about to be finished building. I am also going back to
kamloops with my brother this summer to do more landscaping and drive around delivering trailers for
his trailer renting business. I would like to unlock the second part unless you think that we should

something else. I understand that and don't want to waste your time. Please let me know if there are
certain modules/topics that would be useful to you and we can start there. Also, feel free to ask me
any specific questions you have at any time.Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:06: Hello, even though this is a
mandatory course this isnt your fault so I will put effort into this part of the course as this is
one of your occupations and I feel it would be wrong to give you the cold shoulder. I would rather
put effort into this than wasting your time. I am not sure where we should start, I did not pay much
attention when this website was shown to me. I would like to get a job but I not sure what

job interviews and let me know if you have any questions. I can recall doing three job interviews in
my life and have got the job on all of them. Some tips I have are below. After this, we can move on
to the extension activity of making a resume which you may have already made some progress on. 1)
Don't just repeat what's already on your resume during the interview. They have already looked at it
by the time they interview you. Use the opportunity to expand on your previous experiences and tell
them something different. 2) If you are asked a question you don't know how to answer, take a second
and think about it. You don't need to respond as soon as they start talking. By doing this you show
maturity and that you are giving a genuine response. If you really don't know what to say you can
say ""I need to think about that question more, can I follow up with you later?"" 3) It's likely that
you have all the qualifications necessary for the job if you are getting interviewed. The interview
is largely to see what kind of person you are, so try to be friendly, relaxed and personable.Mentee

definitely been busy, but good nonetheless. How are your courses coming along along - what kinda
courses are you tackling this semester? 😊 Also, I have made the studying tab open for access! Sorry

enjoyed the videos from our first official conversation together. I am curious, how do you choose to
study, and do you find success in the way that you do? I noticed that you recommended this topic
first because you would like to discover ways to study, and I think that's awesome. I think you
never really stop learning how to study and what works best for you since we're always striving to
improve how to better retain information and recall it on tests and assignments. :) Here are some
really cool ways I wanted to point out from the videos on ways to study and pointers on how to study
well and effectively. 1. Spaced studying - Leaving 1-3 days in between studying different topics. 2.
Going back to previous topics studied frequently. 3. Drawing connections with your notes, asking
yourself questions, and explaining concepts and ideas to yourself. 4. Using examples, apply your
knowledge to real-life examples. 5. Using visuals to understand more difficult topics with multiple
steps or concepts. 5. Consistently practice recalling information and highlighting what you do not
know so you can try to focus on those over what you already know. 6. Make yourself practice tests
and scribble on a blank piece of paper what you already know. From some of the bullet points that I
have mentioned - what stands out to you in terms of (1) what you already do and (2) what you might
consider trying? Let me know what you think! I would love to hear some tips that you have possible,
and I can also share to you how I study as well! Have an awesome week and weekend, Hollis!

told Juliet which modules to work on, are you able to open those up?Mentor 2022-02-28, 17:14: Hey
Hararjun, Juliet is the coordinator of this project and I do not communicate directly with her about
individual mentors. You have to tell me which modules: A) Your teacher requires B) Any others that
interest you (Not mandatory) Once you let me know A) and B), we can begin. I can also only open one
module at a time so you decide the order in which you approach them. As always I am happy you help
you along and give you insight on the activities that you choose to complete but I just need to know
from you what you want to do. Cheers, KostaMentee 2022-04-04, 12:27: Words to live by, “He who is

anchor text for this module. I was just watching the video in the anchor text and the idea that
stood out the most to me was the first one by Mina Shum. I totally agree with her that eveything we
do has intentions- sometimes we are aware of them and sometimes we are not. Nonetheless, I believe
not everything is planned by us! You might have noticed that you had a plan A but actually ended up
with B which, indeed, proved more fulfilling in the future! But, this understanding that what I'm
doing is intentional will help you motivate yourself in college. I have this sticky note on my study
desk that says 'you're doing what you love.' This reminds me that I have always wanted to be where I
am today and what I'm learning today so everytime I get exhausted/ tired by all the studying I read
this and tell myself how grateful I am for all this. But, sometimes flowing with the time is the
best idea you know. Can you think of some time in your life when you thought the sitution was worse
and was never going to improve, but it actually all settled down in the end!? When we through a
pebble in a pond, the mud at the bottom of it comes up and we can no longer see the bottom of pond
because of this mud strom. Slowly and gradually the mud settles and we can again see the bottom! You
will face this situation many times in college. Like, you'll have a ton of work to cover but you'll
feel that nothing is getting completed! You'll be exhausted! But, we can deal with it in two ways,
first calm yourself down- think it's just the mud and will settle with time. Second, change your way
of studying, if you're making mindmaps for all the concepts (which is amazing!), make for only the
important ideas and focus on reading other notes over and over again. We can keep ourself flexible
in college to adjust according to needs. It's okay to struggle but we sometimes need to just wait
and change our approach. I know I went a little off-track but I want you to know that what works for
you might not work for your friends and what works for your friends might not help you! So, stay
aware about how you are progressing and when you do well in college so that you master the skill of
getting into your creative self faster than ever! You will have very very unproductive and
uncreative times when you just can't think something amazing as much as you try and That's okay too!
We don't need to take hard paths to do achieve something extraordinary when we have easy ones too.
Take some rest and pick up your work again after a short break! It took you long time read I know!!!
But I hope you found something helpful from my experience. Nonetheless, only you yourself can
understand what is best for you and I'm here to help you find that. Please share what stood out the
most to you and any other comments you have from my response. I'm so looking forward to hearnig from
you and knowing your ways of going into your creativity!! Let me know if you have any questions.
Have a great rest of the week!Mentee 2022-03-09, 12:04: Hi Kushman, I just finished the module. I
think that we do all have our own intentions and knowing what they are is found along our journeys.
I feel really inspired and ready to start a new creative process. If I apply this to my future I'd
get a lot more done a lot quicker. I'd stay motivated and stick to my goals. Can you please open the
next module when you get a chance?Mentor 2022-03-09, 13:55: Hi Chantel I'm so happy to hear that
you're excited for your future creative projects! I'm sure you'll do amazing because I see a spark
of willingness and desire in you! Please let me know which module you wish to explore next! Have a
great dayMentee 2022-03-11, 15:15: I'd like to explore self care","Mentor 2022-03-29, 23:27: Hi Chantel I hope you are doing well. Please let me know if you need any
help or extra time for working on this mentoring relationship. Since I did not hear from you for
more than a week I have unlocked the career considerations module. You may now start working on it
whenever you get time. I'm looking forward to hearing from soon! All the best for the finals
season!Mentee 2022-04-04, 12:25: For the first quiz I got Assemblers and inspectors, electrical
appliance, apparatus and equipment manufacturing. On the second quiz I got Financial sales
representative. On the last quiz I got Producers, directors, choreographers and related occupations.
These are careers I wasn't expecting to get at all but I'm not unhappy with the results.Mentor
2022-04-08, 01:31: Great! These all sound super interesting and diverse! Do you plan on pursuing any
of these? For the carrer choice I would say, take it slow. You never know what is going to interest
you soon, so never fixate yourself. Stay flexible and open to experiencing in college. Before coming
to my school, I was pretty sure about a Psychology major (which I am still..maybe), but I'm getting
a chance to explore a lot more here. I have always been intrigued by paleontology and dinosaurs but
I left this consideration in high school because of lack of resources. But here, I'm actually seeing
potential in it. So, the best way to see what you like is notice how excited you get when you study
that particular subject. I know everyone you met must have told you this excitment factor but,
indeed, it is true and works! Something equally important is talking about your considerations with
professionals. Make sure to see your academic, career, and wellness advisors every now and then in
college. Trust me, they are a great great help! They will help you design your path for your goals.
Lastly, take it easy! don't stress out about not being able to decide what you want. Journaling, as
you already do it, would make this decision a lot easier for you. One thing I like doing is making a
plus-minus list- left side of page for plus and right for minus. Next, right down all the points for
plus and minus as you evaluate, and you'll get a very clear picture of what you wish to do! Let me
know if you wish to know anything else about these resources or what univerity looks like with an
undeclared major! Also, let me know which module you want to do next if you wish ending this one
her. Good night!",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-12, 21:48: Hi Chantel! I have unlocked the well-being and self-care module. You may
now start working on. I'll message you again with my thoughts about this module after weekend. Hope
you have a fun and relaxing weekend.Mentee 2022-03-15, 13:05: Self-care for me doesn't come easy.
however I did just start keeping a journal to collect my thoughts at the end of the day. This has
been very helpful for me. Another thing that I struggle with is time management. To help manage my
time I got a scheduling app. This let me set aside time for myself and my other responsibilities.
One of my responsibilities is making sure I graduate with good marks. I found out that I can
graduate early with the help of my school counsiller. After I graduate I plan to take a lot better
care of myself and possibly start my small crochet business.Mentor 2022-03-20, 18:30: Hi Chantel I'm
happy to hear that you worry about your self-care and do take actions for your well-being. You are
already one step ahead in being aware, monitoring and managing yourself! Keeping a journel is one of
the best techniques of collecting your thoughts! I have also been keeping a journel for years and
sometimes looking at the old ones help me know the progress that I have made so far. However, I want
you to make sure you conitnue doing it throughout your college as well. You will might just want to
crash at the end of the day but make sure you find time for your journel- atleast at the weekends if
not daily. For the time management, keeping an app is very very smart and helpful! There is
something that I do to get most time in day for my work- I have fixed my wake up time. Fixing your
wakeup time (weekdays) will slowly and gradually train your brain to get the sleep you need in
however less time you have. So, if you fix your wakeup time at 7 am, your brain will try and get the
full required rest even if you sleep at say, 1am. This will save ""i need to sleep more"" time of your
life. However, make sure you give yourself time to sleep extra on weekends to freshen up! Having fun
at college and exploring every possible activity is essential but putting your best efforts in
studying is more important. Only grades are not what matters rather, study for every test in a way
that you don't regret you were underprepared after it's done. To save your time, make your notes in
a way that revision takes less and less time as you go through it. It's amazing to hear that!! all
the best for your crochet shop! I'm sure you'll do amazing and I will be one of your early
customers! (Also I'm trying to send you a study technique but I have it in a picture format. Hope
I'll figure out how to share it here soon)Mentor 2022-03-20, 18:30: I forgot to add, Which module do
you want to do next?",,"Mentor 2022-02-18, 23:50: Hi Chantel! Hope you're staying safe. Sorry for contacting you a little
late, I had my midterms going on actually. How have you been? I'm Khushman, you mentor for this
current eMentorship relationship. I'm a first-year university student and have lived in a rural

Philosophy so if you are interested in these subjects feel free to ask tons of questions! I'm an
ambiverst person who loves nature and being outside- all types of animals and plants give me joy. I
also enjoy public speaking and love spending a lot of time with myself and my thoughts (big irony i
know haha). I like singing and reading books as well but I mostly end up procrastinating :( (But
let's together try getting over procrastination this semester!) That was about me. And I'm looking
forward to knowing you too a bit more. Feel free to take aid of ice breaker activity for your
introduction ig you want. Good night! KhushmanMentee 2022-02-24, 11:45: Hi my name is Chantel. here

you! Eveything is possible if we're willing to achieve it. I also love mashed potatoes but I
normally add some indian spices to it as well! I was looking at your profile lately and even I love
crochet! I make wall-hangings, round hanky kind of thing to cover stuff and sometimes borders on my
embroidery work with crochet. What do you like to make with it? Also, let me know which module you
want to start first so that I can unlock it for us to explore together. Have a great weekend!Mentee

Chantel My weekend was great! Thanks for asking. That's amazing. If you ever get a chance of sharing
a picture of your crochet work I'd love seeing it. For the next part of this program, we have
options for the modules that we wish to begin with. When you scroll up to the top of this page
you'll see a bubble with different text like studying, well being &amp; self-care, etc. These are
different modules/ topics for us to talk about. Have a look at all of these and let me know which
you're most concerned about and want to discuss first. I'll unlock that module and we can together

you remember this program exists! :P",,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 17:53: Hello and welcome to the program!!! My name is Challen (they/them
pronouns) and it seems I'll be your mysterious mentor from the far reaches of the universe this
term! :D I've noted that you use he/they pronouns as per your profile, but in terms of names, I
always like to ask just because we've had trouble with registration in the past -- do you go by the
name attached to your profile or would you prefer I use another? Human-wise, a little bit about me:
I'm a fourth-generation settler Canadian (mostly English with some Ukranian background mixed in),
going on 24 years old next month. I grew up in BC on Vancouver Island in mix of semi-rural and urban
settings, completed my English BA at Vancouver Island University a year or two back (luckily without
student loans!), and now I'm currently an English Masters student way out at the University of
Saskatchewan, existing academically in the nerdiest way possible by writing a thesis on the
mythology in the modern TV reboot of Battlestar Galactica (dreams really do come true, haha). Though
gaming-wise, I'm not as active as I used to be -- used to be quite into Pokemon, Zelda, and Portal 2
on that front -- I'm big into fan-art (as well as original!) these days and spend a lot of my spare
time working on a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky fan-comic (as well as drawing Fakemon
concept art for an upcoming Pokemon ROM-hack... don't tell Nintendo, lol). I also like to paint,
play piano, pluck at guitar in a very vague sense that I can't yet call playing, and to read...
which is good, because being an MA student in the English discipline is 75% reading books. Also,
super cool to hear you specifically reached out for an LGBT+ mentor -- I'm both non-binary and
pansexual and am happy to say that Existing While Queer(c) in the university sphere is an
increasingly welcoming prospect, at least at USask (though admittedly we're still in the works in
terms of moving past ""visibility"" to ""understanding what being an enby actually means"" sometimes,
lmao). All in all, I'd like to say I'm doing pretty well in life these days; I got diagnosed with
ADHD last semester in the first term of my Masters studies and admittedly it's set me back a bit in
terms of organization and time management (as I'm sure some of my earlier mentees can unfortunately
attest QwQ) but I'm getting better at it every day and medication helps a ton. It is a Life(c) over
here. What does your existence look like? What drives you to look into Social Studies in particular?
What sort of hobbies fill your spare moments? What brings you Happiness(c)? In terms of the program
itself, please do let me know if you have any questions; your teacher's asked us to do the units on
Well-Being and Self Care, Confronting Discrimination, Career Considerations, and Post-Secondary
Considerations by June 24th, but beyond those perameters we can do any other material you want or
just chat about general life advice if there's anything you're curious about in terms of... well,
everything but taxes, which I still don't understand myself. :') Once you've familiarized yourself
with the site, just lemme know where you wanna start and I'll open the first unit!!!Mentee
2022-02-22, 17:02: hii, i do not use the name attached to my profile, i actually use Max!! thank you
for asking! my existence is mostly contained to my house and the internet lol. My most recent hobby
is playing Genshin Impact! I've actually just finished all of the main quest line (that is currently
available) The interest in social studies is mostly because its always been my most interesting
class lol I've almost always had really good socials teachers so it really fuelled my interest! i
also really like looking at history (and judging it lol) its really cool to see how far we've come.
at the moment I'm not entirely sure what brings me happiness as I've been having a difficult time
mentally, with that it mind do you think we could start with the unit on well-being and self care?
as i think it will be the most impactful on me currently! toodles~Mentor 2022-02-22, 18:55: Ayy, no
worries! I've heard of Genshin Impact but never got the chance to play it (though I recently burned
through Pokemon: Legends Arceus, so I'm not entirely lacking in video game time), and as for Social
Studies, it was never my Absolute Best Mark Ever(c), but I definitely found it interesting to learn
(and, yes, also to judge!). And hey, no judgement on not knowing what brings you happiness --
sometimes the best answer we've got is ""idk but I'm gonna keep sitting here and plugging away at
this thing called life until I figure it out"" and THAT is perhaps one of the most empowering lessons
I've ever learned... that no matter where you're at, you'll be OK as long as you keep trucking along
with it. With that in mind, we'll carry on over to the self-care unit and see if it holds any good
strategies for making that purgatorial wait-period-to-happiness any shorter or easier, eh? :')Mentor
2022-03-14, 14:34: Your class people asked me to poke you again and also open up a second unit in

off like 4 hrs to watch it :))) I've opened up the Job Market module for us! Anchor text 1 is a
great read to learn about what skills are necessary in the workplace and how to shape your resume!
Personally, I think the three most imporant categories of skill I have developed (and still am
developing!) are communication, being a team player and being dependable. Entering the job market
can be stressful and scary, but it always helps in creating and distributing your resume if you can
think of what skills you have to contribute. What are some transferable skills from the article that
you may have expereince with? Janaki P.S I recently re-discovered Cough Syrup by Young the Giant

opened the Rural to Urban module for us :D I've lived in urban areas most of my life so my
expereinces with rural living is quite limited. Just like with rural there are many pros and cons to
city living...such as more job/school opportunities but higher costs of living, and variety of
places to visit but higher crime rates. Have you also noticed such a balance of pros and cons living
in your area? I'd love to hear your thoughts on the three anchor text 1 questions!! JanakiMentee
2022-03-07, 14:22: I've lived in both rural and urban areas. Where I'm at right now, it is very calm
and mainly quiet on weekdays, not much happens. Since there's a lack of... noise, it is usually very
quiet and you can get a good nights sleep much easier than living in a loud city. Everything is also
a little close to eachother if you're used to walking, so it's nice being able to take a five minute
walk up to Quality Foods. I cannot think of any other good reasons, but no one really likes the
smell in a part of the town. There's a paper (?) mill there and it makes everything around it smell
like crap sometimes, especially in the summer. Things also tend to close earlier in towns, like
4-5pm early. Because of that, there isn't much to do unless it's Tuesday movie night and there's a
good movie at the theatre. Did you find it harder to socialize in a urban area?Mentor 2022-03-08,
03:33: Hi Marie! Good nights' rests because of the lack of noise is for sure a pro (and something I
would love to experience)! I think that it is only slightly harder to socialize in urban areas
(especially if you go to a commuter university-- which is bascially when most of the students live
off-campus) because everyone is so caught up in their daily lives/tasks...BUT I also think that once
you start socializing and conversing, people tend to be quite non-judgemental, easy going and
friendly!! My high school was relatively small, so going to a university with a large student
population was definitely a big change for me...I wonder what you think are the biggest challenges
(and benefits) you might face if you go university in an urban area?? (Feel free to ask me any
questions you have about going to an urban uni :D) Janaki P.S. I've been obsessed with The Child is
Gone by Fiona Apple this week (I feel like it's def one of her underrated songs)Mentee 2022-03-08,
14:28: That's fair enough. I'd definately have a very hard time socializing. I find it hard to
socialize if I don't have a friend with me or if there isn't a totally nice extroverted person in
the room. I want to go to a good university, so I feel that it's expected that I go to one in a
urbanated area (especially because I want to go into a trade at the moment). How hard was it to
socialize at first? Do you think people are more friendly in university? P.S Since you gave an
amazing recommendation I thought I'd give one too! I've been listening to Left Alone by Fiona lately
because I really like the instruments in it :)Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:06: HI! I want to give another
recommendation because I've been listening to it a lot recently, try listening to The Great Escape
by Blur. It's probably their best album out of all of them imo :)Mentor 2022-03-12, 01:37: Hi Marie!
I LOVE the recommendations you gave me!! I didn't get the chance to listen to the full Blur album
but so far my favorite song is Fade Away :) I realized that, similar to me, most of the students'
friends went to a different university than them, so it felt like everyone was eager and happy to
talk to each other...I find that's the best part about university--in high school, it's mostly
awkward to talk to people you don't know but in uni, people don't mind at all!! I also get what
you're saying about needing to go to an urban setting in order to get the trade education you
want...I'm not going to lie, it may be a bit challenging at first to get used to some of the changes
of urban living (such as costs, increased public, housing etc.), but I think you might end up
appreciating both, rural and urban living, after a while :D One of the pros of having lots of public
around is that there are also lots of resources available to guide you...for example, my university
offers counselling, career etc. services to students which is helpful. Janaki PS. I hope you have a
great spring break!!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 13:46: Hi Marie!! I just wanted to introduce myself as your mentor till May :D My

after meeting so many people in university, I'm still like that sometimes lol Do you have any
favorite musicians in the British pop/classic rock genre? I haven't listened to British rock a lot
yet, so I'd love some recommendations! I noticed you also like to write sometimes! I've recently
gotten into screenwriting which is quite fun...is there a certain type of writing you prefer to do?

Janaki, I'm sorry for responding so late. My name's Marie, and i signed up for this program for
Career Life Education 10. My favourite british bands at the moment are Blur, The Smiths, and
Gorillaz. I did mention I liked writing, but I find I'm pretty bad at it. So I usually only write
little diary logs from time to time. By the way, do you have any music recommendations? I'm always
looking for new music to listen to!Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:23: Hi Janaki! Just checking up :) I don't

weekend :) (No worries for late responses, I know how busy you must be!!) Thanks for the bands
suggestions!! I'll definitely check them out. Currently, I've been listening to a lot of alternative
pop music (so lots of Lana del Rey, Kimbra, Fiona Apple and any other singers spotify suggests to me
lol). I've also gotten into latin music (it's especially fun to listen to on sunny days)...it's a
bit different from British pop but I think you might like how energetic it is! (If you ever come
across music that you think is great, please don't hesitate to share!! I love listening to new
artists). From my understanding these are the modules you have been assigned to complete: Rural to
Urban (plus extension activities), Entering the job market (plus extension activities), and Paying
for school (plus extension activities)...is there a particular one you would like to start first? :D

pick a module that you want to work on from your assigned list. Then I will open it for you on this

activities, which you will complete on your own, but can also ask for any help you need from me!!).

Urban if that's ok?",,,,"Mentor 2022-04-01, 00:00: Hi Marie!! I hope you had an awesome spring break :D I was thinking that
we could move onto Anchor Text 2 of this module this week...how does that sound? I would love to
know your thoughts on the Mobilize movie! Did you relate to any specific aspects of it? Janaki
:PMentee 2022-04-01, 12:44: Hi Janaki! I had a great spring break!! I actually had to cut a few days
off because my mom took me skiing and tubing at the mountains. I got a cold from it so I'm just
getting back to school today. I missed the movie whenever it happened so I'll probably have to watch
it on my own time. Moving on sounds great! Also have you finished listening to The Great Escape yet?
:oMentee 2022-04-01, 12:52: I'm just reading through the anchor text for part two right now, and
it's my bad I thought it was for school. I mean, it kind of is but I think you get my point. I will
still have to watch it on my own time though. I don't have headphones and I don't think I can play
it in class without them, but I promise I'll try get to it sometime today!Mentor 2022-04-01, 14:03:
Hey!! Yeah, I finished it a few days ago--this album is definitely underrated, thanks for
recommending it!! I think He Thought of Cars might be my new favorite song on the album :) And no
worries, I know how busy and hectic things can get right after spring break, so take as much time as
you need! Let me know if you have any questions along the way. Janaki :DMentee 2022-04-07, 13:30: Hi
Janaki! Sorry for not writing back, I've finished watching Mobilize and if I'm being fairly honest
didn't get what it was trying to reach at all (nor did I think it was going to be that short).
However, I realized there were native influences in it, and I can't tell if there was a small
residential schoool reference in it or not. It reminds me of one of those weird indie films that no
one gets the plot of and only watches for the cinematography. Similar to how I felt about the movie
My Own Private Idaho.Mentor 2022-04-08, 03:06: Hi Marie! I'm a Keanu Reeves fan but I haven't even
heard of My Own Private Idaho (i'll definitely check it out to see if its as weird as you say it is
LOL... The Lighthouse and Tenet are also weird movies :P). I thought the movie was trying to show
the differences in settings while living in rural vs urban areas (for ex. the abundance of nature in
rural areas, while urban areas are lined with trains, shops etc.). What do you think? I for sure
agree with you that the director left the audience A LOT to interpret because how open and abstract
it seemed! ____________________________________ Also, my understanding is that your teacher has
required you to also complete the extension activities for the modules...so I've gone ahead and
opened that up for you for this module! I will also open up the survey for us after you're done! As
always, let me know if you need any help or anything!! I hope you have a great rest of the week :D
JanakiMentee 2022-04-08, 13:13: MOPI is such a classic, even if it seems a little strange on the
first watch. Also I've been meaning to watch The Lighthouse for such a long time now but I keep
putting it off to watch something else, is it good? That's such a good interpretation (it didn't
even cross my mind). It makes much more sense when you look at it that way, there's a lot less
confusion. It would help if there were some vocals or something along those lines, but I guess you
gotta work with what you got! I don't think I'll need help today, but I'll start working on the
extension activities when I can!Mentee 2022-04-12, 14:09: Hi Janaki! I think I finished the ext.
activitites, and now I don't know what to do! Also I watched the first Scream movie last night and
it was SO GOOD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-04-12, 14:49: Hey Marie! You are reminding me of so many movies I need to catch up on!
I'm not the biggest horror movie fan but Scream has been on watch list forever :)) I recently
watched Interstellar again and I can't get over its soundtrack! Awesome job on completing the
extension activities, lets complete the survey called ""Complete conversation"" (I've opened it up for
us), and move on to the next module! Would you like to do the entering the job market or paying for
school module next? Janaki :)Mentee 2022-04-13, 13:48: Intersellar is such a good movie I wish I had
the time to watch it again. I usually can't sit through overly long movies, but it was so
interesting. The soundtrack is so cool! entering the job market sounds ok, so let's do that!",

navigate to the section and begin the activities, that'll be great. For some conversations, it's
asked that mentees start first such as the urban/rural conversation.Mentee 2022-03-02, 17:35:
Question 1] {Somewhat like rural because i can walk places faster becuase its a tiny town} {Always
something interesting because some of the Beachs} {Small amount of traffic because no one lives
there.} Question 2] I dont like it because there isnt too much like malls. No good shopping like for
food or for clothes. I also dont like it because when we moved into a bad part of the town and
fighting always happens Question 3] Whats it like moving to a big city? i lived in victoria for 11
years but i have never been to a huge city like Vancover or Toronto.Mentor 2022-03-04, 12:27: Those
are good points. I've lived in a big city all my life but I lived on the outskirts for numerous
years. Although everything was only a bus ride away, the town felt more isolated because there was
only housing around. I definitely liked the peace and quiet. It was easy to meet up with friends as
well since we were all so close to each other. Finally, as you said, the lack of traffic was
definitely great. I moved years back to a busier city and there's constant noise going on. I never
had experience with fighting in my neighbourhood. That must've been scary. The lack of malls and
entertainment got to me though. Also, when I got a job, having to bus 45 min for every shift was
really annoying. I've only gone to Victoria once! I'd love to go back. Is there anything I should
definitely check out there?",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-12, 00:30: Hi! Nice to finally meet you :) My name is Lisa and I'll be your mentor
for the next few months. I'm a student at UBC studying English Literature and Language. I see on
your profile that you like playing games as well! Do you have a favourite game or a genre that you
prefer? Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be more than happy to answer!! Some other things
about meee - my fav food has to be poke rn which is basically like sushi in a bowl lol. Honestly, I
really like raw fish and rice so the poke bowl is like one huge sushi on rice. Ahah but I understand
why most people don't like sushi. The texture can freak people out. My friends aren't that open to
""interesting"" foods but how about you? Weirdest thing you've ever had or want to try? A quote that I
really like is from J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""It matters not what
someone is born, but what they grow to be"". I think it's important to remember that our fate is
within our hands. As we grow, it's up to us to make the decisions best for us. Culturally, I was
born in a household where emotions were seen as a weakness and, looking at this quote, I know that
I'm not bound by my birth. Or, at least, that's my take on it. What do you think?Mentee 2022-02-22,
17:24: Thanks lisa For reponding back , the Crazier Food i have ate was Bear and i didnt really like
it to be honest but i do like some kinds of sushi. i hope you respond back and im glad to say you
are my mentor.Mentor 2022-02-23, 23:41: Hi Jonathan! Bear sounds really interesting. I'd definitely
give it a try though I'm not sure if I'd actually like it! Looks like your teacher wants us to do
the following conversations: From Rural to Urban (plus extension activities) Entering the job market
(plus extension activities) and Paying for school (plus extension activities) I'll go ahead and
unlock the first one and we can start that together :) If we do finish everything in time, we can
always do any other conversations that you're interested in.Mentee 2022-02-28, 17:45: Hi lisa nice
to hear from you again. i would like to choose the ubran/rural",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-04, 12:30: Now we're on to part two! Feel free to share your answers when you get a
chance and we can start discussing :). No worries if you can't think of anything meaningful - that's
why we do discussions :D Just send whatever comes to mind. Hope to hear from you soon,
Jonathan!Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:53: Hi lisa nice to hear from you again I think the director of this
clip was trying to make a point on how different it is compared to living the city. like for example
when they are harvesting resources like wood and trying to build a cabin with basic primitve tools
like an axe. Meanwhile in the city they are building huge skyscapers with resources they already
have and dont have to get the materials ready and they have way better tools then that. I sorta
relate but not much i have been in a canoe and chopped wood but not lived in a forest also the flim
made me feel kinda weird i dont know the music was odd but i understood what was happening. I have
left a big city 5 years ago and was in middle school at the time but honestly i havnt really seen a
difference.Mentor 2022-03-09, 19:52: Hi Jonathan :) The film also made me feel kinda weird. I think
it was largely due to the intense ticking - you know, like in a horror film and there's a ticking
clock and you're holding your breath in anticipation for something. That's the vibe I got from it.
The close-ups and quick cuts throughout the video also made it really intense? I felt like I was
being thrown around from place to place lol. There was a ton of emphasis on movement and the cut
from the country shots to the city shots was seamless. To me, it felt like the short film was saying
that, regardless of where you are, there is always a hustle and bustle to get to a destination. What
do you think? I'm glad you found moving from a big city to a smaller town as (idk if it makes sense
but) not a huge deal? If you do decide to move to a big city again for post-secondary, the
difference won't be a huge barrier. Honestly, the thing I hated the most was having to transit to
school every single day. When I had class during rush hour, I had to leave my house two hours before
my class even started :(((",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-09, 21:32: So this portion requires you to upload your work to your Portfolio so your
teacher can take a look. I'm not sure if they'll be marking it so you can always ask them to double
check :) I'll share some traditions I had as a child. I hope it'll help with your brainstorming. My
family isn't very ""traditional"" but we always treated Chinese New Year as a special day. Since we're
always busy, we rarely eat dinner together. During Chinese new year, my mom would make a ton of
dishes and we'd all make sure to eat dinner together. In the future, if I ever get married, I'd make
sure to take the time to sit down with my family for meals. I think eating together is a wonderful
bonding experience. Since I don't really follow any traditions, I'm really interested to hear if
there's anything your family does. If not, is there anything you'd want to make into a
tradition?Mentor 2022-04-06, 23:16: Hi Jonathan! How was your spring break? Hope you had a lot more

to start off with you telling me a bit about yourself such as, what classes you are in? What are
some of your favorite things to do in your free time? And anything else you would like to share! You
may have learned a little about me from my bio but if not, or you have any other questions about my
experiences, feel free to ask 😊. As for your question, my background is mixed, I am black and white.
What about you?I’m hoping we can really get to know each other throughout this program and if you
have questions about anything at all during our time together, please send them my way and I will
help you the best I can!Mentee 2022-03-02, 13:44: hello eric i am very sorry for the long wait, i
just couldnt figure out how to even see what you said. apologies aside i an in math science CLE and
gym right now, in math i am doing trigonometry and in science im doing chemistry hopwever out of
school i enjoy playing soccer and video games when soccer isnt running. when you get closer to
becoming adult do your pasions change because i feel as though my love for everything is slowly
deminishing out of my control so im just curuious and what you think about it as you said your in
psychology, but if you dont feel like explaining thats fine i get it you have a life. also i was
wondering if you could send me something about a rural area maybe? my teacher is kinds mad i havent
done it yet (bot blamiong you i take full fault) thank you for reading this i hope your day/night is
going well. please do tell me about yourself as i love getting to know peopleMentor 2022-03-08,

do the things you really enjoy! To answer your question, depending on who you are, your passions can
actually change quite frequently, or not at all for some people. But finding old passions are
getting boring is totally normal! you just have to find something new, theres so many options out
there, you just have to experiment :) So which of the conversations would you like to get started on
first?? also, Im not sure what you mean by sending you something rural?Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:30:

1047550342,1047554102,2/9/2022 20:34,"Mentor 2022-02-20, 07:40: Hi Trisha, Finding Inspiration is unlocked now. It starts off with a video
about creative processes. Below are a couple of questions (this is also in the anchor text): After
watching, choose an idea that stood out to you. It could be an idea you agree with – but it could
also be an idea that you disagree with. Share with your mentor: Your understanding of the idea by
putting it into your own words Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea
Questions you might have about the idea(s) How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your
future From the video, Roch Carrier's response stood out to me the most because his idea resonates
with choices I made in my life that were unplanned for but just happened in the moment. While I
think you can plan for your future to some degree, there's always something that appears to change
those plans, and sometimes for the better. I'm curious about which idea interests you the
most!Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:29: Hi Anne, I chose Denys Arcand’s quote, “If I want to do something
truly authentic … I should stick to what I know, to what’s happened to me. I only work from inside
of me, from what I am truly experienced in.” It is important to be authentic as often as possible;
doing things that make oneself happy. This may be because you are doing something that you do often,
and that you understand well, or something that is new and that you are excited to try. It is common
to do things that you enjoy over and over again, like watching the same show multiple times, eating
the same foods, reaching for the same sweater; things that are familiar give us a sense of safety
and comfort, because we have watched, eaten or worn these things before, and we know the way they
will make us feel. However, it is important and valuable to try things that are out of your comfort
zone. Going out of your comfort zone, trying new foods or watching new shows will allow you to
expand your areas of interests. From these new experiences, you can make new connections, like new
friends who share your newfound interests. With this quote in mind, in the future I aspire to try
new things as often as possible to find new things that interest me, while still sticking to what I
know, and doing things that I know will make me happy. You are totally right! One can plan for the
future all they want, but things will always come up that are unplanned, and sometimes the
unexpected things can make experiences better than you could’ve planned for. Sorry for the very late
reply, I was away for a bit. Can you unlock “Well being and Self Care” next?",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-21, 11:44: Hi, The video of the village is such an enchanting place. It makes me
think about how important it is to protect the ecosystem in areas like this, where sockeye salmon
running through the rivers and streams are endangered by overfishing. Thus, traditional and
scientific knowledge can work together for the same purpose of protecting the land from
anthropogenic activities. Curious to know what you think and why tradition and science may conflict
with each other.Mentor 2022-03-21, 11:44: And let me know when you're ready to proceed with part 2

How are you doing with this topic? I believe you were wrapping up for this class on April 4th.Mentee
2022-04-11, 02:41: Hi, I think it is so important to read and learn about the land that you live on.
It helps oneself feel closer to the nature and beautiful architect surrounding the environment they
live on. As someone who has lived in a small town where fortunately, First Nations culture is very
much embraced throughout the town, I've fallen in love with the energy and welcomeness that First
Nations people express. Starting from a young age I've taken Sm'algyax classes. Not only have I
learned to appreciate the language itself, but through it I've learned that the land is a sacred,
vital part of our lives that we must protect. I agree, traditional and scientific knowlegde can work
together to protect the land from manmade pollutants and threats. Traditional knowledge can offer
information about the land and environment accross many generations and geographies of actual
residents in the area. This information and be used to expand past, present and future scientific
studies to benefit the land and environment.Mentee 2022-04-11, 03:07: Hi Anne, This is the last
e-mentoring session. Thank you so much for your insight these past couple of weeks, I've really
enjoyed our conversations. &lt;3Mentor 2022-04-11, 04:18: Hi, Sm'algyax classes sound interesting!
Great to learn about your views from the perspective of someone living in a small town. We still
haven't done part two of Ways of Knowing, but we can wrap this up now since it's your last session.
You should be able to access a survey after finishing the program. Hope you had a good time with
this program and good luck with post-secondary applications!",,,"Mentor 2022-03-09, 00:44: Hi, For this module, I wanted to mention that self-care is so important
and can often be neglected in university. My personal experience can attest to this. The adjustment
from high school to university exposed bad habits where I stayed up late to finish assignments or
study, exercise was nonexistent, and my reliance on coffee was not healthy. In the end, I felt
terrible and burnt out after my first semester of first year. My advice when you get there is to
take care of yourself first and foremost. Having a regular sleep routine and exercising daily is
probably the best way to be successful in school, and I suggest making a schedule for the week to
plan for upcoming exams/assignments and giving yourself breaks will make the transition easier. This
is the best advice I've ever received from my mom: If you're tired, go to sleep. Wake up and be
productive. Hope this helps!Mentee 2022-03-17, 01:31: Hi Annie! Thank you for the advice, it seems
so simple to take care of yourself first and foremost, yet it is such a struggle sometimes.
Self-care is something that comes very easily to me, almost too easy. At times I feel as though too
much of my time is used for self-care. I spend too much time relaxing, sleeping, doing nothing,
eating foods that aren’t necessarily good for me, and neglecting homework, with the excuse of “it’s
self-care”. The challenge and unpredictability of life are removed when we focus too much on making
ourselves feel safe and comfortable. Oftentimes, life is shocking and unpredictable, but that’s the
fun of it. We get to test our limits and challenge ourselves to become better; this is something
that I have been slowly working towards. But that’s not to say that routine and comfort aren’t also
important. It’s crucial to set some time out of every day to take care and check in with yourself.
During this time of graduation, university, and change, it has been difficult to stay in the moment
and live every day in the present, rather than stressing about the future and the unknown. This has
really put me in a funk, where I am circling an emotional rollercoaster full of fear and anxiety but
also excitement; this has really made it difficult to focus on self-care. Can you please open
“Different Ways of Knowing” next!",,"Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:48: Hi Annie! Nice to meet you. I was really excited to see that we have many
things in common. I hope to attend UBC in September to study Kinesiology. I look forward to asking
you questions about UBC, it's campus and your experience with university itself. I also look forward
to future conversations about their areas where biology and kinesiology mix.Mentor 2022-02-14,
18:26: Hi Trisha, Looking forward to working with you! I'm more than happy to answer any questions
you have about UBC. Although I don't know as much about kinesiology as I do with biology, I know a
lot of people in kin, and biology definitely has some overlap as well. Are you interested in
becoming a physical therapist as well? Also, do you have a preferred schedule to work on the
conversation topics?Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:41: Our teacher wants us to start our conversations next
week. We’re hoping to have all mentors unlock “Finding Inspiration” so that we can start on Tuesday.
Ideally my teacher would like us to spend time on e-Mentoring once at the beginning of the week,
like Monday or Tuesday, and once at the end of the week, Thursday or Friday. But looking at our
schedule it seems most likely that we will only be doing it once a week, at the beginning of the
week. I am not exactly sure what I would like to do after university with kinesiology yet, but
physical therapy seems pretty interesting. I have also been looking into pathology, and becoming a
pathologist, which is totally different from kinesiology, but is just something that has been
piquing my interests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047514152,1047554099,2/9/2022 20:33,"Mentee 2022-02-22, 21:35: The quote that stood out to me was “Not knowing sometimes brings the
biggest change, the most important change in your life.”- Léa Pool When I saw this quote I
immediately thought of how trying new things is always something to strive for. Trying new things
not only helps us to vanquish past fears, but it also allows us to expand our minds to learn new
things. We learn more about ourselves. For me it was trying every single thing my town had to offer
to find out what spoke to me. Some things I didn’t like, and I distanced myself from it. But when I
found the things that spoke to me I embraced it. I surrounded myself with people who shared the same
interests and goals, which shaped me to be the person I am today. My question for you is because you
also lived in a rural area, did you go under the same type of process?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:28:
Hello Shay. I don't know if you have seen my finding inspiration write up yet but I have submitted
it and would like to hear your feedback. My teacher has notified me that we should be starting to
look at any one of the topics. Any topic works, thanks!Mentor 2022-03-03, 15:09: Hey Ronin, really
interesting thoughts! I like the quote you chose, because for me as well, really big changes came
with choosing things I knew little about in advance. Moving to Canada, moving from urban Vancouver
to a small town in the Kootenays, other choices were things I decided to do without having all the
knowledge on how it was going to go. They were risks in a way, but both of them, along with other
big changes that came with decisions I made over the years, have enriched my life and broadened my
perspective. I like your point about expanding our minds. I feel that it's good for me (or everyone)
to maintain a level of change and progress in life, because it keeps our minds flexible and
receptive. It's kind of like stretching your arms to either side to find limits from both
directions, and getting this confidence in yourself within those broad bounds. I also like what you
said about exploring your town and getting to know it in a deep way. I find that in my life I have
periods when I'm looking to step out and explore something new, and other times when I'm looking for
stability and familiarity. I think both can stem from curiosity and inspiration, they're just
different manifestations of those. For example, my choice of moving to the Kootenays was born out of
a desire to get to know a new place, that's very different from other places I've lived in and
explore a different way of life. Later, I had a little fatigue from being transient, which made me
want to stay in place, enjoy my familiarity and rootedness. Both these ""wanderlust"" and deep
understanding of things can be really good sources of inspiration. About your question - yes I
definitely have gone through a process of exploring my town and getting familial knowledge of the
places and people in it. This was true especially because it wasn't where I grew up, so I had lots
to discover. And life in the Kootenays is quite different than other places I've lived in, so there
was lots for me to check out and see if it spoke to me. Getting to know the place and the things I
could do in it, and the people, was inspiring and exciting because it made me feel more at home, see
the complexities and details in things. Something cool that I've tried doing is embrace what the
situation offers. I recently moved to Israel, which means I won't be able to do some of the things I
like (ski touring, climbing...), but, there are things that this new place does offer - like
swimming in the ocean. So I'm trying to be open to this change and make the most out of the
situation. I think getting near to the end of high school is an exciting time in this sense - you
can choose many different things and go after what's interesting or inspiring for you and go pursue
it, which is really cool! Hope you find my insight interesting :) ShayMentor 2022-03-03, 15:12: Let
me know what you think about the stuff I wrote in my last message :) Also let me know which
conversation you'd like to continue to after this one!",,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-08, 00:40: Hi Shay. I really enjoyed your insight. I really found what you said about
risk taking to be enlightening. Moving from Canada to Israel is a huge jump. Going somewhere with
unfamiliarity's opens up more risks to take. By moving away from Canada, you can't do the same
things you used to like such as skiing and climbing. But it lets you discover new things that Isreal
has to offer. You might discover something you didn't know even existed, but you really enjoy it.
I'm glad we both share the same mindset of how important curiosity is. Curiosity helps us grow,
build relationships with others, adapt more effectively to change and create more innovative
solutions. It lets you expand your mind. It's why I'm so excited to see what my next chapter is.
Unfortunately there's no point of curiosity if you don't have the motivation to seek it out. That's
why I think our next conversation should be setting goals and building habits. Thanks.Mentee

topic: ""setting goals and building habits."" Instead I think we should start the topic ""Studying.""
Our teacher also wants us to let our mentors know that Spring Break is next week for two weeks. We
will be taking a break for those two weeks...but doing a final thoughts check-in with our mentors on
April 4th or 5th.Mentor 2022-03-18, 13:06: Hey Ronin, Really awesome points that you mentioned here,
and sounds like you're really attentive to yourself and what works or doesn't for you. It's such a
key part of being effective. It also seems that you have genuine interest in lots of things you do,
which I think makes it much easier to accomplish what you go for. If you choose goals that you're
passionate about, or at least can create some internal hype about - it really helps. I also find
that teaching others is the absolute best way for me to drill in the understanding of something.
Even if I don't know it **all**, but well enough to help someone understand a concept, while I also
solidify my grasp on it. It's golden. About procrastination - I hear you! I think it's the story of
our time and age, with the overflow of content that targets our attention and engagement mechanisms
(I can talk about this for days, let me know if you're curious). And the tasks we actually have to
do have a hard time competing - they don't give us as much positive feedback, rewards are sometimes
delayed (studying hard now but getting a good grade only in a few months). This can make motivating
ourselves more difficult. So I find that managing your own ""reward policy"" is helpful: instead of
trying to sit myself down for hours, I do short 20-30 minute work sessions (on the internet they
call these pomodoros, you can look it up). I take 5 minute breaks between those, in which I either
intentionally do something enjoyable, or just let myself off the self-control hook. I use a timer to
prevent getting sucked up into the abyss of online content. This way, there is a small reward for
working for 30 minutes - I get a nice break during which I can do something nice - which I DON'T
feel guilty about. How nice? I also find physical movement very important in stopping those
procrastination snowballs. When you've been sitting for a long time and reach for your phone to
""check what's going on"", that's your brain looking for stimulus, because you've been idle and
staring at the same thing for too long. I find that doing some exercise either indoor or outdoor,
taking a shower, going for a short walk, whatever really - really helps me break up those long slogs
and reduce the need to look for more interesting stuff. Also, I think procrastination has a lot to
do with how the task makes you feel, and I have lots to say about that - but let's keep it for the
next post just to not go super long. What do you think about these ideas?","Mentee 2022-03-18, 01:59: Hello Shay. After watching the video about how to study effectivly, I can
come to the conclusion that I can see which studying tools I use and the ones I don't. Dont
procrastinate. The first stategy I use often is the switching srategy. Whether it's in the real
world or with the books I often switch my thinking between subjects. I try to find how different
ideas are connected, and the ways they compliment each other. I'm very good at finding multiple
solutions to a common problem. I have the right understanding on how much time I need to spend
studying and analyzing a topic before I can move on. Another studying srategy I utilize is the
elaboration strategy. When I'm at school I'm constantly asking myself how and why things work. It
helps me figure out every little detail which grants me a greater understanding of the material. I
also find myself explaing out questions to my peers. It shows me that if I can teach the material to
other people than I have a good grasp on the material. What I realy need to work on is my
procrastination. I often find myself stressing about upcoming events. In the time leading up to
those events I just tell myself that I'll work or study later. I continue to push my problems to the
future until there's no where left to push. I really struggle with finding motivation and discipline
to sit down and just study. There's always so much distractions that seem more invititing and
require less brain power. I have been trying to work on limiting my time watching media in order to
solve this problem. My question for you is if you utilize these studying strategys. What do you find
works and resonates with you? Do you struggle with procrastination, and how would you try to get out
of the habit of procrastinating.Mentee 2022-04-07, 00:54: Hi shay, I really enjoyed hearing about
your study habits. As someone who struggles with keeping attention, it's really helpful to see other
ways of tackling the problem. I tend to burn out by the hour mark so I like your way of splitting up
time. As someone who always has their phone on them at all time, it can sometimes be really hard to
pull away from it. It's very addictive. I think the 30 minute breaks will greatly benefit me, as
your not outright stopping using your phone, but rather limiting the time you can spend on it. I
like what you also said about physical movement. Whenever I know I need to study but just don't have
the motivation, I tend to just get up and walk around. It feels like a reset for your barin and gets
the gears turning again. The last point I wanted to touch on is my interest on the tasks. I find
that a lot of school work just doesn't motivate me. It's tricky because even if you are not
interested, you still have to do it...that's school. When I get work from school that I do enjoy,
things change. Suddenly I'm motivated, energized and want to get the job done. I see this mindset in
my grades. I just wish I could put in the same amount of efort into the things I don't really enjoy.",,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:29: Hi Shay, Thanks for being my mentor! Im excited to talk to you about
engineering and transtioning from a rural town to a more urban area.Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:32: Our
teacher wants us to start our conversations next week. We're hoping to have all mentors unlock
""Finding Inspiration"" so that we can start on Tuesday.Mentor 2022-02-23, 16:49: Hi Ronin! Before all
- I have to apologize for not being available on the platform for so long! I think there was a
glitch in the system and I wasn't notified that I was matched with you - so I had no idea and hadn't
been checking in. I'm really happy we were matched and I'm excited about having a meaningful
mentoring relationship with you :) I see that you've already sent me a few messages - that's great!
I'm interested in learning a little but about you and telling you about me and my story. There are a
few small onboarding steps we should go through to get out of the way, and we can start with the
""Finding Inspiration"" conversation. Just to keep things easy to find and navigate, I don't want to
write everything on this thread, so I'll write separate posts in their appropriate places (under the
correct conversations). Again, I'm really sorry you weren't getting responses from me, it will be
different from now on :) Welcome to the mentorship program, I'm looking forward to exchanging
thoughts with you! Shay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with you, this is a really beneficial conversation to have especially when you are moving from high
school to univesity. for myself, I was quite lost in grade 12 and didn't know what my passions were.
So for me, Lea Pool's section felt the most encouraging. I usually find myself afraid of change, and
struggle with moving from phase to phase in life. But her words about change bringing new passions
and ideas brought some ease to me about the changes we all face. Who stood out to you and why? Do
you find you welcome change and newness? I look forward to hearing from you :)Mentee 2022-02-22,
22:56: I was interested in TRU! I think I am planning to go to UVic now. I have a couple of friends
who are also going and we were contemplating splitting costs and being roommates. Right now I don’t
think I have any other questions, but I will let you know! The idea that stood out to me the most
was Denys Arcand’s line about authenticity. My understanding of his idea is that the greatest way to
be authentic is by being true to the experiences you have had. You should stick to what you know and
not try to be something you are not. Especially when it comes to interacting with people, I often
find myself shying away from things that make me unique out of a desire to be more similar to
others. I wonder if this is a struggle that many people have. I live in a small town, so I have
grown up around the same people I am going to graduate with. I believe that once I have had a chance
to get out and experience the world a bit more I will be able to be a more authentic person. Part of
the reason I wanted to go away to university, was so that I could make new experiences and grow a
bit more. I find that change and newness can be difficult. I like things to be routine and
organized. I think a lot of people are like that. I think bringing new passions into life kind of
goes hand-in-hand with authenticity. Figuring out what you are passionate about can be a massive
change in your life. I think overcoming the challenge will be easier if you can be honest with
yourself. Those were sort of my thoughts! How do you feel about authenticity? I look forward to
hearing from you again soon!Mentor 2022-02-23, 21:31: I love these thoughts! Because I grew up the
same way you have, in a small town with the same kids I've known since kindgergarten, and I always
felt like I couldn't change anything about myself because everyone was familiar with a certain
version of me. Authenticity can be really hard to achieve in this kind of environment, because the
expectations can difficult to overcome. Going away to university is something I will always
encourage, because it allows you to have new experiences, and it gives you an oppurtunity to
introduce yourself as the most authentic version you can be, without anyone's preconcieved notions
getting in the way. I am also somebody that loves routine, and find changes difficult, but everytime
I break the organization of my life in safe or supported ways, I grow in the best way. Through new
experiences we also learn which facets of ourselves we love, and which parts we wish to develop,
which contributes to that feeling of authenticity and assuredness in who we are. How do you think
our identities contribute to inspiration? Do you think our passions shape us, or our experiences
shape our passions? I'm excited to hear from you, and I wish you the best with UVIC, I think you'll
have the best time there!!Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:38: You have a great insight into this topic! I
think our passions definitely shape us. For example, I have always loved to swim. This love of the
water was a major factor in my joining the swim club and starting to swim competitively. It also led
to me recently becoming a lifeguard at the local pool. As we go through life and make new
experiences, our passions will change. It is similar to the way that your favourite foods change
over time because you have had the chance to experience more. You mentioned that you are able to
break the organization of your life in safe and supported ways. How do you go about doing this? Do
you have a support network that you rely on for these break outs? I am not the kind of person who
likes to step outside of their comfort zone very often.I have been trying to step outside of my own
buble recently. Do you have any suggestions for accomplishing this? This week my teacher would like
us to unlock a new conversation topic. Could you unlock the “Career Considerations” topic? I look
forward to talking to you again!Mentor 2022-02-28, 16:34: I love the connection you made to your
swimming, often the things we loved when we were little remain our passions later in life, which I
think is a really neat aspect of human nature. After I graduated I made a decision that caused me to
break my routine in the biggest way I ever had, I decided to move out with my friends to Kamloops,
far away from my family. It has brought me so many new experiences and I learned so much about
myself, stepping outside my bubble of home, family and friends was really hard though. My main
suggestion for breaking out of your bubble is to do it alongside someone you trust. When I moved
away from home, I did it with my best friend who I had known since we were young. Her and my family
were my support system. My second suggestion is to have a conversation about your decision with
someone you are close to, like your parents. I talked a lot about my plans with my parents, got all
the advice I could from them on how to take care of financials and all of the details. I couldn't
have broken out of my comfort zone without the help from my family and friends, so don't be afraid
to ask for help ever! Be brave, but you don't have to be alone. Is there anything else within this
conversation you'd like to talk about? If not we can start Career Considerations, I'll unlock it for
us to do next time :) It's so nice to hear from you, you have really great ideas Piper!","Mentor 2022-02-28, 17:04: Hi Piper! I'm excited to hear about your results and if they were what you
thought they would be. If you have any questions let me know, look forward to hearing from you
:)Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:31: Hey Haley! I hope your courses are going well! I am planning to do sort
of the same thing you did. In September, I am going to move away from home to go to UVic with one of
my best friends from high school. We will be studying under the same faculty and are also looking at
getting a dorm together. I do talk a lot about the future with my parents. It is sometimes
frustrating because they are as new to this whole process as I am. I think that once I get to
Victoria and start my schooling I will find that it’s not so intimidating after all. I like the
phrase you used at the end: Be brave, but you don’t have to be alone. Those are words to live by! I
took the work preference quiz and these were my top 3 results: Coach Low demand $50,054 per year
Majority in the mainland/southwest Managers in social, community, and correctional services Fairly
high demand $69,513 Majority in mainland/southwest HR Managers High demand $90,244 Majority in
mainland/southwest One of my other recommended career paths was “Funeral Director” which I thought
was kind of funny. All of the above career paths involve working with and managing people. I do
enjoy being in a leadership position and I think I am quite good at it. If I had to pick one of the
three, I think I would go with the second one. It would probably give me the most opportunity to
work with a diverse group of people. Talk to you again soon!Mentor 2022-03-03, 18:32: Hi Piper! The
first thing I want to mention is that it does get much better when you are actually at the school,
and it is so good you and your friend are under the same faculty, because you can figure out a lot
of the scheduling and tricky stuff together! I'm confident you'll have a wonderful year at UVic, and
I wish you all the best with it. A funeral director is definitely an interesting outcome, you would
be working with all kinds of people in that job, you would have a hard time communicating with the
customers though :) I think your middle choice is a good one, working within the community will
definetly allow you to interact with all kinds of people. Working in HR I imagine you would do quite
a bit more delegating and initiatives that don't involve working with the people the service is for.
A general manager in social services or other would allow you to work with people in all walks of
life, which I think would be a lovely part of the job. I'm curious if the results of any of the
quizzes have changed your perception of yourself or if it confirmed what you already knew? I also
wonder what kinds of careers you are now considering that you didn't before? I look forward to
hearing from you again Piper! Have a lovely weekend! ps. feel free to let me know at any point in
the conversation if you are ready for part 2 :)Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:24: I hope you had a good
weekend and that your midterms went alright last week! So far I’ve only done the work preference
quiz but I am now curious as to what the results of the other quizzes might be. I think they will
probably confirm the results of the work preference quiz. I have been considering going into a
career that involves working with people. The quiz results kind of confirmed that that was where my
interests could take me. I remember taking this quiz a few years back and my results were completely
different. It’s interesting to see how my future is being shaped by my experiences. I had actually
never considered a career in Human Resources. I do enjoy management and I think HR would be a good
balance between individual work and team work. How did you figure out what you wanted your career to
be? Did your ideas of your ideal future ever change? I think we can definitely move onto part 2 of
this conversation. I’m interested to explore it further. Thank you for all of your help so
far!Mentor 2022-03-07, 21:00: Hi Piper! It is so wild how we change and grow and how that shifts our
goals, and I'm so glad you've come to find an identity for yourself in these ways. I have no doubt
you'll succeed in a management position of any kind :) I decided when I was little I wanted to be a
teacher, but when I got to about 8th grade I was told I wouldn't make any money and I had potential
for a much 'better' career. So I decided I wanted to be a pediatrician or doctor. The funny thing
is, I'm totally afraid of both needles and blood. So that didn't work out. Other people's
perceptions of me and of the career I originally wanted took me away from where I knew I belonged. I
decided to pursue teaching again when I was in 11th grade, because I loved my volunteer experiences
with kids (mentorship and teaching children's classes at church). I also was told by my mom that a
lot of money in a job I hate is worse than a medium income in a job I love, because your job should
be something you have a passion and drive for. So that's how I finally let go of my worries and just
followed my instincts and experiences :) If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll
unlock pt 2 for us :)",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-14, 15:33: Hey Piper, this conversation is a great pick and I'm excited to hear your
thoughts! I grew up in Langley, which isn't rural at all, but also not very citylike, and now I live
in Kamloops which is pretty much the same vibe. But I do know a lot about navigating new places, so
I hope I can be of some help. I look forward to hearing from you in a couple weeks, talk soon
:)Mentee 2022-03-18, 21:51: I grew up in New Westminster before moving to Prince Rupert. I think it
had sort of the same vibe as Langley; not a small town but also not very city-like. I like living in
a rural area for the most part. Prince Rupert is a very tight knit community. Everybody knows
everybody else and their business. I like that there are lots of work opportunities available for
young people because we have so much industry up here. There are also many city jobs up here which
gives students a chance to make more money in their first few years of working My parents like to
say that living in a small town is difficult because you have everything you need but not everything
you want. It’s practically impossible to take first aid courses up here because there are only 3
people certified to teach in the whole of Prince Rupert. That is why I had to travel to Kamloops to
take my National Lifeguard certification. Additionally, it can be difficult to break into social
circles if you’re new to the community because most people who live in Prince Rupert have been here
their whole lives. I wonder if it is like this is all rural communities or just mine. The rural to
urban conversation was a bad one to end on because it is in two parts! Our spring break starts next
week and lasts for two weeks, and we will be taking a break from e-mentoring for these two weeks. I
think we will be doing a final check-in on April 4th or 5th. Talk to you in a couple weeks! :)Mentor
2022-03-19, 18:29: New West is very similar to Langley! I love what you said about the job
oppurtunities, because I would have never guessed that about a small town. My family and I went on a
trip to Prince Rupert a few years ago and went on a little boat tour to look at the wildlife (bears
in particular) and it was so so beautiful, which is something you definitely don't find in bigger
cities. If you would like, I can unlock part 2 and we can do it real quick for our last day? Thanks
so much for being so willing to share, and I hope you have a nice relaxing spring break! Talk soon
Piper :)",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 20:39: Hi Piper! My name is Haley and I'm an undergrad student at Thompson Rivers
University in Kamloops. I love to read, bake and spend time outdoors, and I'm super excited to be
your mentor! If you have any questions about the program or about me let me know, and if not give me
a list of conversations you want/are required to do and we can get started! - HaleyMentee
2022-02-14, 15:30: Hi Haley! Thank you for being my mentor! I noticed on your profile that you want
to be an elementary or middle school teacher. How did you come to this realization? What subjects do
you plan to teach (if you've thought about that)? How do you like living in Kamloops? I've heard a
lot of good things about the campus there! I look forward to hearing from you soon!Mentee
2022-02-14, 15:41: Sorry, I am still learning how to use this platform and I didn't even see you had
sent me a message! My teacher wants us to hold off on the conversations until Thursday so that we
have a chance to complete the first one together.Mentor 2022-02-14, 17:26: No worries Piper, we can
start the conversations on thursday then :) I decided to be an elementary school teacher in my
junior year of high school. I was a volunteer with Big Brother Big Sister, so I was a mentor to an
elementary school student for the school year. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the school, the
teachers I talked to and of course my buddy. So, I thought that seemed like a place I wanted to
continue working in, and I wanted to continue interacting with kids like my little buddy. TRU has a
beautiful campus, and I've had really great experiences with professors so I highly reccomend
checking it out if you have the chance. Have you thought about any universities you'd like to
attend? What drew you to being a swimmer? It's been so nice to hear from you, and I'm so pumped to
keep chatting!Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:36: I have applies to TRU, UVic, Capilano University, and a
local college. I am thinking I might also apply to SFU as I've already taken a few courses with
them. As for swimming, I joined the local club in the fifth grade. I always enjoyed water activities
and swimming gave me the oppurtunity to keep going with that. I have had the chance to travel for
competitions and in recent years have become a mentor for the younger swimmers. This will likely be
my last season because I am planning to go away for university. My teacher wants us to start our
conversations next week. We're hoping to have all mentors unlock the ""Finding Inspiration"" so that
we can start on Tuesday! Talk to you soon! :)Mentor 2022-02-17, 19:53: Those are all great
universities, my boyfriend goes to SFU and has had lovely experiences with his professors. If you
want a pretty campus or more active social aspect I think UVIC and Capilano are great fits. TRU has
wonderful professors in the science department, which I remember you being interested in right? All
good picks :) I'll unlock finding inspiration for us to do on tuesday! Did you have any other
questions about the program or anything else? It's so nice to hear from you and I hope you're doing
well!",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-26, 20:19: Hi Piper! I know you're still on spring break but I thought I'd get this
started for when you come back. Before we talk about the video I wanted to say I have really enjoyed
chatting with the past few weeks, and I wish you all wonderful things for when you go on to
university in the fall :) I know when you get back will be our last check in, so we can keep this
conversation brief and then say our goodbyes if you wish. There was one thing about this video I
thought was a very strong artistic choice, and that was the music and speed of the footage. As we
transfered from rural life to city life, the music built in tempo and the clips were sped up. This
to me is a direct comment on the pace of life in these two different places. I'm curious what your
thoughts are about the video, and how your spring break was! Thanks so much for being such a
wonderful mentee and being willing to share your thoughts, I've appreciated it so much!Mentee
2022-04-04, 17:44: Hi Haley! I have also really enjoyed our conversations over the last several
weeks! It was really helpful that we have had a lot of the same experiences and so I feel that you
were able to provide really helpful advice! I am more confident now than I was before we started and
I have you to thank for that! My spring break was fairly quiet. I enjoyed the break from school. I
was able to work a lot which was nice! Watching the film reminded me of my own community. A lot of
the activities that were being carried out in the film are practices that my local First Nations
communities practice. It was cool to see that being represented. Your comment made me notice the way
that the videos were speeding up throughout. I think this is meant to show that moving from a rural
community to a big city can be overwhelming. At the end of the video the film slowed down again. I
think this shows that while it may be an overwhelming change at first, you will become used to it
and be able to adapt to the fast paced lifestyle. This sort of matches what I am feeling about
moving away for university. I think that the change would be overwhelming at first. I know that I
will have people around who can support me as I go through this phase of life. I think that once I
get there and start living my life at university, I will become accustomed to the hustle and bustle.
This will be my last correspondence to you. You won’t need to respond to this message because I will
not be able to view it! I want to thank you again for all your help as a mentor. If it is something
you are interested in, you should definitely continue mentoring in the future! You were excellent to
talk to and were able to provide such wonderful insight into all of our conversations! Good luck
with the rest of your university education! Sincerely, Piper :)",,"Mentor 2022-03-07, 21:07: Hi Piper! I'm so excited to hear your thoughts about these videos, as
someone who is moving away from home for university I'm especially curious what you think about
working closer to your hometown or farther away. Talk soon!Mentee 2022-03-10, 16:54: I am planning
to go away for university and a big consideration has been moving from a small community to a city
like Victoria. I would like to be able to work closer to home and family, but I would also like to
be able to get out and explore the world. Long story short, I am not entirely sure where I would
want to work yet. It’s interesting that you mentioned being sort of turned away from teaching by the
notion that you could have a “better career” because that exact same thing happened to me. For the
longest time I have been avoiding getting into teaching because the ideas that teachers don’t make
any money and don’t have rewarding careers have been constantly reinforced. I really enjoyed my
experiences working with kids’ summer camps and they have motivated me to look into teaching. Your
career should be based on your passions, even if the salary leaves something to be desired. With
teaching in mind I tried to answer some of the anchor text questions. I think I do have a strong
personal interest in teaching because I enjoy working with kids. My job as a water safety instructor
also gives me the opportunity to experiment with different methods of teaching and evaluation. So
far, I have really enjoyed this line of work. I have heard that teaching is a very demanding career.
Teachers should be prepared to have to deal with all sorts of stress on the job. I have also heard
that it is hard to have a social life (especially in a small town) when everybody knows that you are
a teacher. There are higher expectations for people who work in the public view. I think that would
definitely have an impact on work-life balance. There are lots of teachers in my community who have
side jobs because they don’t make enough as a teacher or aid. If I were to pursue teaching as my
career it is possible that I would need to have a side job in order to be financially secure. I
think teaching is a fairly secure job. Teachers will always be necessary in society to educate the
population. I think the most difficult thing about being a teacher would be trying to find a place
to start working initially. Especially in BC, I have heard that teaching is a competitive career and
that there are not a lot of open positions. Teaching seems like a very mobile career. If I received
a degree in teaching and completed any and all required training, I could theoretically teach
anywhere in the country (maybe not Quebec). I think there is a survey I am supposed to fill out
before we can complete this conversation. Could you unlock it? I’m sorry that there is so much to
read this week! I guess I had a lot to say. Talk to you later! :)Mentor 2022-03-10, 18:20: Hi Piper,
never apologize for having lots to say, I love reading your ideas :) There is certainly a lot of
things to consider when choosing a career, and no career will be perfect. Just like teaching, there
are downfalls, but there is also a passion for it that helps us to persevere through the challenges.
The best job is one you would do for free. I'll unlock that survery for you for sure, and I believe
your teacher wanted us to do 2 conversations of your choice, so let me know what you pick and if you
feel ready to move on. I look forward to hearing from you again!Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:19: I really
enjoy having you as my mentor because it seems like we've had a lot of the same experiences! It's
like talking to myself from the future! My teacher wants us to let our mentors know that our spring
break starts next week and lasts for two weeks. We will be taking a break from e-mentoring for these
two weeks but will be doing a final check-in on April 4th or 5th. I think I am ready to move onto
the next conversation. As I am planning to go from a small rural community to the University of
Victoria, I was hoping to take a look at the ""From Rural to Urban"" conversation. If you could unlock
that one for next time that would be awesome! Talk to you again soon! :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-14, 15:29: Hi Piper! I've really enjoyed chatting with you these past few weeks,
you're very gifted at communicating your thoughts well. I feel like I'm talking to myself in the
past, which makes me so excited for you to see what university is like and how much more you'll
accomplish. I can definitely unlock that conversation for us, and I hope you have a relaxing and fun

1047551564,1047554097,2/9/2022 20:31,"Mentor 2022-02-19, 00:18: Hi Payton! I’m glad to hear you are excited to continue your education.
I’ve gone ahead and unlocked the “finding inspiration” conversation. If you have any further
questions about the logistic of the program, please do not hesitate to reach out. Otherwise, we can
begin this first conversation! I’ll begin with what I felt while watching the video. Upon my initial
viewing, there were two main messages which immediately jumped out at me; the first was in the quote
“because we want, there is conflict”, and the next was when Mr. Arcand described creation as the
combination of accidents and hard work. I feel that these two ideas encapsulate the meaning of the
chaos which is inherent in the creative process. To put this idea into a metaphor, the creative
process is much like a chemical reaction (I thought you might appreciate this one!): molecules
hurling in space, random motion, but a spark, some “activation energy” is needed to kickstart the
process. In this way, the creative process blends the random nature of ideas, with deliberate
action. This collision of chance and intent is what lead to the creation of art, theories, and any
manner of concepts or plans. I am very interested in your thoughts are on this video. What did you
find were the main concepts? How did you feel while watching the video? I look forward to hearing
your response!Mentee 2022-02-22, 15:53: Youre ideas are very true!! I felt this video was very
moving a touching I chose Denys Arcand quote “If I want to do something truly authentic … I should
stick to what I know, to what’s happened to me. I only work from inside of me, from what I am truly
experienced in.” Authenticity means you are true to your own personality, values, and spirit,
regardless of the pressure that you are under to act otherwise. You are honest with yourself and
with others, and you take responsibility for your mistakes. To me your authentic self is who you
truly are as a person, regardless of your occupation, regardless of the influence of others, it is
an honest representation of you. This may affect my future because I need to stay true to myself
throughout what is to come not only in school but in my far far future. What do you think about
autheiticy?Mentor 2022-02-23, 23:41: Hello Payton! I completely agree with your take on the meaning
of authenticity. I see it as a willingness to express your thoughts and feelings, without the worry
or intention to change these to fulfill certain criteria or please people. I’m interested in your
thoughts on how an occupation or other people could influence one’s sense of authenticity? Do you
find that work/friends/teachers can make it difficult for someone to be who they truly are? I find
that a proper support system of friends/coworkers/teachers can make all the difference in allowing
you to be yourself. How do you find support systems can aid in our journey to be authentic? I look
forward to your reply!Mentor 2022-03-01, 00:13: Hi Payton! Like you, I find that having people
around me with whom I can share my thoughts really helps me stay authentic. Having people in your
life who understand you can help tremendously because they can let you know when you are doing
things that are not authentic to yourself, even when you have trouble seeing it. I’ve opened our
next conversation, and I am excited to hear from you! I appreciate your thoughts and am looking
forward to your next reply!","Mentor 2022-03-14, 23:56: Hi Payton! I completed the abilities quiz on the website above and got a
specialist physician, dentist, and a veterinarian as some of the careers which matched my results.
What about you? I found that my results provided me with career options that I am actively pursuing.
Did you find that the results of the quiz were as you expected? If not, what are your opinions on
the career suggestions from the quiz? I look forward to hearing your insight!Mentee 2022-03-16,
17:06: Hi Alex, my hockey trips went well, athough we didnt place to well, lol. It is super cool you
got jobs you are currently pursuing, much like you I got physiotherapy and Audiologist and speech
pathologist which are interesting. I am taking kinesiology to become a physiotherapist or
chiropractor, so I was happy to hear this. The demand for physiotherapy is not to high but will most
likely get higher by 2031. The annual salary is around $85,000 and the nighest need for this job is
in the Thompson/ Okanagan. Our spring break starts this weekend so i will be replying thursday, and
then after the two weeks of spring break.Mentor 2022-03-16, 23:53: Hey Payton! I’m glad you are
happy with the results of your quiz! As an athlete, I’m sure you are familiar with how vital
physiotherapists and kinesiologists are. I know that I personally have relied on physiotherapists
many times in my athletic career! Have you thought about how you would like to use your abilities as
a physiotherapist in the future? Would you want to work for a larger professional team like the
Canucks? Or maybe would you like to open your own clinic in the Thompson/Okanagan? I look forward to
your reply!Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:18: Hey Alex, today is our last day with this program and I wanted
to thank you! You have been very helpful and offered me lots of advice that I will for sure use in
the future. This program has been very fun and I hope you can continue helping others, like you
helpt me. These topics are super important and something I think everyone should think on. Finishing
off your last questions, I hope I can work with profesional teams much like the Canucks or my own
clinic would be super fun. Again, thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your year!! Kind
regards, PaytonMentor 2022-04-04, 19:07: Hey Payton! Thank you for being an excellent mentee! I’ve
had a great time completing this program with you, and I’m glad I could help you out! Have a
fantastic year and enjoy post-secondary! All the best! Alex",,,,"Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:26: Hi Alex, I hope you are doing well. I know it is midterms for you right
now, so I hope those are going well. Three things i like about living in a rural area are that I
know most of the people in this town, so I have many people who genuinely care about me. Secondly,
living in bigger cities is very scary to me because I would feel lost all the time. Lastly the cost
of living is lower in rural areas than in either urban or suburban ones, and I am closer to nature,
and I spend time outdoors a lot. Two things I do not like about living in a rural area are that
opportunities are harder to achieve, like for myself, I play hockey and from a small town like this
you do not get to be seen by scouts a lot, or get to play in bigger teams. Also, there are fewer job
opportunities here due to their small size and available jobs are likely to pay less than those in
bigger cities. My question is how long did it take you to get used to it or are you still unsure?
Also do you like urban living? I always thought about moving somewhere big, but I do really like the
“countryside,” and urban living is so expensive.Mentor 2022-03-04, 18:58: Thanks, Payton! I was
fortunate that many of my friends from high school ended up attending the same university as me.
This really helped me feel that I was never alone and that I could maintain connections with my
home. I also had my varsity team which acted as a second home for me, so I was able to adjust very
quickly. I would really recommend finding people at your new school who have similar interests as
you, via clubs or sports. By making your own community via your friendship group, you can create a
sense of home. This new home can really help keep you grounded in a busy urban setting. I personally
enjoy urban living, but like you, I love the outdoors. My compromise with this is that I make time
to enjoy the outdoors, usually by traveling with friends outside the city. This way I can enjoy the
outdoors of the country, while still attending school in the city. It may not always be possible to
travel far, so I also take advantage of any nearby green spaces, which more cities are focusing on
providing. Urban living is quite expensive, so staying on top of your finances will be key. The
easiest way I’ve found to get started on this is to work on a budget and analyze where you are
spending your money. This can help you cut costs, and when it comes to living in an urban area every
bit counts. I look forward to hearing back from you!Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:33: I hope you're doing
well!! Those are really helpful tips, ill keep those in mind for next year, thank you Alex. I am
looking foward to the new style of living, and I am happy to hear that they are adding more greenery
to the cities. Could you please open the discussion Well being &amp; Self Care, thanks!!",,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-08, 23:28: Hey Payton! I find the subject of self-care to be very important and took
an entire course about the topic last semester, so please feel free to ask me any questions you may
have! The article above highlighted some key points I believe are vital, the first is that self-care
does not need to be complicated and that we should focus on the basics. For me, that includes
adequate sleep, sports, healthy food, boundaries between work and free time, and spending time in
nature. Recent studies have shown that even 200 minutes of “nature time” a week has a significant
effect on decreasing anxiety levels in students. Although, given your love of the outdoors I’m sure
you already spend much more time than that in nature! The other point I really enjoyed in the
article was the emphasis on creating a plan. Staying organized is such a large part of
post-secondary, and simply by having a schedule, you will see a huge reduction in stress. I create
plans in 4-month and 2-week blocks, and I find this allows me to manage my time efficiently. Having
dedicated time for studying and free time allows me to focus because I know that I have a specific
time to enjoy my other hobbies. How about you? What are your favorite forms of self-care? Do you
foresee any issues with your current routine that may arise during the transition to post-secondary?
As always, I look forward to your reply!Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:42: Hi Alex, I hope you are doing
good, sorry I have not responded in a while I have been away for hockey trips. I agree with
everything you said, as a person how struggles with really bad anxiety I find it important to have a
schedule and organize what I need to do like you. Self-care is super important with school
especially because the stress and homework can take over, so I need to find time to do things for
myself. I try to do sports or go to the gym 5 times a week if that is possible, I spend time
together with friends mostly on the weekend and on the spare time I have to myself I read and do a
little spa day. I try to eat the best I can and drink lots of water. Some people that help me with
this are my parents, they know when I am stressed, they will take me outside and try to distract me
and if needed they will help me. I am hoping that the transition to post-secondary education is not
difficult, but I know that there will be many differences. Especially now that there will be bills
to pay, and much more tests. How did you find your transition? Our teacher wants us to let you know
that Spring Break is next week for two weeks. We will be taking a break for those two weeks... but I
will be doing a check in with you on April 4 or 5. Could you also please open the discussion topic
Career Considerations, if we finsih this new topic by friday and I will be caught up.Mentor
2022-03-14, 23:54: Glad to hear from you, Payton! I hope your hockey trip went well! I found that my
university transition was fairly smooth, I was fortunate to have many friends who were going through
the same experiences. This sense of community really allowed me to feel supported, and I knew that I
always had someone to talk to if I needed help. As you already mentioned, organization is vital and
the better you are at this the easier the post-secondary transition will be. If you ever need any
tips or advice on getting more organized, just let me know! I have tried out many strategies and
have plenty of tips!",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 01:00: Hi Payton! My name is Alex, and I will be your mentor for the semester. I
am 21 years old and studying biology at UBC. What about you? What classes are you in? I see that you
like sports, that’s great! I’ve been an athlete my whole life, I’ve played pretty much any sport you
can think of! What sports are your favourite? Mine are rugby and wrestling! It’s great that you want
to pursue a kinesiology degree, learning about movement and the human body is incredibly rewarding.
Especially when you apply this knowledge to aid others, such as through physiotherapy. If you have
anything else (hobbies, passions, etc.) you would like to share with me, please feel free! Don’t
hesitate to send me any questions you may have, I will do my best to answer them! I look forward to
getting to know you!Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:29: Hi Alex, my name is Payton. I am super exicted to be
matched with you, it seems like we have lots in common. I love sports and outdoor activities, I also
am very excited to be taking some biology/science courses.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:41: I go to charles
hayes in prince rupert, and I am in Chem 12 and careers right now. CHem has been pretty dificult so
far but my teacher is a big help. How do you like studying Biology there? Learing about the body is
very interesting to me. My favorite sports are hockey and softball, but rugby and wrestling are
super cool! Are you playing any sports now?Mentor 2022-02-14, 23:31: Hey Payton! It’s nice to meet
you! I really enjoy studying biology, it is such a broad program that allows me a lot of freedom to
explore whatever aspect of life sciences I choose. I haven’t taken any kinesiology courses
explicitly, but I have quite a few friends in the program, and they say it’s super fun! You get a
lot of opportunities to implement class content in research/practical settings. Just last year I
helped a friend run an experiment where they analyzed the different movement patterns of athletes
running an obstacle course, we ran that course for hours! What aspects of the human body are you
most interested in studying? Did your sports background make you want to study kinesiology? I play
rugby, but occasionally find time to get some wrestling in! Chem 12 can be a very interesting
course, and I’m glad you have a supportive teacher. If you ever need extra help, I would really
recommend either Khan academy or Organic Chemistry tutor on YouTube, I used these a lot for my chem
classes in university! If you have any questions about how the program will work (what the
conversations are, anchor texts, etc) please feel free to ask, I’m happy to help! I look forward to
hearing back from you!Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:42: That sounds super fun, I am so excited to see what
is in store for this coures. I am honestly looking forward to learning to help people feel with
better with their nerves, bones, and muscles. Yes, Sports did make me want to take kinesiology,
beacuse I know lots of people who use sports physio and love it, so that is one of my career
options. Also thank you for the tips i will for sure check out those websites. Seems like you have
lots of fun and get good opertunities in your program. Its good that you get to do other things not
just your school work, seems like you have a good schedule. Our teacher wants us to start our
conversations next week. We're hoping to have all mentors unlock ""finding insperation"" so that we
can start on tuesday. Hope to hear from you soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:29: I agree that certain people in one’s life can change their authenticity, I
find that my friends and family help me by speaking my opinions honestly in a healthy way. They
support me and tell me how important it is to pursue my passions and they allow me to be vulnerable

about me- I'm a second year student at UBC studying psychology and family studies. I have a dog and
a cat that I love taking for walks and hikes in my spare time (yes i even take my cat out for walks

1047548854,1047554091,2/9/2022 20:28,"Mentor 2022-02-19, 12:45: Hey Leah, I really liked the video for this activity! The process of
finding inspiration can be so non-linear and challenging so it was nice to hear from other creative
people. I think the perspective that stuck out the most to me was Denys Arcand; I am a writer, and
I've found that whenever I write what I know, or write about an experience that I've had or a story
that's true, the piece is always a lot more impactful. Writing something that I've experienced and
can put really deep feeling into is usually what my readers enjoy the most, so Arcand's advice about
creating from something that is your own truth really resonated for me. For example, last month I
wrote a story about the crazy things that happened at the first christmas celebration after my
brother passed away, and it made a few people cry when they read it. (I know I've suceeded in
producing strong emotion when I've got somebody crying). Are there any creative projects that you
produced that you feel like come from your own experience? Do you enjoy creating in that way? What
creative method from the video did you agree or disagree with?Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:16: Hi, kira I
agree with you it was nice to hear how other work. The quote you used I also agree with I find that
when you make something it’s always great to see what others think of it. I think the thing that
stood out to me was the quote from Mina Shum “I think you plan everything. I think to even partake
in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you
bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” Cause
it’s very true for me at least, when I make something it always has a reason behind it even if it’s
just I was bored and wanted to draw. I know sometimes things go unplanned, but I don’t think that’s
what they meant by that more that you planned to make something and may have not known what you
where going to make. I have made a few creative projects that come from my own experience. I came up
with a story for a comic I wanted to make, mostly for one character called tam she is ace and I
wanted to have her show what it’s like trying to come out and dealing with rude people. I really
enjoy make things that I feel like others can connect to.Mentor 2022-02-24, 19:42: Hey Leah, Thanks
for sharing that with me, I'd be really interested to read the comic someday! I had a roommate in my
first year of university who was ace, and hearing her experience was really interesting and eye
opening for me, I know she also struggled with people being rude or uneducated about her identity
and feelings. I know it was exhausting for her to constantly need to justify her existence to people
that it had nothing to do with. Anyway yeah that's a great quote, intention is so important to
creation imo! Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about with this conversation? If not,
you are welcome to do the survey or extension activity for this conversation, and then we can move
on to the next one whenever you're ready! Let me know whatever you need I just don't want you to
fall behind your teacher's program.Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:30: Hi Kira, thank you as well for sharing,
i would love to show the comic but it has it even started yet. i don't think there is any thing else
i'd like to talk about, i do need the survey but we don't need to do the ext. activity. besides that
is there any thing else you'd like to talk about in this conversation? If not do you think we could
start well being and self care.Mentor 2022-02-28, 15:36: Hey Leah, Well hopefully someday you'll
finish the comic and publish it and I'll be able to get it in bookstores across Canada! Or maybe
not, publishing online and self-publishing is so common these days so maybe I'll find it as a
webcomic :). Let's do the survey and I will open up Wellbeing and Selfcare right now as well so we
can move on to that, and I'll see your next messages over there.",,,,,"Mentor 2022-04-02, 18:54: Hey leah, just wanted to check in as I haven't heard from you in a while,

this conversation with you if you are, and there are some questions there for you to start us off!
Hope you're well Best KiraMentee 2022-04-04, 17:23: Hi, Kira Sorry for the late response. This will
be are last time to talk but hopeful it goes well. But none the less living in a rural area. I like
living in a small area because it’s a lot harder to get lost after a few visit, the people in the
community are usually very nice and understanding, and having family in the same area as you makes
seeing them much easier. Though I like living in a small area it also has its down side. Like there
can be a lot of traffic that feels like it will never calm down and the fact that everyone knows
everyone which is not something a person with social anxiety will enjoy. (I don’t really have any
questions) I would also like to thank you for being my mentor and talking to me about all these
topics. I really enjoyed talking with you and hearing you thought on the topics. thanks agian,

of fun working with you and I'm glad you feel like you got something out of the program. If you're
still by your computer, I'm gonna open the wrapping up conversation so you can do the final survey
and close out the program. I wish you all the best in your art and your future endeavors! Best, Kira",,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-01, 00:23: Hey Leah I feel like self care can be such a tough thing to master,
especially once you've left high school and maybe have to balance living in a more self-directed
way, either through working full time or through post secondary education. I know that when I left
home in 2018 and moved to the big city for school, I had a really hard time with the basics. Things
can go sideways and fall apart so quickly when you're not getting enough sleep or eating properly or
drinking too much; it overloads your nervous system and suddenly the smallest inconvenience knocks
you down. Which is of course exactly what happened to me, and I got sick or sad or failed tests
because I wasn't taking care of myself and my body or brain forced me into taking breaks, which
sucks because I should never have let myself get to that point. I went to therapy though, and the
solution that my counsellor and I came up with is kind of brilliant. The root of the problem was
that I had a hard time seeing myself as deserving of care, and it felt silly to make time to eat or
sleep when I felt like I had more important things to do. So, and this is going to sound weird, my
therapist told me to pretend that my body and brain were like a pet, something high maintenance,
like a dog. What kind of monster would starve a dog and work it to death? Not me! Separating myself
emotionally from my physical wellbeing helped with ""system maintenance"" and made me realise how
essential it was to provide the basics that you'd give to a dog: food, sleep, exercise/walks,
enrichment and play activities, etc. Because at the end of the day, self care isn't expensive face
masks and shopping trips, its doing things like going for a walk or watching Netflix that feed and
recharge your brain in healthy ways. So I guess my questions to you are, what are some times that
you feel you would have benefitted from self care? Did you provide it for yourself? What are your
fave self care activities, and do you find it challenging to give to yourself?Mentee 2022-03-07,
16:10: Hi, Kira I hope you are doing better now, I’m glad you were able to get the help you needed.
I also love the sloution you and your counsellor came up. And thank you for sharing this with me.
But to answer your questions I wish I had more self-care in middle school when I had the worst
self-esteem ever, like even when someone gave me a compliment It did not make me feel better because
I thought “I’m not good at all”. I find that I will do this all the time with my art, but I am
working on it. Not really, I didn’t provide myself with much self-care for many reasons, but I am
trying to do better My favorite self-care activity is one that I find works for me is just taking a
break from stressing stuff and going to do something different then what I was working on for way
too long. Like just talking to my siblings or family about random stuff. I know for myself, very
often I forget to do self-care and for the longest time I didn’t think I was aloud too time
management was a big problem one for me because I often tell myself I will go eat once I’m done this
question, it then turns into the whole project or worksheet or anything really, so it becomes I’ll
eat when I’m done or I’ll do it tomorrow. Which of course is not good. Some signs that I had that
indicated I needed to take better care of myself was when I got my first big anxiety attack, which
was a build up from a lot of stress and taking very little care of myself. It was the big sign to me
that I needed to work on how I treat myself, though it can be hard to break bad habits. I know that
bottling up everything doesn’t go well, so it always good to remind myself I am aloud to talk to
someone about it. did you find it hard to get into the habit of doing self-care?Mentor 2022-03-07,
20:34: Hey Leah, thanks so much for sharing all of that with me, and yes, I am doing much better
now! I think self care can be one of the most challenging things in life to master, especially
because people don't talk about it enough, or when they do its more of a joke than something that is
super important. It's awesome that you were able to recognise that you needed to start taking better
care of yourself, but I am sorry to hear that it got so bad. Self-esteem is such a hard thing that I
have definitely struggled with as well, and it wasn't until I got to university that I figured out
how to like myself and stop worrying about what anyone else thinks, although I still struggle some
days. I try to remind myself that realistically, I'm the only person who is going to be with me from
birth to death, so I should try to cultivate a healthy relationship with me. Just like you'd never
stay in touch with a toxic friend or abusive partner, you shouldn't treat yourself like shit. At
least that is what I tell myself. I'm totally the same way with my art, its definitely when I am
most critical of myself, but I try to remind myself that I am kind to others so I am allowed to
extend that courtesy to myself, and that no one will judge my art more harshly than I do. Those
sound like excellent self-care activities, and getting better at time management will happen with
practice! I sometimes find it helpful to set timers on my phone, so if I'm studying for a long time
I'll set one hour timers, and every hour I have to take a 10 minute break to stretch and drink water
or have a snack. Yes, I did find it hard to get into the habit of self-care, but eventually I
realised that not taking care of my body and brain had an immediate impact on how well I did in
school, and because I'm at university and have spent so much money and time on my studies, I just
can't afford to let something as silly as being unkind to myself mess up my grades. I forced myself
to make it a priority, and now with pratice it has become second nature. I've got lists of things to
do when I'm stressed, I know how to eat well, and I'm good at keeping an eye on my brain to know
when to take a break. You deserve to give as much love to yourself as you would to a sibling, a pet,
or a friend, and honestly, you deserve even more love because if you don't fight for yourself, no
one else is obligated to. Always be your own advocate, even against yourself ;) (Ps I'm totally
stoked to keep talking about this, its such a good topic, but if your teacher needs us to move on
just shoot me a message with what to unlock next and I'll get on it asap)Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:21:
Hi, kira I would love too keep talking about this topic, but we do have to start a different one it
can be one that you would like to do. also our teacher wants us to let our mentors know that spring
break is next week for two weeks. We will be taking break for those two weeks... but doing a final
thoughts check-in with our mentors on april 4th or 5th.Mentor 2022-03-16, 11:06: Hey Leah, That's
totally fine thanks for letting me know, I'll open another conversation right now and if we have a
chance to start it before your break that's great, but if not we can try to finish up everything
when you're back. If I don't talk to you before then, I hope you have a wonderful and relaxing
spring break! And i will open the conversation Rural to Urban, I did it with my last mentee and
found it to be an interesting one.",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 20:08: Hey Leah! My name is Kira, and I'm a third year Arts student at UBC, doing
my Bachelor's in English Language and Literature. I'm 22, I've lived in Vancouver for almost 4 years
after moving from a very small town, and I come from a very big family. A few things about me! I
love to read and write (kind of necessary for an English degree lmao) but I also really enjoy most
forms of media for creation. I've been really into crocheting lately and made three hats over the
winter break; I love to paint, even though I don't have much time for it lately. I'm terrible at
sketching, but give me some paints and a canvas and I do okay. I collect house plants, tarot decks,
and books (I'm building my library, which sucks because every time I have to move, I have six heavy
boxes of books). I also love to cook, and worked in a kitchen as a line cook for two years before
starting at UBC, and my boyfriend (who I live with) is a sous chef. So if you ever want good
recipes, I've got tons of those. Other things: I'm also pan! And I go by she/her pronouns, but the
more time I spend in healthy queer spaces in Vancouver, the more I question my own feelings about my
gender. Your name in your bio is listed as Leah, is that your preferred name? I will refer to you
however you prefer:) Anyway, that's me! I'm really looking forward to getting to know you while we

thank you agian for the message, you seem very sweetMentor 2022-02-14, 16:25: Hey Leah, okay great,
works for me! I know you probably will have limited time for the program so we should probably jump
right into it. I know we need to complete Wellbeing and Self Care as well as Finding Inspiration,
but have you decided on the other two conversations you'd like to do? And is there a conversation
that you'd like to start with?Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:47: Hi Kira, Our teacher wants us to start our
conversations next week. we're hoping to have all mentors unlock 'finding Inspiration"", so we'll
hopefully start tuesday. as for what i'd like to start i havn't chosse any yetMentor 2022-02-19,
12:26: Hey Leah, Okay great sounds good to me, I'll go ahead and unlock that conversation and we can
get started over there, and no rush as to which ones you personally would like to explore!",,"Mentor 2022-04-04, 17:27: If you have time, please complete this conversation! It will only take a
moment or two and will allow us to complete our mentor/mentee relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047550124,1047554090,2/9/2022 20:27,"Mentor 2022-02-19, 15:49: Alright so what did you think about this video? Does it remind you about
how you gather ideas for your projects? You could relate it to some of the projects you've done
already or even some future projects you've been thinking about. Also feel free to respond
to/discuss some of the questions posted under the video.Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:56: Mina Shaun’s idea
stood out to me the most, she quotes: “I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in
creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you
bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” She is
saying that to find inspiration you must have a passion or a goal in mind. An incentive is an
excellent way of finding inspiration. Achievability and planning is a crucial factor in discovering
inspiration. If your desire is impossible to achieve, why do it? This idea could apply to my future
where I might switch science fields. Her idea does summarize how I gather ideas for my project. I
find an idea, or theme of a project and I plan and build my way to make it happen. The most recent
project I am making is a dungeon grinder. The incentive to make the game is to explore the other
aspects of coding like graphical user interface, and algorithms. I recently made an algorithm that
generates rooms in a dungeon and a graphical user interface to display a player's health. The video
was alright.Mentor 2022-02-28, 00:21: Alright, very nice connections! I've actually always wanted to
make a computer program that generates dungeon rooms. I'm a super big fan of rpgs like Tunnels &amp;
Trolls and one of my side projects is making an expanded version of it. Would you like to move on to
do some of the other conversation things? Let me know which ones you want to do, or if you have any
extra questions for me.Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:36: Hey Shaun, I was hoping you could open the studying
conversation. A question I have for you is: do you have any advices for making room dungeon
generation? My dungeon generation is some what like the room generation in the game 'Binding of
Isaac' except there's really no variety to the rooms, the rooms are all the same size and shape.
Rooms can open up to other rooms in any direction besides the one you just came from. How would I
add rooms with different sizes without them clipping into other rooms?Mentor 2022-03-02, 15:39: Hey
Kevin, Sounds good, I'll open it up now. To be quite honest, it's difficult to say how to do that
without knowing the programing language you are using. Also, I'm not too familiar with the
techniques people use for that. However, there is a subreddit for developers who do a lot of these
things and discuss cave generation quite a bit. Try checking out r/roguelikedev and see if that
helps you at all.Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:35: Hey Shaun, Our teacher told us that this will be our last
time connecting to our mentors, so I won’t be finishing the conversation, ‘Well-being and self-care'
Thanks for taking the time to be my mentor. I’ve gained a lot of insight about Vancouver,
programming, and studying tips from you. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into your
responses &amp; insight you’ve given me, and it help assure my view in the future. Your responses
are very informational, insightful, and energetic. Again, thank you very much for being my mentor
and take care! : ) KevinMentor 2022-04-06, 03:13: No problem Kevin! I hope you enjoy your path
towards your future goals and that you will be able to utilize some of the advice I have given you
while also learning many new things yourself about university and life after highschool. It was a
pleasure to have a mentee as inquistive as you. Actually, answering your questions helped me reflect
a lot about my own journey too, so thank you :) Good luck! I'm confident you will achieve great
things. Sincerely, Shaun",,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-15, 15:35: Hey Shaun, When I have the opportunity, I'll try networking. Spring break
begins next week, and we'll be having a break for two weeks. On the 4th or 5th of April, we'll have
our final check-in. The rural to urban questions: Prince Rupert is a tiny town, getting around to
places doesn’t take that long. The view at Prince Rupert is very nice, especially at the docks where
you’re able to see the mountains. It’s also a very quiet town, not much happens at all; the traffic
is pretty tame. One thing I dislike about Prince Rupert is that it’s always gloomy and rainy.
Another thing I don’t like about Prince Rupert only offers one internet provider, and it’s terrible.
How is it like living in Vancouver? Is it noisy? It seems like a very busy and active place.Mentor
2022-03-18, 00:23: Compared to Prince Rupert, Vancouver is always super busy especially during 7-9am
and 4-7pm. The quietest time is probably around 11am. Sometimes it takes me 40-50 mins just to drive
the 12km to UBC. Meanwhile taking a bus there would take about an hour and a half. One thing I
noticed is that it's better to take a bus when you are travelling during rush hour because the cars
generally won't move faster than the buses during that time. It can be noisy if you are along the
main roads, but otherwise it's not too loud on the regular streets. To put the size of Vancouver in
perspective, the whole of Prince Rupert could fit in just downtown Vancouver. Downtown is about 1/10
the size of the rest of Vancouver not including Greater Vancouver like Richmond, Burnaby, and Surrey
(all of which is connected by the Skytrain). If you get to live in Vancouver you definitely will
have a lot to explore! After moving there from Chilliwack (which is about 3 times the size of Prince
Rupert) I found how awesome it was to have literally sooooooooooooooooo many food options. Whereas
usually in Chilliwack, there would be only one restaurant for a certain type of cuisine. Being a
coastal city, Vancouver is also super rainy, which is why a lot of people invest in waterproof shoes
or just wear short boots all the time (I've opted for the latter). People also tend to use umbrellas
a lot rather than rain jackets which I found really weird, coming from a small town. I still prefer
to just use my rain jacket, because I really don't like carrying an umbrella around. Last year
during the summer, things were INCREDIBLY hot. Usually in July and August it is quite hot, but last
year was something else. I would highly recommend spending some time in Vancouver over the summer to
explore a bit and get some bearings on what the SFU/Langara campuses are like as well as the
surrounding area. Also, try to familiarize yourself with the transit system and see if it fits your
needs before buying a car or anything like that. Well have a fun spring break! Please let me know if
you have any other questions about anything.","Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:04: Mentor 2022-03-04, 00:49: Hmm, I noticed you commented earlier in this
activity, but I can't seem to see the content. Anyways, what study skills do you think you want to
work on? Which ones do you want to practice for university? Make sure you consider that different
topics may need different approachs (eg. biology vs chemistry vs math). Feel free to ask me about
how you might want to implement certain study strategies or just ask me about how I generally study
and I would be happy to answer!Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:33: Before video: Studying is putting your time
into a subject to gain more knowledge about that subject. When I study subjects that require
memorization, I read over the material until I can remember it without needing any help. When I
study subjects that require application, like physics or math, I do examples or I just watch YouTube
tutorials and try to understand what's going on. Sometimes I would have a study session with a
friend, and we would quiz each other on the material. The strategies that I've been taught to help
study are to use cue cards and read things repeatedly. Video questions: The study methods that I use
are recalling material, examples, and asking/connecting. These methods really help me when it comes
to learning and understanding the subject. The most effective studying method shown in the video is
not to cram. It's evident that cramming before an exam is ineffective; you won't have enough time to
absorb the information. The only thing I would add to these strategies is to have breaks. The
strategies I would want to try out is switching since it’s the only method on the studio I haven’t
done yet. Hey Shaun, I accidentally sent a message without writing anything, which is why you saw
that post. The studying skills that I need to work on are switching and not cramming. I frequently
procrastinate and I want to begin reviewing material throughout the day rather than reviewing only
at night. For subjects like chemistry, I review material more than I do examples and for math I do
more examples than I recall materials. How are your studying methods like? Are you always on the
grind I would like to open from rural to urban conversation.Mentor 2022-03-12, 02:17: Alright very
good insights and introspective comments! Reviewing one's own abilities is a super important part of
developing one's skills, including one's studying skills. In general, my approach to each class is
different. I try to pinpoint what is the main type of studying that I need to practice in a course.
Usually I will come up with one (or more) of the following options: memorization, application of
memorized information, and application of formulae. First and second year biology is mostly
memorization and gradually shifts to application of memorized information, however some classes are
actually application of formulae. This makes it tricky because sometimes you may have a class that
is in a discipline (such as computer science) where you expect it will be the usual application of
formulae, but ends up being just memorization or application of memorized information. So my
approaches to each class will depend on which one I identify as the most important part of that
class. So for memorization, I use a flashcard-like note-taking system (like Cornell note taking
except without the notes summary and following the rules of good flashcards by Dr Piotr Wozniak.
Then I put those flashcards into Anki, a flashcard program that uses spaced repetition to give me
the cards I need to review each day (basically a flashcard scheduler). Application of memorized
information requires the memorization stage to be set and then you can do lot's of practice
questions. Meanwhile application of formulae does not require the memorization stage to be set and
lends itself best to just doing lot's of practice questions. In computer science, I will imagine
that most classes will be ""application of formulae"" classes, but some will likely also be the other
two types. Feel free to use my strategies as I have layed them out for you and ask me any follow up
questions if you are interested in the specific parts! Also lastly, I find an extra great tip is to
put all your assignment deadlines from all classes into your Google calendar and then print that
sheet off. Crossing off the assignments as needed is super satisfying and it is so powerful to know
2-3 weeks ahead of time how your homework assignments and midterm dates will clash.Mentor
2022-03-12, 02:19: Oh yea. Yes, I am always on the grind ;) But I would encourage you to do
networking as it is increasingly becoming important to have business skills in the computer science
field to get opportunities like work and internships.",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-18, 00:26: Hi Kevin. Also, I believe your teacher wants you to complete the
well-being and self care module too, so I've unlocked it for you to complete whenever you are ready.",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 02:05: Hi Kevin! I'm Shaun, your mentor for this term. I noticed you are into
Roblox which is super cool because I was into Roblox too when I was your age. This days I play
Minecraft though. I also noticed that you like computer programming which is awesome. While my
Bachelor of Science was in Biology, I do have quite a few years of computer programming experience
from high school and I have a good general understand of how you can work on computer programming
after high school. What kind of games have you made on Roblox? I'd love to know what projects you've
worked on.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:40: Hi Shaun! Thanks for having the time to be my mentor. My name is
Kevin Nguyen and I have a passion for computer programming. I am excited to learn some
life/university advices from you. I've just skimmed over your profile and it's very intriguing and
awesome why you are majoring in biology. My parents always wanted me to become a doctor, but I've
heard that it takes a very long time to become a doctor which I am not fond of. I am curious, as it
doesn't say in your profile, what got you into computer programming? Again, thanks for having the
time to be my mentor and reading this message.Mentor 2022-02-14, 16:08: Yes, I highly recommend not
going into medicine just because your parents want you to. Doing a Bachelor's of Science in Biology
(or any other med related major) takes up 4 years of your life (as you probably know) and it will be
very hard to complete if you aren't interested in the courses you are taking. Plus after that,
getting accepted into UBC Med or any other Canadian program could add another 1-3 years after your
degree, depending on how competitive your application is. And then when you finally get in, it will
take another 4 years of med school and 2-6 years of residency (somewhere in Canada) before you
become a fully qualified doctor. So yea, a super long time, not taking into account the amount of
time to do volunteering and study for the MCAT. Meanwhile a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
Programming will allow you to do co-op so that you can get paid work experience while you study so
that by the time you finish your 4 year degree, you'll already have work experience. While it's a
pretty competitive field, you can end up getting some big bucks ;) Which universities are you
applying to if I may ask? I realize this advice is probably too late for you, but I've heard that
UBC and Waterloo have really good CompSci programs. I actually got into computer programming in like
grade 6, watching YouTube Tutorials on HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript on this one channel called
thenewboston. Ever since then I took programming courses in school when I could. I was lucky that my
high school had a lot of computer programming and computer networking courses, including AP Computer
Science A. Most high schools in my city didn't have very good computer programming courses which is
why I would have liked to take online courses on Udemy or Coursera for a good challenge. I would
recommend you to sign up for some during the summer while you wait for university to get a head
start on some good programming languages. One of the problems I heard with the first year compsci
courses is that they start with old languages that no one uses in the real world anymore. Also, just
in general, university courses escalate in difficulty very quickly throughout the term so it will be
extremely helpful to have a solid background already. What kind of computer programming courses have
you taken already at your school? I would be very interested to know what opportunities you have
available to you in Prince Rupert.Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:39: Hey Shaun, I had no idea that you could
get work experience while studying. I’ll consider doing that once I get into a computer programming
course. I have little to no experience in other coding languages. I am most proficient in LUA, as it
is used by Roblox. It's inspiring how dedicated you are to your career. Over ten years of studying
is a significant amoiunt of time. Also, our teacher wants us to start our conversations next week.
We’re hoping all mentors unlock “Finding Inspiration” so that we can all start on Tuesday. I've
applied to Langara College and Simon Fraser University. These universities are close to Prince
Rupert, which is why I applied to them. I considered applying to UBC, though I never finished my
application for UBC. During the time I was applying to schools, I had chemistry 12 and biology 12 so
I had little time to work on my applications. My high-school doesn’t offer too many computer science
courses. Our school currently offers two courses. Computer Programming 11, which focuses on the
fundamentals of computer programming. Computer Programming 12, where you apply what you learned in
Computer Programming 11 by creating games. Both courses make use of the software ""Processing,"" which
uses the java programming language. Our school does not offer AP Computer Science classes, or even
any AP classes. I’m just getting used to the website and I didn’t realize you had messaged me over
the weekend. Hopefully this answers your question on the weekend. A friend and I have made an FPS
game called ""Bullet Blitz"". It's a first-person shooting game in which you spawn with a laser gun
and shoot people. ""Bladeswork"" is another game we created. It's a free-for-all sword fighting game
in which you can select different swords with different abilities and fight against other
players.Mentor 2022-02-19, 15:28: That's so cool that you are making your own games! I wish I
learned some LUA so that I could make my own games haha. I'm glad that you were able to get some
computer programming experience at school too. Taking chem 12 and bio 12 is good too so that you
won't have to take extra remedial science classes in university. I remember being pretty stressed
also during the October-January period with all the classwork, group projects, university
applications+essays, and scholarship applications. So I can definitely understand you've had a lot
to do in the past few months. From what my uni friends say, Langara and SFU both have good computer
science programs so it sounds like you are on the right track. Staying close to home can reduce a
lot of expenses for sure, especially rent/residence fees. Also, I have just unlocked the ""Finding
Inspiration"" module. I believe I am supposed to send you a message about it, so we shall see. Feel
free to message me first though if I can't figure it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have opened finding inspiration for you! There is 1 video that we should discuss on however, i think
the website is down so i can't access the video right now. Once the website is okay, i will get back
to it and discuss this with you! Please let me know if you're having the same problem or not. Also,
if you have access to the video, you can also share these with me! - what is the first definition /
meaning of idea that came to your mind after you watch the video? - how do you think ideas can help
you right now / in the future? ( you can relate it to one of your aspirations as well! Like sewing,
fashion, etc 😉) I'll get back to you soon! ~ Clara :)Mentor 2022-02-21, 03:21: Hi Kelly!! I think
the website is fine already:) so i'll also give my opinion on it! For me, after i watched the video
i think the definition or meaning of an idea is something abstract and it can start just as simple
as a feeling. It might even start just as an accident. This idea for me can develop into a creation,
an art like paintings, drawings, etc what do you think:)? And for me ideas can help me in the future
since its where the foundation of our creativity began. For instance, ideas can help me develop a
simple basic blazer into a tailored- one of a kind garment that's authentic to me:) how about you?
What are your thoughts on ideas for your future?:) Take your time to watch and takes notes of the
video if you'd like :) you can respond to this questions anytime 😊Mentee 2022-02-22, 15:59: I
couldn’t hear the video that well, the computer I choose has bad speakers but I will watch it later.
The first thing that came into my head for idea is experience. To have an idea of something you kind
of have to have some experience for it, like reading it some where or it happening in person or
daydreaming about it. I have ideas through emotions I cant explain with words. I think in the future
to help me with ideas I would want to experience more stuff even the simple stuff, I definitely
think ideas help shape how I see things and can help in the future to explain past stuff.Mentor
2022-02-26, 19:28: Hi Kelly! Thank you for your response! I definetely agree with you. Without
experience ideas can't seem to appear. That's very smart of you to think in that POV. When you said
about ideas with emotions, i totally relate with that! Like i always start most of my projects with
what i'm feeling? if that any sense 😅. I put my emotion as part of my project and that's what makes
my projects/ artwork feel personal to me. Hbu? Do you have any projects that starts off just as an
emotion that u felt? Feel free to tell me anything :) Also, i wanna know how you're doing :) how's
school? PS: we can move on to the next topic / external activities if you'd like after this :)Mentee
2022-02-28, 15:35: Ive wanted to do more project with emotions but i dont have the room because i
share a bedroom with my twin. i would definitley do more art works with emotions and drawings too if
i could draw. I plan to save up for an ipad or PC for drawing stuff fashion design and creavity
stuff. I made a nightgown in sewing and i was the only one many years who has done a nightgown. i
thought of my mom when i was making it because she wears them every night. i plan to give it to her
when i move out because i put alot of emotion in it. I definitley put alot of emotions in my
projects too they also become personal and i love it when people understand it without me explaining
it because i know they have experience something simliar and understand the feeling. For school wise
im currently failing chemisty but i talked to my teacher and we made a plan for me so i dont fail
the class. its the first class im failing in all my years of school because the notes and work are
confusing and ive been failing most of my tests and quizzes. When you can, can you please open up
the self care one? i hope you are doing well too and having been creating beautiful pieces! Make
sure to take of yourself and have a good day/night!Mentor 2022-03-03, 16:10: Hi Kelly! Firstly, I'm
impressed that you made a nightgown! Its definetely not an easy thing to do and you managed to do
it! I'm also touched when you mentioned that you were inspired to make the nightgown because of your
mom, it really is sweet of you to do that :) i hope you keep on making your own pieces with amazing
ideas and inspiration, you're doing great! For school wise, i'm glad that you have talked things out
with your teacher to find a way out. I know that school can be tough sometimes especially with
quizzes and tests. But you have a will to make up for it so props to you for doing that! I believe
you've worked hard for it too so i just want to let you know that all of it will not go to waste :)
keep me posted on any school related things that you wanna rant or tell about, i'd be glad to hear
and i hope your chemistry class will be doing great! ~Clara",,,"Mentor 2022-03-17, 17:38: Hello Kelly! I have opened both post-secondary considerations part 1 and

frequently as possible. In this conversation, you can explore on different university paths that you
might like. There is also a website where you can explore on different career paths and even the
statistics of salaries, etc are provided. Also i was just wondering, do you already have plans on

sewing. I also think i will take a cooking course at my local communtity college so i dont burn down
my kitchen. I would also like to thank you for being my mentor and for opening my eyes to college
life and that i can do it if i put my mind to it. You have been a big help for my future and career.

very bad at time mangement, so sometimes i dont even get to do selfcare when i want to. I dont have
anyone to look to up who does self care, my parents think self care is just being lazy thats why im
still learning how to take care of myself. Some signs for me that i need to take better care of
myself is my very low blood pressure and me now needing glasses. I definitaly think self care will
be harder in college because of how much time will be taken from you and friends wanting to hangout
when you need to study and take care of yourself. I hope mid terms go good for you!, mid terms can
be very hard and stressful so take care of yourself! i hope you have a good week!Mentor 2022-03-07,
22:53: Hi Kelly! Firsy of all, how are you? I hope school goes well for you. I definetely agree with
you that self care is really important and yes, its true too that sometimes its just hard to manage
or givr yourself a time to do self care. However i don't want you to worry about this because this
is a common problem that most people have and the only way we learn it is through experience and
time so don't worry! Take it slow and take your time to learn how to do a self care :) And yes,
sometimes people do still think that self care is useless, etc but i want you to know that it is
actually productive! Taking care of yourself, physically and mentally can help you be more
productive irl, and increases your health:) so yea! I just wanna let you know that okay:) Lastly, it
is somehow true that college life can be tough. Especially about the homeworks, tests, or even with
social life (eg: making friends, etc) but as long as you can manage your time (making a time table
maybe?) Everything will be just fine, or atleast better 😉 So before ending this, i just wanna know
how you're doing if you're comfortable telling me! Are you having enough sleep? How's your low blood
pressure? And have you had the time to check with an optometrist? Feel free to tell me anything! I
hope you're having a wonderful week and talk to you soon 😊 ~ClaraMentee 2022-03-10, 16:07: Im doing
okay thank you! its unfortunately my friends one year anniversary for his death today, everyone in
my grade is wearing black and blue to show our support for his family. I did get my frames in
yesterday for my glasses! i just have to bring them to the optometrist and they will send them away
to put my lenses in! i choose a octogen shape for my glasses because no one in my grade has them and
i love being different from everyone i know. My blood pressure has been okay, i went for blood work
last week to get more stuff tested. My sleep schedule has been wacky, i cant stay up from 7:00 am to

pictures of your sewing, garments or anything that you make! I'd be really glad to see it 😉 i'm also
so happy that you're considering to go to a fashion school and i hope i can help you with that since
i'm also in a fashiom school right now :) but until then, i hope we can get along and please don't
hesitate to message me or rant to me anytime you want 😊 ~ Clara :)Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:54: Thank
you for getting back to me! i will definitly show you my capstone plan, i want to make my own
pattern for a skirt and shirt from Hellvaboss, this cartoon series that very unqiue in style and
everything! I want to be able to show that i understand how to make my own pattern and sew it
together! Unfortunately i cant afford the fabric with gradution stuff and my sister broke our very
old sewing machine so im hoping the sewing teacher will allow me to use her fabric and sewing
machine for my capstone. Ms.Dueck wants the finding inspiration unlocked by tuesday at the lastest,

one you're supposed to start with. Please take the time to read through the text and watch the
embedded videos! As for the texts, what really stood out to you from what you read/watched? Feel
free to share anything that comes to mind. Also, if you have any questions or need some
clarification, be sure to let me know! Finally, if you need one final prompt, I'll ask you: what is
something that serves as an inspiration for you? -RayyanMentee 2022-02-28, 15:29: From the quotethat
ws given from Denys Arcand I really understand that you should stick to what you know. For
inspiration means i think of a artistic point of view and i believe you would very much identify
better with your own creation if it was a part of you in a way. Just going along with the world and
what people enjoy you might end up being dissapointed with what 6youve done and spent so much time
working on.Mentor 2022-03-02, 16:34: Hi Kai, A great take! I agree with what you said about trying
to stay true to yourself and your values rather than trying to solely please other people. Be sure
to watch the video, it's only around 12 minutes long, and try to see if you can find a connection to
Denys Arcand's quote! You seem to be on the right track, so it should not be difficult for you. If
you already have watched it, what's one thing that you can easily remember that stood out to you or
was there anything that you wanted to talk about? -RayyanMentee 2022-03-10, 16:50: one thing i
remember from the video was when the man pointed out the tree that always had children climb on it.
That really stuck with me because it was cool looking tree and I like trees. i was told to ask for u
to open up the second activity please thanksMentor 2022-03-12, 11:32: Hi Kai, That sounds great! Is
there anything specific about trees that interests you? Maybe you have a favourite one? Let me know
if there's anything you need help or clarification with about the video before we move on. As for
the next activity, there is an extension activity in the finding inspiration module that I can show
you. It is optional, I believe, and if you aren't interested in doing it, we can move on to a
different conversation. Let me know what you want to go forward with! Enjoy your spring break!

speaking to you over the past while. Goodluck with University hope you do well.Mentor 2022-04-05,
21:27: Hi Kai, I'm glad we got to discuss lots of things! There was no need to finish everything,
what was important was that we tried to create a discussion and learn something new. I hope you have
a great remainder of the year, it was extremely fun and insightful being your mentor. I learned a
lot from talking to you, and I hope you found something to take away as well. Thank you for your
kind wishes, and all the best for the rest of high school! -Rayyan",,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 13:28: Hi there Kai, My name is Rayyan, and I'm extremely excited to be your
mentor for the next few months! I hope we can both learn a lot from this experience. Before I
continue, let me tell you a bit more about me. I am 18 years old, and I am currently studying
engineering. I really enjoy using my spare time to read and play sports. Particularly, my favourite
sport is badminton. What are some things you enjoy doing? One thing I'll share from the icebreaker
activity is a recent piece of music that I have found. It's called Danse Macabre by Camille
Saint-Saëns. (Here's the link in case you want to listen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM). I find this composition really thrilling to hear, and
it always amazes me how this is done without any words whatsoever. Let me know what you think, and
if you have any music that you enjoy as well! Feel free to also complete any other parts of the
icebreaker if that suits you! Let me know if you have any questions, now or at any point. I'll try
to answer them the best I can. Once again, I'm absolutely thrilled to be your mentor, look forward
to the upcoming weeks!Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:27: Greetings Rayyan, I am Kai!!! Thank you for taking
the time to be my mentor. I am looking forward to getting to hopefully talk to you about
engineering.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:38: Greetings Rayyan, im Kai!! Thank you for sharing that piece of
music ill give it a listen when I get the chance. I will be starting my first year engineering in
september, im wondering how you have been finding the workload of the courses.Mentor 2022-02-16,
16:20: Hi Kai! I appreciate your kind words, and I'm thrilled that you're also excited! I'll do my
best to answer all of your questions about engineering, but I'm still learning myself, so it may not
always be the best answer. Since you asked about the workload, it's something I can definitely speak
to. As I'm sure you have heard, the workload in engineering is significant. There are times when you
will have a lot going on. However, you can manage it. You need to be proactive and put in the
effort. I'd suggest trying to find a balance between schoolwork and having fun, so that you never
fall behind in school nor drain yourself out. What that looks like is all up to you! :) It was a bit
challenging to adjust to my first semester, but eventually, I ended up falling into a rhythm and it
was smooth sailing from thereon. Know that the professors are here to help you and that every other
student is also going through the same process, so you're never alone. As you get used to
university, I have heard it becomes easier to manage tougher courses and bigger workloads, and,
surprisingly, you will probably start to do better too! That's all I can think of at the moment. If
you need some clarification or suggestions, please let me know. The most important thing to take out
of this I'd say is the idea of ""getting out what you put in"" (reminds me of the law of conservation
of energy :D). If you are ready to move on to the next part of the mentoring process, just give me a
heads up, and we can do so. -Rayyan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-12, 11:32: Here's the extension activity, in case you wanted to give it a try!Mentee

After the watching the video, I am not quite sure if I agree that with the idea that you need to
plan everything in order for creation to happen. Personally, I feel that my most creative ideas come
about when I am thinking about something else and it suddenly strikes me of a new idea or method of
doing something. My biggest question would probably be how do I more of these creative accidents? I
am curious to know what part of the video stuck out to you? Tell me how your creative ideas and
inspiration comes about! Look forward to hearing from you soon! -PhilipMentee 2022-02-22, 15:54: Hey
Philip, After watching the video, the thing that stuck me the most was when Denys talked about how
authentic things come from the things that we know and from what we experience. I agree and disagree
with the statement because it would be easier to talk about what you know best. But on the other
hand, if you keep to what you know you may get too comfortable and not go outside of your comfort
zone. With me personally I stick to what I know but there is a fear that I won't go outside of my
comfort zone to challenge myself and grow. If I could ask Denys a question, I would ask him if he
ever regretted only sticking to what he knows? My creative ideas come from my experiences and my
surroundings and the willingness to go outside my comfort zone. JordynMentor 2022-02-22, 16:26: Hey
Jordyn! Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the video with me! I too find it a bit of a struggle to
find a balance between comfort and growing as an individual. I think a personal example that
highlights this is when I moved away from home for university. One part of me wanted to stay at home
with my family and friends but another part of me wanted to explore what else was out there and
discover who I was as a person. A question I have for you is what does leaving your comfort zone
mean/look like to you? Feel free to share whatever you feel comfortable with :) Look forward to
hearing from you soon! PhilipMentee 2022-02-28, 15:28: Hey philip When leaving my comfort zone I
like to try to do new things that I am not normally doing. One of those may be hanging out with/
trying to make new friends. Being from such a small town it has been hard for me to hangout with
people outside my core group in both school and out of school settings. Recently this year I have
seen myself go outside my comfort zone in writing. I have been writing about new topics that I do
not know too much about or have been writing about controversial topics. Also our teacher would like
us to start another conversation. Would you be able to open the “career considerations” so we could
start that activity! Thank you Jordyn","Mentor 2022-03-01, 13:18: Hey Jordyn! :) It is great to hear about you writing and exploring
different topics! It will help you grow not only intellectually but also emotionally as a person! :)
I've opened the career considerations conversation for us :). I chose a career in pharmacy because
of the abilities to work in different settings from a pharmacy to an office environment to make a
positive impact on society. Let me know what careers interest you and why! Let me know about the
quiz results you got from above and if they matched or didnt match your expectations! Looking
forward to hearing from you soon! PhilipMentee 2022-03-03, 14:29: Hey Philip The careers that
interest me at this moment are definitely thoe careers in the medical field. I really like to help
others with problems they have or help them figure out what issue they may be having health wise.
The careers that I got from taking the quizlet were secondary school teacher, Recreation, sports and
fitness policy researchers, consultants and program officers and an elementary school teacher.
Secondary school teacher: Demand for the job: High demand Expected salary: 78,210 annually Regions
where work is most needed: Mainland south west, Vancouver and the okanagan. Sports researcher:
Demand for the job: low/high demand Expected salary: 60,962 Regions where work is most needed:
Mainland south west, Vancouver and the okanagan. Elementary school teacher: Demand for the job: high
demand Expected salary: 74,727 Regions where work is most needed:Mainland south west, Vancouver and
the okanagan. I am not surprised that I got these as a result as I envisioned myself being a teacher
ever since I got into highschool. This quiz was definitely eye opening but I would still rather go
into the medical field.Mentor 2022-03-04, 16:48: Hey Jordyn! Thanks for sharing your quiz results!
It is great to hear that the results aligned with your expectations. Out of curiousity, is there a
certain topic or area you are interested in the medical field, say for example research, or
pharmaceutical development or patient interaction? Look forward to hearing from you soon! :)Mentee
2022-03-14, 15:22: Hey Philip, I would really like to go into diagnostic medical sonography to help
those get a diagnosis to a medical problem they may be having. Also our teacher would like us to
start another conversation, would you be able to open the Agency In The World. Our teacher would
also like us to let our mentors know Spring Break is next week for two weeks. We will be taking a
break for those two weeks but doing final thoughts check in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th.",,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 03:36: Hi Jordyn! :) My name is Philip and I currently study pharmacy at
University. In my free time I like to go swimming and try making new foods. I was hoping you could
tell me a bit about yourself! What kind of food do you like? What are some of your hobbies? What is
your favourite class right now? Let me know if you have any questions you would like to ask me! My
door is always open :)Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:36: Hey Philip, I would like to thank you for being my

things in common one being that we both play sports. I look forward to hearing from you.Mentor
2022-02-14, 19:33: Hey Jordyn! That sounds great we both play sports! Out of curiosity, what sport
is your favorite to play or watch? For me personally, I like to watch hockey but I would prefer to
play football. Is there particular experience or information your would like to know about? For
example, we could talk about going to university, moving to a new city and lots of other things! Let
me know if you have a particular topic you are interested in and we can disucss more! Look forward
to hearing from you soon!Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:40: Hey Philip, Sorry about not responding to the old
question. I have been having a bit of trouble figuring out the site but i got it all figured out
now. I can now answer those first questions haha. My favourite food is mashed potatoes and kinda
weird but i like ranch on top. My hobbies include lots of sports and hanging out with my friends. My
favourite class right now is physics but my all time favourite is pre-cal. My favourite sport to
play is hockey and I travel every weekend to play against other female teams as I am on a
competitive female team myself. I also like to watch hockey as it is the sport i love the most. I
would like to talk about how it was adapting to a new place and making new friends and also living
on your own since going to university. Also Our teacher wants us to start our conversations next
week. We're hoping to have all mentors unlock ""finding inspiration"" so that we can start Tuesday!","Mentor 2022-03-15, 02:53: Hi Jordyn! I've opened up the Agnecy in the World discussion for us! I
think the time I felt like an outcast was when I moved to Quebec for university. I felt this way
because I did not know the language and everyone appeared to have their friend groups already made.
I think the biggest thing when feeling like an outcast espcially when you are new, is to recognize
things take time. A quote I think that captures this is, ""Rome wasn't built in a day"". Have you ever
felt like an outcast? If you are comfortable, share a moment or time you had to use grit and
determination to reach a goal. I hope you have a good Spring break! Look forward to hearing from you
soon!Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:26: Hey Philip, I felt like an outcast when playing on an all boys hockey
team and I was one of the only girls. I felt left out a big part of the time and it was very hard
for me to deal with. I overcame these feelings and tried to put myself outside of my comfort zone
and try to connect with the boys. I feel like I have gained more self confidence and I am able to
use that when trying to complete my goals. As a student I have access to lots of help from others
and there are also sites online that I can go to if I do not feel comfortable going to someone I
know for help. I know when to ask for help when I feel like I am very upset or drowning in the
thought of the situation. When asking for help it may be difficult to express all that I am feeling
or scared that the person may tell someone else but I just try to put as much trust as I can into
the person I am seeking help from. I know we did not get much time to discuss the topic but I would
like to thank you for all you have done and the support you have given. This will be my last day
with the program as our class is almost over. I had lots of fun with the activities and I would like
to thank you!Mentor 2022-04-05, 00:45: Hi Jordyn! Thank you for sharing a time you felt like an
outcast with me. I am very impressed with the obstacles and challenges you had to overcome to play
on an all boys hockey team. Thank you for your amazing response through out the term, I truly had a
great experience being your mentor! Please know that if you ever have any questions, do not hesitate
to send me a message through this platform and I will answer as soon as possible! I wish you the
best of luck for the rest of the school year and for your future studies! Bye for now! -Philip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

started... I just had my term exam and I was hyperfocused on trying to pass (fingers crossed!). I
will commit to being better at responding in the future! I've opened this ""finding inspiration""
module. Please watch the 12 minute video on the creative process. My favourite quote is “I believe
creation is always an accident. You have to work hard but in the process, something happens and this
is the essence of creation. It’s something that you cannot plan. You have to do a lot of planning
but what is important is not planned.” from Roch Carrier. I think working hard gets you places, but
there's always an element of surprise and mystery to the results. Let me know what you think! Any

your midterms. I wish you the best of luck!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-06, 12:26: Hey Jonathan, As you've asked, I've unlocked the ""studying"" block. Please
take a look at the videos and let me know if you have any questions!! I always crammed when in high
school, but now that I'm in university, I've found that spaced reptition is way more effective, and
actually ends up saving me a lot of time AND stress. My midterms are now over, fingers crossed they
went well! Hope you have a good week! JoceyMentee 2022-03-17, 15:37: Hi Jocey I have watched the
studying video and here is my thoughts and personal stratigies I use. Studying for me is usually at
a later time at night, I have always seemed to procrastinate and hold off untill the final days
instead of spliting it up. I know to most that sounds like a bad thing but I find that for myself it
works out quite well. In school we are always taught to study for about an hour a day and to not
procrastinate. I personally think that your studying should be based around you. For example I tend
to read things one day and a couple days later I will forget almost every drop of information i had
read that day. This is why i feel that holding off untill the last couple days works for me just so
all the information is still fresh in my head. Some of the best skills and strategies I find very
useful that the video used are taking notes and being able to manage the time that you use for
studying. I think it is highly likely that I will try managing my time better. Hope you are having a
Great week!Mentor 2022-03-20, 19:00: Hey Jonathan, I used to study in a very similar way to you!
When I started college however, there's just so much content, that it's really hard to cram all the
information you need to know right before the midterm. So, I started spaced repitition studying, and
also really like anki flashcards. I'm also a big fan of taking notes and really managing my time
wisely, so I think those ideas are great strategies to try for studying. At the end of the day, it's
whatever works best for you... Just make sure to try new techniques out! I've heard through the
grapevine you're going on sping break. Hope you have a great time off! When you finally read this
message, please let me know what conversation you want to open next!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 14:04: Hey Jonathan!! My name is Jocey, it's great to (virtually) meet you! I'm
not a huge fan of the icebreaker activity so I figured I'd just say hi instead. I'm currently living
in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, and I'm in my first year of medical school through UBC. It's kinda
intense but I really like it... I also love the ocean! I grew up in the Kootenays (BC) and I think I
still like the mountains (and skiing and snow) more than the beach though. From my understanding
you're in Grade 12? How's that going? Any plans post-graduation? Let me know when you've read

Depending on the career you go into, some of the lessons you're learning right now will be highly
relevant, while others will not. Something to keep in mind, is the fact that no matter what you're
learning, it is developing your brain and your ability to grasp new concepts. The complicated
physics or math concepts may be completely irrelevant to your career choice, but they help build
connections within your brain to be able to handle other difficult topics! I hope this helps a bit

what you truly belive in. If you work on your passion, your work and results will be stronger. My
feelings are the same as the video. I think follwoing your passion is the best way to get things
done. ""“If I want to do something truly authentic … I should stick to what I know, to what’s
happened to me. I only work from inside of me, from what I am truly experienced in.” One questiion I

easier, more enjoyable, and honestly more effective. Like you said, it may not always be obvious how
some of your passions lead to success. However, there is always an alternate way of looking at it.
For me, I do not want to become a pro skiier. However, by following this passion on my weekends, I
am a more effective worker when I return to my desk during the week. I find it helpful to reflect on
things like this. So, as an exercise, how do you think some of your hobbies/ passions help you

patterns. I sometimes feel that it can be hard to stick to a good schedule, but when I do, I am
really able to see the benefits. A good 8hr sleep makes me happy, allows me to focus, and gives me
energy. I thought I would share the following video with you...

is not as good as when i have a good sleep.Mentor 2022-03-10, 20:05: Yes unfortunately I can relate.
It's rough, especially when the days are so short. Do you know why it is hard for you to get enough
sleep? Is it because you find it hard to fall asleep? Do you have a lot of thoughts going through
your mind when trying to fall asleep? If this is the case, I have a few recommendations that really
help me.Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:19: I do have issues falling asleep everynight, I find my mind races
right before bed and I get worried about things i can't control. I try to get in bed before 10:00pm
every night but then i end up falling asleep around 11:30-12:00 which is exactly the problem. I
would love to hear some of your recommendations for falling asleep. Aswell our teacher wants us to
let you know that spring break is the next two weeks. We will be taking a break for those two
week...but doing a final check-in with our mentors on April 4th or 5thMentor 2022-03-23, 09:57:
Thanks for sharing! Trouble falling asleep is so incredibly common. Two things I'd recommend are:
(1) The 'Calm' app - This app has sounds/ stories that help you fall asleep. I've used this app (or
other sleep aid YouTube videos) in the past and have always fallen asleep within 15 minutes. It is
great for those nights when you are stressed because you have a big day comingup, but you know you
need sleep. (2) I once heard that if you stay completely still for 15 minutes, your body will be
forced to fall asleep. Whether this is true or not, I've used this as a sort of meditation before
bed, and it always makes me more sleepy! Other things that affect sleep, and overall well-being and
self care, include caffeine intake, eating habbits, and light exposure. I hope this helps! Also,
thanks for letting me know about the break! I hope you enjoy yourself :) With our last check-in
coming up soon, I am not sure we have time to start another conversation. Nevertheless, I want to
wish you the very best. I can tell from your detailed replies that you are dedicated to your own
personal growth - this is something that you will be able to count on for years to come. Please, if
you have any lasting questions please let me know early April :)",,"Mentor 2022-02-12, 19:42: Hey Jake! My name is Sarah, I am excited to be your eMentor this semester
:) To tell you a bit about myself, I love skiing and mountain biking. My favourite food is my
homemade neapolitan pizza using a family recipe that has been passed down for generations. What are
some of your favourite hobbies? We have a few conversations to go through, do you have a preference
with one that you'd like to start with?Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:34: Hello Sarah! Thank you for taking
your time to be a mentor. I also love skiing and hiking. I have been skiing for most of my life at
our local ski hill. I have a passion for music especially guitar music and have also been playing
guitar for most my life. I think my favourite food is probably sheperds pie . I dont have a
preference for conversations but i would like to learn about the transition to university from
highschool and the struggles you faced.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:40: Hi Sarah! Thank you for being a
mentor. I also love skiinng and have been skiing most of my life at our local ski hill. I have been
playing guitar for most of my life aswell and really enjoy it. My favourite food is shepereds pie,
it brings back good memories. I am interested in learining about the transiton from high school to
university and the change in lifestyle. Thanks againMentor 2022-02-16, 22:05: Awesome, it's cool
that we share a hobby! What kind of skiing do you prefer? Fresh cords (aka groomers), gladed trees,
park? Thanks for sharing your interest in the transition from high school to uni :) Do you know what
you would like to study?",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-23, 10:19: Jake, I thought we could both do this activity to come up with actionble
goals that will make a long-term difference. My self care actions are... (1) Eat healthy meals - How
I will make this a part of my life is to pre-make my breakfast and lunch the night before. (2) Get
more sunlight (Vitamin D) - How I will make this a part of my life is to spend at least 30 minutes
outside 5+ days a week. This includes going skiing, running, walking my dog, etc. (3) Get more sleep
- How I will make this a part of my life is to stop drinking coffee (or other caffinated drinks)
after 4 pm, and sticking to a regular sleep schedule. I will limit the amount of Netflix/ YouTube I
watch before bed as this often keeps me up. (4) Touch in to my creative side - How I will make this
a part of my life is to dedicate time to turn off screens and do some sort of art or creative
writing. If you want to go above and beyond, and truly stick to these goals, I would write them out
on seperate sticky notes, and put them on your mirror so that you have to look at them everyday.
This is called an 'accountability mirror'.",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-23, 10:23: Lastly, if you have extra time, please go over this list and explain your
comfort level with these tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047514156,1047554104,2/9/2022 20:21,"Mentor 2022-02-20, 15:51: Hi Vanessa! So two things spoke to me in the video. One was from Mina Shum
(the first filmmaker) saying ""as long as it does something for you, you have to just trust that at
some point that will translate to other people."" The other piece was from Denys Arcand (the second
filmmaker) discussing how he works from within. Those lines resonated with me because that's kind of
how I saw being interested in psychology. People asked me why and it was always hard to find the
answer for that, it just kind made sense when the idea of pursing psychology came to me. And
thankfully it stuck throughout my undergrad until now. I think we're quite lucky to know what we
want before starting university because from my personal experience it helped me stay focused and
motivated when things got overwhelming and stressful. Even now with my jobs, it helps keep me
grounded when things get stressful because I know I am contributing to my future plans. Hearing from
my old roommate, she was someone who wasn't super sure about what she wanted to pursue in
university, so she had a difficult time because she didn't see an endpoint/goal to it. But that's
not to say that it won't be difficult because you have a goal in mind because as you probably
already know it can get quite intense. Also not to say that you cant change your mind as you go
through your univeristy journey because that's another part of uni, learning about other
perspectives, seeing what's out there, and that is why we have electives. Having that idea of what
you want to do in the future or just something within you that seems like a ""calling"" or something
you're passionate about, really using that to your advantage will be something that will help you
through your university journey as that is one of the things that I believe helped me! :) How about
you, what pieces/lines spoke to you in the video?Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:51: Hi Jihanne! I liked the
idea you shared, and I agree that even now, before university, knowing what I wanted to do helps me
stay motivated and disciplined when I’m overwhelmed. An idea that I agreed with was from Mina Shum
when she said, “I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in creation, you start with an
intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You
have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” I feel like, deep down, everyone has a
desire or purpose they are trying to fulfill through their actions, even if they are unaware of it.
I hope that if I follow my purpose, I will live contently and feel satisfied with my life
decisions.Mentor 2022-02-24, 11:02: Hi Vanessa! That is such a great point, especially highlighting
that we just may not be aware of our purpose at this moment! I agree that we all have a purpose and
part of uni (and maybe even gaining other life experiences in general) is exploring which will help
us figure out our own purpose. Some people are just able to determine it sooner than others but we
all just have to realize that we all have our own timelines. Side question: Were you able to read my
response to your question about becoming a research assistant? It should be under the ""In activity
Program Instructions"" tab, right under the ""In activity Finding Inspiration"" tab. Just to warn you,
my answer is a bit long... Hopefully it's not too overwhelming but feel free to just read it, you
don't need to respond to it so we can focus on this conversation. I just wanted to make sure you
know it's there.Mentee 2022-02-24, 17:48: Hi Jihanne! I did not get to read your response yet since
our teacher wanted me to focus on the activity but will read that now :DMentee 2022-02-24, 18:11: Hi
Jihanne! Thank you so much for your response. Even though I knew I wanted to work as a clinical
psychologist, I never really knew the steps towards that other than the schooling needed, so this
gave me a lot of clarity. The graduate programs I'm interested in taking after my bachelor's are
really competitive, and I heard it's normal to not be accepted until your second or third round of
applications, is this true? I've kind of been worried thinking about it. I was also wondering if you
had any advice on building relationships with professors? I'm scared that I'll kind of 'get lost in
the crowd' at university since the class sizes are so much larger and everyone is so capable, and
then it will feel out of the blue if I ask a professor to supervise me and then they reject me
;(Mentor 2022-02-26, 16:07: Hi Vanessa! No worries at all. It is important to just focus on one
conversation at a time. So let me know if you want to continue with the inspiration conversation. I
have heard it is competitive because there's only so many slots available and many applicants. I am
currently trying to better my resume for applying to clinical psych, so I share those worries. I'm
not entirely sure about getting in only on the 2nd or 3rd go. I've known of several people who got
in in their first try. One of the key pieces is getting research experience because that is one of
the main things that potential supervisors look at. So it is good that you're thinking about it so
early in advance! I think building a relationship with profs depends too because I've built
relationships with profs through going to their office hours regularly and getting their help, and
that shows that you care about learning. In universities with bigger class sizes, that is one of the
key things you can do is make yourself known by going to their office hours, even if they just
recognize their face. With my own thesis supervisor, I didn't really know her but she was just eager
to have students do research. So profs can just be very engaging in that sense. I have personally
experienced a prof that I liked say no to becoming my supervisor and to be completely honest, it did
not feel so good, even though I know she said no because she was already supervising another student
and she only had room for one student. It was hard not take it personally but I just had to remind
myself that it isn't personal. If a prof does say no, I am sure it would be for something totally
unrelated to you. As I'm sure you know comparison never helps, so I hope you don't go into it
thinking everyone else is more capable. Again I feel that because when people contribute in class, I
would always think ""wow I would've never thought of that"" but we have to remember that we all have
our strengths, and even a prof seeing your effort and determination are strengths!Mentee 2022-02-28,
15:42: Hi Jihanne! Thank you for your advice. It’s really helped me feel prepared for uni and what
steps I have to take, which is very reassuring. Our teacher is letting us pick which conversation to
unlock next so I was thinking “Studying”? I know the workload will be significantly larger than in
high school and I’m kind of worried about the adjustment, especially since I haven't taken any AP
classes before so I'm not familiar with super difficult, heavy courses.Mentor 2022-03-02, 03:45: Hi
Vanessa! I will unlock the Studying conversation for us and we can discuss the workload difference
in that convo.",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 04:22: Hi Vanessa! So determining a study schedule/habit and note taking
techniques that works for you is really important because unlike in high school, the time you spend
in class is focused on the lectures. So there is a lot of time outside of class that you will have
to dedicate to studying and completing assignments/papers. Most times, professors will share their
lecture slides with the class through an online portal, and so what has worked for me is that in
class, I would focus on writing down what the prof says as opposed to writing down what is on the
slides. This saves you having to write everything and you can focus on pieces that are not on the
slides. Then after class, I would combine my written notes of what the prof said and the lecture
notes into a word document. I also make flashcards. I would then keep adding to the word docuement
and keep making flashcards after every lecture so when it is closer to the midterm, I will have all
my notes compiled already and I can focus on studying. I also make sure to ask the prof any
questions I encounter after compiling my notes so that I am fully understanding the concepts as we
progress along the different topics. In terms of how heavy the courses can be, this does depend on
the class, but what I think makes it different from courses in high school is you do not get class
time to work on your assignments or to study for tests/exams. So a lot comes down to your own time
management. At the beginning on the semester, you will be given a syllabus for each class that will
contain all your due dates for your assignments and the dates for your exams. I suggest making sure
to write that on a physical calendar or a digital calendar so you know all the important dates and
can plan accordingly when you need to start assignments or when to start studying. So one of the
good things about uni is that you create your own schedule. There are required courses and a
specific number of courses that you have to complete, but you usually create your own schedule every
semester, meaning you can decide how many courses you take at a time. I personally took 5 courses
per semester in order to complete my degree in 4 years, but it is not uncommon to take less courses
per semester. Although it would extend the time you complete the degree (it is very normal and quite
common to complete a degree in 5 years), it will allow you to dedicate more time onto each course or
if you are also planning on working during the school year then your worklaoad wont be as
heavy.Mentee 2022-03-03, 15:04: Hi Jihanne! Thanks so much for your advice and it was really
helpful! Wow not having class time to work on assignments will definitely be an adjustment but
learning more through this program makes me excited to go to uni and experience all these things for
the first time! Also do you have any advice on having a good school life balance? I don't know if
this would fall into the conversation of well-being or self care and we'd have to unlock it first.
But since we get to make our own schedules and are responsible for it, how do you avoid feeling
burnt out or not overworking yourself and making time for friends and making new friends? I'm opting
for a single room when I go to uni and I'm also generally a quiet and introverted person so I'm kind
of scared that I'll be lonely since I'm going to be so far away from home and my friends are also
going far away too.Mentor 2022-03-03, 17:17: Hi Vanessa! No worries at all! I am happy to share this
all with you, and I'm glad that it is making you more excited! Was there any study or note taking
tips mentioned in the videos above that you are already doing or are wanting to try? To be
completely honest, I may not be the best person to answer the question about school-life balance
because I was very focused on my academics during my time in uni. Not to say that it is a bad thing
because time and effort does pay off with good grades. But when applying to grad school they do also
look at extra-curriculars. I feel like the extra-curriculars like research would still count as
school so if we're thinking social life and de-stressing activities then striking a balance can be
hard there too. I did have a roommate when I was in uni so it helped make it feel less lonely but I
too am an introvert. I think making sure you stay connected with family and friends can help. And
some friendships just come naturally too when students have the same class, so don't be afraid to
approach your classmates, even if it is for a school related question. From there, a friendship can
grow too. Most schools also have clubs not just for different majors but also for different
interests, for example my school had a music club and a board games club or even ones for a cause
(ex. WUSC which supports young people all over the world). And you are right, we can discuss this
futher in the self-care and well-being conversation!Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:41: Hi Jihanne! Not going
to lie watching that video made me realize that I do not study that effectively ToT. I usually cram
all of my studying before a quiz or test but I usually go over my notes and do flashcards. I know
cramming is definitely the more stressful route and if I just managed my time better I wouldn't have
to cram. I want to try spacing out my studying more, using concrete examples, and doing the ask,
explain, and connect method. Thanks for your advice and I'll try to look into some clubs and
extracurriculars the uni offers so I can join them at the start of the year! Looking forward to the
self-care and wellbeing activity :DMentor 2022-03-08, 01:40: Hi Vanessa! That's totally okay! That's
why these resources exist (definitely save the link for them in case you want to look at them again
in the future) and I'm glad you were able to pick up on new techniques from the video. Hopefully you
can start practicing them now and see if they work for you! No worries at all about the advice :)
Was there anything else you wanted to discuss in this topic or would you like me to unlock the
self-care and well-being conversation?Mentee 2022-03-10, 16:21: Hi Jihanne! I can't think of
anything else I would like to discuss on this topic so I think it'd be okay to unlock the self-care
and well-being conversation :DMentor 2022-03-12, 20:42: Hi Vanessa! Alrighty, I will unlock it for
us!",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-12, 21:01: Hi Vanessa! So as you already pointed out earlier in our conversation,
with you being in charge of your own schedule, there may be a tendency to overwork yourself and burn
out. Ideally, you won't get to that point but if academics are really important or if you are trying
to do everything all at once, it can happen which is normal and that's why these topics/resources
exist. In my opinion, it comes down to time management and also knowing your warning signs. As the
article provided, it can even start with how you build your schedule, a course load of 4 class can
be different from 5 class, depending on the class. I believe this is something that all universities
have, but with UNBC we have this thing called the Add or Drop date where the first 2 weeks you have
the opportunity to add or drop classes without any academic or financial penalty, so you can get a
feel for your classes and see if you can manage it as is or add/remove one. In terms of warning
signs, that is a very personal thing that you are already aware of. For myself, I find that if I am
easily distracted, like the example in the video going to random websites, or when I am writing and
I am not able to add anything to the page, those are some of my signs that it is time for a break.
One thing you can also do to avoid burn out or not even reach the point of your warning signs is you
can have a more concrete schedule of when you'll do something fun or engage in physical activity.
For myself, I used to have a cut off of when I need to go to bed, regardless of where I am in what
I'm working on because I know that if I keep losing sleep, it could damage my health in the long
run. How about you, do you have anything you do that you have decided is for self-care? Out of
curiosity, I'm just thinking about your question about burn out, do you find that you are focused
too much on academics/extra-curriculars in high school that you are experiencing some
burn-out?Mentor 2022-03-12, 21:03: Sorry I meant to say: *In terms of warning signs, that is a very
personal thing that you may already be aware ofMentee 2022-03-14, 16:10: Hi Jihanne! Honestly, I
don't really know what my exact warning signs are ToT. I feel like I just get distracted easily and
sometimes I find it hard to do work in my room because I get tempted to just nap in bed. I will try
to be more reflective when I find myself getting distracted so I can become aware of what triggers
it :D In terms of burnout, I definitely feel like my life just revolves around school, work, and
dance classes right now. It's not that all these things are unmanageable, I'm just bad at managing
it ToT. And I know that I don't have a lot on my plate, because I know there are people who work,
have school, are in three clubs, and still make time to study and do well in school. I just feel so
unmotivated almost for no reason? Because I like my job, I like dancing and the dance competitions
our studio competes in, and I want to get good grades in school and I enjoy learning. But sometimes,
especially right now, I feel like I can't bring myself to do any of it anymore. I love these things
and I do get joy and satisfaction from making progress on all those things. But the motivation just
isn't there even though those things are important to me. It's a little confusing and I might sound
weird because how can you not do the things you need to do for the things that you want? I don't
know if this is just because I'm in my last year of high school and it's ""senioritis"" but yeah. I
don't know I'm just having trouble right now because I can't really stop doing any of them you know?
Like I can't just stop attending classes and doing assignments or else I'll fail and I need my job
for money and we have dance competitions coming up in the next two months so I can't just drop out.
So I feel a little stuck and then I feel guilty for taking mental health breaks and not doing
homework for some days because I feel like it just contributes to my stress in the future, so I feel
like I should just work until I get it done instead. Sorry for ranting, I don't know if this kind of
feeling is relatable or common for people or if I'm just struggling for no reason LOL but hopefully
I'll just magically have a change of mindset and be able to be productive again :DMentee 2022-03-14,
16:10: Mentee 2022-03-14, 16:20: Also our teacher wants us to let our mentors know that Spring Break
is next week for two weeks. We will be taking a break for those two weeks but doing a final thoughts
check in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th. Also sorry if I commented the same thing twice the
wifi has been buggy at our school.Mentor 2022-03-16, 02:41: Hi Vanessa! That's fair, but it seems
like you do have an idea of your warning signs, which is good! Honestly, this idea of warning signs
was introduced to me through this program so maybe it's not a common enough thing but it's good that
we have become aware of it because it is an important aspect of self-care, listening to what your
mind and body need. Don't be sorry about ranting, and thank you for sharing! Of course, only share
what you feel comfortable with. But I relate to what you're saying 100% As you know, grad school can
be really competitive, and so I'm working multiple jobs to beef up my resume and also for money. And
I am enjoying what I am learning from all these experiences and I know I need to do these things to
help me get into grad school for the career that I want. But for the longest time now, I haven't
been very motivated and focused, which doesn't make sense because I know I have to do it and I do
enjoy most of it. Sometimes I blame it on probably just being tired of doing something so similar to
school which I've been doing for a while, sometimes I blame it on the lack of structure because
there's minimal supervision, and I also mostly work from home. So sadly, I don't have the answer to
why this is a thing since this is something I am trying to figure out myself. But I hope we can take
comfort in the fact that it's probably not just us feeling this way. I'm sure it's pretty normal to
have this disconnect in what we want to do vs. what we are doing. Maybe it is something like
""senioritis"", I haven't been a senior in a while haha so maybe talk to your friends and see if
they're experiencing the same thing too. But one thing I do believe is important is that we
shouldn't feel guilty about taking mental health care breaks because pushing ourselves too much may
just make it worse, it might take away the joy from these activities. I guess this is where
listening to your needs come in again. Once I find that I can't focus, I try to do something else
for a little bit that is not work-related. If all of that, including dance, is starting to feel like
work to you, and you're feeling overwhelmed, I would say it's important to do something (ex. a
hobby, some down time) that doesn't feel like work even for just a little bit like 15 minutes. But
if those mini breaks aren't enough, then definitely consider talking to your parents about it too to
get another perspective on how to lighten the load. Also thanks for letting me know about the plan
for the next couple weeks, hope you have a good break! :)Mentee 2022-03-17, 15:25: Hi Jihanne! Thank
you so much for your response and advice. It really does feel reassuring to know that other people
feel this way too and I'm not just crazy haha. But I will definitely try to go a little easy on
myself and find things that bring me joy without any ulterior motives. To be honest, when we first
started this program I was a little hesitant and uneasy. Not because of you or anything, but this
was just going to be such a new experience since I've never had a mentor to regularly converse with
before so I was doubtful of how helpful this would be. But over the past weeks, I've learned so much
and our conversations have really helped me mentally prepare myself for this new life I'll be living
in a couple of months. I can't express how helpful this experience has been and I feel very lucky to
have you as my mentor. I look forward to our next conversation in two weeks! :DMentor 2022-03-20,
02:22: Hi Vanessa! It's my pleasure! It was quite reassuring for myself too to hear that I'm not
crazy either haha :) and it is something that others experience as well. And yes, we definitely need
to help ourselves in any way we can in such confusing times, and one way I think is for sure being
nicer to ourselves! I totally understand the hesitation there. It is kind of an odd thing to receive
advice and open up to a stranger, so I'm quite grateful to you for trusting me right away as it
definitely helped this go very smoothly. And I hope I was able to provide you with some answers. Of
course everyone's experience is different and yours will be different too, but hopefully sharing my
experiences and point of view helped even a little. I want to thank you as well for being a
receptive, active, and open mentee! This was a wonderful experience! Please do confirm this, once
you return from your break, are we meant to start a new conversation? (I am a bit confused on this
because the initial email said we need to finish 4, but the recent announcement from your teacher
said 3 conversations) If so, let me know which conversation you would like to start next. If not, if
we are meant to close on this mentoring experience, please let me know and feel free to ask me any
final questions :)Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:14: Hi Jihanne! Yes, this mentoring experience has been
tremendously helpful for me while I'm navigating the path I want to take in the future so thank you
so much! And we are not unlocking the fourth conversation because my teacher doesn't think we have
enough time so this is the end ;( To close on this mentoring experience, I would just like to thank
you for all of the knowledge and advice you have shared with me these past few weeks! This has truly
been such a great learning experience and I appreciate how thoughtful and compassionate your
responses were. I hope life treats you well and maybe will run into each other in the industry
someday! Take care :DMentor 2022-04-04, 22:26: Hi Vanessa! Thank you for all the kind words! And I
want to thank you as well for trusting me in the sense that you shared your personal experiences as
well as in being so open to what I shared with you. I'm very happy to hear that this experience was
beneficial for you. Good luck on your senior year and your journey towards post-secondary! And yes
perhaps we'll run into each in the future! Take care as well. I wish you all the best! :)",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 13:54: Hi Vanessa! My name is Jihanne, and I will be your mentor during your time
in this program. I just wanted introduce myself, and in reading your profile, point out some of the
things we have in common! So I too am of Asian descent. I was born in the Philippines and I moved to
Canada when I was 12, so I've been in Canada for 10 years. I understand your request to be matched
with someone of similar history because being an immigrant and a child of an immigrant is a unique
experience that shapes all aspects of our lives. Another thing I noticed is that your interested in
psychology and well-being! I graduated with a degree in Psychology last year. So definitely ask away
whatever you want to know about the program, or university experience in general! Anyway, tell me a
bit about yourself. How did you get interested in Psychology?Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:49: Hi Jihanne!
I'm super excited to start this mentoring experience with you! I started getting interested in
Psychology when I was really young because both my younger brothers have autism so my life has
always been influenced by mental illness and disorders. Since our family lives in a rural area, my
brothers don't have access to all the resources they need, especially when it comes to aid and
accomodation in the education system. So I wanted to research more about autism and other spectrum
disorders so kids like my brothers can get access to better resources for their learning. I read
through your profile and I also like sitcoms! My favourite is Superstore, have you watched it too? I
started watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine recently and am on season 2 and really like it so far! I feel
super lucky to have such a knowledgeable mentor with career goals similar to mine. I look forward to
learning from you in the future :D -Vanessa :DMentor 2022-02-15, 20:53: Thank you for sharing that.
It's great how proactive you are, so they are very lucky to have you as an older sister! I totally
get that with coming from a smaller community myself, there's not a lot of health care resources,
let alone mental health care resources accessible to us. So is your interest in Psychology focused
on ASD? And yes, I've seen Superstore as well! I've been meaning to watch the latest season on
Netflix! I'm very excited to be able to share my experiences, which can hopefully make your
post-secondary journey a bit easier. Feel free to ask me whatever, which you can do now or anytime
as we go along the program! Also, let me know when you want to start the program. I believe your
teacher would like us to do ""Finding Inspiration"" and ""Well-being and self-care"" as well as 2 other
conversations of your choosing. So let me know which one you would like me to unlock when you're
ready!Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:44: Hi Jihanne! Hope you enjoy watching the last season of Superstore!
Although I was sad that it ended, I found the ending satisfying and started rewatching it from the
beginning again :D Yes, I am interested in ASD as well as child development and trauma. I would love
to know how you got your position as a research assistant because I have been wondering what the
process for that is like post grad and applying for those positions and stuff. Our teacher wants us
to start our conversations next week. We are hoping to have all mentors unlock “Finding Inspiration”
so that we can start on Tuesday.Mentor 2022-02-20, 15:19: Hi Vanessa! I'm sure it will be a good
ending! I'm excited to see it! And I totally get that, I only really like watching sitcoms and I
always just rewatch ones that I like :) Nice, that's really cool that you know specifically what you
want to get into within the field. I personally was not that aware of what I wanted when I started
my degree, and even now I'm still trying to figure out my focus. For sure, so as you may have read
in my profile I work for 2 professors. So the first professor was actually my Honours Thesis
supervisor. I'm not sure if you're aware of that but an Honour's Thesis is how you can get research
experience in your undergraduate degree. So that process usually starts with finding a professor
that is willing to supervise you. It is usually done on the last year of your undergraduate degree,
and you usually jump on an existing project that the professor has or if they have the time/capacity
you may be able to develop a project with them. So my personal experience, it happened during COVID
and we did a study on doing experiments online because we couldn't test in person. So I was able to
do the research on this topic, design and program the study, and also test participants remotely.
And of course there is the thesis portion, which is essentially a research paper/lab write up.
Another cool thing about Honours is that your degree will say Honours in Psychology instead of Major
in Psychology! So Honours is really important if you are interested in research and if you are
thinking of grad school because it is required in most grad programs. But you can definitely start
early with research and volunteer as early as your 1st or 2nd year and I highly recommend that. It
is better to start early, but I personally started when I was in my 3rd year of university. Profs
will usually say if they have ongoing research or even if they don't most profs will talk about
their research and if you find it interesting, definitely don't be afraid to ask them how you can
get involved in their lab. Getting these jobs is essentially building a network. So my Honours
supervisor was able to see that I am capable, independent, and trustworthy so it was almost a
natural next step to hire me as her research assistant (RA) because I was taking a few years off
before continuing with more school. But even if there is a specific professor you want to work for
and let's say not your Honours supervisor, getting these experiences early on during your undergrad
is very important so you can build up your resume and your network. Then my second job as an RA came
about through the network that I have built. So my Honours supervisor told me that a professor was
looking for an RA and my supervisor was able to vouch for me essentially, and I was able to meet
with this other professor who is in the Health Science department. So building that network is
really important and definitely don't be afraid to ask how to be involved because profs are
researchers, that is half of their job so they are most likely very passionate about it and will be
excited about someone who shares the same passion. Sorry if that was super long... I think telling
you about Honours was necessary as it is a really important part of the process. There are a few
more details about the Honours thesis that I wasn't able to add like having a GPA requirement, it is
different in every school, but I can expand on how it is at UNBC if you would like. Hopefully I
didn't overwhelm you... Really the main points are start early by volunteering in a lab, and doing
your Honours is important if you are interested in research/grad school, and do not be afraid to
approach profs! :) I will unlock Finding inspiration for us to start!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspiration"". In this session, let's talk about where do inspirations come from and how do they
affect our life. Please watch the vedio about 5 filmmakes and read their excerpts, and feel free to
tell me your thoughts about it and your experience about finding inspirations in daily life. Be
happy and safe. YimingMentee 2022-02-23, 16:24: I think the video gave a lot of insight into how
varied each individual person’s creative processes are. I found the video to be helpful for giving
me different ideas on how to find ideas and methods of tackling creative projects. But I especially
related to Zacharias Kunuk’s method of finding inspiration from observing his surroundings and
trying to investigate the intricate details. I find that my method of finding inspiration is pretty
similar. I enjoy looking at natural phenomena and further investigating the details and patterns
present in flora and fauna. Beyond looking to nature for inspiration I really enjoy looking at
architecture and investigating the details and trying to figure out why certain design choices were
made, sort of like a puzzle. What kind of things do you do to find inspiration when you’re stuck? Or
what kind of things inspire you to create?Mentor 2022-02-24, 00:22: Hello Tommy, Thanks for your
amazing share! It is a good start to think about principles and correlations behind an objective to
seek for inspirations. Really reasonable and scientific. I think I prefer to be a ""quick learner""
when looking for inspirations. When I am facing a task, I would like to google the information on
the website, and search for successful examples which I can reference. For instance, now I am
designing a virtual poster for an art organization in Vancouver. First, I search for their previous
design productions to learn about their favorable styles, and then search and compare various
high-quality posters from different organizations to see if I can learn something from them. In this
way I can hone my skills and accumulate fundamental knowledge in a short term. I don't know if it
works for you. It is super cool to see different people have different ways to find inspirations. My
question for you at this time is: how do you think the way you find inspiration can affect your
future (choose what major or conduct what kind of career)? You are encouraged to ask me any
questions you have as well! Cheers, YimingMentee 2022-02-28, 16:53: Hi Yiming, Thanks for sharing.
Personally I use the internet quite a bit for certain projects as well and looking for similar
projects is a really good method of finding inspiration. I think the way you find inspiration can be
very indicative of the way you think and process information. And that could definitely inform the
kinds of careers that you may be interested in or better suited for. As for my questions: What kind
of experiences do you have with doing digital art? For our next conversation which topics would be
available to open? Thanks for your time TommyMentor 2022-03-03, 03:44: Hi Tommy, For my experiences
with digital arts, I worked with a team to design 3 visual posters for a NGO with the vision of
anti-racism and social justice. We were asked to show the storytelling ability, creativity and usage
of visual designing tools via our work. Anyway, we really had a blast for that event. For our next
topic, could we start with ""Wellbeing &amp; Self-care""? After this, you can choose another 2 topics
that you favor to discuss. I am sorry for my delayed relies sometimes (grad school is really busy!),
but I think we should speed up a little bit to finish the rest three topics before Mar. 18th. Good
luck with your study and life. YimingMentee 2022-03-03, 14:16: Hi Yiming, That sounds like a really
interesting experience. Yeah for our next topic “Wellbeing &amp; Self-Care” sounds fine to me. Don’t
worry about replying too late. I'll try to check in pretty often to reply a little faster. I know
it's a pretty busy time right now. Good luck with your midterms, Tommy",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-14, 22:07: Hello Tommy, Hope you have a good start of the week! Let us talk a little
about studying. As we all students, it is not necessary to emphasize the importance of good study
habits for our life. Good study habits not only improve the study efficiency, but also make you feel
less stressful. Please ready the anchor text and watch two videos above, and consider: what study
habit you are good at, and what you think you have to improve? Enjoy your time for study and life.
Cheers, YimingMentee 2022-03-16, 01:01: Hi, Yiming Some of the study habits I’d say I’m good at are
taking very thorough and organized notes and reviewing them occasionally. Something I think I
definitely have to improve upon is scheduling time to study more frequently as I often find myself
cramming before tests. My question is: What kind of studying habits have you found efficient
throughout your post-secondary experience? Additionally, have there been studying techniques you’ve
found to be generally ineffective? Also, our teacher wants us to let our mentors know that Spring
Break is next week for two weeks. We will be taking a break for those two weeks, but we will be
doing a final thoughts check-in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th. Stay safe and thank you for
your time, TommyMentee 2022-04-04, 17:39: Hi Yiming, Thanks for the advice for studying. I think
that’s definitely going to help in the future, I imagine I’m going to need to read lots of papers as
well. Do you have any recommendations for resources to learn techniques for efficiently reading
papers? For my reflections, so far I’ve learned a lot about what to expect for post-secondary life,
which I think will be extremely helpful. I think your mentoring process was pretty good, your
responses were pretty thorough and all my questions were answered. And I’m very grateful for you
spending your time to share your insights, thank you for being my mentor. It was nice to meet you as
well, good luck with the rest of your studies, Tommy",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-05, 03:57: Hello Tommy, Welcome to the part ""Wellbeing and Self-care""! I do think
this topic is critical for everyone including me, as mental and physical health is the foundation of
our life and study. Please read the anchor text and the vedio, and then share some reflections from
your experience if applicable. You can think about: when you need self-care? What are your common
strategies? Do they work well all the time? Thank you! YimingMentee 2022-03-07, 23:12: Hi Yiming,
Alright, I have watched the video and read the anchor text. I think that this exercise has really
made me think a lot more about how I tackle my own self-care, which is really not a lot. I do think
that self-care and mental health are definitely important topics, especially for students, and going
over the video has definitely made me more mindful of my own experiences with handling it.
Personally, I don't particularly engage in any specific strategies to take care of myself while
working through my studies or other projects. But now I definitely think I should try to be more
deliberate with the ways I deal with stress and overworking myself. Something I’m worried about in
university is burning out from not having enough time to relax from coursework. Even in high school,
I’ve found that I’m a little too ambitious with the kind of projects I try to take on, in and out of
school. I worry that with university getting closer that I’ll eventually burn out of energy if I try
to keep up with my hobbies and the things I enjoy outside of school. Were there any hobbies or
things you found joy in that you’ve had to give up because of school? Do you have any tips for
dealing with not having time for your hobbies? Have you found that university takes over the
majority of your time or do you find that you still have enough free time to enjoy your time? Good
luck and stay safe TommyMentor 2022-03-11, 05:14: Hello Tommy, How are you today? Wish good look for
your study and life. Honestly, you are right that, at least for me, university life is much busier
than high school life. You will dig deeper about the knowledge and try to solve questions by
yourself. I used to be a gamer, and tried lots of video games, but in graduate school, there is no
time for me left for games lol. So I have played games for a long time. It can be struggling with
limited time for hobbies, but it actually depends on your time management. If you can finish your
tasks quickly, then you will have sometime to have fun. So my suggestion is to learn how to be
efficient in study and avoid procrastination. However, I have to say, my university life is much
more colorful than my high school life. There are so many interesting activities and nice
classmates. If you are targeting at a uni, be prepared for the course load and enjoy it! My question
in turn is: what role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? Please feel free to
ask me any questions. If you feel ok, we can move towards another conversation! YimingMentee
2022-03-13, 21:25: Hi Yiming, Thank you for your response. It is reassuring to know that although
time is limited it is not impossible to make time. And thank you for your advice for uni, I’m
definitely excited for a more exciting and challenging time. I think that time management is
probably one of the most important factors in taking care of one’s well-being. Often a lack of time
or poor time management is the cause of a lot of stress. For myself, I find that I procrastinate on
a lot of work I have to do and that tends to lead to the build-up of a lot of stress. For our next
conversation can we go with “Studying” Good luck with your studies, Tommy",,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 22:57: Hello Tommy, Really nice to meet you! I am Yiming, your mentor at this
time. Hope we all have a joyful and meaning time during the eMentoring program! A little background
about myself: I am currently pursuing Master of Land and Water Systems in UBC as a graduate student.
I generally have a busy schedule but will also squeeze some time to cook or hangout with my
roommates on weekends. My hobbies are photography and ice skating. Please read a little bit about
the anchor text above for you to get familiar with the procedures and I am excited to hear from you
about something about you! Keep safe and well. Cheers, YimingMentee 2022-02-14, 15:44: Hi Yiming,
Thanks for being my mentor. I just saw your profile and I'm super excited to connect with you and
learn some new stuff. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have to improve the mentoring
process. And I have some questions for you. Firstly, how did you decide to study water resources?
How interelated are land and water resources and atmospheric sciences? And lastly, what kind of
things do you do besides studying? Thanks for your time and attention. Gratefully, TommyMentor
2022-02-15, 22:16: Hello Tommy, Happy Monday! So happy to hear back from you and to answer your
questions. I decided to learn water resources engineering, as water is so critical for us. You have
to drink water everyday, use water to take a shower and the crops you eat need water for irrigation.
Meanwhile, lots of issues like flood events, water pollution and water security are happening all
over the world. You can see it is a fantastic subject affecting everyone. The water, land and air
are closely associated with each other. The hydrological cycle is a good example, after the
precipitation falling on the ground, it will infiltrate into the aquifers, becoming groundwater,
some of which will move into rivers or oceans. When the weather is hot, the groundwater will be
transferred into the air via evapotranspiration. So you can see it is such a integrated system,
right? As for my hobbies, I like ice skating lol. UBC has amazing ice rinks. I also like music.
Nothing is better than enjoying music in the bed after submitting my essay. Well, that's lots of
words. Hope you don't get bored. And what about you? Can you talk about your favorite subjects and
your hobbies? [Also, I want to remind you that your tasks for this program is finishing ‘Finding
Inspiration’ and ‘Well being and self care’, plus two others before March 18th. If you are ready,
you can choose one topic, and we can start.] Keep well and safe. Good luck in your study.
YimingMentee 2022-02-17, 17:48: Hello Yiming, Thank you for your answers. I think they've really
helped me think about the importance of studying water. And for my favourite subjects I really enjoy
chemistry and biology. For my hobbies I enjoy video games, writing stories, and tabletop
role-playing games. Our teacher wants us to start our conversations next week. We're hoping to have
all mentors unlock ""Finding Inspiration"". So, we're planning to start with that topic first next
Tuesday. Stay safe and good luck Tommy",,"Mentor 2022-03-19, 20:42: Hi Tommy, Following your questions: The most effective skill for my
studying is learning how to ready literatures. I have to read lots of papers per day, so it is
useful to make annotations and write down take-home messages. The insufficient technique for me is
mobile study APPs, because I thought they might be help me to focus but made me distracted. Maybe I
should throw my phone away when I am studying lol. Thanks for telling me how things will move
forward, so let's move into wrapping up part. This is the place we make reflections about ourselves
and each other. I can go first. In this program, we discussed three topics: ""Finding Inspiration"",
""Well-Being and Self Care"" and ""Studying"". I thought you are very smart and easygoing. I can feel
your passion about science and your thinking ability from questions you asked. I am really happy to
be your mentor and learnt some new ideas from our discussions. Keep moving, I wish you will have a
promising future in your study and life. Now it's your return for final thoughts check-in. You can
consider what you learnt so far and how do you think about my mentoring process. Say whatever you
want. It's up to you. Again, really nice to meet you here, Tommy! YimingMentor 2022-04-04, 20:03: Hi
Tommy, Thanks for your reflections! I'm very glad my answers can be helpful for you. That is my
objective of being a mentor. As for reading and writing papers, I want to provide several blogs from

video for us to watch that touches on how different people can get inspred. we can chat about and
each share some ideas from the clip. I thought it was super interesting when the first women said
""everyone wants something and because of that there's always going to be conflict"". I thought that
it was a bit of a dark view on what drives us but still interesting to think about. Nwo that i think
about it, most of our actions are probably driven by wanting even if we're not aware of it. Another
thing she said (the first quote written above) is that you always have intention for what youre
doing, so if you're sitting down to paint something, there's a reason why you're there trying to
paint something - i thought that was interesting too because, as i said before, i comepltely agree
that there's usually a want or desire behind why we do. Its interesting to think back on decsions
I've made and try and figure out exactly why i made them but it's usually because I wanted something
thats for sure - let me know if you relate to this at all. Anything you found interesting in the
video or which filmmaker you agree with the most when it comes to being inspired?Mentee 2022-02-23,
23:28: Mina Shum - “Everybody Wants Something” Finding inspiration can sometimes be challenging to
do, especially if one lacks the motivation to achieve what is necessary. Being inspired is a
powerful tool when it comes to completing what you want, but one’s motivation can be an inhibitor or
catalyst of sorts. Inspiration doesn’t stem from desire but rather is the desire to achieve your
goals based on the world around you. In the Oxford dictionary, inspiration is defined as, “ the
process that takes place when somebody sees or hears something that causes them to have exciting new
ideas or makes them want to create something”. This explanation shows inspiration is a desire, a
want, and a passion to make something great. Inspiration is what you want, and is what you need. I
think that because everybody wants something, inspiration stems from the passionate side of that
want. Wanting something can be malicious, harmful, or just overall negative, but when one is
genuinely passionate and positive about what they want, that is inspiration. I believe the malicious
side to wanting something is where the conflict comes in. Some questions I have about the topic are:
How does one go about finding what they are passionate about? How does one be inspired to commit to
acts of selflessness? How can time for inspiration be found with school, finding a career, and other
priorities in life? This idea can help me in my future by pondering this, thinking about what I want
so I can be inspired and motivated to do what I need to do. For example, if there is any homework I
have in the future, I can think about why I want and need this homework to be done to achieve
success in my schooling to have a better life in my future.Mentee 2022-02-23, 23:39: Hey Isabella!
sorry, I didn't see your comments about the topic, I just saw it was unlocked and was instructed to
answer the questions beneath the video. I don't know about the schedule for our class logging on
here, but no on the 24th because that day we have a guest speaker, and not Friday because we have
Fridays off to work on our capstone project. Mina Shum's explanation of everybody doing everything
for a reason is something I can definitely relate to. Any time I feel overwhelmed or unmotivated to
do something I think about why I need to do it and how it will inevitably help me in the future,
such as with homework assignments or essays. When I think about things in the past and why I've done
them it's always because I want something. That doesn't mean I want something for myself because I
want the people around me to be good just as much as I'd like things for myself. I think the idea of
not knowing something sometimes can bring the biggest change is an interesting thought. I know not
always this is the case but for me right now, I don't know whether or not I'm going to be accepted
into my university. The outcome of this uncertainty is definitely going to bring the biggest change
to my life so far.Mentor 2022-02-26, 14:59: Hi Owen those are some great reflections and questions!
I think you delved into the essence of inspiration really well and approched it from different sides
too which allows you to see and understand how multidimentional the term ""inspiration"" really is. I
also really love how you interpreted our ""wants"" to be made up of both a passionate component and a
malicious one - I completely agree with this idea and I believe that to want something can mean many
different things depedning on your drive, motivation, goals etc. When relating ""wants"" to school,
Ive definetely experianced both sides, good and bad of being driven by your desire. The statement ""I
want to succeed in my studies"" can mean so many different things. For instance, i've found myself
motivated to do well in my classes because I want to acheive perfection and surpass everyone else
which is not a sustainable mindset. Although it is not direcetly malicious, it doesn't stem from a
postive place. When I've worked on changing my mindset to wanting to engage and really understand
the material that i'm working with, that is when I've found that I've been able to suceed in my
classes. That mindset is far more sustainable and comes from an intrinsic drive instead of an
extrinsic one. For context, being motivated instrisically is doing something because it gives you
satifaction, joy, feeds your curiosity etc. Extrinsic motivation revolves around recieving some kind
of rewards or external graficiation for your work like being paid. When consirdering the different
factors that drive you, for example wanting to get into a specific university or even why you want
to go to university, its always good to examine if you're pushing for something due to an intrinsic
vs extrinisic motivator - in the long run, intrinsic motivation will take you further. Just
something to think about!Mentor 2022-02-26, 15:13: I'd love to go over some of the questions you
brought up about the topic too! How does one be inspired to commit to acts of selflessness? I belive
that once you commit one act of selflishness, it becomes much easier to repeat it. In terms of
beocming inspired to be selfless, I like looking to other people and getting inspired by them to
help me figure out all the different ways that you can live as a more selfless person. For example,
last year I started volunteering with a homeless shelter in downtown Victoria. It wasn't something i
would have thought to do but i overheard one of my friends talking about their experiances working
in a women's shelter in Vancouver and that inspired me to check it out! When it comes to being
selfless, it also helps to start out with things that you are interested in. I have many friends who
love working with children and are part of big buddy programs - while i think kids are great, I'm
not super passionate about that area so i focused on homeless since my hometown had a large homeless
popluation - that was another reason that inspired me to get more involved in Victoria! While I
don't work a lot with kids, I do volunteer to judge the regional science fair that comes to uvic
every year which is made up of grades 3-12. This is something that i get a lot of joy out of
because: I love science and experiemnts I love meeting people who are just as inspired by science
and want to learn more about it How do you think you could get inspired to commit acts of
selflessness or what are somethings that you are passionate about that could tie in to this topic?
You're welcome to talk about the other questions that you brought up too if any were of specific
interest!",,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 16:51: Hey Owen, welcome to Part 1 of Post-Secondary Considerations! In this
section you're going to check out the BC Education Planner to find which schools have the degree
path that you're interested in persuing - since you're interested in science you're going to have
lots of options to choose from! I've linked the education planner here so thats its easy to access:
https://educationplannerbc.ca/ I know that you have applied to and hoping to get into UVic, so as an
exercise what would be a second univeristy or college that you would consider attending and why?
Also, what are some different degree paths that you would be interested in taking? Do you have an
concerns or questions about any of them? When i was choosing my degree path, I knew that i was
interested in medicine in grade 12 so i thought that biology would be a perfect choice so i didn't
really explore any other options. I din't even realize that med school (UBC) will accept any
undergrad degree into their program, not just science! When I finsihed my first year of biology at
UVic, i was looking at the courses that i would be taking in 3rd and 4th year and i realized that i
wasn't really interested in any of them. That's when i decided to switch into biochemistry because
it has a lot of hands on lab courses which is what i love about science. Even though its a pretty
parallel move from biology to biochemsitry, its not a degree that i was really aware of until i was
already in university, so its a great idea to look at different areas of study and then go further
to look at the classes you would be taking to see what the degree is actually made up of!Mentee
2022-03-03, 14:20: Hey Isabella! Thanks for all your help with this stuff, being in careers and
having a mentor is way more helpful than I would’ve thought. Also I just heard it is midterms week
and I know science tests are tricky, so good luck! A secondary university I would like to apply to
is maybe UBC and their bachelor of science astronomy degree. Their campuses, both Okanagan and
Vancouver are cool, but I’d mainly be interested in the Vancouver campus. Either way, this program
is exclusively offered on the Vancouver campus. I’d choose UBC because it is a very prestigious
school and I know many people around me have attended or are wanting to attend UBC for that reason.
The degree paths I’m interested in choosing are mainly my bachelors, and maybe even work my way to a
masters degree. I love the stars and the concept of astronomy, maybe one day I could even be an
astronaut. Otherwise, I don’t really know how I’ll get there but I’ll take every opportunity I can.
I don’t really have any concerns that aren’t financial, but mainly keeping my friends from high
school, staying in touch, and also I really don’t want to live with strangers.Mentor 2022-03-04,
16:20: Hi Owen! Thats great to hear! I think mentoring is way more underrated than people give it
credit for, I've been a mentor in the UVic's women in science program for the past two years but
this year i became a mentee as well to a med school student which has be so helpful and also really
comforting as well. I was pretty lucky and had most of my midterms in the same week right before
reading break (maybe not so lucky because it was very stressful at the time) but i'm happy that
they're mostly all done now! In terms of a second school to uvic, UBC is a great option! It
definetely has a lot of opportunities and you'd be in Vancouver so there's always a lot of exciting
things going on there too. While UBC is great, one thing that some people say is that the
environment is a bit different there from that of UVic (of course i haven't studied at UBC so i
don't know too much) but I know that it often feels quite competitive so that can be a bit
stressful. Because it is such a large campus and has a large student body, it can sometimes be
overwhelming and isolating but it completely depends on you as a person but for me I know that I
like a bit smaller campuses. That sounds like a great degree path, when in doubt just follow what
interests you and just take it step by step, there's no need to rush anything so just see how the
first few years of your bachelors degree go and then you can decide if you want to persue a masters.
I know that this is pretty far in advance, but in your undergraduate (bachelors degree) try and get
a taste of reserach if thats something that you're interested in because will give you an idea of
what your masters could be like. There's tons of different opportunites for research experieance so
it's a good thing to keep in mind throughout your degree. I'm not sure if you're applying to live on
residence for your first year but that's a great place to meet new people and see if there's anybody
that you would want to live with in that cohort. I was really fortunate to come to UVic with many
people from my highschool graduating class and i've been living with one of my highschool friends
for the past three years! I'll unlock Post Secondary Considerations Pt 2 but we can disscuss
anything else in this section if you feel like there's something that we missed",,,"Mentor 2022-03-16, 15:26: Hi Owen, welcome to the studying section! This is one of my favorites
becasue I learn a lot from it too and because having good study habits right off the bat is going to
make quite a few aspects of post secondary easier for you. Check out the 6 study habits video and
also if you like take a peek at the Crash Course one as well. Then, let me know what you found
interesting/new in the video and what stood out most for you. We can also go over some of the
questions above such as: How do you study now? What do you find easiest/hardest about studying? What
do you find works/doesn't work in terms of studying? What's a new tactic you would try? What's your
ultimate goal when you study? I'm also more than happy to talk about what i've learned about
studying over the years and what I find works best for me when studying specific subjects areas
(math vs biology vs english)! A large component of developing good study habits is TRIAL AND ERROR
which can be a bit annoying but at the end of the day it really pays off and often alleviates a lot
of stress to which will make learning and your degree path more rewarding. Enjoy your break :)Mentee
2022-04-04, 17:05: Hey Isabella! Sorry I didn’t end up getting to the studying responses sooner,
thank you for your patience. When I study now, I tend to go over tests and worksheets, reviewing my
steps to going over work and practising further on the subject. This or reviewing notes is how I
study. The hardest thing for me about studying is just repetition. I tend to get bored and find it
monotonous and believe there are more fun/entertaining things for me to do. What works for me is
simply memorising the notes/content we have learned specifically the day/night before the test. The
sense of urgency/ lack of time gets me to finish it faster/ more efficiently. A new strategy I can
use for studying is going over it with a friend, teaching them (even if they already know it), just
to verbalise it in my own words. My goal for studying is to memorise each and every step it takes to
solve any certain problem needed for the next day, for every type of problem. These problems can be
math problems, with specific steps to a long winded solution, English or any real problem that I
should remember. This and recalling the theory in a test is my goal (memorising the content). Thank
you for all of your insight during this program! I have learned alot and definitely feel it has
gotten me a little more mentally prepared for my future. I’m still hoping I get into UVic and see
what it is like living in a new environment. Good luck with biochem!Mentor 2022-04-06, 18:18: Hi
Owen, Those sound like some good study habits! It also sounds like you definitly have the right
mentality down in terms of understanding the theories when you study and not just surface level
information. Of course with each different class and univeristy itself, you do sometimes have to
alter the way you work but its all part of the process and the experiance! Its been great being your
mentor, thanks for all the participation and enthousiam you put into this, its always awesome
hearing about excited people are to go to uni (especially UVic because I'm biased). I wish you the
best of luck with the end of high school and getting into UVic! I'm so glad to hear that you feel
like your a bit more prepared; going to uni for the first time is all a bit of a whirlwind so
hopefully this takes away a little bit of the uncertainty around post-secondary and just lets you
enjoy the experiance of it because overall, its a really fun time!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 16:36: Hi Owen, Its great to meet you, my name is Izzy and I'm gonna be your
mentor for the next little while! A little bit about myself, I love science and I'm in my fourth
year of biochemistry at UVic and i really like it here! Its awesome to hear the that you're into
math, computers and space and that you're interested in UVic's physics and astronomty program. I've
got a few friends in the astrophysics program and it sounds like a fun time (if you like math and
physics haha). Other than school, i love going to the gym, hanging with my friends and exploring
Victoria because it's a great city! How's grade 12 going so far - any favourite classes? I remeber
loving calculus and biology in my last year of high school. Have you already applied to UVic?
Hopfully its mainly been a fun school year and not too stressful. If you have any questions off the
bat let me know, other than that we can get started!Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:26: Hey Isabella! I'm
Owen, I'm sure you've read my introduction, but is nice to meet you! I'm very excited you're in UVic
because I have a ton of questions about it. UVic is the school I most want to go to. I'm super
interested in your studies of biochemistry also. I'm excited to learn about your experiences of post
secondary and out of high school life. Thanks for your time!Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:44: Hey Isabella!
Sorry I missed your questions and message! I'm new to this website and I missed them entirely. My
favourite classes are chemistry, math overall (Pre cal and calculus) and most recently English
(although normally I don't like english that much). I have already applied to UVic and I believe the
opening for self-reporting grades starts tomorrow so I can finish my application. Victoria is a
pretty place, I was there on one vacation I went on some time ago. I'm excited to learn more about
it!Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:29: Hello Isabella! Our teacher wants us to start our conversations next
week. We're hoping to have all mentors unlock ""Finding Inspiration"" so we can start on Tuesday.
Thanks! Owen HelinMentor 2022-02-17, 18:24: Hi Owen, That's great that you're so excited about UVic
and Victoria its a great campus and a really pretty city so I'm sure that you'll love it! I really
like my biochemsitry degree, I orginally started off in biology but then I realized that I doing
missed chemistry so I switched over and its been great ever since - we a do a bit more math than
biology which is nice too because I find math super fun (usually hahah) Its great to hear that
you're liking a good amount of courses this year! They're definitely going to come in handy next
year for sure. They're also building a big new residence building here and a new cafeteria so if you
stay on campus next year it'll should be pretty sweet too! Ok I'll go ahead and unlock the finding
inspiration section - do you have any set days that you're going to be logging on to mentor city? If
you do then I can make sure that I've written back before you log on again, if not thats ok too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:34: Hey Isabella! There are many ways I think you can be inspired to act in
selflessness. I totally agree with your idea of getting inspired from others’ inspiration to be
selfless and getting inspired based on your personal interests. You can be inspired by your personal
background, a problem in your neighbourhood or area you live you want to solve. You can be inspired
by your apathy, sometimes simply thinking about how you’re not doing enough can be motivation to get
up and act in selflessness, I know it has happened to me for sure. My class is now moving on to a
new discussion, so can you open the post-secondary discussion? Thanks so much!",,,,"Mentee 2022-03-10, 16:05: Hey there! After reading the Dalhousie article on how their university
differs from high school, there were a couple of things that caught me by surprise. The fact that
you can manage and plan your own schedules based on your classes sounds very nice, the shorter class
times also sounds really cool. This along with the four-month summer sounds great. The main thing I
believe will affect me the most is the fact that I will be in a completely new environment. The new
buildings, new town, new living space, will all be foreign and I’ll be on my own for a while. This,
on top of the immense time necessary for studying will be a big change for me. I’m excited about the
higher amount of breaks and longer summer, but also cautiously excited about the new environment and
new sense of self dependence. I think the fact that getting an A is demonstrating what you learned
to topics outside of school (#11), will be definitely beneficial as that is the way I learn the
best. I can apply this to my life now by thinking about school, outside of school… What fun! I would
like to know about the syllabus for your biochemistry courses, the discussion point asked me to ask
you to explain, so pick your favourite maybe?Mentor 2022-03-11, 15:03: Hello! First off, I think
that most of the points made in the Dalhousie article are pretty accurate and looking back, I
would've loved to have known all that before a came to university (ah well too late now!). When it
comes to planning your scedule, you do get much more freedom that in high school. Esspecially in
first year courses, the same class can be offered at different times (often with different
professors too) so you can really pick what appeals to you! For me, I don't have a lot of trouble
getting up early so i usually try to have more morning classes but now that i'm in fourth year I
dont get as much choice because there's often only 1 section of a class offered. Here's a little
example of my scheduel: Mon - Biochem (10am - 11:20) &amp; Microbiology (11:30 - 12:50) Fri -
Psychology (10:30 - 11:20) &amp; History of Biology (12:20 - 1:20) The 4 month summer is great but
this also means that things go quicker during the semester - we cover more material at a faster pace
because you're in school less so you just have to be a bit more ontop of you game and know when
things are due! It is defeintly a bit of a environmental change as well, because coming from a small
town, I'm sure that you feel like you know that town and people pretty well. Coming to a bigger
centre, you suddenly realize that there's so many more people that you don't know so that can be
overwhelming at first. You're also completely correct about the amount of studying being a shock
because you classes really only show you what to focus on but leave the learning and understanding
in your hands. This is can difficult if you aren't super self-dicilpined and because a lot of the
students around you, won't spend that much times studying. In your case, the fact that you're
already aware of that sets you up for success! A's are definetly a bit more work to master but
honestly first year is a lot of just figureing out how you study best, what proffessors expect you
to know for exams and how to manage time and multi task easier said than done of course :)Mentor
2022-03-11, 15:22: In terms of what worked/didn't work for me, I learned that I need to start
studying earlier than I thought because even that extra day or two would boost my grades
tremendously. Another thing is that assignments are worth spending time on because they can help to
pad your grades if a test doesn't go super well. Finally, life isn't all about school and it
probably took my three years to figure that out but I now consistenly take time away from studing to
hang out with friends, walk around downtown and just stop thinking about biochem for a bit! Going to
university isn't just all about the classes but the experiances you have and opportunites you take
along the way. Here's an example of my biochem syllabus (this is from last year so the online format
has changed the way some classes are structured) Biochem 401 Spring 2021 Basically it tells you how
to contact your proffessor, any books or online tools that you'll need for the class AND how you
will be graded (aka the fun stuff). It also mentions ""Brightspaces"" which is a site that has all
your classes on it - this is where proffs will post lecture notes, updates, and where you can submit
assignments and sometimes write tests/quizzes. The profs ""office hours"" are set times during the
week where you can go talk to them and ask questions about course material. These are very good to
make use of if you don't understand and helps you get to know your professors better. This outline
as has a brief overview of the topics that will be covered, WHEN tests/assignments will be due and
how much they are worth. After that, it goes over standard department policies and resources that
are availble to students at Uvic. Most courses have an archieved syllabus that anyone can read so
you're welcome to check out some more by just looking up ""class name and number syllabus UVic"" I
hope you have an awesome spring break - I'll be here if you work on this over the break but if not
that's more than ok too!Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:25: Thanks for sharing all about your schedule and
what to expect from UVIC! Unfortunately, I’m still waiting in excitement for my response from them
but I have high hopes Our teacher wants us to let our mentors know that spring break is next week,
as you mentioned, and will be two weeks. We will be taking a break for those two weeks but doing a
final thoughts check- in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th. In the meantime this week, I was
wondering if you could unlock our third final discussion on the topic of studying and making study
time available? Thanks for your help!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047550337,1047554333,2/9/2022 20:19,"Mentee 2022-02-22, 15:45: Finding Inspiration The quote that stood out to me was this one: “If I
want to do something truly authentic … I should stick to what I know, to what’s happened to me. I
only work from inside of me, from what I am truly experienced in.” I do not fully agree with this, I
think that this thinking is flawed because with this thought process I feel like it’d be harder to
learn new skills. I think that you should always have new ideas for all aspects of life so that you
can continue to grow as a person.Mentor 2022-02-24, 13:19: Hey Nash! I agree with you that the quote
does not represent trying to learn something new or evolve as a person. I guess it mainly applies to
if you want to do something that truely represents you as a person then it should be something
original and something true to yourself. The quote that stood out to me was ""I believe creation is
always an accident. You have to work hard but in the process, something happens and this is the
essence of creation. It’s something that you cannot plan. You have to do a lot of planning but what
is important is not planned.” I feel as though in life you can plan out things as much as you want
but you cant plan for every obsticle or challenge that may arise whether it be in the what the quote
is saying, art or just life plans in general. Do any of these quotes make you think in a different
way about maybe the world or your future?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:20: I am gonna be completely honest
none of these quotes had a huge impact on me or my thoughts on my future career.Mentee 2022-02-28,
15:22: Hey Emma, I was wondering if you could please open the studying conversation. thanks
Nash.Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:09: Hey emma, No worries about not opening the studding thing and the
next topic I think we should do Entering the Job market. As for the studying video the technique
that really stood out to me was putting it into your own words, this just made sence to me and
seemed relatively easy which is also an important factor for me cause the less work I have to do the
better. Did any stand out to you?",,"Mentor 2022-03-04, 13:29: Hi Nash, I got my first job back in grade 9 at Tim Hortons and I had no
clue how to make a resume back then, but some of the things I would have highlighted were: - through
mentoring for ringette I had shown that I was responsible and dependable (Responsibility) - playing
sports I had shown that I could work in a team setting, listen to instructions and communicate with
other to achieve a common goal (Team work/ communication) - I probably would have mentioned
obtaining work ethic and academic excellence awards (Quick Learner) -I had experience using
Microsoft office (Technology) Can you think of any examples you have for the transferrable
skills?Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:19: I have had a couple different jobs and they kinda fit the same
catagories you put yours into. Through lifeguarding and being around the patrons and talking to the
public I have learned some pretty decent communication skills. I went commercial trolling for salmon
and had to learn all of the jobs on the boat within two days. (Fast Learning) Thats all I've got.",,,,"Mentor 2022-02-28, 18:00: Hey Nash! Sorry for not opening up this conversation sooner!Mentor
2022-03-01, 11:08: Hey Nash, Sorry again for not having this conversation open for you yesterday.
Please let me know which one you would like to do next and I'll have it open on Sunday night so its
ready for you. For this studying conversation, did any of the study tips discussed in the video
stand out to you? Would you apply any of them to your future studying?Mentor 2022-03-04, 13:12: Hey
Nash, I agree that putting the information into your own words is a great study technique because it
allows you to demonstrate if you actually know what you learned and how you understood it. The two
strategies which I use the most currently are spaced practice and reterival practice/active
studying. When I am studying I like to start studying for midterms about 2 weeks before the exam and
study a little bit each day because then Im not cramming to study the night before (this has
happened before and I did not do well on the exam aha). The retervial practice is a great way to
study as it is a way to demonstrate what you know and if you can apply your knowledge to problems
instead of just memorizing answers. The videos proposed study techniques are really good ideas to
consider because I found the transtion from high school studying to university studying came with a
heavier work load and of course more difficulty. If you have any other questions about univeristy or
studying let me know!! I'll open up the Entering the job market conversation!Mentee 2022-03-10,
16:40: I have a resume question, what do you think the most important thing is to include into your
resume. Also could you please open up well being and self care for the next conversation. Thank you
Nash",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-13, 14:23: Ok so I just have a couple self care questions for you: Why do you think
self care is important for well-being? How do you think transitioning to post-secondary will make
self care more difficult? A lot of students struggle with a work/studying- life balance, why do you
think this might be and what aspects of self care might be the most difficult do you think? I'll
give my answer for the first question: I think self care is really important as it incorperates lots
of diffferent aspects that are related to our overall health such as nutrition, excercise and sleep.
All of these things will help reduce stress in our lives, are physically beneficial and provide a
greater sense of balance in our lifestyle.Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:21: To answer your first question I
think self care is essential to living a healthy and happy life. I think your're completely right
that a lot of the aspects of self care dirrectly translate to living a healthy life for instance
drinking enough water. I think that the change from highschool to post secondary education is
deffinetly a shock to a lot of students and it eats up a lot more time than they initially expected
it would. This takes time away from all activitys includding those used for selfcare. I think the
hardest ones to keep in check after the switch into post-secondary would be remembering to drink
enough water and eat enough food for me at least cause those are usually two things that I have to
be policed on by people around me.Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:24: Our teacher wants us to let our mentors
know that Spring Break is next week for twoweeks. We will be taking a break for those two weeks...
but doing a final thoughts check-in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th.Mentor 2022-03-16, 21:00:
Hey Nash! I completely agree that studying can take up a lot more of your time than you would expect
and that people would forget to drink water and eat. One of the biggest things I have noticed in
students is that when we are studying we definetly forget to take breaks during which we could eat,
excercise, hang out with friends, etc. Hope you have a great spring break!",,"Mentee 2022-02-10, 17:45: Hello Emma.Mentor 2022-02-10, 18:55: Hi Nash! My name is Emma and I'm your
mentor this year. I guess I'll share a little bit about myself. I currently am in my 4th and final
year of studies in biology at UBC in Vancouver but am originally from Kelowna, BC. Some of my
hobbies are playing tennis, ringette and soccer, walking my dog Radar and camping/hiking. I am
hoping to become a large animal veterinarian for my future career. I'm excited to have some
conversations with you this year! Here are a few questions so that I can get to know you better.
What are you planning on doing after highschool? Whats your favourite subject in school? What are
some of your hobbies? Feel free to tell me anything else about yourself/introduce yourself and if
you have any questions for me send them my way!! - EmmaMentee 2022-02-14, 15:33: Thanks Emma After
highschool I am planning on going into engineering. I can do my first year locally so im gonna do
that then I plan on transfering to UVIC. My favorite class is probably physics, but thats probably
cause the teacher is one of my favorites. Hobbies of mine consist of playing rugby and im taking a
coding course early to lighten my workload next year. I've actually got a friend who went into
biology with an intent of being a vetrenarian so thats neat. My question to you is how big of a
sport is ringette in UBC.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:42: Thanks Emma Im planning on going into engineering
next year and I have already started taking a coding course to lighten my workload next year. I am
gonna do my first year in my town then transfer to UVIC for the rest. My favorite class is physics,
but I think that is because the teaxcher is my favorite. My hobbies are playing rugby and then being
outside. I have a friend who went into biology with the intent of being a veterenarian so thats
neat. My question for you is how big of a thing is ringette in UBC?Mentor 2022-02-15, 16:28: Hey
Nash! Thats amazing that you are already taking coding courses to lighten your workload for next
year. Physics is a tough subject glad you are enjoying it! Engineering is super interesting, do you
yet know which type of engineering you want to do yet (ie. civil, mechanical, etc.)? UVIC is such a
great school and has a nice campus, thats exciting! I also like being in the outdoors during my free
time. Thats funny about your friend going into bio and also wanting to be a veterinarian, I guess it
is a trend. At UBC ringette is not a big thing, so I only get to play when I go back to Kelowna
unfortunately. I see that you are required to do two converstions: Finding inspirationa and Well
being and self care. Which other two would you like to do? Also let me know which one you would like
to start with so I can open it up.Mentee 2022-02-17, 17:32: I am thinking that electrical
engineering sounds really cool, but a cool part about the first year engineering is that you dont
have to specialize into anything until the second year. So I might change my mind depending on how
my first year goes. As for our first conversation topic my teacher want us to start with the Finding
Inspiration one and she wants to start that on tuesday.Mentor 2022-02-20, 18:29: Electrical sound
really cool and yea you are right about not having to choose a specialization until second year
which is nice! I will open the ""Finding Inspiration"" converstion so it is ready for Tuesday",,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-06, 21:34: Hi Nash! Tomorrow and Tuesday I have classes basically all day so I
thought I would just open up both parts of the conversation now. For my second ever job interview I
was supposed to meet the owner of the company at a cafe at a specific time. When I got to the cafe
like 5 mins before the interview I looked around for the owner but had no clue what he looked like.
After 10 minutes I decided to email the owner because I didnt have his phone number and then after
like 30 mins he hadnt answered. I then had to call my friend who also worked for the company to get
the owners phone number and I called him. He answered saying he was stuck in traffic and would be
another 10-15 minutes. Then when the owner got there the interview took like 15 minutes and the
whole time when I waiting like 45 minutes for the owner I felt so nervous but the interview went
fine. Do you have any questions about interviews or any memorable interview stories?Mentor
2022-03-09, 23:27: The commercial trolling job sounds super interesting! Do you have any questions
about interviews or resumes? Also let me know which module you would like to do next and I'll open
it up!Mentor 2022-03-12, 00:02: Hey Nash! Hmm thats a good question! I dont think there is one thing
that is the most important to include but the most important part of your resume would be tailoring
the resume toward the job, so inlcuding skills that are relative to the job. When mentioning
previous jobs or volunteering, stressing that you have skills from those that will help you in the
position you are applying for. As an example if I was wanting to get a job at a coffee shop say,
making sure that I get across that I have experience working in customer service, working in a team
environment and in high stress situations. I have heard that you are on spring break, hope you have
a fun one! I'll open the Well Being conversation so its open for you when you get back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047490352,1047554093,2/9/2022 20:17,"Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:44: Hi Melissa. I disagree with Denys Arcand “If I want to do something truly
authentic … I should stick to what I know, to what’s happened to me. I only work from inside of me,
from what I am truly experienced in.” . I don’t believe limiting yourself to what you know is the
way to express your true self. People change and grow, becoming different than they once were.
Working with only what you work with before can’t express that growth.Mentor 2022-02-26, 15:49: Ya
that makes a lot of sense. I think it really depends on the individual creator! I would think many
people are able to be most creative when they think outside of the box that they know well. But I
also suppose that when you get inspiration from your own experiences, then that probably helps with
creating content truly meaningful for you and that you can perhaps take deeper. Its interesting that
one of the quotes above says that ""you plan everything"" and another says that ""creation is always an
accident"" - just goes to show how polar opposite peoples opinions can be on this and that neither is
right or wrong. Creation and inspiration comes about differently for everyone and what works for one
person may not work for another. And sometimes its a mix of things. What about you? How do you think
you find inspiration - like for example when you decided to design your quilt - where did you get
the inspiration for that and for your design?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:38: I think I find inspiration in
the world around me. For the quilt I take not only physically from my town but also my cultural
symbol tieing back to important connections for me. It was a feeling that it would be a good thing
to do. Going back my teacher wants us to move along. It would be nice to start the Studying
conversions. I often procrastinat and I find this would be helpful.Mentor 2022-02-28, 15:47: Nice :)
Sure I'll open up the studying conversation!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-28, 15:48: Lots of really great info about studying in this conversation! What do you
do now when you're studying? Have you ever used any of the strategies mentioned in the video?Mentee
2022-03-07, 15:28: As of right now, my studying involves just sitting in front of my notes and
rereading all the stuff I wrote down. Not the best method for me but it works well for now. I never
really learned to take good notes, so all the strategies interest me. I generally use the outline
method. I would mind trying the others for taking notes. I am also thinking about making a session
plan.Mentor 2022-03-08, 22:43: Sounds like making notes has worked well for you so far but thats
cool that you're open to learning some new strategies. Making a study plan is always good! I also
used to write notes a lot, but something I've learned in the last few years is the importance of
active recall and spaced repetition, meaning, quizzing yourself on things and then checking if you
got it right and studying over time (ie not cramming! haha - I know this can be hard). I've kind of
moved away from writing notes as when I was doing this it was mostly passively writing notes and not
actively engaging with the material, and I now use mostly flashcards - I make tons of flashcards.
But everyone is different and as long as you find something that works for you then thats great. And
its a continual process of trying different things to see what works best!Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:25:
Yeah, true everyone is different. I think for our next discussion I think the difference ways of
knowing would be neat. It seems like an interesting topic. Also our teacher wants us to let our
mentor know that spring break is next week but doing a final thoughts check-in with our mentors on

Teacher wants us to hold off on the required conversation till thursday. She wants all the students
to go at the same paste and some of us don't have mentors.Mentor 2022-02-15, 12:13: Nice to e-meet
you! How do you like living in the North Coast? Thats cool you're making a quilt! I used to love
sewing when I was younger and would love to get back into it Hmm thats a tough question! When I was
pretty young I used to love watching Scooby Doo, so maybe that! Sounds good! just let me know when
you're ready to move ahead to the first conversationMentee 2022-02-17, 17:54: Nice to e-meet you
too! Living on the north coast is a nice kind of different. Up here has a lot more Outside
activeness. Back in my small town in the south there aren’t any sidewalks or buses and with the heat
it a requirement to have a car. That had some getting used to. On your moves did any of them feel
like that? Also, what kind of sewing project did you do? My teacher wants us to start our first
module conversation starting next week. Could you please unlock ‘Finding Inspiration’ so that my
class can all start the first module together on Tuesday. Thanks!Mentor 2022-02-18, 15:45: Oh I see,
ya that sounds like it is quite different from the north coast! I lived in Australia for 4 years
when I was a kid and so I defnitely understand how the heat can make going outside difficult and the
important need for air conditioning! Moving to a different place with different ways of life
definitely takes some time getting used to. Just small sewing projects like making clothes/pillow
case/scrunchies etc. It was fun! Also yes I unlocked the 'Finding inspiration' conversation! :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the same time, all my stuff is here, and I have a very deep relationship with the church here as
well; all things I won't have in Terrace. connected to a union job through a good friend, friend.
Met him at first friend's wedding(we were both his best men) abt a year ago. Finding inspiration:
Your understanding of the idea by putting it into your own words: Roch Carrier believes that
creation isn't producible, but must happen naturally. He thinks that during the process of creation,
something not describable, plannable, or foreseeable happens and it is this that is the essence of
creation. Although lots of planning goes into the creation process, it is the things that are not
planned are the most important to the creation process. Your thoughts and feelings that come up in
response to the idea: I agree with this thesis since when creative writing and trying to make an
interesting plot or story, I often have difficulty creating intricate details and character
developing events Questions you might have about the idea(s): What mishaps and uncooperative ideas
did he venture to come to this conclusion? What is he implying about his or all work out there? How
this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future: The future is unknown, and although we
know what we do, and what we wish to do through those actions, it is what we don't plan to do, but
happens anyway, that shapes us the most, gives us the most inspiration and provokes unique creation
from each person. I see this as a metaphor for life, and how it is the unexpected things that we
don't plan that mean the most, and sometimes, seem to be the largest events in our life. My future
has yet to fully develop, and possibly change due to these unexpected events, and I'm eager to see
what God has in store for me. Studying would be a fun next topicMentor 2022-02-23, 13:51: I can see
why you have mixed feelings about leaving PR. At least you'll be relatively close to home, not like
going all the way to Vancouver. It's funny that the thing you picked out from the video was the same
thing that I did. The idea that you have to plan but the important things that come are unplanned.
I've seen this happen a lot in my life. When I travelled I planned a lot, but all my best
experiences and the most important people I met were totally random. Same thing with going to school
- thought I was going to be an engineer, almost went into teaching, and came out as a soil scientist
and I wouldn't change a thing about that. I think that you'll find the same kind of thing for
yourself when you move to Terrace. You'll think that you're going there for school but so many
interesting things will happen in life. There will be other people there in the same boat as you and
you'll probably make some really meaningful friends. And at the end you'll know what life is like
living away from home and you'll be able to decide better about where you want to live later on. It
will be so much better to have seen something else and chosen to come home than to never leave and
always wonder what might have been. It really seems like you have a good head on your shoulders and
you'll find a way that works for you. It takes courage to make a big change but later you'll see
that it was all part of the path towards the happy accidents that make you who you are. You said
that you wanted to take on Studying as the next topic, so I'm going to unlock it. I don't know if
your teacher wants you to complete the Extension Activity for this conversation, or if you're good
with how we've left it. Check in with her so we make sure you pass lol.Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:39: my
teacher said that she wants to wait until the entire class finishes the first conversation starter,
we shall wait. Corgage plays a role in the initial leap, but in my experience, the relationship I
have with God is playing a large factor in knowing I'm headed somewhere great and that everything
that happens will rather develop my character into something stronger and better, or benefit my
life.Mentee 2022-02-24, 17:27: My teacher said the class will continue on Monday.",,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-28, 23:29: Before video: To study is to review information, and create thought
patterns that when recalled, helps to aid in the correlation to other information (info you need to
know for tests of just in general. I'll review the targeted information, then try to recall the
information later(maybe 30min to an hour, or after completing other homework). Previous study tips
are to take small breaks(when completing projects) and review before bed(when retaining info).
Notes: -Taking your time while studying and spacing it out will lead to better results -Switching
topics within a subject is a more effective(but in some cases, not easier) method than focusing on
one topic for too long -Question the material to understand, and relate the material to your daily
life and what you already know to remember -Relate topics to pictures or images. Develop images
based on what you learn -Putting away notes and recalling information is the most important and
effective After Video: no questions, makes sense I'm not quite sure what the survey thing is, or
where to find the 'complete conversation' button is dis- and misinformation seems like something
that might be interestingMentor 2022-03-01, 13:50: It seems like you've got a pretty good handle on
this stuff. I think you're going to do really well in your classes. Thanks for really putting some
thought and effort into this, it makes it so much more engaging for both of us! A couple more things
that have always worked for me: rewrite the notes and key points in different words rather than just
reviewing. It seems like it's something about how my brain is engaged differently when I have to
think about it and then try write it again. I woul dtake notes from the last few weeks of classes
and distill them into a page or two that had all the important stuff I needed to know for tests.
don't leave studying until the last day before the test! But if you do, then make sure not to pull
all-nighters. You're way better off to study the most important points as efficiently as you can,
get your 8 hours of sleep, and then review again when you get up. I would set time limits for myself
for studying each topic if I had a few things on the go. Like an hour of one thing, then a half hour
break, then come back and review the key points for like 15 minutes, and then study an hour of
something else and take another break. I find this helps you to focus on key points and not get lost
in details or start to get bored. Some of the things in there I have never really tried, like
relating things to images or things my life. O rmaybe I was doing that in my head on my own, but was
never a strategy I tried to use. I have a pretty good memory for remembering text, I guess like a
photographic memory but not at super human levels. Sometimes in tests the image that I would see was
actually of my summary notes page - I could remember where on the page a certain piece of
information was and almost see what I had written. I have access to the Compete Conversation button
and I am pretty sure that you're not supposed to see it, which makes it strange that the
instructions tell you to press it and do the survey. I will press it now and you can see if it
brings up the survey for you. And I will unlock the Dis- &amp; Misinformation section.Mentor
2022-03-01, 13:56: Hey Luke, I sent a message to the moderators because I didn't see a way to give
you access to the survey. The survey came up for me and then that was it. I'm not sure if I was even
supposed to fll it out but I did anyway. Dis &amp; Misinformation is now unlocked.",,,"Mentee 2022-03-03, 17:45: How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on
and share on social media? Not a large role. I’d say that when it comes to sharing things on social
media, it only consists of funny things since I have few people that I feel would actually read into
or watch material that i send them Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have
you ever been drawn in by misinformation? Yes, and I can't say that I have. What are your
experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for
sharing misleading false information? Again, I don't share much, but the opinions I have are based
on the majority of opinions around my personal life. This is questioned and challenged by others and
has led me to have an unbias stance on most politics. How important do you think these critical
thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student? Extremely important. If there was a
way to tell what was true and not true for every piece of info online, that would solve many if not
all dis- and mis-information problems. However, statistics can be warped, there's no way of knowing
if the government controls the internet (bc if they did, they’d obviously make it impossible to find
proof that they are), and people can believe what they wish, which changes what is ’true’ in some
cases(like abortion). On the topic of the government controlling the internet, do you think that's a
possibility? Bc it would require a very powerful program, ai, or supercomputer that they may or may
not have to filter through all of what they want to be censored. But at the same time, why would the
government want to do that? Are there really things that the government is so committed to hiding
that they’d do that? Bc the logical thing to do in that case would be to not tell the general
public, so even if it is happening, we wouldn't know. I'm interested to hear your viewpointMentor
2022-03-08, 03:41: Sounds like you have a good handle on this stuff. It can be really hard to find
good information sometimes so I try to keep myself open to a variety of sources and try to make my
own mind up on things. It really helps to understand the biases of the sources you read because
whether a person wants to or not we all have our bias that comes from who we are and what we're
exposed to. We all need to understand that our own point of viw is its own kind of bias and try to
be open to other ways of looking at things. That said though there is so much bad information out
there and not all ideas and opinions need to be given the time of day. You really have to beware out
there, especially with technology increasing the ability to make fake videos and pictures. There's a
lot of money and power to be won out there by spreading false information unfortunately! As for the
government controlling the internet, I don't think that's happening. Or at least not in Canada. Like
you wrote, there's just way too much information out there for anyone to police it, unless the
government went like China or something and cut off the outside world. I think as long as we have
the ability to get information from outside of Canada, then it's really hard for the government to
control because all the governments would have to be cooperating. With so many things going on in
the world, it seems pretty clear that governments don't really cooperate very well on things that
are essential to the functioning of the world, like the Russian invasion and climate change and
immigration. I don't think there's anyone out there pulling the strings, more like a bunch of
confused people out there pushing and pulling in all different directions. When you see all the
things that come out regularly about dumb or terrible things that governments do, then it seems
clear that if they are trying to control the internet or the media, then they're doing a pretty bad
job of it :)Mentee 2022-03-10, 15:45: ill do rural to urban my teacher said we're only doing 3-4

18:44: Hey Luke, I got an email saying you messaged but I don't see it here. Hopefully you see mine.
I read your profile and that's all good by me if you don't want to use this platform much. On your
way to do you carpentry ticket sounds like a solid plan to me. I went the university route but my
friends who went into trades are doing better than me, lol. Trades are a solid way to make a living
for sure. I'm a soil scientist, back at UBC to do my MSc while I work. I mostly work in mine
reclamation, so going and trying to clean things up after the mines do their thing. I spend a lot of
time outside for work and in my spare time. Just let me know if you have any questions about what
comes next for you. Probably a lot of the things in here about paying for your education or moving
away don't really apply to you. Do you have to go to a bigger city to do classes for your training,
or can you do them all at home? Anyway, I'm here if you want to drop me a line or your teacher
forces you to, lol. TrevorMentee 2022-02-14, 16:00: Howdy Not too many questions regarding what I
have ahead of me. Paying for education isn't too big a deal for me, since I need to work for a year
before I'm ellegable to go back for a year 2 certification in carpentry. when it comes to moving,
the town I plan to move to is only an hour and a half from where I grew up, and there's a college
there that teaches all the courses I need to become a carpentry journeyman (red seal). My course, is
40% practical(building stuff) 40%theroy(books), and 20% final. The in-class part is necessary since
you're graded on what you build I see you take interest in mountain biking, snowboarding, and
hiking. I also love these things! Been skiing all my life, picking up hiking over the years and love
the scenery, and really hope on picking up mountain biking in the next few years of my life. In
regards to university, do you find that your study habits formed in high school directly relate to
how easily you passed your courses? I certainly did and found that my ability to adapt and learn
topics I found pointless strengthened my ability to learn n general. I also found that my passion to
learn as much as I could in high school (since it's free) resulted in my knowledge of quite a bit of
information in all general topics taught to me, and gave me a deeper appreciation for the people and
world around me.Mentor 2022-02-16, 13:24: That's awesome. You have a solid plan for what you want to
do and that's more than I had when I was finishing high school. It's not a big deal for those who
don't have an idea, but a bonus if you do. I'm impressed by what you said about trying to learn
during high school, and trying to appreciate the world around you. I don't think I was like that, I
did what I had to do but I didn't really have a good attitude about it and growing up in Surrey I
didn't really have a deep perspective on the world - my world was pretty much hanging out in parking
lots and driving around with my friends,but I at least loved to play hockey and snowboard. I didn't
really start to appreciate the world until after I went travelling for a while and that opened up my
eyes a lot. My study habits in high school were pretty much non-existent and that made it really
hard when I got to college and started in engineering. I switched programs in my first year becuse I
wasn't ready for it. It worked out well in the end. Once I travelled for a while and went back to
school then I was actually serious because I was there because I wanted to be and not becaue my
parents expected me to do it. I was a way better student then and I saw all the people who were a
few years younger than me right out of high school having the same problems I did. It sounds like
you're really stoked on carpentry and you have a real interest in learning so it sounds like you're
going to be fine. Are you feeling good about moving to a new town? Do you have connections for a job
there? I'm sure findign a job wont be hard if you're eager to work, but moving can be a mixed bag.
Some people really flourish and others dont like it so much, even if its only an hour and a half

video, I'd recommend you to watch this at 1.5x speed to get the gist idea since the pacing in the
video is very slow in my opinion. Feel free to read my response before or after you finish the
video! Although my work does not require as much of my creativity as what the video is about, I
found my intentions aligned with some of the filmmakers featured in the documentary. As a student, I
have an intention of learning and delivering my best when doing my assigned work at my job. I also
like to dive into the codebase on the team I'm working on as well to figure out how a codebase is
structured on a large scale since I won't be able to learn this by myself since it is not common
outside of enterprise/company codebase where organized code in large projects is a concern. I have a
question for you, what drives you interested in programming or your hobbies at the moment such as
volleyball and taekwondo? Don't worry if the motivation behind them isn't clear right now, my
intentions weren't very clear at the start of my internship and the start of my 1st year when I
chose to study CS. Over time it will be more clear once you know what is important to you and your
work.Mentor 2022-02-19, 01:37: Hey, this is a follow-up to my previous message. I have a podcast
from The Yes Theory called American Dreams that dives into motivation and how it shaped the things

you read this, you have had a good spring break! To answer your question, although I don't know how
to drive a car, I can share my experience riding my motorcycle in Ho Chi Minh city, since traffic
such as this (https://youtu.be/AbQEdblUIF0?t=1418) is a pretty common occurrence for me. To get
comfortable with the traffic, I'd say be a passenger first to observe how people drive in Vancouver
and see how the driver deals with certain situations as well! Having someone to observe how you
drive and give you feedback would be helpful as well. Finally and most importantly is to stay calm
when you are behind the wheel. I hope these tips help you when you move to the city.","Mentor 2022-03-03, 01:51: This is an interesting topic since I've recently enrolled in a MOOC
(massive open online course) on Coursera about how to study (feel free to look up Learning How To
Learn by Barbara Oakley). I wished I'd learned these tips before I attend college in Canada since I
was taught to passively follow what the teachers write on the board and repeat the same information
on exams. In addition to the video, I also want to share one thing I learned from the course that is
very important to me when I learn programming is the concept of the illusion of competence. For
example, if I passively follow a tutorial without revisiting the code to understand it, I'd think to
myself that I understand the material but in fact, I won't be able to write it on my own without
looking at the source code. Therefore, I think it is important to have a personal project for
yourself where you test yourself and allow yourself to make mistakes to learn from them. I hope this
helps you with your programming journey. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the video and whether you
have already applied the tips listed in the video or will apply them in the near future.Mentee
2022-03-07, 15:26: Hi Danny. This is a bit of a late message so my apologies. Here are my answers to
the questions asked for the Studying module. Before watching video: -My definition of studying is
absorbing information from a topic you have learnt/are learning. -When I study, I read over the
information usually multple times and try to really understand what it means. I try to get a good
sense of what it is talking about. The more logical things are, the more they stick to me. I always
try to ensure I know the material without looking back onto the notes. -Some teachers recommend cue
cards or a study guide, but I have never really bothered with that. After watching video: -The study
skills I have used before are No cramming and Ask, explain, and correct. These skills have proven
incredibly useful to me and have allowed me to absorb lots of information. The first skill I haven't
used as much as I have learned it in the last year, but the other method I have been using for quite
some time. -I think the strategy that is most effective is the No cramming. While the others feel
like strategies, this one feels like a neccesity. People have many effective strategies when it
comes to studying, but I feel like it's impossible to effectively study when cramming a lot of
information on a night before an exam. -The most challenging skill for me would be the visual skill
as I do not draw and prefer not to write things down when studying. -I will most likely try out the
switching strategy as it is fairly simple to do and seems effective. The next conversation topic I
am interested in is From Rural to Urban.Mentor 2022-03-08, 02:02: Thanks for sharing your thoughts
about studying! If you happen to find yourself having a difficult time learning or following your
plan to change your habit for studying in the next few weeks, feel free to come back to this
conversation to share with me and I'll try my best to help!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 15:31: Hi Jayson, how are you? My name is Danny and I will be your mentor in
February and March. I'm currently in my 3rd year studying Computer Science at UBC. I would like to
know more about you! What do you like to do on the weekends? Are there any ongoing code projects you
are doing right now? Feel free to leave anything you would like to tell me.Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:41:
Hello Danny Thank you for taking time out of your studies to be my mentor. As you may know, my name
is Jayson. I am very intrigued in computer programming, or more specifically, programming video
games. Currently, I create games on Roblox, but hope to move into more open-ended engines like
unity. What are some of your experiences with computer science? (Languages that you like to use or
interesting projects you have worked on) Also, what was it like to begin learning in university? I
feel like a lot of coding is self-taught, so when you learned from a professor, did it feel like
there were things you had to look into in order to understand the lectures? Thank you again, for
taking the time to read my message. I look forward to talking with you again. Sincerely,
JaysonMentee 2022-02-14, 16:24: Hello Danny Quick message as I did not see your first message haha.
To answer, I enjoy playing a variety of games, watching anime, and coding. I am working on a roblox
game for my careers class actually. It is a passion project for graduation. The game is an MMORPG,
and I hope to have the main mechanics and beginning story area done before the end of my
class.Mentor 2022-02-14, 20:24: Hey Jayson, That sounds like a great project even though I am not
used to creating games on Roblox. Through working on the project, I hope it'll teach you many
lessons on project planning and overcoming challenges commonly met by both experienced and new
learners such as fixing bugs and working on the project as it gets bigger. Although I won't be able
to address your concerns specifically to the Roblox, feel free to reach out if you have any other
concerns about the project. To answer your question, in my job, I am currently working with C# and
Unity. Outside of my job, I am studying React and JavaScript since I want to learn more about
front-end web development. When I started learning in university, it took me quite a while to know
how I best learn and change my habits around it. I also had to look up a lot of things in order to
implement the theory taught in class into the weekly assignments although I should have attended the
professor and TA office hours to get my concerns answered and save the time I've spent looking up
online. I also didn't take breaks when I should have whenever I encountered a blocker so at the
moment I remind myself to take breaks at work and in my own study time outside of it. These are the
two things that come off the top of my head right now but hopefully they help answer your question.
On a final note, which Conversation modules would you like to start first this week?Mentee
2022-02-17, 17:41: Hello Danny, Your experiences and studies sound very interesting. I will be sure
to ask for any general help. Our teacher wants us to start our conversation next week. We're hoping
to have all mentors unlock ""Finding Inspiration"" so that we can start on Tuesday.",,,,"Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:20: Hi Danny, I hope you are doing well Our teacher wants us to let our
mentors know that Spring Break is next week for two weeks. We will be taking a break for those next
two weeks... but doing a final thoughts check-in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th. The main
three reasons why I enjoy living in a rural area are that the place is relatively peaceful, unique,
and small. Traffic is a lot less scary here. The community feels very diverse and unique to the
town. Because it is a small town, you can often walk to any place you need to go to. Reasons why I
do not like living in a rural area are similar to the reasons I do not. There are not many things to
do around here, so it can get boring. Prince Rupert is next to the ocean, which is nice but also
means we get a lot of water advisories and the connection messes up a lot. One question I have about
living in the city is driving. I feel comfortable driving in my hometown but driving in the city
seems a lot more stressful. There are many more cars and more highways. How would you get
comfortable driving in the city?Mentor 2022-03-15, 02:59: Sorry for interrupting your first message,
you can find my response to yours in part 1 of the conversation topic, I didn't realize there were 2
anchor texts in this conversation topic. Well here's my response to the documentary video (part 2 of
the conversation topic)! After watching the documentary, I feel a bit uneasy because of the fast
music pacing along with the bustling human activity, yet the woman in the green dress is walking
down the street very nonchalantly and takes her time to look out to the city view. I'm not sure if
the documentary also evokes the same emotional response to you as well and whether the emotional
response matches your feelings about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? I'd
love to hear your thoughts since I don't really have a conversation with my friends about it since
they are also from big cities.Mentee 2022-03-17, 15:30: I think the director of the film was trying
to say that living in the country is similar to living in the city in a way. Regardless of where you
are, you may still be doing tough labour. If there is anything I relate to, it's the woman wandering
around the city. When I have been to the city, it was really interesting to go around the city as I
felt very small in a huge place. The video definitely made me feel uneasy. The song was not pleasant
to listen to, and that combined with the switching clips of the city made it a bit disturbing. I
still feel excited about moving to the city for post-secondary education because the city is an
exciting place to be in.Mentor 2022-03-20, 00:02: Thank you for sharing and that's great to hear
that you are excited to move to the city. Do you have any other concerns about moving to the city
such as housing or packing when moving to a new city? I can spend more time in this conversation
module before moving on to a new one or continuing this conversation module as well as starting a
new conversation topic. I believe we only have to go through ‘Well being and self-care’ in the
program.Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:22: Hello Danny I feel pretty fine moving to the city. It is just the
driving environment that I worried about. I will be sure to use your advice when I begin driving.
Our teacher has told us that this will be the last time we connect to our mentors, so I do not think
we have to do 'Well-being and self-care.' Thank you for taking the time to be my mentor for this
mentoring activity. Although we did not communicate much about programming, it was very interesting
speaking to someone with more insight on the field. One last question I have in that regard is if
you have any tips or tutorial recommendations for getting into Unity? I have planned for a while to
get into it, and I hope to spend time in the summer to thoroughly learn the engine. That is all. A
final thanks for mentoring me. Take care, JaysonMentor 2022-04-04, 20:38: Hey Jayson, Even though we
won't be able to talk about ""Well-being and self-care"", I'll leave here the resources linked in the
module here for you to look over if you have time outside of the program. I think it is important to
know how to take care of oneself, especially when learning a new skill and facing tough problems in
a project: - Mind power: 10 tips for student mental health | The Star - Self Care Action Plan – How
to Adult I'll leave some suggestions on getting into Unity and these particular resources have
helped me get a project for myself: - C# Unity Developer 2D Coding: Learn to Code Video Games |
Udemy (wait for the course to go on sale and you can get it for 15-25 CAD, Udemy often goes on sale)
- UBC Game Development Club (this is a club where at the start of every school year you are matched
with a team of UBC students and will work on a project to demonstrate it at the end of the year to
other students in the club and judges from the game industry, they also accept high school students
as well) - Freecodecamp.org (this is a great website where you can find free tutorials and articles
written by other developers in the community, I think that besides C# and Unity, it is important to
learn how to use version control tools such as Git, GitHub, and SourceTree as well). I'm currently
learning Python and working on different data structures and algorithm problems again this summer to
sharpen my technical interview skills again for the upcoming application season. I wish you the best
of luck in your learning journey! Cheers, Danny",,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:33: What I got from the video is that if you want to do or create something
special, it should come from you. Authenticity comes from what you know or have experienced. This is
an idea that I support. I believe it is important in films, or anything of that matter, that things
feel like they come to life or that people can connect. Doing this becomes a lot easier when an idea
comes from actual life experience. I believe that my drive in doing my hobbies or anything in
general is that sense of progression and accomplishment. What motivates me to do anything is
improvement, improving and eventually achieving great things. I think that is the greatest feeling
in the world.Mentor 2022-02-23, 22:49: That's really interesting to hear you sharing your intention
behind what you do. I hope that in the process of improving yourself achieving your goal, you are
also taking breaks and not pushing yourself too hard. I have a couple of questions about the
conversation topic: 1/ Do you have any more questions or anything else you would like to add before
we move on to another conversation topic? if so, feel free to leave what conversation topic you want
on top of my message. 2/ Is this extension activity required/assigned to be completed by your
teacher in class?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:28: Hello Danny, I hope you are doing well. I do not have any
more questions or anything else to add to the conversation topic Finding Inspiration. From this
point on, we can choose any conversation topic, so I think I would like to start the Studying
module. Our teacher says that the extension activity is not required to be completed, so I will most
likely not complete it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

issues with accessing it. While completing the conversation, feel free to send me any questions or
thoughts you may have about the material.Mentee 2022-02-23, 15:39: I find that humans are always
subconsciously planning ahead and have desires they are always looking to fulfil. I feel that we all
do this to some extent because when people dream they see their wants, needs, and desires. People
might forget what they saw in the dream, but the message of it remains clear. Some questions I have:
How far ahead do most people plan? Do we always need to fulfil these needs? Just out of curiosity, I
was wonder about what ideas in the video stood out to you and why?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:26: Hi
Zaraah, I was just wondering if you got my message and I would also like to request that ""Well being
&amp; Self Care"" be opened. I was also just notified that the extention activity is opitional, but
not required.Mentor 2022-02-28, 19:01: Hi Gryphon, Sorry for the late reply I have been very busy
with school and I was away on a trip. I will not make the mistake of replying late again in the
future. With regards to your first message, I can try to attempt at answering your questions but I
don't think I'll be able to provide conclusive answers since it varies for individuals. How far
ahead do most people plan? --&gt; I think it depends on the person and the circumstance. For
instance, if I had a test I would be planning at least 2 weeks before to prepare but if I were
taking a trip, vacation during the summer now this would require a lot of planning in advance,
probably about 6 months. I also don't think we always need to fulfill the needs, but even trying to
fulfill some of them would be adequate. People may come across new desires as opposed to the old
ones that they want to fulfill. Thanks for your question, when watching the video I was thinking the
same things as you. Overall, to me, the idea of finding out ""where to start"" is quite vague and
broad but after watching the video I was able to learn more about this. I hope I was able to answer
your questions! If not, please do let me know!Mentor 2022-02-28, 19:05: With regards to your second
message, I did not receive a separate message for you to request that the conversation should be
opened, but I will go ahead and open the ""Well-being and self-care"" conversation for you to work
through. As always, please don't hesitate to ask any questions that you may have (this time I will
be sure to reply on time :)) Feel free to start that conversation when you get the chance, but there
is also a little survey you will need to complete before starting the ""Well-being and Self-care""
conversation. Once you have submitted the anonymous survey, you can move onto the conversation.",,,"Mentor 2022-03-08, 02:22: To get you started once you've gone through the content, I'd like you to
think about this question: Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered and what
sparked your interest in these programs? As always feel free to ask me questions. Enjoy this
conversation!Mentor 2022-03-10, 16:08: Hi Gryphon, It's been a couple of days since I last heard
from you, how have you been? I just wanted to follow up to ask how things are going with this
conversation and how you are finding it. Hope to hear from you soon!Mentee 2022-03-10, 17:28: Hi
Zaraah, I have just be looking through all the careers in the science section of the Career Compass
on the WorkBC website and have found a few that look quite interesting. As for the conversation, I
have finished the questions and will be sending them through in just a minute.Mentee 2022-03-10,
17:30: One program that I found quite interesting was Agricultural Representative because they
provided advice and assistance to farmers on how to properly care for their land such as harvesting,
fertilization, crop erosion, etc. Salary is always one of the most important thing to me when it
comes to my future career in biology. Biology provides an average salary of $80,000 a year, which is
enough for me to life a comfortable life without having to worry too much about food, cloths, etc.
If the career that I was interested in was not displayed on the WorkBC website, then I would look
around the web until I came across a document that has all the information that I would need to know
about said career. It is incredible important for me to have an understanding of biology, physics,
chemistry, and math because they will be the main subjects that I will need to get started in
biology. Although I struggle with math at times, that does not mean that I will be unable to get a
degree for my future career in biology. Just out of curiosity, I was wondering what subjects you had
trouble with and how you manage to overcome them.Mentor 2022-03-11, 03:07: Hi Gryphon, Great job
with incorporating all the discussion questions/points in your response, it really shows how much
effort you are putting into this program in order to gain the most knowledge out of it. Would you
ever consider becoming an Agricultural Representative, as a possible career option now after
learning a bit more about it? If not, you can always learn more about this particular job or just
the skills involved by taking agriculture courses at your chosen post-secondary school. I'm taking a
few right now and they are quite interesting and address many things such as how harvesting is done
and how to care for the farmland. We also get to go on some pretty cool field trips like Dairy Farms
and produce farms. I like how you looked into the salary and whether it is a major factor for you
when it comes to choosing a career! Being resourceful is the best thing and you'll always be able to
find some career you are interested in on the internet! Can you think of some other websites that
you might visit to look for careers? (It's okay if you can't, this is just a thought exercise to
make use of your resources) Being optimistic is the way to go! I was the same way when I was in high
school and applying to post-secondary schools. I always felt that having a basic understanding of
these courses would be important (even though I did find some of the hard and struggled), but I
managed to get through it with lots of support and guidance. Essentially, you can think of those
courses (physics, chemistry, math, and of course biology) as the basis for what you will learn and
you'll continue to build on those core subjects throughout your studies. If you don't mind me
asking, but at times when you struggle with math, how do you seek help? Not being so good in certain
subjects is completely fine, as long as you put in the hard work you'll make it far! Although times
can be tough, just know that there is always an end and you'll successfully make it, through the ups
and downs! That is a really good question, thank you. In high school, I struggled with math and
physics quite a bit and I thought I wouldn't make it into sciences to get a Biology degree because
of it. After I received my first test mark for both of those classes I ended up seeking help from
the teacher and tutors so that I could do better and get a good mark in the class. So this is how I
managed to overcome physics and math in high school. Fast forward to my university academics, I
would say that I also struggled with any physics and math courses I had to take as well as
statistics but luckily they were only introductory and I never had to use them again (phew), but at
the time I did seek help by getting help from tutors, attending office hours to meet with the
professor or attending study sessions. I would have to say though, I definitely struggled quite a
bit with most science courses while completing my Biology degree, but to be fair most people do
given that they are quite difficult (i.e., chemistry, genetics). I hope this answers your question,
but please let me know if you'd like to know more or if anything is unclear.Mentee 2022-03-14,
15:45: Hi Zaraah, Our teacher wants me to inform you that Spring Break is next week for two weeks,
but we will be doing are final thoughts check-in with our mentors on April 4th or 5th. Okay, now
that that is out of the way I can get to answering your questions. - I have never thought of going
into another career other then biology, but Agricultural Representative was quite an interesting
career to read about and I might look into it some more. - I don't really know about any other
websites, but I know that there is likely an abunance of them flooting around the web. - When math
became difficult I sought help form the learning assistance office and from there I got the help I
needed. If the questions was something that not even the learning assistance could help with, than I
would go and ask the teacher if he could explain the question more clearly.Mentor 2022-03-14, 16:16:
Hi Gryphon, Thanks for letting me know the upcoming plans and that you will be on Spring break for
the next two weeks. I believe participating and completing conversations during your spring break is
optional, but please don't feel pressured to do so (unless you have time to do it). If this is the
case, please let me know which conversation you would like to move on to next so I can unlock it. :)
Also, thank you for answering the questions that I had asked. I'm glad to know you have your heart
set out for a career in biology! It is a great choice with many opportunities and different careers!
Also, there are a few other websites, but I believe the Work BC one is the most used. Even trying
some career surveys online can be quite fun and beneficial. Lastly, it is nice to hear about how you
managed to seek help with math (this is always a tough course). Always asking for help from your
sources whether it's a friend, teacher or learning centre are the best options. If you feel ready to
move on to another conversation, please let me know!Mentee 2022-03-16, 17:35: Hi Zaraah, I was
hoping that you could unlock the conversation ""Paying for School"".Mentor 2022-03-16, 18:28: Hi
Gryphon, I hope you are enjoying your Spring Break so far. And as you have asked, I have unlocked
the ""Paying for school"" conversation.","Mentor 2022-03-18, 19:20: There are two parts to this conversation as well. Let's work through Part
1 together first, and feel free to ask me questions as you go along with the conversation. One
question to start off this conversation, after watching the video or reading the article, were you
surprised to learn what a university education costs in Canada or did you already have an idea about
this before reading the article or watching the video?Mentor 2022-03-30, 03:04: Hi Gryphon, I hope
you had a restful spring break! I just wanted to check in to see how you are doing because I haven't
heard from you in a while. I hope to hear from you soon!Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:38: Hi Zaraah, My
spring break was nice, went to see some lava beds, relax in a hot spring, and got to eat out at an
incredibly good Japanese restaurant. Now that that's out of the way, lets begin. I already know
about the cost of univercity education before watching the video, it still intimidating everytime I
see it. I can only imagine how terrifying it's going to once I actually have to start pay. Now, onto
the questions. - What is the best way to buget yourself from your experiences? - What would be the
best way to balance work/school life?' - What mistake did you make during your first year at
univercity? I would like to thank you for the knowledge that you shared with me, you have given me
alot of insight into how unviercity functions and how to balance my school life from my personal
life. I Cannot thank you enough for taking the time out of your day to help me with all of this. If
it doesn't bother you, I would still like to hear what you have to say about my questions, but if
you don't want to that's perfectly fine. I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavours.
Sincerely, GryphonMentor 2022-04-05, 02:11: Hi Gryphon, It's nice to hear back from you and I'm glad
you had a great spring break! University education is indeed quite expensive and it can be daunting,
but not to worry! There are ways of coping with these stresses such as speaking with a financial
advisor or enrollment services professional who can guide you on the right path with the correct
resources to use. Additionally, you can also apply for loans and scholarships which are super
helpful! Now, moving on to answering your questions: - From my experience, the best way to budge
myself was by following the spreadsheet I put together which included all my expenses and finances
for school. Since I live at home while attending university, this accounts for most of the cost, but
living at home I am free of the cost of living expenses. Moreover, I don't buy food as much when I'm
at school (only in rare cases) and thus I prefer to bring my own lunch to school. I think it is
mainly dependent on the individual and how they can handle and manage their budget and finances. -
Personally, the best way to balance work and school life would be to create a schedule (i.e., by
using a calendar or planner) with all the dates and times in order to follow the events easily and
to make sure there is no overlap. Try to see if you can get some flexibility at your workplace, for
example, I mainly have classes throughout the weekdays usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays this term,
therefore, I have told my work that I won't be able to work those days and we have managed to create
a schedule which fits both my needs and their expectations. - The last question is thought and I
don't think I can answer it because I feel that I didn't make any mistakes during my first year of
university since I had lots of guidance from my parents and older sister, as well as advisors who I
would seek help from. If I don't hear back from you (as I believe your class will be finishing with
the program soon), it has been a great pleasure mentoring you! I hope my knowledge is useful in
helping you navigate your way through life and school and carving your path to success when you go
on to your future studies. I would like to thank you for allowing me to share my knowledge and tips
with you and for sharing your thoughts, questions, and opinions on this material, as well as for
participating in this program. I really enjoyed being your mentor! I'm not sure if you are ending
the program this week, if so please let me know so we can move on to the ""wrapping up"" section of
this program. I also wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavours! :)Mentee 2022-04-05,
16:50: Hi Zaraah , I was just informed by my teacher that are class is not doing a ""wapping up"", all
we had to do was fill out the survey about how the program went, what we learned, etc. Sorry for the
confussion. Again, thank you for everything that you have done, it has been a huge help to me.Mentor
2022-04-06, 03:13: Hi Gryphon, Thanks for letting me know! All the best!Mentor 2022-04-07, 15:06: Hi
Gryphon, I forgot to ask this when we were saying our goodbyes. But if you wish, did you want to
keep talking and working through the program together? If not, this is totally fine, I just thought
I would ask.",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-28, 19:08: This conversation has been opened, please let me know if you run into any
issues. Please enjoy this conversation as I find that it is really helpful for life in general
(outside of school and work). I'll send you some questions once you've read and watched the
material. But feel free to send me any of your questions as well.Mentor 2022-03-01, 00:54: I think
answering this before going through the material would be best, but one question I would like to ask
is how are your wellbeing and self-care so far? What do you do to take care of yourself? Do you have
any bad habits you would like to fix? I'm also happy to share my experience and any advice with you
if you'd like, in addition to the material in the conversation.Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:34: My
wellbeing and self-care is good, but not perfect. I sometimes neglect my sleep and I am working to
fix that by going for more run/walks on the local trails around the city. I also need to learn to
manage my stress because whenever I get stress I tend to focus only on that specific thing and
neglect everthing else in my life. I plan to fix this by taking time off school/work to read a
pleasant novel once in a while. One thing I do to calm down is to talk with a friend/family member
because I find that helps me. I will try to send some more imformation soon.Mentor 2022-03-04,
02:43: Thanks for answering those questions! I really like how for each of your habits you were able
to suggest some possible coping solutions. I feel like you and I (along with many others) all would
agree that when it comes to our wellbeing and self-care, sometimes it gets neglected because we all
have such busy lives with many different factors that we tend to prioritize over our own health.
Trying to catch up with sleep or even having a sleep schedule can be tough to follow or at least
maintain, as you'll learn from the content in this conversation, there are other ways of coping with
this and ways of making sure that you get adequate sleep each night. But sometimes this can't be
controlled and there are times when sleep really isn't an option. I find when I'm lacking sleep, I
usually go for walks around my neighborhood which help keep me awake and provide a boost of energy.
Would you say that your stress is mainly due to school or are there other factors that contribute?
If it is related to school, I feel like having a planner or calendar might help with organizing your
thoughts and tasks, and it also helps with time management (which is something I personally struggle
with) so I have found this really helps me and controls my stress levels have decreased. Reading is
a great way to relieve stress and also taking breaks during your time studying really helps as well!
I find even after a busy 7 day week, taking 1 day to just fully relax helps recuperate the mind and
body. Lastly, it seems like you are already doing the right thing by talking to a friend or family
member when trying to calm down, so great work! I also do the same thing, I also find for me joining
a club or participating in an activity has helped relieve stress as well. As you continue to go
through the content in this conversation, you will see that there are many helpful tips and tricks
that might help with improving your wellbeing and selfcare and day-to-day activities. And no
worries, please take as much time as you need with this module as it is an important one where you
will learn lots of valuable information!Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:32: If I had to pin point the main
cause of my stress, I would have to say school is definitely number one. I really liked the idea of
taking a full day off to calm my nerves, so thank you for that. I would also like to thank you for
the suggestion to use planner, it such a small thing but it can really make a difference. I was also
hoping that you could unlock the conversation “Post-Secondary Considerations”.Mentee 2022-03-07,
15:35: I meant to say ""a planner"", my apologize.Mentor 2022-03-08, 02:17: I am glad my suggestions
are helpful to you! I would also like to mention that in addition to a planner, even a calendar for
your desk or the calendar in the actual planner is really useful for staying organized as well. If
you feel that you are done with this conversation and have no more questions, then we can go ahead
and move on to the next conversation which you have chosen. I have unlocked the ""Post-Secondary
Considerations"" conversation now.",,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 04:18: Hi Gryphon! My name is Zaraah and I'm looking forward to mentoring you!
You'll be graduating soon, you must be so excited! I'll also be graduating soon as I'm currently
finishing my final year of Applied Biology at UBC, with a major in Applied Animal Biology. After
reading through your profile, it seems that you are also interested in pursuing a degree in Biology,
which is awesome! Biology is a great field to study as there are so many things to learn. I read
from your profile that you'd like to study in the field of Zoology and personally that is a bit of
what I've been learning; I can tell you it is definitely interesting and worth pursuing. Animals are
awesome and dissecting them can be fun too, you get to dissect a wide variety of animals depending
on the courses that you end up taking and the institution you choose to study at. Have you thought
about which schools you'd apply to once you graduate? I also read that you hope to gain a greater
understanding of biology, so in addition to completing this program, feel free to ask me any
biology-related questions and I'll try my best with answering them! I've only ever had a dog as a
pet, so knowing that you had two rough-skinned newts as pets (which aren't normal companion animals)
was quite interesting, as well as learning about the fun fact that they possess a toxin that is the
same toxin found in pufferfish (which I never knew before). I'm curious to know, how do pufferfish
release and transfer the toxin? Also, a little bit about myself, if you haven't had the chance to
look at my profile yet (which is totally okay btw), I enjoy hiking, playing soccer and swimming. I
also like to travel, but haven't been able to enjoy this as much given the times. What are some of
your favourite hobbies/ interests? Lastly, I'd like to mention if you have any questions, please ask
as I am happy to answer them. I hope to hear from you soon and here's to a fun mentoring experience!
Looking forward to reading your introduction!Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:48: Hello Zaraah, Thanks for
being my mentor. I will start by giving a bit more information about my self. I have always found
living organisms interesting and have planned to study in biology for quite some time now. My
favorite documentry as a child was The Blue Plant, which I believe helpped grow my fascination with
living organisms. As for my hobbies I enjoy reading, playing rugby, hunting, and camping.Mentor
2022-02-16, 02:27: I'm not being biased in any way, but biology is honestly a great field of study
and learning about living organisms is very fascinating! Do you have any idea what you would want to
study or become when you grow up? I remember you briefly mentioned something about studying
zoology...Also, would you ever consider becoming a veterinarian? I've never heard of that
documentary before, I'll have to check it out! Those are some pretty fun hobbies you mentioned, what
genre of books do you enjoy reading? Any fun camping spots where you have been or suggestions?Mentee
2022-02-17, 17:49: Hi Zaraah, Our teacher wants us to start our conversations next week. We're
hoping to have all mentors unlock ""Find Inspiration"" so that we can start on Tuesday. As for zoology
at the moment I am thinking about trying marine biology. My favorite book series is Dmitry
Glukhovsky's Metro 2033 and its two sequals. The best camping spot that I can suggest is Tyhee Lake
Campground, it has great trails all around it and there is the beautiful lake of Tyhee just a rock's
throw away from the campgrounds.Mentor 2022-02-20, 18:35: Hi Gryphon, Marine biology sounds like a
lot of fun and thanks for suggesting that campground, I'll be sure to check it out! As for starting
the conversations, I will go ahead and unlock the ""Find Inspiration"" conversation so that you are
able to start it on Tuesday and we can begin mentoring. Please let me know if you have any questions
about the program. I'm assuming you have had a chance to read through the ""Start Here"" conversation
and understand how to use the program? If so, then we can continue conversing in the ""Find
Inspiration"" conversation. Have fun with it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-16, 18:32: Oh, my apologies Gryphon. It seems that I cannot unlock the ""Paying for
school"" conversation yet as this conversation is not complete yet. We have to finish part 2 since we
have only done part 1. Let's work through Part 2 of this conversation first and then once complete I
can open the one you requested :) Please let me know if you are able to access part 2 of the
post-secondary considerations conversation (you just have to click the blue prompt at the bottom of
the part 1 conversation.Mentee 2022-03-17, 18:35: - One thing in the article that suprised me was
that we get a four months break, but I am have a feeling that I'll likely have to use some of those
months to study for my next courses. Just out of curiosity, what suprised you when you first arrived
at post-secondary. - The thing that will affect me the most is have to move from my small home city
of Prince Rupert, to the massive and busy city of Vancouver. I also know that the traffic is
terrible and that winters can be quite brutal there sometimes. - Although some of the things about
the city are annoying, I am actually quite exited to go. For starters there are millions of people
living in the city so I will currently have no shortage of interesting folks to talk with and the
city has a huge selections of foods to from multiple different cultures, so this will also be a
great chance for me to expand my palate. The one thing that I am really scared of is that Vancouver
has more crime than a small city like Prince Rupert, and I am worried that I might get robbed, have
my car stolen, etc. Alright, now that that is done I'll head onto the next article. - There are few
strategies in this article that I will try. The first one is paraphrasing and recording the
lectures. My writing is not exactly the best so taking quite note or recording the lectures will be
a game changer for me. The other is setting short term goals for myself. I often set goals that are
years away from reaching, so setting goals that I can achieve in a short amount of time will really
help keep me on track to reaching my main goals. - What strategies have, but also haven't worked for
you. - I was also hoping to know what I should expect from a university level biology course. I am
sorry too be rude, but I would be most appreciative if you would open the conversation ""Paying for
School"". I would also like to thank you for point out that I missed part two of the conversation. I
was in a rush that day and I completely missed it.Mentor 2022-03-18, 19:15: Thanks for sharing your
thoughts Gryphon! - These four months of break can be used to study for your next courses, or for
taking summer courses if you decided to do this option as well. You can sign up for COOP or
volunteer opportunities at your choice of post-secondary school to stay busy during those 4 months
too! When I first arrived at post-secondary school, I think what surprised me the most was the
change in learning and the environment, as well as the amount of independence that everyone had. -
Moving from a small town can definitely be difficult, but adjusting to the busy city of Vancouver
can happen very quickly and easily if the right connections and resources are used. Especially if
you decide to stay on campus, making friends and connections really helps with adjusting to a new
city. There are also a lot of activities to join as well. As for the traffic, it is pretty terrible
and the same with the weather during the winter, but this is something we can't really control haha.
You always have to be prepared and dressed well, that's for sure. - Yes, moving to the city can be a
great experience! And it is perfectly normal to be scared or worried about certain things when
moving to a new place. The chances of you getting robbed or your car being stolen for example are
quite low and you will be in safe hands. This is why its important to establish connections with as
many people as you can when moving to a new place, and as mentioned before making these connections
and friends can happen through social events such as clubs on campus for example. - It's nice to
know that you plan on using some of these strategies! Like you, I was not great at taking notes when
I first entered university so this was definitely a change for me. I did start recording the
lectures on my phone or another device and I found that listening to the recording after and taking
my time with making the notes really set me up for success in specific courses. And setting
short-term goals is very good, in addition to long-term ones as well. I feel like this is where a
planner can really help with sticking to those goals too. - As mentioned before, definitely
recording the lectures and rewriting the notes after class have worked for me. Although it takes
extra time, I find it helps with retaining the information better and longer. Even though I would
record lectures, I still spent that time in class participating in any activities, given that I
would read or skim through the lecture material beforehand just to have a general understanding of
what was going to be taught in the lecture. I also found taking pictures of notes or lecture slides
to be quite helpful as well, and using flashcards and physically writing notes down useful too.
Another strategy that has worked well for me is related to time management and prioritizing the
assignments that are due earlier in the term, while still working on the later assignments a little
bit each day if I have the time. I would say what hasn't worked for me was writing notes physically
in class, so in addition to recording the lectures, I would download the slides before class and
then during class, type my notes onto those slides so it made studying easier. - Great question, so
from a university-level biology course (starting from the first year), it is pretty much a review of
what you learned in high school, but in more detail and the examination process is more intense (not
that I want to scare you). As you start to take more biology courses the information changes based
on the specific course, biology does require a lot of memorization however so sometimes this can be
a disadvantage for some students. Note-taking in biology courses and completing practice questions
as well as the practice exams AND asking for help when needed is a must! Starting at the beginning
in your first-year courses, really grasping these ideas and study techniques help with higher-level
biology courses, as they essentially build off one another (i.e., what you learn in the first year
will be applied to second-year courses but with more detail and so on). And no worries! Once you
have taken a look at my comments feel free to move on to the new conversation. I will go ahead and
open the ""Paying for School"" conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

put your mind to it, you can find beauty in everything. If you have some sort of emotional reaction
or connection to something, you can create something with it. I love the idea that you can find the
smallest details like a beer can and create something out of it. Being a performing artist, I
thought it was cool to see people find inspiration for their art in other mediums. I don’t
necessarily have any questions about this idea, but I would love to know how these artists found
their special way for getting inspiration. I feel like taking the time to appreciate my surroundings
will help me find inspiration and have something to create and have a creative outlet.Mentor

career? or we sohuld be flexible and following our dreams?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:24: I think career
changes are perfectly fine! As we grow, our interests change and maybe our career isn't what we
thought it would be or we no longer get joy from it. Life is too short to stick to one thing that
won't satisfy you! My dream has always been to become a pharmacist but lately, I've been thinking a
lot about teaching. I love pharmacy and working in a pharmacy really proves that's what I want to

not able to support me financially. Back at that time and even now I had to work at multiple jobs

saves me so much. However, I share a part of the rent with them now. I always keep this in mind that

with studying and I don't really study that much which I need to change before I go to university.
During biology class, I found flashcards pretty useful but I want to learn more strategies that can
help me more. The strategy that sounds most effective for me is studying over a long period of time.
The thing I have struggled with over the past year is the timetable at our school. We have longer
classes but they run for a shorter amount of time. This doesn't really give me enough time to soak
up the information well so studying for a little bit a day over weeks sounds like it will be useful.
The most difficult strategy for me would probably be visuals. I feel like it would be super useful
for me but it would be hard for me to get used to. I will try and use these strategies but I have a
super hard time focusing and retaining information. I also get unmotivated really easily so I will
try my best to do these skills.Mentor 2022-03-06, 18:22: Hi Faith, Thanks for your message. I also
found the video helpful. What I personally do in pharmacy school is using ""Quizlet"". i even used it
back in my undergrad years. It use the ""repeating"" strategy. For me, learning new things takes so
much time and it only happen through repeating it over and over. Quizlety helps me with this and it
has fun and innovative ways of doing it. For example it creats mini quizes for you, multiple choice
questions, flash cards, or even short games to play and learn new vocabulary, formulas, etc. I love
it and suggest trying it:)Mentee 2022-03-07, 15:11: I love Quizlet! That's what I used for biology

1047541369,1047554084,2/9/2022 20:13,"Mentor 2022-02-19, 00:53: Hey Jacob, I have unlocked the finding inspiration conversation. For some
reason I can no longer see our previous chats. But I do recall you wanting to learn more about the
human body in relation to working out and body building. So just to touch on that a bit before we
get into the finding inspiration. I know the body building world has plenty of examples of people
using steroids. I want to make sure you are aware these drugs can cause significant health concerns
and are illegal. This means that they can be tainted with toxins or bacteria and result in serious
harm. Additionally, do not forget your heart is a muscle too and taking these types of drugs can
lead to an increase in your heart muscle which is not a good thing! I know for many in the body
building world it seems to be the only solution, but long term it is harmful. You can achieve great
results with a disciplined working out regimen, managing your macro nutrients through proper diet,
and getting an appropriate amount of sleep. On top of that, non of these have long term or legal
consequences! I am not trying to imply that you were planning to do that, but I am aware of the
industry and would feel terrible if I did not pass along the information and evidence I am aware of
in relation to that stuff. Now in relation to finding inspiration, I think it is interesting how
each participant in the conversation had a different perspective on how to find inspiration. I feel
what that highlights is the best way to find inspiration is to do what works best for you.
Personally, when I am faced with a challenging task that I cannot figure out a solution for I like
to sleep on it. I will go and do something completley different, go to sleep and wake up and the
vast majority of the time I can come up with a creative solution to my issue. Sometimes for me
inspiration pops up out of no where, so it can be handy to have a writing instrument nearby to put
those ideas down for later :)Mentee 2022-02-22, 15:42: The Quote that really stood out to me was
“Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life.” this
stood out to me so much because it brings about the idea that you never know what life might bring
you and your life can change in an instant. sometimes one of the most beauiful things that happen in
life is when you least expect it. Other times you might be scared to try something new but it can be
one of the most enjoyable experiences. one question i have is why do some peopl have such a hard
time opening up to change when it can be such a beautiful thing. Going forward i am going to try and
be more open to new and different experiences.Mentor 2022-02-27, 10:58: Great question. There is a
lot of research and theory around change management in the workplace because people really do not
like change. I imagine in part it is a left over trait from evolution. It likely served as a way for
humans to perceive a threat in the environment. If something was different than their routine, then
something may be trying to eat them perhaps. While this served a purpose for our ancestors, it now
plays out as an annoyance rather than helpful. I would also think there is a psycology component to
this. The human brain operates on pattern recognition, so when something does not line up with the
previously understood pattern the brain has to adapt which takes energy and imparts some stress. I
can tell you change is hard and scary even when you advocate for change like myself! For example, we
used to use one brand of cardiac monitors at work, than we were given a different brand and I was
PISSED! I hated it, complained about it etc.....but now I prefer the new cardiac monitor to the old
one! From that experience, when I find myself hating a change I try and reflect on that experience
to remind myself change is good! :)Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:22: Thank you for responding Brock it was

""from rural to urban""","Mentor 2022-03-10, 22:51: So I did two of the quizes. The first quiz said I would fit a health care
job, while the second quiz said I would be a good elementary school teacher, which is hilarious as I
do not like kids very much...although being a medic the first quiz was correct. What are your career
aspirations? Did you also take the quizes?Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:20: I just took the abilities quiz.
suprisingly it told me that i can be a musician or singer, radiologist, or an air plane
pilot/engineer. none of these are actually interesting to me as i want to be a heavy duty
technician. where i live in BC there is a high demand for heavy duty technicians and the pay is
quite high usually starting at $32 hourly for a first year apprentice. A journeyman will usually
earn between 50-75 dillars hourly depending on the workplace.Mentor 2022-03-14, 23:20: Yes, I think
it is important to recognize the validity of these quizes is limited. Also, your mood can change the
answers to the questions. While the money earned in employement is a consideration I think the most
important thing to consider is what you will have the most fun with and enjoy. A lot of people work
jobs they hate because of the money and I think that leads to a sad life :( I love my job and the
work I do so it makes it easy to wake my butt up at 5am and get to work for 6 and put in 12 long
hours. Sometimes more! So, all this to say, dont put much weight in the quiz and put more wieght in
the things you like :) ALSO!!!! it is okay to change your mind :) Lots of people find new hobbies,
passions, and careers! It was always insane to me that we expect high school students to know
exacctly what career they want so they can choose their education path. How the hell would they

flexible!Mentor 2022-03-14, 23:20: Mentee 2022-03-17, 15:24: Thanks for responding Brock. I am

of today. good luck in the rest of your career",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 20:36: I have opened the rural to urban conversation. So I grew up and spent
majority of my life in Hamilton Ontario, next door to Toronto. I was born and bred a city boy. It
wasn't until I retired from pro paintabll that I found a passion for rural life because I started
hunting and fishing a lot more. The city is great when you are young. It caters to a virbant social
life and allows you access to lots of fun things like bars, clubs, variety of food, and just way
more people in general. Plus, if you make someone angry its unlikely you're going to see them again
lol The down side to the city is the sheer number of people means you will just be another face in
the crowd and that can make it hard to find friends. I find people in the city tend to keep to
themselves and their own social group. Its also a lot busier, so it can be hard to find some chill
time. And the traffic jams are the WORST.... Moving to rural BC was a fantastic experience for me,
but I was ready to have a more chill life and wanted easier access to hunting and other outdoor
activities that were diffiuclt to access in the city. I mean I friggin have elk in my yard eating my
bushes and buggling, don't get that in the city!!! Just skunks and racoons :( Rural though has
limited access to stores etc. Since moving here Canadian tire has become my go to store, but in the
city it was kind of a last resort store lol So that is challenging. Thankfully theres online
shopping, but that makes it hard to assess the product to see if something you like... the other
challenge is health care, the resources are limited and if you need specialized care its either not
here, the wait is to long, or you gotta travel real far to get to it. That being said, I wouldn't
ever move back to the city, except to go to medical school I love rural living! :) PS: theres a
million more gyms in the city compared to rural lolMentee 2022-03-03, 14:12: For me I will have to
move to the city for at most 10 weeks for my apprenticeship training. The trades school i plan to
attend is in kelowna and for me that is a big step up from where i currently live in the north. One
thing that i like about rural living is how diverse it is. this is because i can go fishing and
hunting for a week then i can come back and live my normal town life. Another thing i like is how
close everything is. i only have to leave my house 15 minutes before i have to be anywehre because
of how close everything is another thing i enjoy is the people. You can make lasting connections
easier because of how easy it is to meet up without needing lots of time. Something i dont like is
how little stores we have here All shopping is done online then you need to wait for shipping. i
also dont like how much longer shipping takes because of being rural. One question i have about city
life is if it is easier to find things to do wwithout much planning?Mentor 2022-03-08, 02:03: Well,
that depends what you are looking for. If you are looking for outdoor aventure like fishing or
camping than the city requires more planning because of the logistics of esacping the city to get to
those adventures. If you are thinking about food, night life, sporting events, then the city is much
easier to access without as much planning. In the city there are bars, restaurants, pubs, bands, ETC
all over the place!!! Even in the suburbs you can find this kind of stuff.Mentor 2022-03-08, 02:04:
Also cities have much better public transport than rural areas so it makes it way easier to travel
around. Instead of having to look up bus times becuse the buses run sporadically, you can just
assume most of the time a bus will be available and quickly. The only caveat being after 3am...but
nothing good happens after 3am, so you should already be home lolMentee 2022-03-10, 16:44: thank you

consider myself a gym rat lol except during exam pressures...then I would say I'm a junk food rat

1047514148,1047554080,2/9/2022 20:12,"Mentor 2022-02-21, 20:26: Hi Catherine! I've unlocked this conversation for us. That video was a
really interesting one to watch and to see all the different perspectives of these film makers. I
really resonated with what Deny Arcand said about sticking to what we know to use as an inspiration
and guide to doing something that is authentic to us. In my personal experience, whenever I have
done any artistic work (poetry, paintings etc.), I have always found it easier to get the
inspiration by looking into myself, my experiences, my memories. It has helped me resurface emotions
and memories that I had forgotten about, helped me realize of ambitions that were hidden away - I
definitely found the process very therapeutic. How did you find that video and what are your
thoughts?Mentee 2022-02-22, 16:01: Hey Jalila, thanks for unlocking this conversation. I also
resonated with Deny Arcand’s perspective that doing things based on personal experiences and
interests makes them meaningful. Personally, this spoke to me as I use this idea in school when
writing essays and creating projects as I truly feel passionate when I follow prompts I can relate
to based on things that have happened in my life. While I find this idea of sticking to what I know
comforting and I like that it provides a sense of ease in some situations, I also wonder if this
mindset restricts spontaneity and living life to the fullest. For the future, I’ll inevitably rely
on my personal experiences to find inspiration as they are numerous, deep-rooted and authentic to
me.Mentor 2022-02-23, 23:58: Hi Catherine - I totally get what you mean! Since you are well versed
in finding inspiration within yourself using your life experiences, I think that it would be a
driving force when you are making decisions/finding inspirations in your life. Great point about how
this can maybe hinder ""spontaneity and living life to the fullest"" because it is comfortable to
stick to what we are familiar with however I think that it is also equally important to try new
things so that new experiences are possible and through that, you can expand on what you know about
yourself. I have been an introvert my whole life, but I started pushing my social limits just a
little by putting myself in situations that normally would give me anxiety but are also good to help
me overcome any associated shortcomings (that I have identified) - so when I joined social clubs at
the university, I had to meet new people, have ""small talks"", and be comfortable in those
situations. By doing so, I found that I prefer a balance between intro/extro-verted life style where
I like to give myself some ""me"" time but also dedicate some time towards socializing with my friends
and meeting new people/trying out new adventures. You have mentioned that you are pursuing
engineering, and from my experience I found that the courses can be very stressful. What I did was
take an elective (whenever possible) that motivated me to use different skillsets or learn different
skill sets and also serve as something that is naturally easy for me to enjoy. I took a painting
course and I loved it! I got to listen to other people in my class talk about their art work, their
inspirations, their stories and I got to share mine and it was such an enriching process and it made
me realize that I really enjoy visual arts. Then in my senior years, I ended up doing projects that
involved lots of data visualization - hence marrying the tech and artistic skillsets that I have. I
hope this conversation has been helpful for you and would love to hear any further comments that you
have or questions!Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:35: Hey Jalila, I really appreciate your response. I totally
relate to what you mean about finding an intro/extro-verted balance as I find myself to be naturally
introverted as well. Through school clubs and sports, I have tried to put myself in slightly
uncomfortable/challenging positions like taking leadership roles that seem daunting but they have
really helped me to expand my learning. The advice about university and engineering was also really
helpful as I hear a lot about the intensity of an engineering degree. It’s cool that you took an art
course amongst your more academic courses and that's definitely something I will think about doing
as well. I didn’t realize you could take miscellaneous electives like that. Our class is now moving
onto a new conversation starter of our choosing and I was hoping that you could unlock the Wellbeing
and Self Care topic as I think that would be most beneficial to me and of most interest. I look
forward to talking to you again soon!Mentor 2022-03-02, 15:57: Glad to hear it was helpful!
Unlocking the next conversation :)",,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-14, 16:33: Three things I like about living in a small town are: the short commute
times: It takes me less than 5 minutes to walk to school, 5 minutes by car to get to dance and less
than 10 minutes to drive across town. the comfortability: In my small town, most people know each
other and everyone goes to the same few stores so it is usually a familiar environment. the low
costs: Things from lower gas usage to the lack of entertainment and paid activities, I feel I don’t
have to spend as much money to live in my small town. Two things I don’t love about living in a
small town are: The lack of activities and entertainment: While we have many natural attractions,
there’re not many things to do with friends on a friday/saturday night other than drive around town.
The lack of restaurant options: In our small town, we only have a Mcdonalds, Tim Hortons and a
Subway for fast food options. There is one “fancy” restaurant and a nice sushi place but the variety
of food is very limited. One question I have about living in a big city is how much preparation and
time you should account for when planning your commute to school or around town. Also what are some
things you should keep in mind for commuting and using transit generally? One last note is that our
teacher wants us to let you know that Spring Break is next week for two weeks but we will be back
for a final thoughts check-in on April 4-5th.Mentor 2022-03-16, 14:30: Hi Catherine, Regarding your
questions: One question I have about living in a big city is how much preparation and time you
should account for when planning your commute to school or around town. Since you mentioned that you
will be going to UBC , I'll narrow my answer to that but generally it should still be applicable to
other big cities as well. It highly depends on where you will be living in Vancouver. For example,
if you are choosing to stay at the UBC residence, then there is going to be very little commute to
the uni however keep in mind that UBC campus is HUGE and a lot of times the classes are back to back
with just 10 mins to get to the next class and usually as the first/second year classes are more
introductory (not very specialized), they can be in different parts of the campus. Some students
bike to their next class, others leave a bit early from the class to get to the next one. Another
thing to mention is that first year classes normally have 200+ students so it can be very packed so
account that into your timing to ensure you can grab a decent seat. If you are planning to live near
Kitsilano or downtown Vancouver, then it is just one or perhaps 2 buses you will need to take. In my
experience from living in Van, I recall that the buses get VERY FULL at times that go to UBC campus
(especially mornings), so they would skip stops because they can't load anymore people so prepare
for that and best to give yourself enough margin to account for that. If you will be staying in
Surrvey, realistically the commute would be quite tough - would need to take multiple buses, sky
train etc. And the weather in Vancouver is mostly wet so preparing for that weather and dressing
properly is also very important. Commuting around town is similar - lots of places are accessible
via sky train and it is much faster to commute using that than driving yourself. There are TONS of
malls that the sky train stops by so that is easily accessible as well. It is very common for people
to take the bus as well to get around Vancouver because gas/driving/parking fees can be expensive
and stressful. The nice thing with Vancouver is that there are LOTS of public commute available and
the time between each bus at the stop is very small so if you miss a bus, or need a bus, they come
by quickly and frequently. Also what are some things you should keep in mind for commuting and using
transit generally? My rule of thumb with public transports in to be vigilant at all times. Carry
minimal items with me - for instance, I keep a small wallet with just basic cards that I need in
case I may lose it or anything, that it would be easy to replace. Keeping a good quality umbrella
with me, and dressing for the weather and for changes in the weather because Vancouver weather is
unpredicatable at times. Let family/partner/roommate whoever you will be living with know your basic
whereabouts as well. Keep a power bank or charger with you in case your phone battery runs out.
There is no one way to get to a place, so prepare in advance looking at different routes/modes of
transportation to decide what is best for you. Few comments about the things you like/dislike about
living in a smaller town: I can definitely understand and resonate with the comfort of knowing
everyone in the town and feeling safe in the familar space. From my experience at bigger
univerisities, I found that it is important to mentally prepare for social downtime, especially if
you would be living off campus. There are activities and events for first year students to mingle
and socialize, so definitely take advantage of that to meet like-minded people. Bigger cities are
expensive but there are lots of different entertainments and activities that are for students to
enjoy especially since there are usually lots of businesses that give student discounts - so that
might come in handy too. Going with public transport instead of your car is much cheaper as well.
Getting a roommate instead of your own place also helps. Hope this is helpful! Enjoy your spring
break and talk to you soon :)Mentee 2022-04-04, 17:16: Hey Jalila, we just got back from spring
break and this will be the last time I'll be contacting you. I'd like to thank you for all your
insight on post-secondary and tips on urban living. I've very much appreciated your mentorship over
these past few months and I feel slightly more comfortable with entering university life in the
fall. Once again, thanks so much and I wish you the best in your future and current endeavours!
:)Mentor 2022-04-04, 18:42: Hi Catherine, I am so happy to hear that you were able to take away some
good tips and experiences from our conversations. I wish you all the best in your studies and bright
future! Take care :) Jalila",,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 16:08: Hey Catherine! This is a great conversation to pick! To start off the
conversation, I can share some of my experiences with finding my way to the self-caring journey.
University life, especially at the start, can be SUPER busy. Classes, school work, jobs,
relationships, taking care of ourselves, etc etc. It is a lot of manage. And that is where time
management comes in to play - because in my experience, once I started being more aware of managing
my time better, things started to fall in place for me and the stress level went wayy down. I got a
planner - Jotted down class schedule, allocated some time towards when I will be eating
lunch/dinner, scheduled in workouts (I find that when you write these down, you feel more
accountable to doing these things) AND if I was too tired and decided I would rather stay in and
watch Friends with a pint of Ben and Jerry's - so be it! I taught myself to savour these time of
moments and allow myself to spoil myself here and there - moderation is key. I made sure to add at
least one fun activity in a week. Coffee date with my friend, video chat time with family, go to
movies etc etc. I usually put that in at the end of the week so it was something exciting I could
look forward to through out the week. When my stress level was very high and I did not have time to
work out or do leisure activities, I would concentrate on making sure I am eating well. So for me,
that meant more veggies, staying away from junk food, drinking LOTS of water. Little changes like
that, in my experience, can make a big difference. I got a cat - if you can't have a pet with you at
dorms, make friends with someone who has a pet ;) They really do help with stress. I know that UVic
had a pet day every week where people would bring in their pets and students can interact with them.
I went to see counselling services on campus when I was going through some really stressful times.
If it is super urgent, they can take in the students the same day as well. Having someone listen to
your problems or worries while having no fear of judgement, that safe space is wonderful during time
of need. What do you think about these ideas? Is there anything that you are doing right now that
works for you, or you know that hasn't work for you in the past? What does self care mean to
you?Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:52: Hey Jalila thanks for unlocking this topic and sharing your insight
with me! Everything you said about ways to manage stress and balance self-care with school was super
helpful especially since I’ve been starting to plan my transition to post-secondary. Personally,
I’ve been having a hard time prioritizing self-care while dealing with school, activities and some
mental health struggles. I always acknowledge the importance of maintaining good self care but I
sometimes struggle to apply it to myself when I start to feel overwhelmed. In the past, things that
have worked for me are going on a jog in nature, especially during lockdown and going out for food
with friends. Recently I’ve noticed something that does not work for me is spending excessive
amounts of time on my phone. I find myself turning to my phone for distractions from work and being
present in my own life and this takes time away from doing things for actual self care. I’m working
towards improving some of my self care practices and I also have a cat which helps a lot. I’m
definitely going to try to incorporate better foods into my diet instead of snacking on junk so
often and keeping my water bottle nearby should encourage me to stay hydrated while working. I
really appreciate your input and the bullet points I hope to implement some of those practices as
well!Mentor 2022-03-06, 20:47: Hi Catherine - hope you are doing well :) it sounds to me that you
have a good understanding of what self-care means to you, your goals, and the things that you need
to work on. I have the same issue with getting distracted with my phone so I usually keep it facing
down if it is sitting next to me while I am trying to concentrate or just keep it in a different
room. I find that when I am scrolling through social media apps, it is hard to put the phone down.
So, when I find that I am struggling with getting off my phone, I set up a timer that ""okay, I will
use my phone for 5 more mins"" and when it goes off, I hold myself accountable for that committment I
made. OH and same thing with remembering to drink water, setting timers helps. There are apps as
well that send out reminders. Worth checking out, if you haven't already. Hope that helps! Keep up
with nature walks and spending time with friends. It is a lovely self-care routine and totally
understandable that it is hard to do during busy times. May be look into an activity that is low
committment and short that you can easily incorparate on days that you are very busy. For me, it is
listening to nature sounds and meditating for 10 minutes. Really helps me reset :) Was there
anything else that you wanted to chat about? Or another topic you want us to move on to?Mentee
2022-03-07, 15:29: Hey Jalila, thanks for the tips! I think I will try using one of those timer
apps, that’s a good idea I hadn’t thought about. I am also on the lookout for a good low commitment
activity and have been trying to set aside time to just listen to music and relax without
distractions. For our next topic, could you unlock the “From Rural to Urban” section? I realize that
your bio tells that you’re from an urban area already but I think you could still provide some
useful insight for me and my move from a smaller town. Looking forward to hearing from you
soon!Mentor 2022-03-07, 21:13: Sure thing! Unlocking that now :)",,"Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:49: Hi Jalila, nice to meet you! I'm excited to be able to connect with you
and ask you some questions. I read your bio and I'm intrigued by your major in computer sciences as
this is a field that I have been interested in for a while. I noticed that in my first-year courses,
I'm required to take an intro to computer sciences though I have next to no experience with coding
or software programming. I'd like to know if you had prior knowledge or experience in computer
science before pursuing your major or if you discovered your liking for it while in university.
Also, do you recommend gaining experience with computers before taking CS classes? I love that
you're such a strong advocate for mental health as I've come to learn the importance of maintaining
my mental well-being while also focusing on school. Are there any strategies or activities in
particular that have helped you with mental health in the past? Thanks!Mentor 2022-02-15, 23:29: Hi
Catherine! Nice to meet you too! I enjoyed reading your bio and feel like we have lots in common. I
really look forwarding to our conversations :) Here are my responses to your questions: Computer
Science: The intro courses are designed as beginner friendly so they will go over the most basic
concepts. When I started my studies in CSC, I had no prior knowledge of coding or anything like
that. I do have a few tips for you that should help you feel more confident with taking on that
intro class, and even more programming courses down the road. It is super important to build a
strong foundation, so going to all the lectures and practicing the assignments and course material
as much as possible is really going to help you out. There are also free programming courses that
you can even start practicing on your own now, or whenever you have free time. Ex: Code Academy.
Ultimately, you don't have to have prior knowledge in programming, and very likely that lots of
students won't have that either.. so it is just up to you :) Mental Health: University can be very
stressful and managing school, part time job, friendships, health.. it can be overwhelming but that
is okay, it is expected. So it is always good to have some tools in your pocket. For myself, it took
me some time to figure out what particular activities worked best for me. I joined the mental health
initiative program (I believe that UBC has one as well) where I got to collaborate with other like
minded students and it instilled a sense of community and support - which was awesome. I also
started incorporating healthier life style by doing relaxing activities like yoga - it really helped
me de-stress. I have lots more examples to share with you as we chat more about this. If you like,
we can start with the well being and self care conversation. If you want to start with a different,
that works too! Hope this was helpful! I look forward to hearing from you :)Mentee 2022-02-17,
17:41: Hi Jalila, thank you for your responses to my questions, they were very helpful and it's good
to know that not too much prior computer science knowledge is required, I was pretty worried. I've
also always wanted to try yoga and meditation to see if that could help with stress and relaxation
so I think I'm going to start that soon. Personally, I'd love to start with the well-being and
self-care conversation though our careers class is doing this mentor program on a schedule. Our
teacher wants us to start our conversations next week. We’re hoping to have all mentors unlock
“Finding Inspiration” so that we can start on Tuesday. I look forward to talking to you more then!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047551593,1047554081,2/9/2022 20:10,"Mentor 2022-02-23, 13:25: Hey Charlie! Sorry about opening the other convo first, lets do this one
for now and see where that takes us! Thanks for telling me! now lets begin the topic! What do you do
to find inspiration :0 what did you think of the video? What inspires you to create (as I know you
enjoy drawing and other creative hobbies)? For me, its my favourite anime series. I am constantly
drawing fanart of it and posting it on social media. I rewatch and rewatch my favourite anime over
and over again to feel the magic, it makes me so happy. What do you think about planning creativity
and inspiration?Mentee 2022-02-28, 15:39: It's alright, my class has been pretty all over the place
When I look for inspiration, I often look for prompts. Sometimes explicit ones you can find online,
but I also take other people's discussions into account (i.e ""I'd like this character design more
if...""). It's these tools &amp; prompts I use to overcome my executive dysfunction, without feeling
as if I need a 3rd party telling me what to do all the time. I also really like seeing other
people's creations or scrolling through pinterest.Mentor 2022-03-02, 14:27: That's awesome you've
found a way to combat your executive disfunction by finding prompts! I always have trouble figuring
out what to draw, I look through fanart usually and try to draw some of those ideas in my own style.
Are there any places or songs that give you inspiration? I'm not a music person so not for me, but
usually sitting in nature helps me draw or sitting with people I like in my painting club!Mentor
2022-03-13, 12:27: Hey Charlie! I guess we are doing self care now haha! I feel you in terms of
showering, washing hair and brushing teeth... I barely shower (I also took an hour to comb my hair
so I instead had to cut it really short), brush my teeth only once a day, and don't dry dishes :( As
you mentioned though, there are consequences to some actions, like getting a cavity for eample as
you mentioned. I wonder, I feel like if we did do these things though we would feel a lot better
about ourselves, almost proud of ourselves even. It would eventually become routine!Mentee
2022-03-16, 15:29: When it comes to finding inspiration, I agree and disagree with all the
directors. On one hand, finding inspiration or an idea to build on can truly come out of the blue,
when you’re thinking to yourself at night or travelling home. But it’s rare that someone who doesn’t
want to create something can get an idea they want to, and have the skills to build on. Once that
initial spark is ignited, the flames must be tended to. The fire needs to breathe, and it will only
grow if given enough fuel. But if left to fester without proper care, either the fire will eat
itself alive or consume everything in its path. To me, inspiration is that spark that starts. But
how to handle that spark- if to let it grow into fire, or run through a copper wire, or perhaps even
snuff it out, that drive is true creation.Mentor 2022-03-16, 20:24: Hi Charlie, That is so true, I
think if someone does not want to find inspiration themselves, then they will never find it.
Although it is true that it just comes naturally, you have to be open to it coming and know a bit
about how to act on it. For instance, there is no reason for me to get inspiration to open a
skateboarding shop when I don't know how to skateboard lol. Inspiration is such a tricky thing,
because even when it does suddenly come to you, it can just as quickly leave you :( leaving you with
a pile of work in progresses along with it going. You not only have to have inspiration, you also
must have passion, and drive. You have to want to complete the things which you have started even
when inspiration has left you. its a lot of hard work too",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-17, 17:52: Hey Charlie!! Sorry for the late message, this week has been crazy with
exams since break is coming up! I promise I won't reply late again haha. It was really nice to hear
from you!!! Its cool you like anime too, I tried watching JJK but I felt it was a bit similar to
Blue Exorcist haha. And its nice we both like drawing, its really a good way to excert your passions
I think. Also I have ADHD too! It sucks lol, and for you to have that and OCD is very tough :( My
boyfriend has extreme contamination OCD (like germs and stuff, he washes his hands till they bleed)
so I know how hard that is to live with... Let me know if there's anything I can do to help! I hope
you don't mind, I decided to start the self care conversation! What do you know about self care?
Self care from what I know is taking time to yourself, doing things you enjoy, showering, etc. What
sorts of things do you do for yourself when you're feeling down or feel like you need an extra
treat?Mentee 2022-02-22, 15:26: It's great to hear back from you, Sonia. I haven't gotten into blue
exorcist unfortunately, but I'll definetly get into after pushing through the backlog of
recommendations lmao Also, as much as i wanna start with the self care conversation, my teacher says
my class have to do the same conversations at the same time - can you please unlock the Finding
Inspiration coversation? thank you!Mentee 2022-03-10, 16:05: How easy is it for you to think about
self care as something important? In theory &amp; on paper, I know self care is important. If your
mental &amp; physical health is neglected, your performance will suffer, too. For me, though, these
routines can be tedious &amp; easy to forget about. Why brush your teeth when using mouthwash saves
so much time? Why brush my hair when I can throw it into a braid or ponytail? Why towel dry the
dishes when they’ll dry up on their own in a few hours? These petty attempts to save time only
snowballs into bigger problems later on. The kitchen is a mess, I got a cavity, and my hair got so
tangled it took me an hour to untangle in the shower. What role does time management play in taking
good care of yourself? Time management is extremely important. Just as you need time to meet
deadlines &amp; study, you need time to sleep, shower, eat, exercise, &amp; unwind. Without managing
your time, it will feel like you're always running out of it, or have periods where you have nothing
to do at all. Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the
things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into
your own life? My mom has been on a long journey to be healthier. She’s changed her diet &amp; takes
more care of herself. My dad has been taking extra steps to find a new job to escape a toxic work
environment. What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be
taking better care of yourself? I get fatigued quite easily &amp; I struggle to keep on top of
chores. Eating regularly can be a challenge &amp; I don’t enjoy physical activities. How might the
transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? Your mentor may have some
insight into this! It’s a new environment, with new structures, rules, code of conduct, etiquettes,
people, and hazards. Adjusting to a new routine with new responsibilities can be challenging without
a support structure or plan involved. How good are you at taking care of the basics of self care:
Getting adequate sleep? 7/10 Eating healthy food? 6/10 Drinking water? 8/10 Regular physical
activity? 5/10 Taking breaks from work? 4/10",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 16:07: Hi Charlie! I'm Sonia, nice to meet you! I'm a fourth year UBC student
studying English Language, although I used to be an art major until I had a artistic mental
breakdown LOL, drawing for a grade is difficult!!! I noticed you enjoy art as well, what kinds of
things do you enjoy drawing? Kinda embarrasing, I like drawing anime characters (professors were not
happy with that lol). My favourite anime is Yu-Gi-Oh! GX!!! I like it because it tells a story of
growing up and experiencing depression and trauma, but still having the courage to become an adult
despite all that. What shows do you like? Do you like anime :0 ? I also noticed you said you'd like
someone who has experience with neurodivergence, lucky for you I have depression and borderline
personality disorder LOL. If you ever need any advice on this kind of thing, let me know. Its hard
to live in a world where society expects us all to be neurotypical, the world doesn't really slow
down for us even if we are having a rough time... What does help though is talking it out, I'm sure
you have people who care that want to listen, and if not, I'm here :D ! How are you dealing with
school and studying? I'm excited to hear back from you! Let's crush this program lol (also let me
know which conversation you'd like to do next!)Mentee 2022-02-14, 15:34: Hullo Sonia, Thank you for
reaching out and agreeing to be my mentor. Whenever you're free, would you like to have a quick ice
breaker , or cut to the chase and start with a conversation? I'm also not sure if we should stick to
an email format or have tis structured more casually. Cheers, CharlotteMentee 2022-02-14, 15:42: And
to answer your questions, I like drawing all sorts of thins- dragons, characters, anything I deem
fun to create. My favourite animes are Jujustu Kaisen, Demon Slayer and I've been trying to get into
other shows my friends recommend :0 My mental health struggles surround OCD and ADHD (inattentive),

been studying all weekend. I am excited about this topic because I have lived in both rural and
urban areas. Now that I am attending university after working for a bit, I have had to move back to
a city life. Which I don't mind, but I do miss some things about smaller towns. These are the
questions you are to answer, and I'll ask a few followup questions. Three things you like about
living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. Two things you don’t like and, again,
explain your reasons for each. One question you have about living or moving to the cityMentee
2022-02-17, 11:47: Three things i like about rural living: I like how i used to live in an area
where i didn't really have neighbours, free to go explore the land and stuff around me I like how we
wouldn't hear cars running or sirens etc, it was very quiet it's just better to me i don't really
know how to explain it Two things i don't like: I didn't like how we had to go to the next town over
to go to school, get groceries etc All imports are expensive like gas, fruits, etc One question you
have about moving to the city: Was there a sort of culture shock? Like i mean do people on the
street just act different, are you treated different by neighbours, strangers etc?Mentor 2022-02-22,
12:11: Hi Jesse, I am so sorry for the delay in sending this message. I will definately do my best
to reply within three days going forward. Three things I liked when I lived in a rural area is the
community aspect and how everyone knows their neighbours, how easy it is to get around (if you have
a vehicle), being comfortable in a town that's familiar, What I don't like are the prices of food
and fuel and I also enjoy having this sense of anonymity in the city, I can go down the street
knowing that people won't recognize me. I think that's the biggest difference from a small town to a
city life, people act and treat you like they won't see you again because you probably won't meet
again. But people are still very friendly. Just a bit different atmosphere, because in a small town,
there's a good chance you'll see someone again. I'm going to open the part 2 for this
conversation.Mentor 2022-04-06, 00:32: Oh my goodness Jesse, I must apologize as I forgot to reply
to your message. Life can get very busy for me, and I often forget to do important tasks. That's no
excuse and I hope you understand, I will do my utmost best to keep up with messages going forward.
In university life can get very busy, this semester seems to be really hard for a lot of people. I
think one reason is coming out of COVID there is uncertainty, and personally I am signing up for so
many things and wanting to do all the activities that are available. I need to learn to slow down,
take a step back and breath. A little tip, I ask my profs for extentions all the time, often
professors are good with giving extentions to some extent and it never hurts to ask for one if I
need more time. If you're good with this topic we can move forward, maybe we can do a prerequisit
topic, such as plagerism or one that we need to get out of the way, are you good with that? I'll
open up the plagerism one but if you want to do another just let me know. ChrisMentor 2022-04-06,

different ways of knowing, and studying. as for forgetting to do things, i forget all the time LOL.
i started carrying a pocket sized journal in my bag or pocket and i write down a list of stuff i
need to do that day, so i go along and check it off if i did it, cross it out if i don't need to do
it anymore(or if i pushed it to the next day). it helps me compartmentalize my life and so i feel
obligated to do all the tasks on my list. it makes me feel like im on a mission and my list is my
instructions lol. it helps prevent executinve dysfunction becasue i essentially plan my day in
advance, so i already know what is going to happen so i know if there is any change in my scheduled
routine.",,,,,"Mentor 2022-04-08, 00:29: That's amazing that you're able to use those skills and tools like a small
pocket book to keep you on task. I forget things all the time. I think it has a lot to do with my
own self-care and capacity to do things. I like how this video talked about self-care as a
responsibility. I think self-care is a wholistic process including spiritual, mental, physical and
emotional wellbeing. This video talked about separating self care actions into different categories
as an action plan, so I separate my self care actions into these four quadrants of mental, physical,
emotional, and spirtual categories. It is hard to maintain this, but I really do think it is an
ethical responsibility to maintain my wellbeing. Thinking about it, I also think it varies depending
on the global and community situations, for example, during covid-19 I needed more selfcare than I
do now, or perhaps now my self-care is more social activities than it was during Covid-19. What are
your thoughts?Mentee 2022-04-12, 14:28: Yeah I noticed how the video sort of described self-care as
a responsibility, I don't know how that makes me feel because when I think of my responsibilities I
think of chores etc. I feel like self-care for me personally shouldn't feel like a chore, because
then it seems counterproductive almost? I never thought about seperating self care into different
categories-- for me when I think about it, there's things I prioritize doing, then there's things
that are lower priority but would make me feel better if I did it. If I don't do the prioritized
things first, then I won't do the lower priority things because it can make me feel worse. I don't
think seperating it into categories would be productive for me, because I'd feel overhwelmed with
getting it all done and keeping track of it all. take my pocketbook as an example lol. it is quite
literally a list of everything i do so i can see it linear and simple, but when i think about it i
have sort of subconsciously organzied it by priority/importance? I guess I do sort of seperate them
then, but it is more like a grocery list or something. Highest priority(not optional) If I did it, I
know I would feel better(optional) Lowest priority(not optional) Optional extras It's easy for me to
maintain when I organize it like this, because in my mind I don't really seperate categories I just
know what is most important, and what is optional etc etc. I don't think it differs too much because
of external factors like what you mentioned, but I feel like it plays a bit into it. i am running
out of time this class, i feel like i have more to add later though.Mentor 2022-04-13, 03:32: I get
what you mean by compartmentalizing self-care becomes overwhelming. For me, I don't compartmentalize
it but rather understand and reflect on how self-care invovles different aspects of my life,
including mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional. For emotional self-care I socialize with
friends, like have board game nights or just spending time with others For my physical I make sure I
do something active like run or something For my mental I like to read, or make sure my homework is
finished. And for spiritual, I like to get outside by the river, or go for a hike as I find being in
nature is somewhat spiritual. Some people don't focus on this part, but I think it's important for
me. I don't focus on these all the time at all, but when I feel off balance, I can think about what
part is lackin. So I don't get anxious about it but use the compartments to reflect on where I can
improve. I don't know if that makes sense. But this is kinda how I take what the video was saying
about compartmentalizing our self-care actions. What do you think about this, does it still seem
counterproductive?Mentee 2022-04-13, 13:33: It doesn't seem counterproductive for others, but for me
it just hasn't really worked like that. I frogot to mention yesterday-- I don't actively categorize
stuff, that is just the closest comparison I could think of at the time. I really don't know how to
explain it, but I feel like it's similar to what you are explaiign to me? Similarly, I don't
actively think of the specific category so like you the only time I recognize a specific need hasn't
been met is if I feel dysfunctional, or off-balance. I guess to put it into the categories that the
video suggested, it would look like: Emotional i like to talk to my plants or take care of
them(check roots in propagating plants, brush off dirt or dust on leaves, misting them etc) i like
to hang out with my dog Jack Physcial I used to do powerlifting and kickboxing during the week, but
now all i can handle is stretchign and keeping my joints mobile etc Mental keeping my pocketbook
helps me not get overhwelmed , so i think it counts here? SPiritual with school i havent had much
time to focus on my spirituality anymore, but i used to go biking through the trails with my dog to
spend time with nture, taling care of myself and Jack I guess in the end it makes sense to define at
least one thing for each aspect of self-care, and I think I was under the impression that people
were actively thinking about the actual aspects instead of just doing it.(I hope that makes sense
lol)Mentor 2022-04-19, 14:05: That totally makes sense. My selfcare shifts all the time depending on
crazy my life is. I think the biggest thing about self-care for me is to just ensure that I always
have compassion for myself and stop myself from beating myself up inwardly. For example I started
feeling bad I'm replying to you late, and I just submitted an assignment late today, but I need to
be able to provide myself compassion and realize that even though these things are late I'm still
getting my tasks done. Life is busy and it can often get overwhelming, and focusing on one task at a
time is part of my self-care. Let me know if you have anythign else to add about self-care or if you
want to move on to another conversation.",,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 19:59: Hello Jesse, it's great to meet you virtually. My name is Chris, I use
they/them pronouns, I'm attending my third year in unversity, trying to get my Bachelor of Social
Work. My favourite part of university is working and connecting with the student union, I think it
gives me a strong sense of community and I get to participate in all the activities. I'm very happy
to discuss anything about attending university with you through this messaging platform. I saw that
you enjoy learning some computer languages, I think that will be a very great skill you will use in
the future, it will make you stand out in a many professions. Collecting bones is an interesting and
unique hobby, I'm curious what the most interesting bone is that you've collected? What conversation
topic would you like to discuss first? Talk to you soon, ChrisMentee 2022-02-11, 11:57: hi chris,
it's nice to meet you too. i do like to learn computer languages, but mainly i learn new things like
that for a very short term project before i end up losing interest. mostly i know python3 and
python5, but i want to learn basic back-end html and css and how to incorporate javascript/python
into html. i wouldn't mind doing something after highschool with web building/design, so i probably
would find a remote program to learn from. the most unique bone i have collected is probably the
mandibles of a piranha, or a big triangular shaped bone. i don't know what that one is from, or what
bone exactly it is but i can try to attach a photo later. also i don't know where the conversations
are, all i have seen is the solo ones. -jesse.Mentee 2022-02-11, 11:58: oh wait no i found the
conversatioon topics i'll enter some inMentor 2022-02-14, 00:33: That is very cool that you have a
mandible piranha bone. I had to google what it was, and I think that would be a great piece to hold
onto. I agree, this site can be challenging to navigate, but I think you got it. I started the rural
to urban topic conversation, and the instructions are for you to start the discussion. I will say a
short hello in the discussion and wait for your response. Talk soon.",,,,"Mentor 2022-02-22, 12:41: I enjoyed watching this video. What i appreciated about it was how we
connect with the land and how an urban lifestyle can disconnect us from our roots. I related to the
image of the woman standing on the roof a building looking outward, and I also related to the man
canoeing in the creet, moving really fast that a branch got stuck in his canoe. It made me think of
my busy life and how sometimes I go so fast that I don't realize I got a branch stuck in my canoe.
Sometimes life moves fast I forget to be aware of what's happening around me. What did you think of
the video?Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:53: I apologize for the delayed response, I didn't have wifi or
computer and was out of town for a bit. What do you think the director of the film was trying to
communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? I think the
director was trying to convey the difference in connections to the land, and the values of the
people who live on it. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? I
agree, I also relate to the man who was canoeing, it reminded me of when i would go canoeing with my
dad to scout for geese in hunting season. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of
things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? It made me realize that at some point I
am going to have to live in a big city at some point in my life, even if i desperately would like to
avoid it. In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are
feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? It makes me want to stay
rural forever and never step foot into a city again. I went to Vancouver on the weekend, and there
was way too much going on. Apparantly a bunch of cities are stacked on each other, but it all loks
like Vancouver to me. It smelled bad, and the skytrain was so shocking to me. I had never heard of
anything like that before(not to sound like a country bumpkin or anything, LOL)Mentor 2022-03-01,
01:16: Country bumpkin is a new word in my vocabulary, lol, I think I've heard it in passing. You
mentioned a interesting point that the director is trying to convey, the differences between our
connection with the land that contrasts with the values we hold from society, to keep moving. I see
these as social constructions, the idea to keep going and do as much as we can is a social
construct, and contrasts with balancing our lives and wellbeing. The idea to be competative and make
as much money as possible contrasts with values to connect as a community. Your answer made me think
that we hold values inside ourselves, deep in our soul. I think these values come from various
experiences we have, like living in a rural area, or experience with community and family possibly.
These values often contrast with social norms or society's way of doing things, but it doesn't mean
we can't be true to ourselves and keep our values. We can live in society and manage to thrive, but
still maintain our these values. And we can find ways to do this while living in an urban city. For
me it would be going cross country skiing outside the city, or going to live music shows that are
small so I have a sense of community. I'm sure you'll find ways to maintain your values even in a
bustling city. Do you have anything else to add? Do you want to move onto an extension activity?
There are keeping traditions or easing tradions Or if you feel like enough is said we could change
topics. Lots of options. ChrisMentee 2022-03-31, 13:49: Hey Chris, Sorry I didn't respond. I had the

2022-02-23, 20:36: You'll share some things with me first as instructed and then I will follow
up.Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:51: Reasons I like living in arural area. One reason is it's quiet, I like
having a quiet space while working or just in general. Another reason is it's not busy all the time,
I like to be on time to things but also don't like leaving to early. Last reason is you kind of know
a lot of people and there's always events that most people go to. One of the reasons why I don't
like living in a rural area is there's not enough places to go to like malls, more food options.
Second reason is there's nothing to really do, even with friends, if you want to do something fun
you'll most likely always have to go out of town. I like being active most of the time. What is your
favorite thing about living in a urban area and why did you move there?Mentor 2022-03-11, 13:06:
Very interesting to hear about your experiences living in a rural area because I have always lived
in an urban area. I would also love the quietness and more importantly less traffic in a rural area.
It takes me an hour in a half to just get to school every day so would 100% love having no traffic
and being able to wake up later. For example, for a 9:00 am class I usually have to wake up at 6 am
:(. I should point out, however, that my hometown is not as ""busy"" as UBC where I go to school, so I
have some experience living in a somewhat ""smaller community"". This of course all changed once I
started going to UBC (a huge school with I don't even know how many students, but a lot for sure).
It was definitely overwhelming, but the best part was meeting so many new people and always having
so many opportunities to participate in activities/events. Like you said, in a rural area it's
difficult finding things to do, which was also the case for me sometimes in my hometown
(Cloverdale). Usually, my friends and I would have to leave town to do something fun. But at UBC,
there's almost everything right on campus, from restaurants, gyms, cafes, grocery stores, pools,
clubs, libraries, to the beach. Not to mention downtown is only a bus ride away! Therefore, it's
never difficult to find something to do. This is one of the reasons I chose UBC for post-secondary!
I wasn't ready to move abroad but I definitely wanted to experience things/meet people from outside
of my hometown. So, to summarize, my favourite part about living in an urban area is always having
the opportunity to meet new people, and try new things! Lmk, if u have any questions/want to know

and contrasting rural life and city life. I find it interesting how both are equally as chaotic but
in different ways. I'm curious to know if you'd say the video did a good job of portraying rural

1047550298,1047554071,2/9/2022 18:29,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-28, 13:00: Hey Jax, please feel free to discuss your thoughts on urban vs rural after
reading the text above. I once lived in a rural area, but that was when I was very young. But I
think that experience was enough for me to have some way of comparing the two. Personally, I believe
there are great things about both environments, but one thing I can say for certain is that there
are more opportunities available to the average citizen in an urban area than in a rural. What're
your thoughts on this comparison?Mentee 2022-02-28, 17:14: I live in a rural area but i 100% agree
that there would be way more opportunities in an urban area than in a rural. There are some benifits
about living in a rural are even if its smaller, since the area is smaller there is way less people
and there is not much traffic which is nice. I know a lot of people and I see them quite often, and
when I get new classes for school I know most of the kids in my classes. There may be some good
things but its not all good. Since where I live is so small there is not very much to do and we dont
get much stores or places like skate parks. We also dont get a lot of opportunities for stuff like
jobs besides working in fast food. When you move to a urban city is it a lot to take in, since urban
cities are big and have lots of stuff will it take a bit for someone to realize how much there is to
do and how much opportunity there actually is compared to rural cities. JaxMentor 2022-03-03, 12:35:
Oh yea, I totally agree with you there. And yes, at times it did feel a bit overwhelming, but that
was partially because I was very young and moved to a new environment. I think adapting to a new
place is a slow process rather than instantaneous, so it would always be the safe bet to take it
slow and try to fit in the way that suits you. Like you said, there are more people in urban cities,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to get to know all of them. I personally have a
great friend group that I chat with all the time and meet regularly, so if you can find one for
yourself, I think that would also help in adapting to the new environment. What're your thoughts on
moving to an urban city, do you feel more excited or nervous?Mentee 2022-03-03, 17:25: I agree that
if someone found a friend group in a new place that has experience in urban cities it would be much
easier to get used to the area since you are with people from the area. On the topic of being exited
or nervous on moving to an urban city, I would feel exited on moving to a urban city since it's a
new environment and I could do lots of new things and meet lots of new people in the area. I can't
lie I would be a little nervous since it would be a new place and most likley a way bigger place
than where I from but I feel like the nerves would go away pretty quick once I get into the new
city. When you move to a new city how do you find out where everything you need is like stores for
food and resturants that you like?Mentor 2022-03-07, 00:00: I'm glad you feel excited, and of course
being nervous is also just a normal reaction to such an experience. Nevertheless, I believe you
shouldn't have any major issues in fitting in as long as you go at your own pace. As for the part
about finding anything in such a large place, from stores to restaurants, I personally find it
easiest to search on the internet. A quick search is really all you need to find many of the places
you are looking for nearby. Over time, you will just get accustomed to the place and know the nearby
places like the back of your hand 😅. If you have any more questions about the switch in
environments, feel free to ask now or even later on once you think of something, but until then let
me know if you would like to continue onto part 2 of this section.Mentee 2022-03-07, 16:59: Hi, for
now those are all of the questions I could think of. I am glad that the internet exists for reasons
like finding places since it makes life so much easier, if we didn't have the internet I guarantee
that life would be 100x harder when moving to new places. Anyways it would be great if you could
open up part 2 for us, thanks!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 15:30: Hey Jax! How are you? My name is Mehak, and I’ll be your mentor from here
on out! Well, I’ll just start off with a quick little introduction. I am 19 years old, and in my
second year at UBC studying Chemical Biology. Now I hope you could tell me more about yourself, it
could be anything. Like you could talk about your hobbies and interests. I see that you like playing
video games (I do too!), so what's your favourite game? What is your favourite subject? Right now,
my favourite subject is Chemistry because it can get very interesting, but in high school, I loved
math, mainly because of how accomplished I felt after understanding the topic. And of course, if you
ever have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask (I’m here for a reason haha).Mentee 2022-02-11,

soccer when im not at school, when I am in school my favourite subject has recently switched to
physics and chem because I just took both of them and really liked them. I was wondering what has it
been like studying Chemisty Biology because that seems like something that would interest me. Thank
you JaxMentee 2022-02-17, 15:30: YoMentor 2022-02-17, 20:27: Hey Jax, My bad for replying so late, I
had been really busy recently with exams and stuff. But yea, thanks for reminding me again.
Chemistry and physics are really interesting in general and it's great that they interest you.
Chemical biology is a combined major so I take an equal amount of chemistry and biology courses.
It's really fun in my opinion because I don't get overwhelmed with one subject and I have a lot of
options to choose from for my classes. And I hope to help you understand what it's like after high
school in the upcoming conversations. Let me know if you are ready to start those!Mentee 2022-02-22,
17:03: Hi, I totally understand that exams and school work is more important and would take up most
of your time. It makes sense since you are in post-secondary and school is way more important there
than in highschool, thanks for responding though. I didn't realize that you could have mixed majors
like chemisty biology, is there anything like Chem physics? personally I find physics more
interesting then biology, I still enjoy both of them though. Hope you have a great rest of you week!

might have been on your spring break! How was your spring break? Did you have fun? I have been fine
as well, although a bit stressed as my finals are quickly coming up. I'm glad you gave the video a
watch, and honestly you can share whatever you'd like about it. Anything you learned, felt
interesting, could relate to, etc. I look forward to your response.Mentee 2022-03-29, 16:47: Hi, my
spring-break was pretty good for the first week since I got a cast off my arm since I broke it about
6 weeks ago. the second week of spring break wasn't the best because I got covid and was pretty sick
for about 5 days. I hope finals go good for you. During that video the only thing I thought about
was the song in the video, I didn't understand what was going on or what the song was about but it
wasn't that bad of a song. Besides that I don't really have anything else about the video.Mentor
2022-04-02, 03:24: Oh I see, you had a surprising spring break, but I'm glad you're doing better
now. As for the video, I agree, it was quite abstract and complex, especially as there was so much
going on at once that it seems a bit difficult to digest. I personally believe, though, that the
feelings you would gain from this would be quite unique to yourself as it is a lot about what
catches your eye and interest you most. I also found the song quite interesting and thrilling,
especially near the end. I don't know if you would like to discuss anything else about this text and
video, and if not let me know and we can move on!Mentee 2022-04-05, 17:51: Hi, I can agree that
there was a lot going on at once making it very hard to follow.I got nothing I can thing of left to

home early yesterday because I was not feeling very good. I hope you had a great weekend! JaxMentor
2022-04-10, 01:52: Oh, I hope you had a great week as well. It has been quite busy lately for me as
my finals are just around the corner, unfortunately. I see that we have talked enough about this
section already and so, I believe we can just move on. Before that though, are you required to or
would you like to do the extension activities related to this conversation? If not, we can continue
on to the next conversation.Mentee 2022-04-11, 17:20: Hi, I am not sure what the extension activites
are and my teacher has not told me about them. If you feel like they would be good to do we should
do them, if you feel like we should move on that works aswell. I hope your finals go well for you!
JaxMentor 2022-04-15, 01:27: Since you're still unsure about whether the extension activities are
necessary, we can just move on for now, to make sure we can finish all the necessary conversations
on time. And if we have time near the end, we can always just come back and do the extension
activities then. For now, I'll just open up a new conversation. Which one were you thinking about
doing next? And thanks for the support, I just had two finals this week, it was a lot to take in
haha.Mentee 2022-04-19, 17:36: Hi, im not sure if there is a order you do them in or if you just do
them at random. If there is no order I think it would be interesting to do ""Entering the job
market"". I think this one would be a fun one to do. Jax",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about myself before we start on this mentor and mentee journey. I'm a first year student pursuing
Biology and hoping to get into med school. As you may know I'm also really into acting and anything
theatre related. Which is something you also like so, YAY! Theatre kids for the win! I would love to
know what kind of acting you prefer and if you have any favorite plays or musicals. For me it would
be my favourite musical is Beetlejuice and Dear Evan Hansen. I'm super excited to start working with
you and talk more about acting! -MaiaMentee 2022-02-15, 17:47: Hi Maia, Its also very nice to meet
you I see that we both have a lot in common, I love learning about bio in science and I was also
wanting to go into med school to become an RN nurse. Wait no way you were also a theater kid!? I
used to theater when I was younger but now, I’m doing acting as a professional actor doing movies
and series, hopefully that is what I’m going to be when I’m older. Is med school what you want to do
in the future? You were talking how you love beetle juice? I love it too! But I love Hamilton way
more I think I’ve watched so many times. Well its really nice talking to you talk soon!Mentor
2022-02-15, 20:43: Hey Hope, It sure sounds like we have a lot in common! It's so cool that you are
doing professional acting! Would you say you like acting on screen more that on stage? As well what
made you want to go into being a nurse before? I'll admit I'm not very informed on how to pursue
acting after highschool, but I'm more than excited to start doing my research and learn together of
future possibilities for you to become a professional actor! Yes! Med school is possibly one of the
things i'll end up or doing or research. I would say Hamilton is my third favourite musical,
anything made by Lin Manuel Miranda is a masterpiece. What would you say is your favourtie part of
acting and what you are learning in science class? As well do you have any conversation you want to
start first? Anyways it was nice talking to you, talk soon and take care!Mentee 2022-02-17, 15:43:
Hello Maia, I would say I like acting on screen a lot more because I get more chances to act and
redo a scene if I don’t like it. And the reason I wanted to become a nurse is to help people as much
a possible because recently my mom passed away and seeing the nurses and doctors try to help her was
very heart felt to me. Yes, acting is very exciting I love it I would so recommend you do it! My
favorite part of acting is be8ing able to be someone else then me so basically, I like being in
someone else shoes other than myself. Right now, I’m learning Chemistry which is not really my
favorite. And for what I’m wondering how did you want to you wanted to go in med school? And how did
you pay for it? Also how do you like going into university after high school?Mentor 2022-02-18,
16:17: Hey Hope, how's it going? Yeah in theatre you really don't have a chance to redo it, but it
sure makes for funny stories. How long have you done professional acting? My condolences about your
mom, it was really nice that she was treated by kind and helpful doctors and nurses. I tried for a
while to do acting when I was in middle school, as much fun as it was I like theatre more and then
grew to love the tech side of theatre and directing plays. Yeah being someone else is a lot of fun,
is there a certain type of chracter trope you enjoy? I always like playing either the clown of the
show or the mean and cruel character. (Yeah they are very opposite which makes it fun haha) Oh yeah
chemistry wasn't my cup of tea, even know it's probably my least favourite course. I knew I wanted
to go to med school since I was fairly young, I saw that overall there was a lot of need for
doctors, but even more for kind and well trained doctors who care about their patients. I'm not in
med school yet, just on first year of univeristy. So, how I pay for univeristy is by working in the
summers and saving the money, going after bursaries and scholarships during my high school years,
some that my univeristy offers, and outside scholarships that companies or organizations offer to
students. As well I did depend on my family to cover the other costs but going after money like that
helped me reduce my tuition by a lot. For med schools I plan on doing the same and probably start
saving up for it. I've actually really enjoyed university so far, it is a lot different than high
school, of course. The courses are more in depth and challenging but if you like what you are
majoring in it makes it a lot more enjoyable to do. I also enjoy the independency that you get from
it as now i'm more in charge of what I'm learning and how im living. Do you have any questions about
life in university or high school? Im more than happy to answer anything that you are
wondering.Mentor 2022-03-02, 14:03: Hey Hope how is it going? I hope everything is going well on
your end. I can't believe that its already March! time really passes by fast doesn't it? If you have
time over this week I would love to hear from you and if you've been up to anything related to
acting so far.Mentor 2022-03-07, 19:52: Hey Hope! How was your weekend? were you able to rest and
have some fun? It's been a while since we talked, how are you doing?Mentee 2022-03-10, 16:54: Hey
Maia, I am doing good thanks. How about yourself? Sorry I have not answered in a while I’ve been so
busy with schoolwork. And I know its so cool that we have the same interest of acting. Not going in
Port Alberni for much longer because I’m moving soon to Nanaimo to be closer to my dads work and
acting for me. And I’ve been taking law studies in school and I’m starting you love it and maybe if
acting doesn’t work out, I’m going to become a lawyer or a criminology. And my weekend was good did
a lot how about yourself? And this might be the last time I will talk to you because ill be moving
schools after school but it was so nice to talk to you and learn lots about you😊 I hope the best for
you.Mentor 2022-03-10, 21:01: Hey Hope! I'm also doing pretty good. That's great that you found
another interest, and in law studies! thats pretty cool! Happy to hear you are moving somehwere else
for your acting, I wish you the best on your future career, whatever that may be. I'm sure you will
succeed in whatever you put your mind on. It was really nice meeting you and getting a chance to
know you. Take care!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for the late start to everything, as you said lifes been a little hectic lately. But thank you for
being so understanding and patient I super appreciate it. Although I can't even imagine the stresses

like to share what you've come up with? Maybe we can discuss a couple of items on the list that you
struggle with and brainstorm ways to improve them? - ALexaMentee 2022-04-12, 14:12: Sorry about the
long wait again I honestly forgot about this for awhile. I was a little confused on what to do but i
suppose im just answering the questions?? im very aware of how important self care is. its always on
the back of my mind i wouldnt say i have anyone in my life who models self care but i have people
who encourage my self care and well being. just simple things like making sure im sleeping enough,
drinking water, taking all my necessary pills, etc. poor mental and physical health resluting in
major hair loss, poor grades, friendships drifting no physical activity loll i just lay in my bed
mosts days im honestly not really thinking of post secondary so no point in answering this i get a
decent nights sleep most nights. except weekends i rarely eat healthy food i drink water daily but
not as much as a should in regards to like an actual job, i start my second job this friday where i
get a scheduled 30 min and 15 min break, while i dont really do schoolwork very often, so it would
be like more me taking a break from doing nothing to get schoolwork done.. if that makes senseMentor
2022-04-14, 13:37: Hi Hannah, No worries! Sorry for the confusion on what to do. I was supposed to
share first, but I thought you were, haha! Thanks for answering the questions anyway. You're not
alone in your habits. High school is when you're supposed to be figuring things out, so it's not
uncommon to have real self-care plan or routine. I'm glad that you have a good support system and
that you're managing for the most part! I'm also sorry to hear that you've noticed some things
resulting from needing proper self-care. If you feel like you're the only one who's experiencing
this, you're not! Of course it's not ideal, but it seems like you have good people around you and
you're aware of what you need to do, and I think that slowly, you'll be able to learn to navigate
through things and find the right time and way to take care of yourself better. In high school, the
best thing I ever did was learn how to set achievable goals. The idea seems nerve-wracking, but it's
really just about taking small steps. One of the best things I did in high school was learn how to
manage my time. Because of that, I was considerably less stressed about school than everybody else.
It's not as hard as you think. I started by dedicating parts of my day to one thing, for example,
finishing an assignment. I did this a few days before the deadline so that I wasn't cut for time. I
would always feel so relieved that I was finished before the due date while everyone around me was
stressing. It's honestly the best feeling LOL. But with that, I eventually had time for everything
else, even laying on my bed watching YouTube for a couple hours (or more). It doesn't seem that
you're struggling too much with that, but in terms of the parts of self-care that you struggle with,
I'd like to suggest setting small goals so that you can take better care of yourself. You can start
with drinking a bit more water everyday. For example, if you only drink one water bottle a day, try
drinking 1.5 bottles a day. Do you have any other ideas on how you can maximise your self-care
routine? Again, thanks for replying Hannah. If I don't get to talk to you until after the long
weekend, I hope you have a great and safe holiday! - Alexa",,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 14:43: Hi Hannah! My name is Alexa (yes, like that Alexa, but I won't play you

1047551371,1047554045,2/9/2022 18:27,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-17, 11:51: Thank you for opening this! Three things that I like about rural living
are as follows; there are less people, which is good because I am not a very social person, it is a
smaller area so I have less commuting time to and from the places I go. There is also more wildlife
where I am from, and I enjoy being out in nature because of it. Two things I don't like, however, is
that because of the fewer people, I see people that I am not as fond of more often. Anouther thing
is that there are less things to do in a small community, which forces me to travel further to do
more activities. One thing that concerns me about moving to a larger city is the higher rent rates
and housing costs. I understand that going to a university can be expensive, so how can I balance
the cost of that as well as basic living necessities without having a lot of dept follow me through
my life?Mentor 2022-02-19, 00:47: Thanks for the questions and I'm so sorry for answering so late!
Money would definitely be something to be concerned about when you're living in the city. I would
suggest getting a part-time job to help alleviate the financial burden, or applying for a
scholarship at your institution would help as well. there are a lot of scholarships you can look for
that ranges from academics to sports to even volunteering i believe. So it would help you
financially to look into that, especially when you'd want to do well in school already (i mean
you're paying for the tuition gotta make that money worth lol). I am taking up a part-time job aside
from school, and it will be quite tough if you're taking a full course, but you may also feel more
stress thinking about money and such. I have my parents' help in paying my tuition and some expenses
but I understand that not everyone's financial situation allows that so looking up part-time jobs to
do in your free time or applying for scholarships can help. I would also look up saving accounts and
stuff like that but that might be a bit too much hahaMentee 2022-02-22, 13:27: Thank you for the
suggestions, I will definately look into some scholorships that I qualify for, and will try to find
a job now so I can save the money I make. Anouther thing that concerns me is public transportation
in lue of a vehicle. Do you have any suggestions on what types of such transportation is more
affordable, as I have heard that buses and the like can be quite pricey, and cycling is not my
prefered mode of transportation due to the unpleasant weather where I live?Mentor 2022-02-23, 01:57:
hm, from what I am aware, your tuition would include a bus pass so you can pay for your bus fare at
the beginning of your school year at university, at least that's what my uni does, but if not I
would prob get a car if i can afford it :/Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:27: I didn't know that universities
offered bus passes, that is definately more convinient when included in the tuition, thank you for
telling me that, I really appreciate it. Could you please open from rural to urban part two and we
could begin that conversation? Thank you.","Mentor 2022-03-28, 14:03: Just opened it for you, feel free to ask me anything if you got questions
:)Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:10: I completed the questions before and after the video, and these are my
answers. What does it mean to study something? It means looking at it from different perspectives
and researching the topic further to better understand the material. What do you do when you study?
When I study, I look over all the material multiple times, and ask questions or research them if I
do not understand it fully. After that, I get someone to quiz me on the subject to make certain that
I fully understand the material given. What have you been previously taught about how to study? I
have always been taught to make sure I understand what I am studying and not simply memorize it. I
have also been taught to look over the material again right before bed so that it will be fresh in
my mind for the morning Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What
was your experience with those skills? I have tried a number of these strategies, and have found
that, so far, most of these have not worked particularly well for me. Which strategy seems the most
useful to you? Explain your thinking. I did find that relating real life knowledge to the material
helped me understand it better, and using real life examples also helped. Which strategy do you
think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the case? I Would find that spreading out
my studying over time would make it more difficult for me to understand and remember for later. Do
you have any questions about these strategies? Are there any strategies you would add to this list?
Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? I think that if they added
getting someone to quiz you rather than writing down what you can remember at the time. How likely
is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in
the way of you trying these strategies? I do not think that I will be trying these strategies
because they would not work for me and my learning style.Mentor 2022-04-01, 02:35: (the way i've
watched these vids before when I was in high school as well 💀) I'm glad to see you understand these
vids and I can see that you put yourself to quite a high standard when it comes to studying. It is
hard to find a style of studying that suits you and it can feel discouraging when you can't really
see a good result even after studying, I know I have been struggling with finding a studying method
that really suits me. Eventually, I learned that i study best when I am able to set up questions and
answer them to test my knowledge. And if you find it hard to really set up questions, what i would
do is ask my teachers if they are willing to hand out test questions from the previous years and do
them yourselves. Maybe this can help you study better?Mentee 2022-04-07, 13:12: I think that since I
finished the extention activities, that there is a survey that I am supposed to complete. Would you
please open that for me and then we could start a new section after? Thanks!Mentor 2022-04-08,

taking care of myself, however, I find it difficult to find the time to do such things for myself. I
noticed that I should be spending more time doing things for my well being, although what I have
tried has so far been unsuccessful. I was wondering if you had any suggestions to improve my well
being, or maybe things that worked for you?Mentor 2022-04-13, 22:44: hm, personally i just go on
youtube and watch videos, i do enjoy watching people cook though it does make me hungry sometimes
but it's very calming when ppl cook. I also play Minecraft sometimes lol but i don't really do that
a lot now cuz i end up playing for too long i forgot my own work, so I practice typing whenever I
take breaks and just have some downtime. Honestly, self-care to me is just doing nothing for a
while, or doing something completely useless to your studies, work, whatever. I think that's what
self-care means to me really.Mentee 2022-04-14, 13:12: I think that just doing nothing for a while
would be really beneficial for me, because I always seem to be doing something. Doing nothing, at
least nothing particularily strenuous, will be something I am going to try to do more often.Mentor

down my response as follows: The director did a very good job of showing the differences between
living in the country and living in the city, although they showed the extremes of both. They showed
how different it was to live in the country, having to survive using limited supplies in some
places. Whereas living in the city, you have everything under your fingertips, as shown through the
typing, and that can be very overwhelming to someone, anyone, not used to living in such conditions,
and vise versa for someone moving to the country from the city. I can relate to being as overwhelmed
as they showed the girl was when in the city, as I am also not used to being in a large city and
would feel uncomfortable as well. I felt very anxious while watching the video, the images flashing
by so quickly and the music fast, though I suppose that was the whole point. They slowed the images
down during the country scenes when the man was in the river to make the viewer calmer and paint
country living in a better light. I found that this film accurately expressed how I feel, and the
things that I worry about, when moving to a larger city.Mentor 2022-03-02, 13:52: Yeah, i get what
you mean. I grew up in the city all my life so moving for me didn't feel that overwhelming other
than the cultural differences since I didn't grow up in Canada. I think that the fast-paced of the
pictures moving can contribute to how fast pace the city is since there is a lot more transport that
can shortening travelling time but also how the culture in the city is everything has to move
quickly and have to move on from one thing to another in a really short period of time. I think
anxiety would come whenever you need to move, it is a big change for anyone who lives in a
stationary place. It is important to find support when you need to move, whether is it to find
friends, talk to family, or find a therapist. I know win BC there is an ap called Here2Talk that
provides 24hr online counselling, that may be useful when you do think about coming to the city for
further education :) also, so sorry for the late reply, i couldn't see your message earlier 🙏Mentor

for making clearer notes to study for the future, bc you might just scribble something on that might
not be legible and you might forget what you wrote in a few weeks so i find it better to write down
notes on the subject. And I think that setting up days to do quizzes on different subjects sounds
like a great idea, I didn't do that for the longest time because i didn't know how to study well and
really learn what was taught. It took me a while to realize that quizzing myself is the best way to

of my house, and do chores daily. Getting around town – using public transit Not yet I cannot drive
yet, and I don’t use public transportation, however I intent to start driving once I am able.
Finding a doctor, dentist, etc. and making appointments Not yet I intend to start making some of my
own appt. Paying bills Not yet I will ask how my parents do the bills and see if I can look at them
when they do. Doing household repairs/calling for repair services Yes I can do many household
repairs, and am able to ask for help when I don’t know how to do them. Banking – making e-transfers,
money order, bank draft, writing a cheque Not yet I don’t know how to do these things yet, seeing as
I have no money, nor a job to get any yet, however once I get some, I intend to learn how to do such
things. This is what I have for the skills/responsibilities activity.Mentor 2022-04-19, 14:08: I see
that you've made the table and i think one of the most important life skills you need to how to
cook, so I think you're pretty much set for the real world lol. But seriously, a lot of the other
skills that you are not confident in yet are skills that you will learn eventually when you live on
your own, I've only started doing banking stuff after I started living alone. These skills may look
intimidating at first like calling to make appointments, but once you made your first step, it isn't
so stressful after all. All you need to know now is that you still have your family's support and
you don't have to worry about them currently, and you have plenty of time to learn a thing or two
from your family.",,,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:15: I did the keeping traditions activity, and this is what I said; During
Christmas time I would open one present early with my family on Christmas eve, they were always
pajamas so that I could wear them on Christmas day. On Christmas, around one o'clock, me and my
family would go to my grandparents’ house for dinner, we could get up to 25 people at a time. We
would play games or go downstairs to the pool table. When I go away for University, I will make a
point of always coming home for the holidays to spend them with my family, because that tradition is
very important to me.Mentor 2022-03-09, 15:29: aw that's very sweet, I'm glad you have a tight
relationship with your family. I also have a tradition basically the same as yours on Christmas
haha. And usually, I would meet my family for Chinese New Year as well, but because I have to move
out of the country for university, I didn't get to meet my family in person this year, though I am
able to video call them and meet them for a little while so it helped with my homesickness a bit.
Tradition does help with adapting to a new life and I'm glad to hear you have one that you can find
comfort with.",,"Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:11: I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to reply, I have been busy recently. I do
think that having support from my family will really help my transition, and I am glad I have it.
The universities I want to go to are not very far from them, so that will help as well. Sorry again
for not replying sooner.Mentee 2022-03-11, 13:31: I did the easing traditions assignment and this is
what I could come up with based on what I do: Easing traditions Home Victoria Coffee shops:
Starbucks- 3800 Finnerty Rd Tim Hortons- Shelbourne St_ Bookstore: Bolen books- Hillside Ave _
Sushi: Machi Sushi- Cadboro Bay Rd_ Restaurants: The Keg- Fort Street The Empress- Government Street
10 Acres- 620 Humboldt St _Mentor 2022-03-11, 13:48: nice, i'm glad to see you can find some
""replacements"" near where you would live later on. Where I used to live there has boba tea shops
nearby that I would go to often but where I'm living rn it's kind of hard to find stores that sell
good boba :/ but I'm gad you can find sth for yourself :)Mentor 2022-03-11, 13:49: I think this is
the end of this module, would you like to start a new one? Which one would you like to go for
next?Mentee 2022-03-28, 13:19: Hi, yes I would like to start the studying portion if that is
alright. Thank you!Mentee 2022-03-31, 13:04: Alright I will, Thank you!",,,"Mentor 2022-04-08, 02:47: I just opened the survey, you should be able to fill it, and tell me which

section, you can find a blue link upon the Send Message part, it will take you to the Anchor Text 1
called Where We Live with the two beautiful pictures under 😆. Let me know if you can not find it,
ok? As promised, I will tell you a little bit about my journey as an international from a small
country to a big beautiful country like Canada. Actually, I dreamed of studying abroad for a long
time, but it took me several years to complete it. I had to go through a lot of difficulties to be
able to come to Canada, but when I came here I felt like all my efforts were worth it. I've been
here for over two years and I love living here. There are many reasons why I like Canada so much: 1.
The scenery here is very beautiful with four distinct seasons. The air here is also very cool and
fresh 2. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful. For example, when I walk to school, even though
we don't know each other, people always smile at me and say hello. That small thing makes me feel
very happy and lovely 3. The biggest benefit that I gained when I study abroad is that I have a new
language, friends from many different countries and more advanced as well as new education. 4. I
also learned a lot of interesting things from other cultures. 5. The opportunities for your future
career will also expand Actually, there are many opportunities that you can get even if you are
moving from the countryside to the city or from one country to another. And I believe that big
changes I made are worth it 😄 However, when moving from one place to another, we cannot ignore
mention its limitations: 1. If you are a person who has never been away from home like me, then the
first thing you will encounter is homesickness. Then what should we do to overcome that? My sincere
advice is to make a lot of friends or take the time to explore the area you live in. The worst thing
I've ever done wrong is keeping myself busy, it's not necessarily bad, but it's not a good solution
to keep you going. So, to avoid homesickness, find yourself a lot of friends, it will help you have
more fun and learn more things. 2. If you decide to move to a new place for your studies, keep that
in mind. Because sometimes the part-time job will make you forget that important thing. Part-time
work is great because it will help you build your own experience, but that was not your main goal at
the first time. So, we should try to balance them well! 😊 3. A few other drawbacks I encountered
were language and cultural barriers. However, it is easy to overcome because I love to expand my
knowledge about it, so I try to overcome it by learning every day. You know, when you decide to move
from one place to another new place or from one country to another, you have already accepted its
limitations. Life in a new place is not easy, especially when you are far away from your family.
However, everything you get will be worth your effort and you will learn to be more responsible for
yourself. 😇 Oh! All of the above sharing comes from my personal experiences only. ^^ So, Ella, What
do you think? Have you ever thought about moving to a new place (a new city or country) to study or
work (maybe)? And If yes, then Where would you like to go?Mentee 2022-02-17, 12:23: 1. i like that i
can go for a walk outside and i know everybody in my neighbourhood. 2. im not worried about any like
crimes happening like break ins or stuff like that because of were i live. 3. i also enjoy there not
being a lot of people in town, i think where i live theres like around 3 thousand people. 4. one
thing i dont like is that we have no mall, i have to go an hour away to the closest mall and its not
even that good. 5. another bad thing is that there is surprisingly only one hishschool in my town so
obviously thats where everyone goes, people recycle friends and there is a lot of drama. 6. i go to
vancouver a lot so i already know quite a bit about the city, i am scared to one day have to drive
in the city. i really dont have any questions though because i already know quite a bit.Mentor
2022-02-17, 13:18: Good morning, Ella! Thank you for sharing with me your thought! 1. I think we're
the same 😊. I also like living in a place where you can comfortably walk around and chat or get to
know your neighbours. To be honest, I'm not that close to my neighbours, but I love the way people
give me a smile or a hello when I just run into them. It makes me feel like my day becomes happier
and warmer 2. I feel sorry to hear you talk about where you live😟. However, we cannot completely
eliminate it, can we? Crime can happen anywhere, just more or less often. It is important that we
know how to protect ourselves against all situations, right? 3. Wow, I found our common ground
again. I also like a peaceful place and not too busy, that's why I chose Kamloops 4. It's hard when
you have to spend about 1 hour getting to the mall. That's sad, isn't it? Especially when you want
to meet your friends every free time, it will take you a lot of time to be able to complete that
outing, right? I understand your feeling. However, at some point, you can also choose where you want
to go in the future, and I am sure that there will be many interesting things to have fun and
explore. 5. I understand that going to the same school and meeting a few friends over and over will
make you feel like nothing is interesting. However, sometimes it is better to build a lasting and
solid friendship than to have many friends. I meant it's not that I don't promote making friends 😐,
however, the only people who stand by you during your most difficult times are your closest
friends.😊 6. So you've been to Vancouver already? I've never been there, but I've heard it's one of
those cities worth living in. The weather there is also gentle and not too harsh like Toronto or
other places. Vancouver is also one of the trading cities between many cultures. The opportunity to
study and work there is also very good. Looks like Vancouver is the right place for you! Also, I
don't know if you've been to Victoria yet? I went there once, and I love it very much, because of
its beauty and I like the sea too. My Kamloops is also very good, not bustling, but very peaceful
and poetic. If you know another place, please share it with me! And the cities above are just
suggestions based on my experience. If you know anything else, please add it to me! 😄 So, Let's
think a bit wider😉! Have you ever thought about studying abroad? Do you have a country that you love
and would like to visit? And do you have a culture you want to learn about?Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:37:
good morning brianna, i have been to victoria a couple times, i usually go before back to school for
shopping. i actually went to vancouver this weekend to visit my cousins, i had a lot of fun but it
was a lot of sitting in a car driving from house to house. i also usually go shopping with my cousin
when im there but she broke her foot so we couldnt go. i have thought about studying abroad but i
feel it would be very stressful. on top of school you would have to learn the place and stuff like
that, i do think it would be cool though. i really want to travel to croatia, my moms side of the
famaily is from there and i really want to go there. my grandma lived there till she was 16 than
moved here by herself. she said she would take me to croatia for my grad present with my sister and
cousin since we are all the same age. i have many cousins and other family living there that i have
never met. i would also love to travel to paris since ive been learning french for 3 years and
planning on keeping going till grade 12. what made you decide to come to vancouver island to study?
i dont think im going to stay on vancouver island my whole life. are you on reading break right now?
because my teacher said that a lot of schools would be right now.Mentor 2022-02-22, 15:04: Welcome
back, Ella! Isn't it fun to go shopping with your family members? I'm glad you had a wonderful trip
to Vancouver, however, I'm sorry to hear about your cousin's accident. I hope her foot get well
soon! Was your mother's family really in Croatia? That was amazing! Although I've never been there,
I've seen Croatia in pictures and videos, it's a beautiful place! And, travelling there when you and
your cousin graduate is a great gift. I believe it will be a trip that you will never forget! ^^ Oh,
I knew that you're learning French. That's admirable because I can not learn French. That's sad :(,
however, I'm learning Japanese right now! I want to travel to Japan as much as you want to go to
Paris! So let's try together! ^^ Oops, one thing that I didn't make clear to you is that I am
studying in Kamloops, a small city quite close to Vancouver. I'm really sorry for that. 😣 Okay, now
back to your question! 😄 The reason I came to Kamloops was that at that time I wanted to choose a
city that was not too noisy and crowded. Another slightly unfortunate reason is that I prepared for
the school search quite late and I missed a lot of opportunities. However, after going to Kamloops,
I don't regret it anymore. My life here is very good because the people here are very friendly and
sociable. My favourite thing here is in the spring, I mean after the snow melts and the sun starts
to return. Then I can garden and plant lots of flowers, I love that season the most! My studies here
are also very good because I have met a lot of good teachers and lovely friends. Another thing is,
yes your teacher is right, we are in the reading week break now. But after that, we will have to go
through midterm exams or assignments. Actually, this week is to help us prepare for the upcoming
tests without the time pressure! However, don't worry about sending me a message! Because I would
love to talk to you every week😊 You know what, I think we have done really well in this part! Let's
keep it up, Ella! I really enjoyed your stories! 😄 Alright! Would you like to stay here a little bit
more or Would you like me to take you to the next part? Because I think we still have a lot of
interesting things after that!Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:44: hey brianna, i would love to go to the next
part of this thing. thats cool that your learning japanese i feel like that is a really hard
language to learn. i have never been good at gardening but in the spring my mom always gardens. i
love the look of gardens there always so colourful. i think its nice that you guys get a prep time
before you have to do all your midterms.Mentee 2022-02-25, 13:16: hey brianna, i cant seem to find
the video i dont know where to look",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 20:36: Hi Ella! ^^ How are you doing? My name is Brianna and I am currently a
third-year Computer Science student at Thompson Rivers University. To be honest, I am really happy
to meet you and become your new friend this semester! :D I think you said that you have 2 dogs and 5
cats, right? I am also an animal lover and I can spend a whole day with my pets, too! By the way, I
have a dog and a cat at home as well and I love them so much. I hope that I will have a chance to
meet your cats and dogs someday, and I am sure they're really cute. Oh! I love baking and cooking,
too! I used to dream about opening a cafe to serve cakes and coffee to everyone. However, I hope I
can make that dream come true! ^^ I think we should spend some time after finishing the school work
to discuss the ideas of running a restaurant or cafe. ^^ It's a little bit about me! I would like to
hear about your story. Please feel free to share with me more about yourself or any interesting
things around your life. I am always happy to listen! :D Anyway, welcome Ella! ^^Mentee 2022-02-11,
12:28: hey brianna, im doing great how about you. i think its cool that you are an international
student and ive always thought about going to school somewhere far away. what are your pets names? i
dont know much about computer science and i would like to know about it.Mentor 2022-02-11, 13:24:
Good morning, Ella! I am glad to hear that you are doing great! ^^ I am currently in the middle of
my new semester, so I have a lot of tests coming up. However, don't hesitate to send messages
regularly to chat with me because I am always enjoying talking with you! :D Oh, right! I am an
international student and my experience while studying here is somewhat a little bit interesting, I
will share with you more when we enter ""From Rural to Urban"" section ^^. Becoming an international
student is a really good topic for us to discuss in that section. I will also share with you a few
exciting things in Computer Science major as well, so wait for it! ^^ As I shared in the previous
message I have pets at home which are a Labrador and her name is Paige and a British short-hair cat
with his name is Rupert (he is a 14-year old man now) ^^. When I have free time, I always make
something for them, for example, clothes. I have made a collar and crocheted a t-shirt for my cat,
he wasn't happy with it at all, but he still wore it! So, I am satisfied with that! I am really
surprised that you had 5 cats and 2 dogs, heh? Taking care of them might take a lot of work, right?
But, meeting them every day will bring us a lot of fun and relaxation. I think they have some secret
miracle power that they can melt our hearts and catch our attention at any time, don't they? By the
way, how is your new semester going? Is there anything interesting that you want to share with
me?Mentee 2022-02-15, 13:17: hi brianna, im excited for you to open the from urban to rural section,
i am very interested in it. i really like your pets names and its very cool that you make stuff for
them. my mom has a organization i guess you could call it, we rescue cats and thats why i have so
many, we try not to keep them and surprisngly weve only kept 3, the other 2 we already had. we once
rescued a kitten with paralyzed back legs, i tried to make him a wheelchair out of lego and it
somewhat worked but the people that adopted him got him a real one. it can be hard to take care of
all the animals and i really try to help out when i can by taking my dogs for a walk and making sure
the food bowls always have food. my dogs names are romeo and emma and they were both rescued from
mexico. my cats names are mack, cisco, gus, chloe, and karen. gus is my favourite. this semester is
going good. i sadly dont have any electives but not all my classes are hard. i have PE and career
and id say those are my easy classes, i also have math and science. most people in my grade had
science in first semester and now they have math or vise versa but i have both in one semester. i
can definitly handle all the work and id say im a pretty good student. in semester one i got 3 A's
and 2 B's. im hoping to get all A's this semester and id say that it is a pretty realistic goal. how
many classes do you have a week? i think the normal for post secondary is like 5 classes per
semester. my brother is studying at BCIT right now and i think thats how many classes he has. also,
do you have any classes on the weekend because ive heard of classes on the weekend and i think that
would be terrible.Mentor 2022-02-16, 12:15: Hi Ella! Thank you for sharing with me about the noble
work your mother and you have done. I really appreciate what your mom and you do to help homeless
cats and dogs. You know, for me that work is very beautiful.😊 I'm sorry you didn't have any
electives for this term, but I'm glad all the core subjects didn't keep you too busy and pressured.
I know and I believe you are a very good student. The effort will never be superfluous to get what
you want, but don't work too hard. You know, the results won't determine who you are, but your
efforts will. So don't put too much pressure on yourself, ok? 😇 And about how many subjects to
choose from in university depends on the program you choose, the regulations of the school and your
ability. With TRU (my university), each student must register for at least 3 subjects each term. I
also usually maintain 3 to 4 subjects a semester because I want to complete each subject with the
best results and quality. I also have a few friends like your brother, they also take 5 subjects a
semester, and they are very busy. However, Ella, that depends on your decision and also your
school's future regulations. Well, it's also a fact that my school doesn't have weekend classes.
However, that also depends on the program of study. Actually, I don't think many schools will let
their students study on weekends. So don't worry too much! 😉 Anyway, thank you for sharing with me
those things. They are all really interesting! And, if you have anything that makes you concerned,
just let me know. I will try to answer them as I can! 😄 Alright, let's start our main work! I meant
I will move you to our first fascinating section ""From Rural to Urban""! ^^",,,,"Mentor 2022-02-23, 21:59: Hi Ella! As you said, Japanese is a hard language, and I found that as
well 😅. That is because their alphabet and mine are not the same and it took me a lot of time to
learn the alphabet. Actually, I think learning a new language is not always easy; however, if you
love them, you will have a lot of motivation to learn. 😊 Oh, I am not sure whether I am a good
gardener or not. But, doing it makes me feel relaxed and happy. I think we usually do gardening
because we want to bring a lot of colours to our house and it also helps our house look more
brighter and beautiful. Another thing is that I am thankful that we had a reading week break now.
Because, it not only helps us prepare for our exams better, but it also gives us more time to take a
break during the busy semester. Alright, I have taken you to the second part of From Rural to Urban
section. In this section, we are going to watch a video (make sure you watch it, okay? 😊), then
let's have some small discussions about that. Let's consider the first two questions, which are: 1.
Is the director of the film trying to convey a message about the differences between living in the
country and in a city? In my opinion, I see both similarities and differences between urban and
rural areas, and I think many people will notice that too. The similarity between them is that no
matter where you live, you have to work. The first difference here is that in the countryside,
manual labour will be the main focus, and their working environment is nature, which is close to
them. In the city, the working environment will be more modern and it is divided into manual labour
such as construction workers or intellectual labour, such as working in an office. And if you work
with your mind, your life will be happier and less strenuous than with manual labour. The second
difference is, living in the countryside will help everyone get closer to nature. Whereas in the
city, we will only see buildings and structures. 2. Let's share our thoughts if there was anything
in the film that we found related to. From what I have experienced, I find that the difference
between rural and urban is very large. Rural areas will focus on occupations related to available
natural resources and mostly manual labour. However, the benefit here is that we will have the
opportunity to be closer to nature. In contrast, life in the city will favour technology and
machines. Surrounded by urbanites are skyscrapers and bustling nightlife. Positively when living in
the city is that we will have more opportunities to develop knowledge and career. However, no matter
where we live, the benefits will come with negatives, and if we have made our own choices, we are
ready to face those negatives. All the things shared above come from my personal experiences and I
do not have any intention to offend the countryside or the city 😊. Now, let me hear about your
thought, Ella! How do you think about those things above? Please feel free to correct my thought if
I was wrong, so we can learn from each other better. 😄Mentor 2022-02-25, 13:29: Oh no! I am so
sorry, my dear! I should give you a direction for that! 🥺 If you look beyond this Send Message
textbox, you can find a blue link called From Rural to Urban-part 2. Click that, then it will take
you to Anchor Text 2: Between Worlds. You will see a picture of a man rowing a boat, scrolling down
a little bit, then you can see the video 😊 Please let me know if you can or can not figure it out,
okay?😇 I am always happy to help you, Ella!Mentee 2022-03-03, 13:08: hi brianna, im sorry i havent
answered in a while ive had a few tests this week and ive been really busy with my school work. i
havent gotten to watch the video but i am going to try to watch it tonight when im on my hour break
at dance.Mentor 2022-03-03, 15:02: Hi Ella! Thank you for reaching out to me and letting me know
that you're busy right now! I understand your situation. It somewhat looks like mine as well! 😅 I am
quite busy this week with some midterm exams and assignments. So, take your time, Ella! There is no
rush here, okay? 😊 Make sure that you stay safe and take care of yourself as much as you can. You
can watch the video and do this Anchor Text whenever you want, my dear! Don't force yourself too
much! 😇 Oh! Good luck with your tests and school work! I believe that you can get a lot of good
marks If you need any help, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to help you!
^^Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:30: hi brianna, i finally got to watch the video. 1. i think the director is
trying to portray a message that shows how different people live.i agree and think that the
realationship between the two is that they both have to work. 2. i think that i can somewhat relate
to the living in the countryside just a bit, we work for ourselves a lot at my house like cutting
fire wood for the woodstove and other stuff like that, i can definitialy relate to the city side
also because i live their and i get to view everything first hand. these are really hard questions
to think about and i know my answers arent the best they could be. this classthat i am in when i
answer you is really demanding and we always have something to catch up on so i am just trying to
balance all my work.Mentor 2022-03-09, 13:44: Good morning, Ella! I am glad that you're back! And, I
am sorry to hear about your busy time 😣 You worked really hard, didn't you? So, I appreciate every
time you come here and have a discussion with me. I don't think there are any perfect answers, and
every answer is equally good. I also found it very difficult to give the answer same as you, so
don't feel pressured about it. I know you did a great job, even though you are very busy😊 Don't work
too hard, okay? Try your best with what you do and give yourself some time to rest up I like your
answers and the ways you give your opinion, so keep it up! 😉 I think we are good at this section.
Would you like to move on to the Extension Activity? There are two of them about Keeping Traditions
and Easing Traditions. So, which one would you like to do first?Mentee 2022-03-11, 13:01: good
morning brianna, i think we should do the keeping traditions activity. it sounds like fun, im not
sure if im supposed to start it right now or what. i dont know when the next time ill anser is
because this is my laast day before spring break so ill be gone for 2 weeks and i cant figure out
how to log on to the mentor site at home. im very excited for spring break and i have some fun
things planned. i will try to log on to this at home but just know if i dont answer for 2 weeks its
because i cant log on.Mentor 2022-03-11, 13:29: Hi Ella! Thank you for letting me know about your
Spring break! It's an exciting thing, isn't it? Oh! I will open Keeping Traditions for you and you
can do it whenever you want. 😄 I'm glad you still want to come and work with me during your spring
break. I really appreciate that. 😊 I don't know if it's the same for you and me to log in? But you
can try it! You can visit the website: www.mentorcity.com. You will then see a place for you to
enter your login information there. However, I am not sure about that, because the way we log in may
be different. So it's okay if you can't make it because you deserve this break, right? You've been
working hard this semester, so take time for yourself as much as you can! 😊 And whenever you come
back, just bring me lots of interesting stories! I would love to hear your Spring break stories, I
believe they will be very interesting ^^ Oh! Do you know where to go to the Keeping Traditions
section? We follow the same way as previous sections. There will be a blue link called ""Rural to
Urban - Ext. Activity: Keeping Traditions"" above the Send Message box, click it and it will take you
to the section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-11, 13:39: There we go, Ella! I took you there! There is an unfortunate thing is that
you will do this section on your own 😞. However, I am here if you need me to explain something or
support you with technical issues. ^^ Whenever you finish this section, just let me know, I will
take you to the new one. We have one more extension activity to go, then we finish the ""From Rural
to Urban"" topic. We have done a really good job! 😄 So, Ella, If this is the last time, I mean the
last time before Spring break 😆, then I hope you will have a good time with family and friends.
We'll see each other after the break! And, whenever you need me, just send me a message! I'm always
happy to help you 😊Mentee 2022-03-28, 13:45: hi brianna, i couldnt figure out how to log on to my
mentor things and now that im on im struggling to figure out how to do the keeping traditions. i
clicked on the thing but then it just took me to our old messages so if you can try to help me
figure that out.Mentor 2022-03-28, 16:32: Welcome back, Ella! 😄 I hope you had a good Spring Break!
And, I'm sorry with the issue that you had after coming back😔. However, don't feel stressful, we
will figure out together, okay! 😊 Now, let do step by step together, okay? So, as what I understood
is that when you are trying to click the blue link to Keeping Traditions, it will take you back to
our old Anchor Text, right? Or if It's not what you meant, please feel free to correct me, so I can
help you better😊Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:05: i found the assignment! one of my favourie traditions that
happens at christmas time is that me and my siblings get to open one present on christmas eve. its
always pajamas and its fun trying them on. we usually play a new board game or something. it says im
not supposed to actually send this to you but save it to my portfolio so just my teacher can see it
but im going to send it anyways.Mentor 2022-03-31, 14:18: Hi Ella! I am glad that you can finally
find the assignment 😊 And, Thank you for sending your assignment to me! That makes me very emotional
🥺 I also like Christmas as well. Because I live with a homestay family, I had the opportunity to
experience it. I love opening presents on Christmas morning. What I always get is pajamas just like
you. Actually, because I always wear pajamas at home, you know, they're very comfortable 😆. For that
reason, I often receive pajamas as a gift. Well, we don't play board games, but we do spend time
cooking dinner together or watching movies together. However, no matter what we do, Christmas is a
time for family, right? 😌 Alright! If you have done with this section, Shall I move you to the next
one? We have one more extension activity to do, then we finish this topic.😄",,"Mentor 2022-04-08, 10:50: Hi Ella! It has been a week since I received your message! I hope that you
are doing well!😊 Actually, not receiving your messages as often as before makes me feel a bit
strange and worried 🥺. But, I think you're probably pretty busy with your studies after Spring
break, aren't you? I hope you will see this message of mine and I hope you will connect with me
again!😄 Oh! You'll see that the message will appear in Extension Activity – Easing Transitions
because I brought us here. If you do not where it is, then looking for a blue link upon the Send
Message box, you will see Rural to Urban - Ext.Activity: Easing Traditions link, click it, then it
will take you to where I am now. I think it's because you've completed the Keeping Traditions
section that it sometimes makes it impossible for my messages to reach you, so I've moved us here.😊
If you see this message of mine, feel free to do the homework for this section! The sad thing is
that I am also allowed to do nothing with you in this part😞. However, if you have any problems, feel
free to connect with me! That way I'll know you're fine and I can help you too.😉 Anyway, reach out
to me whenever you see this message because I am looking forward to seeing you again😇Mentee
2022-04-08, 12:48: sorry brianna ive been busy with tests and stuff, ive also recently joined a
track team and thats been keeping me busy. so i think im on the right extension activity, its called
easing traditions and i will do it right now. it says im supposed to do it on a peice of paper so i

that you reached out to me right away😊! And, I can see your message appear at the same place as me,
which means you're at the right place! I was worried since I did not receive your message as
regularly. However, I know the reasons now. Thank you for letting me know or I might be freaking out
a little bit!.... I am just kidding😆 I also thought that you are busy with school work after a long
vacation. But, I didn't know you were on the track team, that's cool! 😮 Anyway, I am glad you're
still doing good! Please take care of yourself and don't overwork, okay? Oh! Thank you for thinking
about me whenever you do the extension activities, I appreciate that! Let me know if you finish this
section, I will take us to the new one. And, remember that I am always happy to help you with any
issues! 😄Mentor 2022-04-16, 16:16: Hi Ella! I hope you are doing well this week! It has been another
week since we talked together! I know that you're busy with the school work! So, I hope you are not
overworked, okay? 🥺 I just wondered whether you have done this section? If you had some problems,
please let me know. I am here whenever you need me! 😊 Anyway, be in touch with me for any reasons,
so it will help me know that you're still good! 😇 Oh! Another thing...Happy Easter Day! 😄 Wish you
have a good Easter day with your family and friends!Mentee 2022-04-19, 14:10: hey, brianna sorry for

your household income and how much your tuition is estimated to be. Different schools will also
offer bursaries or scholarship programs- some merit-based, some need-based, and you usually apply
for these around the same time as you apply for university or shortly after the school year starts.
I can't speak for other universities, but I know at UBC the worklearn program is pretty good- they
offer good part-time jobs (with priority to students), which often pay at a competitive rate (above
minimum wage!) and are fairly flexible in terms of hours because they are aware of students'
schedules. UBC also has the co-op program, where it's basically a year or 3 semesters of time off
school for full-time paid work. People also often work full-time during the summers if they're not
taking summer courses to save up some money! One thing that's worth looking into is doing a couple
years first at a community college (in Vancouver, somewhere like Langara college or BCIT), where
tuition is much cheaper, then transferring to UBC in your second or third year if that's something
you'd like to do. Of course, finishing a degree at college is also a great option, and a lot of
programs offered at BCIT have pretty good employment rates aftewards as well. I can't really speak
to financial aid options at these schools, but they are generally cheaper, and a lot of trades
degrees are less than 4 years as well, so you also get into the workforce much quicker :) Also, all
schools will have a financial aid office for students that you should definitely reach out to-
they'll be able to give you much more specific information about available scholarships and
bursaries, as well as help you out with applying for student loans if that's something you are
interested in. Let me know if you have any other questions!","Mentor 2022-02-18, 12:52: Looks like you'll be starting the conversation for this topic :) Look
forward to talking to you soon!Mentee 2022-02-28, 14:08: Hi Erica :) I personally don't enjoy living
in a rural area. Some things I like about it tho is the less of wait in lines, less reaffic and i
think that's about it. Some things I dislike about living in a rural area are the lack of stores as
I enjoy shopping, lack of people as I like places with many people and the overall vibes. One
question I have is what was it like moving into a bigger city? Was it a big change?Mentor
2022-02-28, 23:31: I can see how shorter wait times and less traffic would be nice benefits of
living in a rural place (one time, it took me 1.5 hours to drive to work when normally it takes 40
minutes)! It must be quite frustrating on the other hand to have limited stores and shopping centres
though- I think that's one thing people in bigger cities take for granted, the convenience of having
lots of stores and brands available. I can't really speak to moving to a larger city from somewhere
rural- the closest I've got is moving from the suburbs of a big city (Vancouver) to the downtown
core of a bigger city (Montreal). While I imagine the change won't be quite as drastic as maybe
where you're from, it definitely was still a noticeable change! Like you said, there's just so many
more people, and especially in the downtown core, it felt like the streets were never quiet. I
remember the first few weeks in Montreal I would be woken up at night from the police/ambulance/fire
truck sirens, though I eventually did get used to the noise. The other thing about living downtown
vs in the suburbs is that everything is much more condensed downtown- I could walk 5 minutes to the
grocery store, or 7 minutes to another grocery store, then in the same area was a whole bunch of
restaurants; another 5-10 minutes walking distance away were boutiques and shopping centres. I would
say that the biggest thing is to give yourself time to adjust. Those first few nights in downtown
Montreal had me stressing over how hard it would be get a decent night's sleep with all the noise,
but eventually the noises just became background white noise. So don't underestimate your ability to
adapt to change! And also remember to take in the positives- having everything within walking
distance was a huge bonus that I didn't fully appreciate at the time, because I was too focused on
how loud and annoying it was at night.Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:12: Hi Erica :) Wow wow that seems a big
change but I know I can do it! Could yu please open from rural to urban part 2 please :)Mentor
2022-03-09, 16:51: Hi Tyla! That's definitely the right spirit! I've opened up part 2, let me know
if it's not working for you :)Mentee 2022-04-13, 13:37: Hahaha oops how do i respond in the thingy

Dis- &amp; Misinformation tab ive been curious about it!Mentee 2022-04-19, 13:18: Hi Erica! I'd like
to start the paying for school conversation first! :) I'm looking forward to that one as i have no
idea how to pay for schooling yet. How do you pay for your schooling?",,,,,"Mentor 2022-04-07, 22:45: Hi Tyla! Self-care is a really important thing to take the time to do- it
definitely isn't something that should be a ""reward"" or ""treat"". I did have trouble at the start of
university because I always felt like I needed to be doing something- studying, volunteering, or
working. It felt like there was always something more I could be doing, like getting ahead of school
work, doing all the optional pre-readings, etc. It's a fairly common experience, I think, to feel
guilty about taking some time for yourself. In reality though, taking some time to go and get a nice
meal, or set aside time every day for a hobby does so much more for you in the long run- you end up
feeling better mentally, which makes you more productive at school/work/volunteer. The bonus: if
you're better-rested and more motivated, it might even take less time for you to get all the things
that you wanted to get done, done. Which leaves you more time for all the fun things you'd probably
enjoy more than studying! What do you think about taking the time for self-care? And how do you
think you'll be able to incorporate that into your lifestyle, when you're busy with school or work?
Look forward to chatting with you :)Mentor 2022-04-12, 18:06: HI Tyla! I saw your message under the
""complete conversation"" tab but I'll reply here to try and keep it a bit more organized haha. It's
great to hear that you're able to recognize when you feel a bit more stressed and start taking those
steps to taking better care of yourself! Grades are important but they definitely aren't as
important as taking care of yourself. And it's really good that you're trying to get more sleep-
sleep is so important! I always find myself doing better in school when I'm well-rested. I've
realized over the years that staying up late an extra few hours (and probably not retaining much
from it!) is never worth feeling tired the next day, which makes me even more unproductive. Similar
to you, I try and take the time to do things I enjoy- crochet, volleyball, even the occasional
baking. It definitely helps to just switch gears entirely from school/work and do something totally
different- I feel like it helps me decompress and stop thinking about whatever was stressing me out.
I'm also lucky enough to have nice trails and the beach not too far from where I live, so going out
for a long walk by the beach (yes, very cliche) is always nice on a sunny day. I hope you find time
for the things you enjoy! Let's both remember to take a break from work occasionally and make time
for us to do the things we actually want to be doing :)",,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 21:51: Hi Tyla! My name is Erica and I will be your mentor this semester :) A
little bit about me- I'm 24, I grew up in Vancouver, went to Montreal for my undergraduate degree,
and now I'm back at UBC completing a pharmacy degree- I'd be happy to answer any questions you might
have about that! I play volleyball, knit/crochet in my spare time, and I'm also working as a
pharmacy assistant at a Shopper's. It's really cool that your dream job would be chef! I'm not much
of a cook and mostly stick to baking (or microwaving leftovers)- what's your favourite thing to
make? And how is school going for you so far? Of course feel free to tell me anything else you'd
like to share as well :) Looking forward to hearing from you soon!Mentee 2022-02-11, 12:27: Hi Erica
its nice to meet you! :) That""s so cool that we have the same job! How long have you been working at
shopper's for, and what do u do so far? My school life is going very good, my grades are decent and
i have a lot of friends. Also i love making cookies or brownies! I read that you moved out at 18 i'm
very interested in doing that as i want to get away from my home, do u have any tips that you could
share? Can you also give me tips on how to find an apartement to rent? Any tips will help! Anyways
it's nice meeting you and i look forward to having you as my mentor!Mentor 2022-02-11, 20:58: It's
great to hear you're doing well! I started working at Shopper's last November, so far I'm just
filling and working till! And I'll slowly start doing more counselling and giving recommendations as
I learn more about the medications in school :) Are you enjoying the work so far? We can for sure
talk about moving and finding places to rent! It can definitely be intimidating to move out so I'm
happy to share my experiences with you- did you want to start then with the From Rural to Urban
conversation topic? We can talk more about it there and it seems to fit nicely with what you're
interested in! Let me know if that's what you'd like to do and I'll unlock that conversation for
you. Chat soon!Mentee 2022-02-17, 13:52: Oh wow wow thats so cool i started working this december! I
love working at Shopper's I get to start filling very soon! I love the people at my job so its very
enjoyable. Yes i'd love to start with the rural to urban conversation! Can u also tell me a little
about you moving out at 18 and how it went? :)Mentor 2022-02-18, 12:51: Hi Tyla! For sure I can tell
you a bit about moving out :) The biggest thing is I definitely could not have done it alone! I had
a lot of help, mostly from my parents, who actually came with me from Vancouver to Montreal to help
me get everything set up in my dorm. So the actual moving process was about as painless as could be.
What I wasn't quite prepared for was the homesickness- dorm food obviously is many steps down from
home-cooking, I missed my dog, I missed having my own room/bathroom (again- dorm life!), etc. I was
doing a lot of video-calling when my roommate was out, and basically just calling home every night.
It didn't help that the whole moving out experience was compounded with being in university for the
first time- classes were huge, there were so many midterms coming up- it wasn't the best first month
of living alone. Eventually things did get better and I did begin enjoying living alone, but for me
it just took some time. I like sharing this experience because while I was going through it, it
seemed like everyone around me was having the time of their lives, while I was really quite
miserable for a good couple weeks. Obviously, I hope you'll have a great time when you move out! And
for most people, that is the case. But I think it's important to know that it's definitely okay to
not be happy and excited for a bit, because moving out can be stressful and hard, and if you find
yourself feeling that way- you aren't alone, but know that it will get better with time. I'd be
happy to answer any more questions you have about moving! I think MentorCity now lets us view all
our messages even when we start a new conversation, so I'll unlock the Rural to Urban one, and if
you want to chat more about moving out, we can continue that here :)Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:30: Hi
Erica :) ! Thank you for telling me about your experience! I'm very excited to move out! I know its
gonna be hard especially since i won't have my parents support but i do have lots of other people
wanting to help! Do you know anything about paying rent? Or finding a place to rent? When you moved
did you have a budget? Also do you know how to pay bills as that's something i'm not sure how to do?
I am so so excited to move out but i know it's gonna be very hard.Mentor 2022-02-23, 14:39: It's
great that you have people around you willing to help! For finding a place to rent- it really
depends on the city/town you're moving to! In Vancouver, I've had luck with craigslist, but in
Montreal, they used Kijiji more. The biggest thing to watch out for on those online platforms though
is scams- if it's too good to be true, then it probably is (and never ever put down a deposit for a
place you've never seen! It's too common, especially in larger cities, for people to post pictures
of apartments that aren't theirs, then claim to be out of town and need you to e-transfer a deposit
to secure the place). I would definitely recommend to start looking for a place about 2 months
before you want to move, and then make a trip out in order to visit different neighbourhoods as well
as actually see a few places/sign a lease if all goes well, just to avoid signing for a place you've
never seen before since online pictures can be quite misleading. I've also seen people move first to
an AirBnB for a couple days while they look for a place, just to minimize the chances of scammed by
someone online. If you are moving out for school, then often there will be Facebook groups for
students looking for roommates or subletting their apartments as well. As for paying for rent, it
will depend on your landlord. Some prefer e-transfer, some will ask for post-dated cheques. Most
banks these days won't charge you a fee for e-transfer, but that might be something to look into if
you're not sure what kind of account you have. Paying bills again will depend on a lot of things,
like if utilities (gas/electricity/hot water) are included in your rent or not, then if they're not,
it would depend on the city as well and how they charge for utilities. I can only speak for
Vancouver- you can set up automated payments directly to BCHydro for electricity. For things like
wifi/phone plans, you can also set up online payments, though I use a credit card for that (I
believe a debit visa should work as well if you don't have a credit card). Essentially- online
banking is the way to go for a lot of these things, especially if you're renting (I've never
received a paper bill haha). I didn't have an exact budget when I moved out, but I did keep track of
what I was spending in an Excel sheet, and tried to limit eating out when I could. There's loads of
student budgeting tips online though if you want to look into that! And again, if you are moving out
for school, there are usually financial advisors you can speak to and they'll definitely be able to
help you out. If not for school, then try talking to people at work and see what they're doing!
Generally, most people are happy to help if you reach out. I've given you quite a bit to read there!
We can always revisit this topic as we move through the Rural to Urban conversation- I've opened it
up for you, let's chat about that next :) Let me know if you're having trouble accessing the
conversation page!",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-09, 17:01: Hi Tyla, hope you enjoyed the video! Personally, I found it really
interesting how the video starts off pretty slow-paced and we get to see more traditional First
Nations' way of living, with building cabins and canoes by hand; then, as the music picks up pace,
the video clips get sped up as well- almost representing how the people in the video were perhaps
struggling to keep up with modernization (for example, the contrast between chopping down individual
trees to get logs, versus the very industrial crane + metal buildings) and how much faster the pace
of life is in larger urban centres. I also felt like it showed how much faster the process of
modernization is in larger urban centres compared to rural, and how change is slower the further you
are from an urban area. That's what really caught my attention- how the music matches with the video
clips they used. Let me know what you think!Mentee 2022-03-31, 13:56: Hi Erica. I found this video
interesting as it begins to bulid up and shows us tradional First Nation's ways of living such as
the fishing and hunting. It was interesting to see the change between the Natives way of life in a
rural area to a urban city that moves fast with machines and technology.Mentor 2022-04-04, 17:12: Hi
Tyla, I hope you had a great spring break! Sorry for the delay in replying. Definitely agree about
the pacing and transition of rural to urban- I think it was a really interesting video! Do you think
there are any parallels between the video and how you feel about moving to a big city? Let me know

Thomas, these are the questions; You, the mentee, will start this conversation. First, share with
your mentor: Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it.
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. One question you have about
living or moving to the city Your mentor will ask some follow-up questions to help you explore your
ideas about living in the country. Feel free to ask your mentor any questions that arise for you. In
addition to answering your questions, your mentor will share some experiences they may have had when
they started school in the city.Mentee 2022-03-03, 17:21: 1: i personally like living in a rural
area because of the people you can meet around your own neighborhood and even stores. 2: There are
also alot of cool spots in port alberni like trails that head up the mountins or that lead to a
creek where that i really enjoy my time at. 3: I dont have to walk very far to get to a friends
house and a store to get something to drink or go to a nice swimming area i can also choose whiether
to take the bus or not because the school is only 20 mins away.Mentor 2022-03-08, 12:09: Growing up
in a rural setting I enjoyed exploring the woods; hiking trails; being out on the ocean. You can't
get that in an urban setting, luckily in Vancouver nature is not that far away where you are. Things
I didn't like growing up remotely is there was no movie theatres, no fast food (good thing I guess),
the only thing we had was a Band Store lol Moving to Vancouver was a breeze, I always considered Van
my 2nd home and more or less my home base when I comes to BC. I like how you can jump on a ferry
&amp; get to the Island fairly quickly. Both PA and Vic are 3 hrs from start to finish! There are
many opportunities as well; lots for Indigenous Youth, trades programs, technology programs such as
learning to code, as well as many more housing developments for Indigenous Peoples going up here in
Van",,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-11, 14:27: hello nice to meet you Peter, I am glad to say you are my mentor for this
course because we are both indigenous and have some stuff in common i would like to be getting
advice on how you made it through your years of learning so i could use it to get through mine. I
will be asking questions in the best of my ability. How was highschool when you were going? did you
evr have to redo a class?Mentor 2022-02-16, 11:27: Hi Thomas, how is Port these days? Vancouver has
been dry! lol How did I make it through school throughout the years? That is an interesting
question. I guess you can say through by doing the homework, doing extra research and seeking out
help from peers or a knowledgable person such as a teacher or tutor. Highschool was great, I went to
Vic High in Victoria and was fortunate to have other Indigenous classmates :). I did have to redo my
English, but thankfully my next English teacher was an amazing person. He helped me so much in
learning how to write and even proper English grammar skills.Mentee 2022-02-17, 15:47: thank you for
sharing those were some good answers that i needed to know. Ya port has been good there is lots of
opportunities for work and schooling but its pretty boring as usual. Having to go through my school
year ive been lucky a couple times having a good teacher but most arent as motivative to push there
students it feels like they want to see them fail and have there favourite student pass sometimes
they even bring there students down by saying there gonna fail instead of telling us how to make it
through the year.Mentor 2022-02-17, 16:32: School can be tough at times but the thing to remember
about that is to keep going. And seek out people around you that want to see you succeed, whether
that be peers or teachers/counsellors. What do you like doing in PA on your time off?Mentee

seek out for people that want you to succeed. On my free time in PA i usually hang out with my
homies and play basketball or go to this like program called nights alive to chill and they have a
theatre room also a pool table so its pretty chill.Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:22: thanks peter for the
heads up i really like your saying to seek out for people that want you to succeed. What i do on my

2022-02-24, 20:55: Hey Thomas, is there any topics you'd like to start or has your teacher given
direction, the topics can be found above our conversation, PeteMentee 2022-02-25, 16:10: yes i was
given the first topic is going to be ""From Rural to Urban"" So basically they are two diffrent
settlements, Rural a place with a smaller population and area which the Urbans size in population is
way bigger and the area is to with big building.Mentor 2022-03-01, 12:06: Good morning Thomas, do
you know where you want to move when the time comes? I've lived in many cities; Port Alberni,
Nanaimo, Victoria &amp; even Kamloops for a short time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definetly have quite a lot of advice to give as I am paying for my school on my own so feel free to
ask me any sorts of questions on this topic!Mentee 2022-04-13, 13:14: I only have 1 question, Ive
heard that housing is more expensive than tuition, food, books and everything. Is this true?Mentee
2022-04-13, 13:14: Mentor 2022-04-13, 21:03: Good question. It definetly depends on where you go to
school. In my case my housing is my most expensive cost because UBC's tuition is relatively cheaper
for citizen's of Canada. But I were to go to USA for school, I would pay international tuition fees
which are very expensive so then tuition would be more expensive than my housing costs. Are you
worried at all about finding sources of funding for school?I can help go over some of the different
resources available for education funding.Mentee 2022-04-19, 14:07: Funding is an Issue for me as I
do not come from a very high end family. I am an A student and tremendous athlete but the cost
allways worries me that I will waste my potential.Mentor 2022-04-20, 20:16: I totally understand and
I was in a similar situation when I was in highschool. Since you have good grades and are an
athlete, I would try to find scholarships. You can either try to get an athletic scholarship from
the school you want to go to, or apply to the many scholarships found online or within your
community. I applied to many scholarships online when I was in highschool. I use the funding I got
from those, along with Student Loans, and savings from part time jobs to fund my education. Student
loans are very helpful since you don't have to pay it back until you are finished school. So if I
were you, try to get as many awards and scholarships using your good grades and athletics to find
funding, and maybe look into student loans if needed. Some schools also offer financial aid
depending on where you go to. That information can probably be found on that specific university's
website.","Mentor 2022-03-02, 20:05: I have opened the Rural to Urban conversation. Just read and follow the
prompts. Let me know if you are confused about anything!Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:18: Three things you
like about living in a rural area Everything is central and close together, everybody knows
everyone, and the air is nice and clean. Two things you don’t like Some thing that I wish we had are
not here, such as a mall. I often have to travel out of town for reasons, like particular medical
specialists. One question you have about living or moving to the city What is the pricing of decent
housing in the city?Mentor 2022-03-03, 20:44: I quite envy the sense of community rural areas have.
It is kind of hard to make such connections in bigger cities. But it is true that malls, and
healthcare ae very accessible, so that is convinient. Its sort of depends on where are you in terms
of how expensive it is. I live in Vancouver, some parts are very expensive aroound $2000-$3000 just
for one bedroom a month. But if you live just outside Vancouver maybe 10 minute bus ride away, you
can get much for affordable $1000 apartments.Mentee 2022-03-04, 13:14: I will take the housing into
account when I plan to apply for university, this information has been so useful.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 23:45: Hello Tennison! I am Etienne and I am super excited to be your mentor for

am looking forward the talking with you and getting to know you! What do you like to do for fun? Do
you have any hobbies?I love to stay active by playing sports like tennis and basketball. Is there
anything in particular you want to let me know about yourself? Don’t hesitate to ask me any question
that you have!Mentee 2022-02-11, 12:15: Hello, this is so exciting. I am happy that you are my
mentor as I am also a student athlete who is well into the scienses. Hopefully I can go to UBC
someday to learn dentistry. Plus your rugby team is awesome, they came to coach my team for a day
and I learned alot. Cannot wait for this opportunity.Mentor 2022-02-12, 01:19: Wow! Thats is great
to hear. Dentistry is a very rewarding jouney. Good choice! UBC's rugby and athletics are very fun
to watch and great way to engage with the school. So cool that they came to coach your team. If you
have any questions about science or UBC feel free to ask! Do you have any questions on how this
program works, like the coversations, or extention activites, or anything before we get
started?Mentee 2022-02-15, 14:18: I am just curious about what pre-requisites would be helpful to
have before entering the medical field.Mentor 2022-02-16, 01:33: Good question. I am going to use
Dentistry as an example since you mentioned it, but it should apply to most medical careers. You are
going to need to finish highschool, and while in highschool you need to complete various high school
pre requisite courses such as Biology 12 or Chemistry 12 etc. These depends on which university you
plan to go to for undergrad and what they require for the program you want to get into( these pre
reqs can be found on their website). You will probably want to do a bachelor of science undergrad so
can you learn more about it and see how you like it. Once you are done 4 years in undergrad you will
apply for grad school for denistry or whatever you decide on and do that for 4 years....and thats
pretty much it. It is a long journey but very rewarding.Mentee 2022-02-16, 02:18: You're advice is
proving quite helpful, now it looks like I have to start saving money for 4 years on
university.Mentor 2022-02-16, 03:42: Glad I can help! I believeyour teacher is requiring that we
comeplete these 3 coversation topics: From Rural to Urban (plus extension activities), Entering the

would you like to start with? Feel the ask any questions even if not related to the coversation

was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city?
I feel the film was trying to sway that both ways of living are vastly different. What, if anything,
did you relate to in the images presented in the film? I related nothing at all. How did you feel
while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you?
I was annoyed by watching a 3 minute video that was just flashing images and weird sounds, the film
maker provoked theese feelings by making the video 3 cminutes long asnd a waste of my time. In what
ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about
possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? My emotional response is negative ,however
I would love to move to the city.Mentor 2022-03-10, 21:41: Those feelings are totally understandble

anchor text. I am looking forward to hearing about your thoughts and feelings about the prompts
listed above :)Mentee 2022-03-28, 13:17: three things i like about living in a rural area: there
arent that many people meaning less trafic and runins with people(?) with less people becuase its a
smaller town that i live in meaning i have more chances to form postitve bonds with the people in my
community the scenery of living in a rural area is also quite nice two things i dont like baout
living in a rural area: is there are a lot less employment do to the lack of demand and it tends to
be a tad bit upsetting but i tend to tell myself eventually ill get a job if i apply(hopefully) and
this is a bit more specific but the drug and alchol use can also be quite high in the place i live
in which is not always a good enviorment to be around one question i may have about living in a city
is how are the exspenses? and if there are more chances to education and such?Mentor 2022-03-29,
14:08: Hi Tara, Thank you so much for sharing! Your points are wonderful - it can be really
comforting living in a smaller community where the surroundings are not so overwhelming. I actually
grew up in a small town outside of the city, and it was so nice to recognize people instead of
constantly seeing new faces and having no sense of familiarity. Do you find that it is easy to get
around? For example, are there good public transit systems or busses that can get you where you need
to go?Mentor 2022-03-29, 14:12: I definitely understand how upsetting that can be. In the small town
I grew up in there were very few places to apply, and I got rejected from the ones that were hiring.
But I did eventually find a job that I loved, and that I am actually still working at now. You never
know when opportunities will pop up, so do not get discouraged! And in the city there are jobs
EVERYWHERE that span such a wide range of things!Mentor 2022-03-29, 14:19: I still live in a small
town, but I commute to school in the city. There are so many academic opportunities! There are
multiple universities, for example SFU and UBC, but there are also colleges and smaller programs
that some people find is a better fit for them. Whatever you want to study, there is always
something available for you. It is a bit expensive to attend post-secondary school, but there are
hundreds of scholarships you can apply for. For example the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) gives out
thousands of scholarships! Are you thinking of attending school after highschool? Or maybe
working?Mentee 2022-03-31, 13:52: hello i missed the past 2 days of school so i am replying now(:
where i live yes the public transit is really good and all the bus drivers are really nice. and
thank you for your advice ill keep my head up while continuing to look for a job. after highschool i
was thinking about working for a bit before applying for any sort of post sceondary education right
away because i would like to save up a bit of money to do so. so hopefully that seems like a good
idea but i will also cosnider scholarships(:Mentor 2022-04-02, 21:11: hi Tara! No problem you have
been so wonderful with your responses! That is great that the transit is reliable where you live. It
is very easy in the city as well, there are always tons of buses and skytrain stations that go
everywhere. And I think that that is a wonderful plan! Work is also great to gain some experience
and find out the kinds of things you enjoy doing in a professional setting. It is also just as
valuable for figuring out what you do not like! That will also help you make decisions about what
area of study you would like to go into if you would like to attend college or university!Mentor
2022-04-02, 21:13: Is there one thing in particular about city-life that you are excited about? Or
one thing that you are maybe a bit worried about, or are hesitant about? For example I really enjoy
the energy of the city, it is always very exciting and there is always something to do. But I do not
enjoy the expenses, and sometimes the amount of people can be a little bit overwhelmingMentor

excited about in the city is the oppertunitys and ivelihood of a city seems like a wonderful
experience. some things that i tend to worry about are the exspenses such as food or rent seem to be
quite costly in a more city like area. and i hope you had a wonderful weekend too((:Mentor
2022-04-08, 00:18: Hi Tara! Thank you so much for your response :) I definitely agree that there are
many opportunities in the city, and expenses are something that definitely need to be planned for.

while watching this short documentary clip. So I think it was very moving, even without the need for
words or dialogue. It showed a very clear contrast between the beginning scenes in the country and
the end scenes in the city. In the country everything was outdoors and there were animals roaming
around, and children were playing with games that they made themselves, and the individuals seemed
very in-tune with nature. In the city, there were buildings and busy traffic, even the clothes
people were wearing were so different! For me it was a little bit overwhelming to watch, and it
really made me think about these differences of lifestyles. I would love to hear what you think
about the questions listed above, especially how you found you related to certain aspects of this
video. What point do you think the director was trying to make about life in the country vs the
city? I hope you had a great weekend and I am so excited to hear from you soon! :))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

be awaiting your reply! -JongMentee 2022-02-17, 15:45: Hey Jong this is Spencer reporting to you
today. Yipee! Today I will be talking about why I like and dont like living in a rural area. There
are several things I like about living in rural area but the main one is the community. In a rural
city the community is smaller so it is eisier to know people and know who is who and this makes a
lot of good connections. The connections you make from a community like this makes it eisier to get
jobs and to make friends. A problem with the community being small is that if you mess up it gets
around and you might have a bad reputation making everything in life harder. Efficiency is another
good thing about a rural area. In a urban city there is tons of traffic and is super busy while in a
rural city it takes me a 30 minute walk to get anywhere in town. This is a huge upside about a rural
city. The last upside about a rural city is that it doesnt cost a million dollars to live here.
Housing in rural citys are normaly a lot cheaper then in a urban city and that is a turn off when
trying to move to a larger city. Overall those are my 3 upsides about living in a rural city. What
do you think about them and do you have any other reasons why you would like to live in a rural
city? Sincerely, Spencer MeikleMentor 2022-02-20, 17:50: The reasons you gave all sound like great
upsides to living in a rural area. I really understand the benefit of having small, tight
communities in rural areas. Communities definitely vary from location to the type of people the
community is built up by, and personally, I find it difficult to imagine thriving communities in
urban areas. However, it is possible! Could you think of any examples? Also, are there any other
downsides to living in rural areas? The pricing and commute are also important factors to consider
when considering adjustments to the city. I hear about a lot of friends moving from rural areas that
really hate all that city noise! But also some love it as well. As for me, I think as time has
passed I enjoy the silence and peace of rural areas a lot more now. I used to think I was a
full-blooded city kid, but I realize I really like the outdoors, and I usually get my fill going
tree planting during my summers where we live in tents deep into the wilderness. But, the city is
also a kind of forest and environment all on its own, each unique, bustling with its own people and
neighbourhoods. After living in Vancouver for the past 6 years, I can call it my home in the sense
that I've explored and remember a lot of its parts.Mentor 2022-02-20, 17:52: Also, two more
questions: Is there anything you are curious about in terms of moving to the city and what that
might be like? Do you see yourself moving into a city in the future?Mentor 2022-02-20, 17:53: And no
need to answer all the questions, just the ones you are most keen on answering!Mentee 2022-02-22,
17:42: Hey Jong hope your doing well. It is only 2 more days until thursday! Hope youre as excited
as I am! I dont have many question about moving into a urban city because ive lived in winnipeg for
a few years and know what it is like living their. On the other hand i havent thought about moving
to a Urban city but i would probaly try to stay in a Rural areajust because i like the smaller
community. We will see when i grow up. Sorry for the short message. Sincerely,SpencerMentor
2022-02-24, 04:45: I'm glad to hear you have a good community around you, I think it's a powerful
reason to stay in a region. It's also difficult to imagine where we might live in the future since
there are so many things to consider: what we want to study and explore, what life styles we become
interested by, etc.. I would just keep in mind that our possibilities are vast, and they become more
vast the more we become aware of them. If you come to any questions and comments, feel free.
Otherwise, I think we can move onto part two of the module! I'll get back to you in the next few
days with comments on the video we will both watch.Mentee 2022-02-24, 18:01: Hey Jong hope you had a
terrific thursday! Thanky you for letting me know that I can ask you about moving. Ill watch the
video and get back to you next week. Thank you, Spencer",,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-11, 14:04: Hello, my name is Spencer Meikle and you're probably wondering how i got
into this situation. Well it's simple i passed all my classes in grade 9 and somehow ended up in
this class, and then I got matched with you. Hooooray!!!! I've lived in 4 cities/town and moved to
BC 5 years ago from Flin Flon MB. I dont know what i want to be when i grow up but taking Creative
Writing seems fun.. What do you want to be after college since you majored in 2 English classes? I
hope to hear from you soon and have a fun time talking to you! (I have CLE once every 2 days so it
might take awhile for me to respond) Thank you Spencer MeikleMentor 2022-02-11, 15:59: Hi Spencer!
I'm Jong (Jaw-ng), and thanks for the nice message. Wow, that's a lot of moves, and a far move from
Flin Flon, Manitoba. And congrats on making your way through grade 9! These are all big
accomplishments and they should be celebrated! I noticed you've played sports for a long time and
you are curious what directions you could take. I have several friends who do kinesiology
(sports-medicine type thing) and/or play college sports (football, soccer) so I could answer any
questions you might have about these. But really, the paths anyone can take is endless so no
pressure! As for me, to be honest I am not very sure! What I do know is that I love creative writing
to my core, and do not see myself stop writing any time soon. It is a highly rewarding field, and I
recommend everyone to experience it at least once. There are options I keep thinking on, taking a
masters in either creative writing or English to continue my education, there is also a high demand
for proficient English Majors for their writing and critical thinking skills in a variety of fields
(marketing, technical writing, publishing industry, free-lance writing, nearly all industries need
writers). Sorry for this looooong message, but feel free to ask any questions, I love answering them
and hopefully I can make it shorter next time! As for now, I'll just get you to read and watch the
text/video above, starting with ""start here"". Let me know when you're finished, and we'll move
on!Mentee 2022-02-15, 16:29: Hey Jong sorry for taking awhile to respond I watched the start here
and it helped me find out a bit more about this program. Sorry about not saying much about myself
just went off the top of my head and havent put much thought into it.. I saw you've mentored 2 other
kids how did those experiances go? I think mentoring would take a lot of work to do and sustain a
conversation throught a course and am wondering how that experiance is. Sorry about the short
message and hope you have a good day! -Spencer",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-01, 01:13: Hey Spencer! Hope you're having a good day, especially with everything
that's going on in the world. I thought this was a really powerful video. I loved the music and
rhythm of the Indigenous people's traditions and their rural lifestyles. When the scene changed to
the city and its environment and growth, I felt that something had changed drastically, and also
stayed the same. The city is also an environment, but holds drastically different values and
lifestyles from the rural. I actually found the artist's website and one quote describes how the
video is about ""the perpetual negotiation between the modern and traditional by a people always
moving forward."" (https://carolinemonnet.ca/Mobilize) I love this idea of ""perpetual negotiation"",
it sounds to me like 'constant discussion and consideration'. I'm reminded that my relationship to
nature and the city are always changing with one another. When I first moved to Vancouver for Uni, I
loved the city, the noise, the ""endless"" potential, even the pollution! I see now how important it
is to have perspective of nature and rural areas, and I'm grateful to have grown up in a wide
variety of environments. But both are important, after all, they both exist and are a part of the
world we live in! Take a look at some of the questions above. How did the film make YOU feel? What
did you notice about the filmmaker's choices? Are there any circumstances (education, work) that
might lead you to the city?Mentee 2022-03-01, 18:09: I watched the video and found it intreguing. I
think the derector was saying that living in natur is a lot more fun and has less responcibilities
then living in the city. I liked how they used the music to further the video and make it better and
they did that perfectly. The beat and everything made you feel more passionate about what they were
showing. Overall the video was really good and the creators did a fantastic job and made me feel
passionate about the subjet. I have like 2 minutes to pack up here so sorry about the short message
and might finish this at home. Thank you SpencerMentor 2022-03-02, 04:27: Great message Spencer, I
agree that the music further's the video and makes us feel more passionate about it. Do you feel
there is anything you didn't like or confused you about the video?Mentor 2022-03-03, 03:34: After
answering my question, I think it'll be alright for you to move onto the extension activities. I
think you have to do them on your own, but if you need extra support I gotchu!Mentor 2022-03-07,
18:31: Helloo! Hows it going? Have you been playing any sports lately? My intramurals basketball
team is going to playoffs and I AM HYPED. Haha, one of my friends wrote a bunch of swears in an
essay I wrote in my first year (they were bad). We had to DISCUSS it in class and it was mortifying.
I took another look at your earlier message and you had a really interesting thought that the
director was saying people living in nature have more fun and have less responsibilities than living
in the city. I wondered about this and wanted you to think a bit more about what it is like living
in nature and in rural areas. Like, the people in the video were weaving their own snow-shoes,
carving their own canoes and taking them into lakes and down dangerous streams! What types of things
do you think you do (or your family/friends) where you live that you might not in the city?Mentee
2022-03-09, 17:07: Hey Jong sorry about the late responce.. Ive been playing a bit of hockey and the
biggest basketball event in my school is comming up tomorow so i am definatly going to watch some of
those games. some things which are different that we do right now in a rural area is walking our
dogs. In a rural area walking our dogs in nature is natural but in an urban enviorment it would be
city walks which are different and weird. Living in an urban enviorment would be different, not
better not worse. What would you end up changing if you changed your living enviorment?Mentor
2022-03-11, 01:40: That's so true! Dogs, especially certain kinds of dogs fit well into nature and
large areas to roam, run around, and explore. I like how you phrase living in an urban environment
as different, it can be too strong of an answer to stray to far into one direction, we often have to
find an answer in the middle! Hmm.. Great question. I used to live somewhere with a large park
nearby that I would always visit, and I've been really missing that lately. I still go for walks now
and then, as well as in the city portions or near the beach, but it's difficult to find a place that
felt as silent, as tranquil as that park did. I think it's difficult to find (and create for
ourselves) a place that's healthy and calming, rather than merely distracting or a way to drown out
our problems. But I guess there's other ways to do that as well! Thanks for the kind message
Spencer, and wish you luck on the extension assignments.Mentor 2022-03-16, 02:36: Hey Spencer, I
know you're on your break now so just wanted to tell you to relax and get a real break from things!

went to kewlowna in the summer for softball provincials i loved it there, Is it a nice place to
live?is it very exspensive? i was thinking of going there when im older.Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:33:
three things i like about living in a rural area is its quiet, the houses are spaced out, theres
more nature outdoor places to go forests, trails, lakes, moutains etc. 2 things i dont like is that
its farther away from town like stores, its along walking distance the other thing is its usally
farther from friends cause not alot of people live in your neighborhood cause everyone is so far. is
it exspensive living in the city, is the traffci bad, does it take longer to get to one place to the
other or to drive to the grocery store. does it get anoying on how busy it isMentor 2022-03-09,
13:51: Hi Shayla, Of course, take your time with your assignment, I really look forward to hearing
what you have to say. Kelowna is quite big and expensive but it is full of life and different
experiences. I like that the lake is right by and you can go to different restaurants. People here
are very friendly and the University here is quite fancy. When I came here I was so shocked because
the other university I studied at is quite small and isolated. UBCO is like a whole mini town! You
say you love Softball, is that your favourite sport or do you enjoy other sports? I Love watching
NHL hockey. I can't play it at all but I am a super fan. I love the Vancouver Canucks and the
Toronto Maple Leafs. :) Have a Great Day and hope to hear from you soon! -IsabelaMentee 2022-04-13,

20:33: Hi there Shayla! I have unlocked the rural activity for you so hopefully, you can start
working on it. If it isn't unlocked or if you need some help, please let me know. :) I am excited to
work with you. I was looking at the ice breaker activity on getting to know each other and I found
this photo and I thought I'd share it with you. I have recently moved to Kelowna for schooling to
become a High school teacher. I moved from a smaller city on my own. I find the lakes that surround
me here are so beautiful. I love water and swimming so living here is a positive. I find walks by
the lakefront very enjoyable and a peaceful way to destress after a long day. I also love animals so
seeing all the cute puppies that walk by always make my heart melt. I love how peaceful it is and
how pretty the color of the lake is. It's sometimes a greeny aqua color or a deep blue color. I like
seeing all the boats parked there and how clear I can think when nature is involved. Do you have a
special place or somewhere in nature that you find beautiful and freeing? I look forward to hearing
about your special place. Have an awesome day. :)

we can start taking a look at the materials and discuss. I'm also curious to hear more about what
makes you most interested in rural areas. I'm looking forward to seeing your responses to the
conversation prompts! -VanessaMentor 2022-03-07, 19:24: Hi Sarah, I hope you're doing well! I heard
your class has gone back to being primarily in-person and that you may not have as much time for
this mentorship program anymore. I wanted to check in and see if you had any time to read through
the materials or had any questions for me? Hopefully this semster is treating you well!
-VanessaMentee 2022-03-09, 17:03: Three things I like about living in a rural area are: It's a much
more secluded community making it more close knit. Cities have too many sirens and traffic,
including foot traffic and there are people everywhere. I like to be able to find spots that no one
has ever been before, and I have all to myself, and be able to sit in silence without the buzz of
the city. Two things I don't really enjoy are: The lack of activities and things to do, and
sometimes it can become very repetative. One question I would ask is do you ever get overwhelmed? I
feel like i would have a hard time navigating myself through the city and have a bit of a sensory
overload when there is too much noise around me.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 11:10: Hello Sarah, My name is Vanessa and I will be your e-mentor. I am 24 years
old and I am in a Master's of Science program at UBC. I completed my undergraduate studies in
Biology and now I am studying Experimental Medicine. I'm curious to know where in Europe you
have/would like to visit. I went and travelled part of Europe a couple of years ago and fell in love
with the beauty and culture. I'd also like to hear more about this 'immaculate' music taste. What
genre do you listen to most? Personally, I listen to a lot of electronic music and if I had to pick
a favourite artist it would be ODESZA. Looking forward to hearing back from you!Mentee 2022-02-11,
14:15: Hey Vanessa, how are you? When I go to Europe my first stop will be Italy. It is such a
gorgeos place and I obviosly love the food. After I spend some time there I will go to Switzerland,
France, Greese, and Spain. Where did you visit during your travels? As for my music taste, I listen
to almost everything. I checked the artist you mentioned, its not bad. Personally I am more into
hippie/indie/soft rock, although my taste is kind of all over the place. How is Experimental
Medicine treating you? Can't wait to hear from you! Thanks, Sarah.Mentor 2022-02-14, 11:18: I'm
doing well, thanks! How are you? Those are all great places to visit! I've been to the Netherlands,
Germany, the Czech Republic, Belgium, France, Spain, and Greece. I haven't been to Italy yet, but
it's definitley on the list. I would highly reccomend adding Prague, Czech Republic to your list. It
was my absolute favourite place from my travels so far. Those are some good genres, do you have a
current favourite song/artist? So far, Experimental Medicine has been good. I am learning a lot and
really enjoying what I am doing. How has thsi semester been for you so far? What classes are you
in?Mentee 2022-02-15, 16:41: I'm good! your travels sound amazing and like quite the adventure! I
would love to visit prague, from what I can tell its beautiful. I would have say that my favorite
artist at the moment would be Mac DeMarco but i have been listening to a lot of adele recently. She
is my mom and I's favourite to listen to in the car. I am glad school is going well. My semester has
been pretty good compared to the last. I have english and science which are some of my favourites. I
am great at science and my teacher is really nice. My last semester wasn't the best because I was
stuck in math and social studies... my least favourites ever. Not to mention my teachers did not
know how to teach. Im happy to hear your doing well, have a nice day! SarahMentor 2022-02-17, 19:35:
There is nothing worse than a bad teacher! I have had plenty of experiences like that and it's never
good. But I'm happy that this semester is off to a good start for you. If I recall correctly, there
were 3 conversation topics that your teacher has required us to complete. Do you have a preference
of which one we start with?Mentee 2022-02-24, 16:53: I guess we start with ""from rural to urban"" if
thats okay. I am more interested in rural areas but my teacher said thats a good one to start on.",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-13, 17:27: I definitely get what you mean about the city being very busy ad loud. It
can be overwhelming at times but that's why it's important to develop pratices and habbits to help
you find some alone time to decompress. It's not hard to find places to go for a walk and be alone
with your thoughts, or personally, I enjoy the quite in the library and sometimes I go there when I
am not studying to decompress and enjoy the silence. Fitting in a little bit (or a lot) of time like
this each day helps to keep me from being overwhelmed. How are you finding the materials for this
topic? Was there anything you were surprised to learn? When you're ready, I'll open the extension
activities.Mentee 2022-03-28, 17:11: I was not surprised when learning about rural and urban areas
as I have lived in both. Going to the library seems like a good idea for some peace and quiet. I am
not exactly sure where to start with the extension activities, the instructions say to add my
response into my portfolio. Is it mandetory?Mentor 2022-03-29, 15:27: I think you shouuld double
check with your teacher about what is mandatory/expected for you to complete. I know that different
classes have different processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and you've made a good recovery! I've opened the ""Entering the Job Market Conversation""! Here we
will be talking about transferable skills that will help you get a job as well as ones that will
benefit you while working! First step is to read this article: Resumé Skills for High School
Students with Examples By Alison Doyle from The Balance Careers, published May 15, 2019 linked
above! Once you are done reading the article, we are going to talk about your experiences in the
skill areas of: -communication -responsibility or dependability -quick learner -team work -tecnology
If you can think of any specific examples for each area from in or outside of school, write a few
sentences about it! If not, I can help you think of some. I can give you an example from my own
experience! Communication: Last year I started a job at a private tennis club as a server. It was my
first time working at a private club and I was very nervous as I was the youngest one of my
co-workers. Whenever I was unsure about something, I made sure to ask one of my co-workers for help
and always communicated to others about the tasks I was completing. I asked tons of questions and
was sometimes worried I was aking too many. However, one day I was standing with two of my
co-workers and they said ""we think you're the best new employee we've had in a long time!"" It was a
very nice compliment to receive and I know that part of the reason I received it was because of my
communication skills!Mentee 2022-04-12, 14:16: communication: well back when i was 13, my sister had
hired me to be her regular babysitter (for her kids 5 and 7) for the summer. paying by the hour. at
first i didnt really think that it was too much of a job. just being there for them when their
parents were out working. and throughout the summer i did do really well with taking proper care of
them, feeding and cleaning up after them and making sure they were safe at all times. but i was
unaware of how important communication really is. i always just felt that checking in every hour or
so was enough. but one learning experience changed my perspective and understanding forever. one
afternoon my sister had asked me to watch them from 4pm until 11pm. therefore they set up a dinner
plan for an easy meal for me to make the kids. well when i got there we hung out for awhile and then
around just over an hour later they were ready for dinner. they ate it all up and even said they
want MORE! i knew that both them have an allergy to dairy and one has an allergy to wheat. i was
always skeptical about them having other allergies but got over the wonder because it was never ever
mentioned about any other allergies. so i ended up making them some extra sandwhiches. well one of
them started reaction to the peanut butter that i had put in the sandwhiches. it wasnt a very
serious reaction but it was hives and stuff. i found benedryl that was in the cupboard and gave it
to her. called their parents and told them about it. i think that overall there were some
communication issues on both parts. but luckily enough, her allergy to peanuts is very very mild. i
think that even though its a mild allergy they could have told me about it. and/or becase i was
skeptical that they had other allergies i could have just asked them to make sure.Mentor 2022-04-14,
17:54: Hi Robyn! Wow that is a great example for communication! How about example for the other
transferable skills: responsibility, quick learner, team work, and technology? You can just write a
sentence or two for each! I can give you some examples! responsisbility: showing up for my job on
time everyday! quick learner: learning the different terms and lingo for every new job I take on.
team work: I currently work at a clothing store and have to communicate with my co-workers for each
customer to make sure that they have a good shopping experience! We are always sure to help
eachother out with tasks and customers if we notice that someone is busy. technology: when I worked
at a golf course a few years ago, I made multiple spreadsheets and charts to help with organization
in the clubhouseMentor 2022-04-14, 17:55: Once you've come up with some examples we can move onto
the next part of the conversation! :)Mentor 2022-04-20, 19:08: Hi Robyn! Jus checking in! Let me
know if you need any help answering the question!",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 17:16: Hi Robyn! How are you doing? My name is Raquel and I will be your mentor
for this program! I am 21 years old and I am in my fourth year at the University of British Columbia
studying psychology and English literature! I am originally from a small town of about 2600 people
and came to Vancouver following graduation! I enjoy photography, hiking, snowboarding, and hanging
out with friends! I am very excited to get to know you, and would love to know what your hobbies
are, what your favorite class is and what you’re interested in as a career! Please feel free to ask
me any questions and I will try my best to answer them.Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:41: hi raquel. i am
doing okay. right now, i dont have many hobbies. before, i used to enjoy hiking, swimming, little
road trips and travel, as well as playing basketball and video games. i guess i've gotten kind of
lazy the past few months. i like staying home more. but my birthday was last week and i got my
learners and i've been really enjoying getting out and learning to drive! before, i was really
looking forward to being a speech therapist when i grew up. but after a psychology course i took, i
started looking into being a psychologist and it looks so fun and seems more fitting for me!Mentor
2022-02-28, 13:31: Hi Robyn! Happy belated birthday and congratualations on getting your Learner's!
I remember when I got mine and it was very exciting learning to drive! Those are all great hobbies!
I love road trips! I once did a road trip from San Diego to South Dakota and it was so cool! What is
your favourite road trip memory? Sometimes it can be hard to get out and do things, I know I have so
many days when I would rather stay home and watch movies instead of going out, but I am always so
happy when I do go out instead of staying home! That's amazing! I am a psychology major and I love
it! There are so many interesting post secondary courses you can take in psychology! If you ever
have any questions related to psychology feel free to ask me anytime!Mentor 2022-02-28, 13:35: Also
whenever you're ready, let me know what Conversation you'd like to work on first and we can begin
the program! :)Mentee 2022-02-28, 14:18: hi raquel. thank you! i remember when my family and i drove
to Disneyland. i was really little. like maybe 7 years old. it took us 43 hours to non-stop drive
there. i really valued all that time i was spending with my family. i'm really looking into becoming
some sort of psychologist. i really struggle with my attendance in my classes but every psychology
course i've taken, i've just really grown a love for it. what made you want to study
psychology?Mentor 2022-02-28, 17:41: Wow what a great memory, that sounds so fun! That's great that
you value that time you were able to spend with your family! I'm 22 now and I don't get to see my
family too often because I'm away at school, so I really treasure all of the memories I have with
them from when I was younger! It's great that you've found a love for psychology! I know it can be
hard to want to attend all of your classes some days, but in the end attending them saves you so
much time and alleviates so much stress, I promise! I took an AP Psychology course in grade 12 and I
really enjoyed it! I found the material really interesting and it made studying so much easier! When
I came to UBC I took another first year psychology course and still found it so interesting! My
original major was economics but I found that I loved psychology so much more so I ended up
switching. I learn so much everyday in my psychology classes about human behaviour and the human

hi i'd like to start the agency in the world conversation","Mentor 2022-03-06, 23:22: Hi Robyn! I've opened the agency in the world conversation!Mentor
2022-03-08, 15:28: For our disscussion of the Agency in the World conversation, maybe we can first
consider the question, ""What are your experiences with feeling like an outcast?"" I can tell you
about some of my experiences first! In grade 10, I moved schools. I moved from my hometown
highschool of 300 people to a new school on Vancouver Island that was about 600 people. I didn't
know anyone and it was very different from my previous school, I was from a very small town while
most people I met were from much larger towns with much better school systems. I felt like I was
very naive and didn't know much and didn't feel very confident in my academic abilities. I was also
very shy and much less outgoing than many of the other girls I met. It was difficult at first, but I
pushed myself out of my comfort zone to be more outgoing and make an effort to talk to different
people more often and it helped me make new friends and feel more confident! Do you have any
experiences with feeling like an outcast? If not, maybe we can think about what is the relationship
between ""grit"" and ""agency""?Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:20: wow! that is a great story. i kind of had a
similar one to that. back when i was in 8th grade. i had just gotten to the highschool and the
school i went to before was small and had a very little amount of students. so getting to the
highschool with 1.2k students was very different as well as difficult for me. for the first semester
i was super quiet and only had a couple close friends; and when it came to having partners in class
or doing group projects, i didn't really have anyone to choose. i always felt down about how i seen
that everybody was always out having fun with their friends after school and on the weekends and i
was at home most of the time. near the end of the semester, i had a talk with my older sister who
had already graduated high school. i told her that i wanted to try put myself out there but i was
afraid that i would be rejected or they wouldn't like me. she told me that i'm only really in
highschool once and that this is the best, and basically easiest time of my life. she said to just
put myself out there, get out of my comfort zone, and whoever doesn't like me, for me, just forget
about them and i will find the right people who DO. by the end of grade 8, i found many friends to
have fun with and make me happy.Mentor 2022-03-11, 15:50: Hi Robyn, Wow good for you! That is
something a lot of people struggle with even into university, so that's awesome you've already
realized that the important people who are kind and will make good friends and companions are the
ones that will make you feel happy and comfortable! Great advice from your sister too! She is right,
highschool is supposed to be fun and it is definitely one of the easiest times in your life, so it
is important to try and enjoy it! :) Your story reminds me of one of my favourite quotes from Dr.
Seuss, “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who
matter don't mind.” Maybe we can discuss the video a little! In the video, the speaker refers to do
people who have demonstrated great ""grit"" and ""agency"" and as a result achieved great things and
their goals! What are some of the skills you already have that can help you move towards your goals?
For me, I am really good at not letting the little things get me down. For example, if I get a bad
mark on a test or assignment I try not to dwell on the bad grade but instead focus on what I can do
next time to get a better grade! In other words, I let it motivate me to do better!Mentor
2022-04-05, 01:47: Hi Robyn! Just wanted to check in and see how you are doing! I hope you had a
good spring break full of fun! I was thinking maybe we can move onto one of the required
conversations for your class next! I believe they are: From Rural to Urban (plus extension
activities), Entering the job market (plus extension activities), and Paying for school (plus
extension activities).Mentee 2022-04-05, 13:23: Hi Raquel. sorry i haven't gotten to replying. i

mentioned that you might not want to move across the country after high school. Please take a look
at the Anchor Text above and let me know what your answers are to the included prompts! Looking
forward to chatting some more :) MichelineMentor 2022-02-24, 15:54: Hey Rees! I wanted to check-in
and see if you've had a chance to read my messages or look over the 'From Rural to Urban' anchor
text yet! Hope everything is going well :) MichelineMentee 2022-02-25, 16:07: Hey! Sorry I wasnt
able to reply I have been super busy this week and have not had time to check my email. - I like
living in a rurual area because there isnt a ton of people and its not super crowded. There is
barley any traffic or anything like that here and I really enjoy not having to wait in traffic
forever just to get to a destination that is like 15 minutes away becuase I can get very impatient.
I also like living in not such a big city becuase Covid doesnt get as bad there, wheres in a big
city like Vancouver or Toronto it would be much worse, its much easier to avoid getting covid in a
smaller town. My last reason is becuase if the town is small enough like Port Alberni for example,
everyone in our age group sort of knows everyone. Its easier to meet new people that way. -
Something I dont like is that if someone spreads a rumour about someone or there is drama within a
friend group then EVERYONE will know. Especially with there only being one high school in my town,
once one thing is said about someone or something everyone will eventually hear about it. My second
reason is that there is nothing to do. The only places to shop here are Walmart and one clothing
store that is way to expensive, and the only city to shop in is Nanaimo which is an hour ish away. -
A question I have about moving is, was it hard to meet new people? One thing I am worried about is
moving across the country, or even just to another part of my province is that I wont meet anyone. I
have lived in Port Alberni since 2018-2019 ish and I only made friends earlier this school year is
September. Another question I have is was it scary? I have this fear of moving on my own and not
being able to afford it, especially while being a univeristy student. Also, was it a huge change
once you moved to a huge city from such a small town?Mentor 2022-02-28, 13:14: No worries at all!
Hope things have settled down a bit for you :) Those are such fair points. Big cities can definitely
be crowded and oh the traffic... hard to get used to something like that. But there are ways around
that! To answer your question about meeting new people - good news, it was really really easy. The
nice thing about starting an undergraduate program is that everyone else is in the exact same boat
as you are; everyone is starting a new program, nobody knows each other, many students would be new
to the city, and most importantly, everyone has the same thought about whether they will meet new
people and make friends. Luckily, most post-secondary institutions make it easy to meet new people.
They might hold events where you go just to meet friends. They may have optional activities where
you can meet new people and find friends that you have things in common with. If you decide to live
at the school (ex. in a dorm), then you will make a lot of friends there too. In my opinion, it
would be much harder to make friends coming into a high-school midway because the students there
would already know each and already have made their friends. But with a post-secondary institution,
everyone is looking to meet new people and so it is very easy to make friends! I moved to Montreal
from BC and yes, it was scary sometimes before I went. But more than anything, I was really excited.
I was worried about being away from my family for the first time but that went away once I arrived
and got settled in. It is definitely an adjustment but it's such a great learning experience. There
is always a lot of support at schools for anything you're feeling as well. The financial aspect is
another factor to consider, but again, there are many support systems out there for that and we can
talk about that in a later topic (""Paying for School"") if you'd like. I hope this helps. I feel like
I could go on forever about feelings of moving away but I'm trying to keep it somewhat brief! Do you
have any other questions before we move on to Part 2? Talk soon :) MichelineMentee 2022-02-28,
17:45: Hello! That makes me feel a lot better about meeting people, thats the part I was most
worried about to be honest. And I don't think I have anymore questions before moving on, Thank you
so much, Rees.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 00:23: Hey Rees! How's it going? My name's Micheline and I'm excited to be your
mentor this year! Your profile says you're interested in medicine - that's awesome, I'm in my second
year of medical school at UBC and it's been really great. This sounds like an ideal mentor/mentee
match! How's school going? What classes are you taking? Looking forward to getting to know you and
work with you. Please let me know if you have any questions, always happy to answer them :)
MichelineMentee 2022-02-11, 14:27: Hello School has been fine, very tiring though especially with
our three and a half hour classes. Right now Iam taking English 11, Science 10, CLE 10, Concert/
Jazz/ R&amp;B band. Next year in grade 11 I am taking Anatomy and Physiology 12 and i am very
excited. What are you going to med school to be and what are u learning about right now? I am
planning to start off my carrer with being a health care assistent. In grade 12 I am taking a health
care assistant certificate corse an NIC, and in the summer i am taking a few first aid corses. What
other things are you interested in and what are some of your hobbies? Thanks, Rees.Mentor
2022-02-13, 13:18: Wow, three and a half hour classes would be a lot! Anatomy &amp; Physiology 12
will be a great course seeing as you're interested in the human body. I did my undergraduate degree
at McGill in Physiology because I also love the human body and how all the systems work together.
Right now in medical school, we are learning about the health of newborn babies! When I become a
doctor, I would like to be an anesthesiologist - I like how you can get to know patients before
their surgery, help them feel at ease, and monitor them during the surgical procedure. Who knows,
maybe one day we will be working together in the operating room! Outside of school, I love playing
sports and I also like to play the piano and read. Do you know much about the steps you have to take
before getting into medicine? Have you thought much about where and when you would want to complete
your undergraduate degree? You're still young, so there's no pressure or rush, but I'm happy to
answer any questions you have about undergrad programs too :) Talk soon! MichelineMentee 2022-02-15,
17:12: An anastesiologist would be cool! What kind of sports do you play? I do gymnastics. And what
kind of books do you read? My favourite is harry potter and right now I am reading a book called ""
When breath becomes air "" by Paul Kalanithi, it is very good so far and I highly reccomend it if you
have not read it already. No, I do not know the steps i have to take before actually getting into
medicine, which i should probably know lol. I was not really sure what an undergraduate dagree was
so i had to ask my teacher, but I was thinking about completing it at The University Of Toronto, but
most likely UBC because I most likely wont want to move across the country right after high school.
Though I am not a huge fan of Vanvouver because it is super expensive. Do you have any
reccomendations for schools or undergrad programs? Thank you, Rees!Mentor 2022-02-17, 16:18: Hey
Rees! My favourite sports are ice hockey and biking. I watched the Women's Olympic gold medal hockey
game last night and am so happy Canada won! ""When Breath Becomes Air"" is a really great book! I read
it a few years ago. I definitely did not know anything about undergraduate degrees or getting into
medicine when I was in grade 10. But the good news is, this is exactly why we are doing this
mentoring program! I have lots of information and advice that I can share with you about
undergraduate degrees throughout our mentoring match-up. Luckily, there is no rush and we have lots
of time to talk about this. I think now is a great time for us to start with the 'Conversation'
assignments that we are to do. Why don't we start with ""From Rural to Urban""? You should be able to
click on the ""From Rural to Urban"" title on the navigation wheel above to go to that page. I'll
leave another message there :) Micheline",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-03, 01:26: Wow! That was an interesting documentary video. It really put into
perspective the difference between living in a rural area and a big urban center. It made me feel a
bit overwhelmed at first when I saw how many different things are going on in an urban center.
Though I guess there is some good in that too! There would be many opportunities that would be
unique to an urban center. I also did like the theme in the video of making things on your own in a
small town. My question to you is: what do you think the director of the film was trying to
communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city?
MichelineMentee 2022-03-07, 17:35: Hello, sorry I havent answered again I have been super busy this
week aswell. At my school there is a festival called Totem happening this week and I have been
preparing for that. I also got the opprotunity to go to this event called "" Mini med school "" and I
am very excited! What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the
relationship between living in the country and living in a city? - I think the directer was trying
to say that living in the country, like in the video. You have to be a lot more independant when it
comes to building things, food, saftey ect. And that you have to be a lot more mindful of your
surrounding in a rural area when it comes to wild life and things like that, I dont think that life
style if for the faint of heart. Wheres in an urban area, things can be a lot more stressful
especially with lots of people around you and so many options of things to do. What, if anything,
did you relate to in the images presented in the film? -In the film, when they showed the part of
the women in the big city, she looked a bit worried or confused. That is relatable becuase, when I
go to big cities or places with lots of people I also get stressed out in those situations. How did
you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those
feelings in you? - Iam not going to lie, the video was a little scary once they added the music. It
was really intense and it was hard to focus on what was going on in the video becuase I was so
focused on the music. In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match -
how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? - I still want
to move to a city for school after I graduate. The video didnt really effect my answer.Mentor
2022-03-10, 12:58: Hey Rees! Before I start, I wanted to ask about ""mini med-school""! What's that?
Sounds cool! Thanks for your answers. I agree with them all, especially how it's easy to get
stressed when you're in a big city with a lot of people around and where there seems to be so much
going on at once. But don't worry, there are cities in Canada with great post-secondary schools that
aren't THAT crazy and busy! There's also a large spectrum of ""urban areas"" where you could go to
school. For instance, the University of Toronto would be pretty busy compared to somewhere like UBC
Okanagan (in Kelowna) or the University of Victoria. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being Port Alberni and 10
being Toronto, what would your ideal level of ""busy"" be for a city to go to school in? Or do you not
mind? Feel free to start the two extension activities when you have a chance. I especially like the
theme of the ""Easing Traditions"" activity as it will make you reflect on what city you would be
interested in going to for school. I'm happy to talk through that part with you as it's a big
question and really important to start thinking about. Talk to you soon! Micheline",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-28, 17:24: Hello. I do not know to much about the mini med school thing, but on the
flyer it says they talk about the newst medical research which I am very excited about. I think that
once I graduate high school, going to a school and moving to a more populated city wouldnt be an
issue. I actually would really like do go to a big school, I think that would be kind of fun. The
only thing that would stop me is covid. But on a scale from 1-10, probably like an 8. The smallest I
would go to is probably somewhere like UVIC. Something else I have always wanted to do is study
abroad in Europe somewhere, but that probably wont happen. I was planning on being an exchange
student next year, but I dont know if that would be a good idea because grade 11 will be my last
year of high school.Mentee 2022-04-20, 17:01: Hello! Sorry i have not had time to answer, I have

studying abroad in Europe would be such a cool opportunity! The good news is that most universities
offer exchange programs so if you wanted to do a semester abroad (ex. Europe, Australia), then that
is definitely doable when you're in University. Have you had the chance to complete the extension
activities? If not, let me know if I can help. Otherwise I will mark this module as complete and we

connected to another,its eaiser to know where you are. the small things can be fun the two things i
dislike about rural areas, you know everyone, not a bad thing but when certain bridges and
relationships dont workout, its harder to move on with your life. The lack of oppurtinity, not as
much support for things later on in your life, if you want to make good money you got to leave town.
My question about living in a city, is how is everyone connected, do you meet new people everyday,
or do you just mind your own buisness and focus on lifeMentor 2022-02-23, 22:03: Hey Rahil, it is
great to hear from you! I think there are a lot of benefits for living in a rural town and you
highlighted a few of them. A sense of community can be very helpful, especially when you are going
through a tough time or if you need help with something. On the flip side that can also be a
negative, like you pointed out. If you had an issue with someone, it can be hard not to run into
them from time to time. You asked a good question. I live in Vancouver. There are soooo many
different personalities in the city. I think it is fairly easy to make friends, especially if you
are active (eg. play sports, go to social events, etc.). One nice thing about a bigger city is that
you can always ask people if they want to try new reasurant or hike. Although people might be busy,
it's usually not too diffiuclt to send a text and arrange a meet up time. What are some of the small
things that you find fun? Personally, I like going to the gym, watching UFC, and going on hikes.

student at UBC. In third year we do most of our learning through preplanned rotations. I have been
placed in various hospitals during different rotations (eg. plastic surgery, emergency department,
internal medicine, psychiatry, etc.). I am currently doing my ""rural"" family practice in Abbotsford.
Aside from school I am a big UFC fan, NHL/NBA/NFL fan, and a big Kanye fan. Before opening up

bengals just sayingMentor 2022-02-16, 20:52: hahaha yeah the Ram were better, but a part of me
wanted the Bengals to win. Oh well, at least OBJ and Donalds got a ring. Post-secondary can be a big
change. If you are moving away to a different city you will have to get used to transiting, cooking,
cleaning, and doing all the little things around the house. I can be stressful to find a new place
to live, but hopefully you have a few friends that are going to be living in the same area. I see
that you want to be a lineman. What makes you want to do that? Seems like a cool physicla job I was

explain why you like it. I like how traffic isn't as bad. Its not so clustered and the overall air
quality feels better. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. There
isn't much to do and not many places to go. It gets repetitive and boring after awhile when you have
to go to the same places/ shop at the same stores for 15 years. One question you have about living
or moving to the city I don't really have one.Mentor 2022-04-02, 19:05: Hi Quinn, I'm quite jealous
that you don't experience heavy traffic. Unfortunately for me, it is usually a 30-minute drive to my
workplace and almost an hour to get to my university because I have an early class where I am sadly
stuck in traffic. When I would visit my hometown I like to visit my cousins in the countryside and
we often would go to a lake and swim which is nice because the water is much clearer than it is in
the city. If you don't have any more questions, I have opened up the next set!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 18:23: Hey Quinn! What's up? I saw you want to be a therapist or criminal
investigator. That's super cool because I am also interested in that field of criminal investigation
stuff. The stuff that I like is baking, taking my dog to the dog park when I'm off from school or
work. I saw that you also love playing with your dog. What breed is your dog? Mine is a
Shepard/hound, name Diesel, he loves sniffing and cuddling by my feet. What are fun things you like
to do after school or just in general? How is school going so far, especially with what's happening
in the world right now? are you enjoying it, if so what subjects do you like? In high school mine
was English and french, I was never really good at social studies or science and ironically, science

is a pitbull lab mix, shes about 2 years old and her name is Bailee. I also have 2 cats one named
Blue and the others name is Delilah. Usually after school I will do my homework (if I have any) and
then have a nap. When I wake up I'll usually take my dog for a walk if it's not dark out and then
when I get home I play videogames and talk to my online friends. School is going alright. I have
most of my favourite subject this semester. Them being Science, PE and Band. Some of my likes
include anime, watching sunsets, crystals (specifically rose quartz), pasta, cats and whales. Some
of my dislikes are wasps, the dark, airplanes and spiders. What are your likes and dislikes? I guess
some of the topics I'd like to know more about would be what type of schooling I need to do to be
able to be a criminal investigator/therapist. -Thanks Quinn! :)Mentor 2022-02-12, 19:47: Hii :) Awww
I love your pet's names, and they sound adorable. what kind of video games do you like to play? I
like watching Minecraft videos during my limited free time. I love travelling which I hope to do
soon, I'm going to Toronto in the summer which is quite exciting. I also love playing my guitar when
I have the chance, which is harder to find nowadays since I'm balancing my last couple of semesters
before graduating as well as work. I don't like bugs either especially silverfishes because I am
constantly finding those buggers in my house :( well, there are many ways to become a criminal
investigator/therapist. if you want to be a criminal investigator, you could get a degree in
criminology or psychology and apply for the police force, get experience and work your way as a
criminal investigator by applying for courses that they offer through police school. we can go more
in-depth in that if you have specific questions. My friend is becoming a therapist soon and she got
her undergrad in psychology and applied for a master's program in counselling. I might become a
crime analyst or a forensic psychologist and what I am doing is getting my undergrad in psychology
and possibly apply for BCIT for their forensic investigation program or get my master's in forensic
psychology. just depends where I get accepted inMentor 2022-02-19, 17:02: Hi Quinn! Just wanted to

vlogs. I haven't been relaxing hahah. I've been working non-stop :( I'll start off with being a
therapist and move on to criminal investigator. Anyways there are many ways you can be a therapist.
The easiest path is taking your undergrad in psychology and then getting your masters. Do you have
an idea of what kind of therapist you want to go into? Like there's counselling, social worker,
psychologist, psychiatrist? Since many of these require different education levels. If you want to
be a psychologists, i can be more helpful because that is my path of education right now, but i can
try to help you with others since I have friends who are in different programs.Mentor 2022-03-04,
19:40: Hi again! Just wanted to see what's up. Anything interesting in school or outside of school?
I just finished my first round of midterms and I'm so exhausted, but I can relax again before I have
midterms in mid march. It's also my birthday soon and I'm excited to go out with my friends. Let me
know what you want to talk about next.Mentee 2022-03-09, 16:57: Hi, Nothing interesting has
happened. Do you mind opening the Rural to urban assignment?Mentor 2022-03-10, 19:44: Hi! what do
you mean by rural to urban assignment?",,,,"Mentee 2022-04-07, 17:02: 1. What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate
about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? The director was trying
to communicate that if you are living in the country you need to get alot of your basic needs
yourself. For example water, food, heat all of that. When you live in the city it is given to you if
you pay for it. 2. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? I
didn't really relate to anything. 3. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things
did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? I felt bored. In my opinion it was a boring
topic. 4. In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are
feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? I guess it kind of does
match. I'm not excited to move but at the same time I dont really care.Mentor 2022-04-10, 15:58: HII
the short video was interesting but I also found it quite boring. It's probably because I cannot
relate to it as I have been living in the city my whole life. Moving can be quite scary at first but
it'll be good once you've settled in to your place and know how to navigate the area. I might be
moving across the country for my graduate study and I am a little intimidated and worried but it'll
be good. What topic do you want to work on next?Mentor 2022-04-19, 11:46: Hey Quinn, just wanted to
say hi and see how you were doing. I have my finals this week so it has been a little stressful over
the past couple of days with studying and getting my assignments handed in. Which topic do you want
to move on to discuss? Let me know so I can open that up for you and we can go from there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-04-20, 17:26: I don't really have any family traditons. Usually when theres a holiday me

be the very first part of the conversation topic ""from rural to urben"" please read the above text
and dont forget to share with me these 3 points outlined above Three things you like about living in
a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your
reasons for each. One question you have about living or moving to the city I am very excited to have
this discussion with you because I have extensive experience with moving and having to adjust to a
new norm since I immigrated to Canada from Iran with my family back in 2012. So, I have learned how
to adopt to living in a totally different world. Feel free to ask any questions you have in regards
to this topic. Once we are done with this set of anchor text we will move onto the next one. and I
will send you a message under that anchor text. I cant wait to read your response. Best
wishes.Mentor 2022-03-04, 16:36: Dear Quaid Hello, I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your
responses. I will start with answering your question first, the points you mentioned you liked about
being in a rural community is definitely different in the big city. Living in a big city
unfortunately involves dealing with occasional/ often traffic depending on the city you reside in.
However there are lots of big malls and activities available that depending on your interest you can
access. The issue of having lots of homeless people unfortunately still persists in the big cities
sometimes in even bigger scale which is heartbreaking but the solution to that issue I believe lies
on the government and the economy not citizens fault so never feel guilty about that. But that is
not to say that our contributions won't help I love encouraging people to help out the homeless
community as much as possible and It's very considerate of you wanting to help. in regards to moving
to a big city, definately will need some time to adjust. Transportation will be something that you
might have to think about that you didnt have to think about before. But there are many ways of
transportation public transit (bus &amp; skytrain), having a car if financially capable to do so.
There are many things that I'm sure you would like about moving to the city such as a new start,
more people to socialize with, more job and educational opportunities, more things to do, etc. I
hope I was able to answer your question. I will send you another message under the 2nd anchor text
within this topic so we move along progressing through this topic also. Thank you for your time

moving on to",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 16:27: Hi Quaid This is Sahar, I am so excited to get to know you and talk to you
about topics that interest you as well as those that your teacher has chosen for us to go over. I
also can't wait to help you with questions that you might have. But before that, I would love to
hear more about you, your hobbies, interests and some fun facts about you. To start it off, I will
share some fun facts about myself. I am 24 years old boomer who has already graduated University. I
refer to myself as a boomer because although I am young but I have an old soul, so I can realte to
you but I also can relate to the older folks. One more fun fact, I am an immigrant from Iran. I
moved here when I was 14 years old and had to deal with adjusting to a brand new foreign culture all
by myself. I am also bilingual, fluent in Farsi and English. I would love to know whether you are
also bilingual or not. Lastly, incase you wanted to know I graduated UBC with a Bachelors in
Science- Biology and I also have an Associates degree in Science Biology. So that makes me a
Scientist :). I have way more fun facts about me that I will share as we get to know each other, but
I won't bore you too much. I cant wait to hear all about your fun facts.Mentee 2022-02-15, 17:44:

extent i have been studying nuchaunaulth for about 3 years now but that's all for nowMentor
2022-02-17, 17:07: Dear Quaid Hi, it was so nice to read your message and get to know you abit
better. I am glad that I am mentoring you also and I can't wait to help you as much as I can with
the questions you might have. What sport you used to play? and I'm so happy to hear that you are
interetsed in the same subject that I am interested. Being a Scientist is great and I know at many
times intimidating but I am here to help you and show you that its alot less scary that it seems.
University overall is stressful until you get a hang of it and after that its not too bad and
luckily I am here to share all of my advises to help you to not have to feel the stress. Firstly,
lets talk about which conversation topic you want us to start with? your teacher wants us to cover
these 3 topics by may and the topics are 1) From Rural to Urben 2) Entering the job market 3) Paying
for school . Feel free to let me know which oen of these 3 you want to start with and I will open it
up and we can chat over there about those topics. and then I will help you will all of your
questions. Have a great day :)Mentee 2022-02-25, 16:09: dear sahar i used to play softball and
basketball but eventually grew out of those sports but i think rural to urben sounds good:)Mentor
2022-02-28, 17:30: Dear Quaid Hello, I hope you are doing well. Thats very cool, I used to play
basketball also and I was part of the swimming team; but just like you I grew out of them so I know
what you mean. In regards to the conversation topics, I will send you another message in addition to
this under the conversation topic ""from rural to urben"" so that we can get started with that
conversation and its activities. So, please watch out for that message as well as this one. I am
looking forwards to our first coversation topic. Have a great day :)Mentee 2022-02-28, 17:47: Dear
sahar i think it's cool that you used to play basketball to and i can't wait to conversate about
rural to urbenMentee 2022-03-02, 17:19: Qestion1 I like that i can walk to most places in a small
amount of time I like that theirs mostly a small amount of traffic and there is always somthing
interesting Question2 I don't like that we don't have a mall or big store the only big stores are
walmart or no frills I don't like that there's so many homeless because it just makes me feel bad
for them and because i can't do anything for them Question 3 what is it like being in a big city and
what is it like for traffic and what is it like to move into a big city",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-04, 16:50: Dear Quaid Please read the second anchor text and the questions and the
ctivities below it and send me your responses and then we will discuss it and I will open the survey
for you to be able to finish that also afterwards. If you have any questions related to the topic of
""from rural to urben"" feel free to ask me :) Best Wishes.Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:38: I think the same
things about living in the city is that theirs multiple people living together and working together
and traveling together but in different ways for example in the city their for transportation they
use cars and it has workers working on buildings in the country they use canoos and make snow shoes
and make their own houses it seem I didn't relate to anything in the film It made me feel weird only
because i feel like the music didn't go with what was happening i think the video has taught me
something valuable wich is to work harder and showed me that moving to a big city probably won't be
as bad so i guess i feel better on the decision to move to a big city as i grow upMentor 2022-03-14,
22:55: Dear Quaid Hello, I hope you are doing well and are enjoying your spring break :) Thank you
for your resonses and taking the time finishing up the required questions. Prior to finishing the
final survey for this section, there are 2 extension activities that we need to also work on an
finish as requested by your teacher. So, I will send you an additional message under the ""keeping
the traditions"" extension activity so we can begin with discussing that extension activity first.
Also, when working on this anchor text did you face any more additional questions regarding ""rural
to urben"" topic? if yes, don't hasitate to ask me :) Thank you.Mentor 2022-04-14, 17:51: Dear Quaid
Hi, I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you were able to finish both extension
activities and again feel free to send over any questions you might have before we move on from this
topic to the next conversation topic. If you don't have any questions about this topic and are ready
to move on, let me know and I will complete this coversation topic and then there will be a quick
survey for you to complete and then we can start our next conversation topic. Let me know :) Also,
before we finish this topic I wanted to ask you some questions 1) after going through the activities
and what we have discussed has your opinion changed about the differences between rural and urban
communities? 2) Do you see yourself moving from your community to a more urban big city environment?
3) Do you think this topic and its activities has been able to better your understanding of urban
and rural community differences? I would love to read your responses. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-14, 22:59: Dear Quaid Hi, its me again here is the second message I stated earlier.

you have to write a resume and do an interview before you got the job? If so, what experience or
skills did you list on the resume?",,,"Mentor 2022-02-22, 17:46: Hi! How was your long weekend? :) Sounds like you found part 1 of the
conversation for ""From Rural to Urban."" In the writing above there are a few prompts/questions, feel
free to answer these when you have time in your class, and then we can discuss!Mentee 2022-02-23,
17:34: 3 things i like about living in a rural area 1. i like living in a small town because i could
never see my self living in a big city. 2. i like how easy it is to navagate and you dont have to go
far to get groceries and life nescities etc. 3. i like how you have a close friend group in a small
town.Mentee 2022-02-23, 17:42: 2 things i dont like 1. everyone finds your perosnal stuff out 2.
rumours spread very easily How is it living in a city? can you unlock the part 2 please ?Mentor
2022-02-24, 00:12: Oh that's so interesting you don't see yourself as a big city person! When I was
younger (maybe elementary/beginning of high school) I used to think how I would love to live in a
big city... but now I love the opportunities to get away from it all and relax, less traffic, less
population density of smaller cities. Haha, its great! Anyways, to answer your question living in a
bigger city is totally ok! Certainly there can be challenges like finding a place to live (finding a
place to rent is nutty!), and the general cost of living (think groceries, phone bills) there are
also many advantages. I think if you need to move to a larger city to attend school or to work a
job, then the benefits of growing as a person outweight the cons. It sounds like you are very much
rooted in a small town. What would you like to do when you graduate (stay or move) and why?Mentor
2022-02-24, 00:14: I can open up the next part just as soon as we finish this conversation :)Mentee
2022-02-28, 17:37: When i graduate i definetly want to move off the island and move somewhere like
up north, the thing is if i moved up north i would miss the fishing and ocean but living on the
island i miss the hunting so there is alot of pros and cons. i would definelty consider living in a
medium size town but i really do like living in a small town. when i graduate i think im going to
take a gap year and travel around and see which places i like best and get ideas on where i want to
go and the best job oppertunitys.Mentor 2022-03-02, 00:48: Sounds like you have a good idea of your
direction after high school! Maybe if you have some extra time in your class, you would like to
search up some towns or small cities up north that you could see yourself living in? If you do, feel
free to share :) I will also unlock part 2 for you to work on in your next class, as you requested
(and because I know there is a bit of a time delay, haha).",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 19:52: Hi Olivia My name is Karissa and I will be your mentor. I am 22 years old
and I am studying psychology at Vancouver Island University. I am excited to hear about you! What
are your hobbies? What are your views on school? Or anything else you would like to tell me? My goal
is to help you work through this mentoring program in a way that best serves you! I am happy to work
quickly or slowly, and answer any questions about the program or life in general. Just let me know
your preferences!Mentee 2022-02-11, 14:11: Hi, I am Olivia and my hobbies are hunting,
fishing,hiking and exploring. But i espically like hiking when theres a big buck on the trail
waiting for me. Um what else.. i like to quad, pretty much i just love being outisde. My teacher
mentioned something about urban and rural converstation but i dont know. My thoughts on school, well
i like it sometimes and other times i dont, sometimes it feels like a waste of time espically when
its nice out and when its fishing or hunting season.. But i find i learn more when im with my dad
and papa in the bush out hunting fishing. But i have to go to school and atleast get my grade 12.
And for the learning quickly and slowly uhhh it doesnt really matter maybe mid speed i dont
know.Mentor 2022-02-11, 17:45: Oh super! I love the outdoors too! I might be biased, but I think we
live in one of the best places to enjoy the outdoors :) And totally - there is so much to be learned
outside of school too, just like you say you learn from fishing and hunting. I think sometimes too
that its not necessarily learning the material in school, but rather learning to show up and put in
the reps. As you mention the rural and urban conversation, I will open that conversation up first
and we can begin working through it!Mentee 2022-02-22, 16:53: Yes that is very true being able to
show up to school and having that responsibility is very important to teach us for the real world.
And yes we definetly do live in one of the best places. So for the rural and urban thing what are we
supposed to do?Mentee 2022-02-22, 16:56: I found the rural and urban thing i will start working on
it.",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 01:05: Hmm! I think this a really thought provoking short film. From my
perspective, it seems like the film director is trying to convey the message that traditional and
modern ways of being (while quite different) intersect at the point where we are often trying to
move forward. And our world is constantly moving - animals, people, nature, etc. I think this also
draws on the ideas we may have of how life differs between rural and urban areas - and despite them
looking quite different, they share a commonality in the challenges of moving forward. What do you
think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living in a
city and living in the country?Mentee 2022-03-03, 17:09: Am i supposed to watch the video?Mentor
2022-03-03, 19:34: Hi! Yes, you can start reading from where it says ""Anchor text 2"" as well as
watch the 3 minute video :)Mentee 2022-03-09, 16:50: oh oops i forgot about this sorry hahahMentor
2022-03-10, 11:15: No worries! When you have a chance to watch it, see my question below :)Mentee
2022-03-10, 17:23: i think he was meaning in the city theres everything for you its easy life but in
the country you gotta work for well not nesseceraly work for it but its not as easy as the city
espcially off the grid you are more isolated.Mentor 2022-03-10, 19:53: Totally! I like that
interpretation - almost sort of that in rural areas you have to slow down (because you may need to
grow or catch some of your own food, or build your home) whereas in the city you can speed up
(because everything you may need is readily available, like food, housing, etc). Do you relate to
anything in the video? Either now or in the future, perhaps when you explore some of those northern
rural cities? :)Mentee 2022-03-11, 15:54: Um im not sure but i definetly want to be self saficiant
or however you spell it andbe able to do myown things and not relie on stores and other places to
keep me going. Todays the last day of school before spring break so ill answer again in 2 weeks have
a good spring break!Mentor 2022-03-11, 16:53: Absolutely! Any last thoughts on what makes you most
nervous about leaving your current home/moving to a new place? And what makes you most excited? Have
the best break!! I hope you get a chance to get outside and enjoy all of your hobbies :) When you
get back to school and this program we can finish off this conversation. There are 2 extension
activities that you should be able to unlock that your teacher is wanting you to do, please let me
know if you have any questions about these!Mentee 2022-03-28, 17:05: On spring break i got a job so
ive been working alot and i did go fishing a couple of times. other than that didnt do alot. and
moving away from my hometown is a little nerv racking but it would be a good change.Mentor
2022-03-30, 18:24: Woohoo! Good for you! It can be so rewarding to have a job in high school :) How

conversation/section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-04-01, 15:37: Every year we go out with friends and family out to the busah and we have

like to spend time (lets say 4). Then you could pick a town up north that maybe your interested in
moving to after grad (e.g., Prince George), and see if you can do a google search to find some
similar places/activities to the items on your list :) This one should also be saved to your

start by answering the prompts above and we can have a conversation about it. And, as always, feel
free to ask if you have any questions!Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:34: Three things you like about living
in a rural area. Lots of places to adventure to, i like that because i love exploring. No traffic, i
love this because you can get to places fast. Everyone knows eachother, i like this because it makes
our community closer. Two things you don’t like? Not having close shopping, i dont like this because
i love going shoppiong at malls. Less activities, i dont like this because it can get boring
sometimes. One question you have about living or moving to the city? Is it frusturating living in a
big city?Mentor 2022-03-09, 13:58: I really like the points you made about the pros and cons about
living in a rural area. I used to live in a rural area when I was younger and I had a lot of the
same thoughts about it. Is living in a big city frustrating? Could you maybe elaborate on what way
you would think its frustrating? I would say for me personally I find that a lot of the conveniences
and pros outweigh the cons. I really like accessibility to different shops, restaurants, things to
do etc but certain things like traffic can be annoying and in a city its not always practical to
drive your own car so you get used to dealing with public transport if you're not in a place where
you can get around everywhere on foot. And sometimes I guess it can be annoying how places can get
very busy. But I would say cities I've lived in like Vancouver and Montreal are a lot more
manageable than some other big cities. They're not too big and they're pretty safe and things are
accessible.Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:28: Right now I live in a small city, the traffic isnt usually bad
unless its holidays or summer than lots of people cut through my town to go to the lakes or Tofino
area. I would love to live in a big town because lots of activities to do and plenty of shopping!
The traffic would drive me crazy though and the loud sirens and vehicals would bother me at night.
For me i would want to live in like Victoria, im not sure why but i find it very pretty there and
theres lots of places to walk in town. I havent decided yet where i wanty to live and go to school
because a small town would be nice so i could live in a barn house and ride dirtbikes and have
fires, but living in a city would always be nice cause you could save lots of money walking
everywhete and so much shopping. There are lots of pros and cons to both though, so its hard to
decide! I think as someone going to school i wouyld look more at money, time, accesability, and the
importan things to help me save money to save but to also enjoy my time.Mentor 2022-03-31, 15:59:
Yes city offers a lot of opportunities for things to do, sights to see, food to enjoy and places to
shop! I think though in a lot of cities people prefer to make use of public transport because of
traffic like you mentioned and the public transit system in Vancouver is pretty good. I haven't
visited Victoria but it is very beautiful from what I've seen. There are so many different
considerations in deciding where you want to live but its also good to remember that where you
choose for now doesn't have to be where you live forever and that our wants and needs change over
time. Additionally many people choose to study in one place and then go back home or move somewhere
else after finishing their degree, so the options are endless and definitely don't limit yourself! I
understand it can be hard to decide though but it seems like you have very valid considerations
you're keeping in mind which is good.Mentee 2022-04-04, 13:43: Yes. I am a very organized person and
when i plan or put my mind to it i always try to follow through. Since i have lived in a smaller
town my whole life i would love to live somewhere else while i go to school. Like you said i wll

I'm so excited to finally have a mentor! I am from the CLE class right now, my other classes are
english, social studies and gym. I am really enjoying social studies because i have an awesome
teacher even though im normally not a fan of social studies. Grade 10 is a very hard year but i am
looking forward to grade 11 so i can take law studies. Outside of school i really enjoy spending
time with my family and friends, i like going out on drives just listening to music or going up the
mountain to have a fire. I wanted to know what kind of law you're studying, how long have you been
in school so far?Mentor 2022-02-17, 19:17: That's so great, I'm glad you're excited to have a
mentor! Grade 10 can certainly be tough but it's really positive that you have classes you enjoy and
are looking forard to other classes. I completely understand the value of having a great instructor
for a course. Social studies was always one of my favorite classes (I was a history major in
undergrad) but now in law school property law is one of my classes I'm not too fond of content wise
but my prof is so great and enhtusiastic it makes it a lot more engaging. I'm currently in the
second semester of my first year at law school so all of the classes I am taking right now are
required courses which include contracts, torts, property, criminal, charter/public law and
Aboriginal treaty law. Your hobbies are really relatable - I love spending time with family and
friends and listening to music. I see from your profile you also like working out? That's really
good for keeping a healthy active lifestyle not just physically but mentally. It's a crucial part of
my routine and staying grounded amid the stresses of school.Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:41: Thats really
good to know what course you're taking right now, i would really love to know what one you are
leaning more towards. I dont really know how your courses work in uni but what kind of lawyer do you
want to be? I am thinking of becoming a criminal lawyer because investegations are very intreging to
me. One day i really hope to become a judge.Mentor 2022-02-23, 19:07: Well first you do your
undergraduate degree where you typically choose a faculty (arts, business, science, engineering etc)
and then within that you choose what subject you want to major in and what subject you want to minor
in. So I was in faculty of arts at McGill and I majored in history and minored in political science.
Then after you do your undergraduate degree you can apply to law school. In the 1st year of law
school you have to take all required classes but then in 2nd and 3rd year you have more flexibility
and can choose what to take. I am hoping to take intellectual property and sports law next year. I
don't really know what kind of lawyer I want to be yet but I am interested in sports and
entertainment law or being in house council for a fashion house/luxury brand. Criminal law is super
interesting! It's what made me want to go to law school, I used to really want to be a prosecutor.
Investigations and true crime shows/books are so fascinating! And that's such an amazing dream you
have to become a judge. It takes a lot of work and there are a lot of steps to getting there but I'm
sure if you put your mind to it you can do it. If you have any questions about the undergraduate/law
school admissions/lifestyle/anything else then let me know!Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:09: Thank you for
sharing about yourself and the classes your taking! would you be able to open the Rural Urban
assignment? i would be interested in talking about those questions.Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:09:",,,,"Mentor 2022-04-04, 13:49: I just watched the video, it draws some interesting comparisons and
contrasts between urban and rural life - what do you think? You can consider the questions above the

19 years old and am currently attending my first year of college at Selkirk College. I am from a
small town and have moved away from home to come to school. I truly believe in open, honest
communitcation, and I am here to spread all of my knowledge onto you while we are able to connect. I
am willing to answer any questions you have to the best of my abilities and will give you my honest
opinions on anything you ask. I have learned so much already and would love to share what I have
learned. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!Mentee 2022-02-17, 11:57: hello, my name is legna
and i am excited to be have a conversation with you. hope you are having a good day today!Mentor
2022-02-18, 15:04: I am doing very well thanks! How about you tell me a little bit about yourself
and what you are hoping to get out of this mentorship. Have you thought much about post secondary
school? What are you thoughts on it? Have a great weekend!Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:29: well i am
planning to exceed in biology and just science in general, with an added class of calculus. i don't
remember if its university or college but whichever one has those options i will try to attend. I
play basketball and skateboard in my free time and i like to hang out with friends. i know vet
school can be very competetive and you do have to be pretty skilled at a lot of things but i'm
hoping to get into that and continue my dream career.Mentor 2022-02-25, 23:06: That is so great to
hear that you have a plan already started, that is a good place to start. I am taking a lot of
sciences right now and am also taking calculus this year. Vet school is an awesome end goal, there
are a few people in my program in that have the same goal. I also play basketball and I love playing
volleyball. Both college and university offer all of those courses, it will just take some research
to determine where you would like to live and go to school.Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:53: that's awesome,
i was thinking of getting a fresh start in maybe vancouver but im still looking for a good place to
start. I really don't have a school in mind and whichever one i pick i hope i get the education i
need and also want. i have heard vet school would be pretty competitive which is kinda scary aha, i
will do some digging on a good school but vancouver is pretty far away from my family which would be
a big commitment and im not quite sure if i want to go that far away for a school.Mentor 2022-03-02,
00:31: Yes I completely agree. I moved 3 hours away from home for college this year which for me,
was perfect, not too far and not to close. I can still be independent but also can visit when I
please. In my opinion, the location is almost as important as the institution. Vancouver I think
would be a very good option, there are so many colleges and universities to choose from. Vet school
can be very competitive, but if you have a good worth eithic and drive, than it is more than a
feasible goal. Also, do not stress too much about finding the perfect school, there are many people
who transfer after a few years and do very well. If you have a few institutions in mind in
Vancouver, I think it would be worth while for you to go do a few tours, it gives you really good
insight into the schoolm atmospheres.Mentee 2022-03-03, 13:14: its very hard for me to learn a
certain way and i have many troubles so I don't know how it'll go and I don't know what's best for
me. vancouver does look nice and is an okay distance to be away from family but i think i'll have to
look into the schools and see if they will have the best I can get and the best they can provide.
tours could definitely be helpful and that's a very good idea. i might wait a year or two just so i
can make sure that vancouver is the best place for me and that gives me time to think about expenses
and the family situation.Mentor 2022-03-06, 17:47: Yes that is such a great idea, and you honeslty
still have plenty of time to work it out and really think about what will serve you best. Almost
every campus is super great for supporting you in any way they can, it would be worth having a chat
with someone about that when the time comes of course. I think that your head is in the right place
and you are asking yourself all of the right questions in order for you to end up where is best for
you!Mentee 2022-03-07, 13:36: yeah I still got 2 years but its a very hard decision to choose aha,
theres a good vet school in vancouver that i saw and vancouver has a lot of learning opportunities
but it could be very pricey. I have a good idea of my plan but I'm still sorting stuff out. I am a
big overthinker so its very hard to just settle down on a school. i have a lot of friends in
vancouver so i still have the support that i may worry about.Mentor 2022-03-10, 12:17: I am a
complete overthinker too; it took me way too long to decicde which school I was going to go to.
Having friends and people that you can talk to about these decisions is very important, especially
those with experience. Have you had any sort of college fairs at your school? I know at my high
school that they would host open houses and give students the opportunity to ask questions. I found
it very helpful and that is actually how I found out about my program!Mentee 2022-03-10, 13:11: no,
we have actually never done that. we don't really do any colaborations or anything like that which
sucks a lot. that wouldve been a good idea but maybe in the future we would do thatMentor
2022-03-15, 15:40: Yeah I think it would be a beneficial thing for you to sreach out, if your school
does not offer it maybe ask your guidance counselor if they can lead you to online options. There
are many virtual college fair that are held year-round. This will give you a good sense of the
school, what programs they offer and any other things that are unique to their institustion.Mentee
2022-03-17, 19:58: Is there any colleges you'd recommend?Mentor 2022-03-20, 18:27: Honeslty it
completely depends on where you would like to go to school. Small colleges are always a great
option, I beleive to start out in post-secondary because of the small campus, small class sizes and
more one-on-one time with your professors to get help. I would do a search on what is available
around your area and look at what programs they offer. Any college should offer an associate of
science degree which is a 2 year science degree that you could transfer anywhere after you complete
it. I go to school in the Kootenays so I am not very farmiliar on the options around where you are,
but I would highly recommend doing some research on local colleges.Mentee 2022-03-28, 12:12: thank
you for the tips! i will look into some small ones because that seems like a better option for
me.Mentor 2022-04-04, 17:48: Yeah I really enjoy my time at college, much smaller class sizes and
more one on one help. Do you have any other general questions for me?Mentee 2022-04-08, 13:28: how
would you describe the work you do, is it pretty difficult? should i expect it to be a stress free
environment or a more troubling experience.Mentor 2022-04-12, 12:23: I would say that the work I do
for the most part is not extremely difficult, although there are a few classes that do ahve very
heavy material. I would say that the only thing that makes them difficult is the course load. I am
currently taking 6 classes and find it hard to manage my time sometimes, so of course I am stressed
when I have multiple midterms in the same week, but other than that, I think that if you manage your
time well the stress should be at a minimum. College is a pretty stressful environment in general,
but if you put in the time and make sure to have fun, it will be very worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when I moved out. I knew life was going to be expensive but it definitely surprised me when I
realized the cost of simple things like groceries! Personally, I had to take out student loans since
my parents can't support me financially. I found it really useful to write out the money I had after
student loans and working then to spend time researching how much I expected things to cost so I
could plan accordingly. Have you had any jobs? If so, do you find it easy to balance work and
school? After watching the videos above, are there any tips for saving money that stood out to you

access it now! As always, feel free to ask me any questions.Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:36: hey Rhianna,
how are you? I read the questions for the conversation topics, here are my answers. The three things
I like about living in a rural area are there is lots of nature around me, depending on where you
live in the town there is lots of peace and quiet, there is also less crime so thats nice. The two
things I don't like about living in a rural area are there is no where to go shopping all we have is
like 5 grocery stores some furniture shops and hardwear stores. There are thrift stores but I don't
want to buy all my clothes from there. The other thing I don't like is how little people there are
that i click with. There can be lots of drama as well which sucks. When you moved to the city did
you like it at first? Did you get a job? Was it really expensive? Is it hard to find housing or do
you live in a dorm? Are you on reading break?Mentor 2022-02-24, 14:35: Hi Lauren, I'm good thanks,
how are you? Being so close to nature and having lots of quiet is super nice I agree! I can
definitely relalte to your experience with not having many people you really get along with.
Although I'm from Kelowna which isn't a very small town I went to an extremely small school from
kindergarten to grade 12. My class was so small I graduated with 5 people. Because of this I always
felt like I couldn't choose my friends since I didn't have many options so I couldn't find ""my
people"". One of the reasons I'm so happy I chose to go to UBC is because there are so many people.
This allowed me to meet tons of nice, like-minded people. At first I was extremely nervous to move
to a bigger city and live away from my family but after about a week (once I got settled) I realized
I love living here and all the experiences it had provided me! I think it is scary for most people
but it is a great way of getting out of your comfort zone. When I was growing up, Kelowna also
didn't have many clothing stores for people my age so that was definitely a perk of moving to
Vancouver:). Are you planning to move to a bigger city once you graduate and are you nervous? Have
you visited any big cities and what did you think? Yes, living in Vancouver is very expensive which
is why I always try to find cheap options for living, groceries, etc. Cheap housing can be pretty
hard to find but if you plan ahead and look early on you should be able to find something! I had to
apply for my dorm about 7 months in advance. Currently I live on campus with 3 roommates. I haven't
gotten a job in Vancouver since I come home during the summer to work and I find a job would be too
much along with taking 5 classes. Yep I'm on reading break! When is your spring break?Mentee
2022-02-25, 13:28: hey rhianna, Im good thanks, Thats crazy that you graduated with 5 people. I am
definetly going to move to a big city when I graduate. I vist vancouver about 10 times a year
because most of my family lives there. I really like it there, in the summer i stay there for weeks
at a time and I think if i moved there i would really like it. my older brother just moved there and
he really likes it. Our spring break starts on march 11th I'm super exited. What prerequisites did
you need to have to get into schoolMentor 2022-02-26, 15:35: Hi Lauren! That's great that you've had
tons of experience being in a big city! I bet that makes it less stressful when you think of moving
away from home. Here is the link for the UBC pre requisites I had to take in high school:
https://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/requirements/canadian-high-schools/#british-columbia. I thought it
would be easier to send you the link then to list them off haha. I'll open up the next part of this

23:51: I'm good thank you! Just in the middle of midterm season so a little stressed but that's
expected haha. Those are great hobbies! I love studying biology, I definitely feel like I found my
subject. I really think it depends on your strengths and your interests for how difficult a subject
will be. I did struggle in first year as I had to take a variety of courses like math and physics
which are hard for me but now that I am in third year most of my classes are biology which I enjoy
the most! I also really love university life and meeting new people so even though first year might
have been a struggle I still enjoyed my time! What is your favourite subject in school? Are you
interested in studying biology after high school? Have a great weekend:)Mentee 2022-02-15, 12:44: my
favourite subject is probably science mainly biology, I also like physics but chem is really
difficult for me. I am hoping that I do go into biology after highschool. I'm not for sure how this
thing works, your supposed to open a conversation or something my teacher didnt explain it well.
good luck on your midterms:)Mentor 2022-02-15, 16:15: Hi Lauren, thank you so much! Yes, there are a
few conversation topics we have to complete specifically for your class. These topics are ""from
rural to urban"", ""entering the job market"" and ""paying for school"". Out of these conversation topics

answer the questions. I think it shows that people who live in the city have easier lives becasue
they dont have to hunt for their food. I dont think I realated to any of the images presented in the
film. I think the video looked cool. I think thats all I had to doMentor 2022-03-10, 14:58: Hi
Lauren! Thanks for answering those questions! I also think a big thing that stuck out to me was how
busy city life felt in the video in comparison to country life. Did you notice anything similar to
that? I think there are definitely pros and cons to both types of living and depends on what you
seek in life. Do you think you prefer the busy city life or the calm of the country life? I
definitely like to have a balance of both in my life.Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:08: hey Rhianna, sorry i
haven't answered in a while i have been very busy with school. they video did seem very fast in the
city, I dont really know which life i would prefer like in terms of city or country. some days i
want the clam life and other days i want the busy city life. I don't have a great balance of it in
my life because of where i live but as I mentioned befrore I do go to vancouver quite a bit. do you
like living in the city or do you find it to busy.Mentor 2022-04-01, 17:37: Hi Lauren, I hope you
had a great spring break! No worries, I understand school gets so busy sometimes. I agree, I think
it's nice to have a balance of city life and country life but I think that can be really hard to

places to walk and explore nature, and how it is less busy and quieter than urban areas. Two things
I dislike about living in a rural area are how it can feel like there can be nothing new to do at
times and how since it is such a small area it seems like everybody knows everyone. A question I
have about living in an urban area is when compared to rural areas is living in an urban area is it
a lot more busy and full of people?Mentor 2022-02-28, 13:38: Hi Kitty, It really depends on
specifically where you live. It's definitely busier overall. I've lived in Greater Vancouver since I
graduated. Greater Vancouver is basically one big city (Vancouver) surrounded by a bunch of smaller
cities (Coquitlam, Surrey, Port Moody, Delta, Richmond, Burnaby, New West etc...), and they're all
connected by transit (buses, Skytrain). In the city of Vancouver, it's really busy and there are
lots of people. I really don't like it because it feels like someone is always in your space.
Sidewalks are always really busy and you have to navigate around other people all the time. It's a
bit different when you are in the other cities like Burnaby or Coquitlam. They're still big, and
they're attached to Vancouver by Skytrain, so you can be in the city in about an hour. But it's not
as crowded so you can have your own space. I like it because you aren't around people all the time,
but you can still have access to things when you need them. For example, my friend and I took the
Skytrain yesterday to Metrotown to see a movie. Metrotown is the fifth biggest mall in Canada and I
would hate to be near it all the time, but it's there if I want it. You definitely don't have to
live in the big city to go to University. I go to SFU (which is in Burnaby) and people who come here
live in Burnaby, Coquitlam, New West, Port Moody, Surrey - really from all over because transit
makes other places a lot more accessible. I also lived on an island just off the coast of Vancouver
for a while. It was a typical small community where everyone knows everyone, lots of nature etc. But
it was an hour by ferry/bus out of Vancouver and two hours from SFU. There are quite a few people
who never leave unless they need to go see the dentist or a specialist, and when they need it, they
just go to the city (so kind of the best of both worlds). Sorry, that was long! I guess what I'm
saying is going to University doesn't have to mean living in a big city. Some questions: You
mentioned that there's not a lot to do in small towns. What kind of things/activities would you like
to have access to? Are there things about living in a small town that you would like to keep? You
mentioned nature. Are there other things?Mentee 2022-02-28, 17:59: There arent really specific
things or activities i would like to have access to but it would help if there were more things to
do or places to go when hanging out with friends instead of doing the same things everytime. Things
in a small town i would like to keep are how it isnt as busy and full of people as places like
vancouver can get, another thing i would like to keep about small towns is how its easy to find your
friends and hang out. Thank you for telling me that, thats a problem i have with having to live in
bigger cities for school. Its good to know that there are less crowded places that i can study at.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-13, 22:26: Hi Kitty! My name is Cicely. I'm in my last semester at SFU in Burnaby.
I'm actually studying psychology which I see you might be interested in! I also saw on your profile
that you like dance - that's really cool! What kind of dance do you do? I looked at the icebreaker
questions under the instructions above. I chose to do the Muiscal Interlude one. I'm linking
Skyscraper by Demi Lovato. I think this song means a lot to me becuase it's about going through hard
times, but coming through them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_8ydghbGSg I look forward to

years. Currently i am not sure what i am going to do after high school. You said that you are
studying psychology which something i am interested in studying but am having a hard time deciding
on. On your profile you said that you also had a hard time deciding what to study, what helped you
decide or choose to study psychology over the other courses you took? Thank you for suggesting that
song, That song has also meant a lot to me in the past and helped me through hard times.Mentor
2022-02-17, 00:41: Wow, that's cool! I've always wanted to try Highland dance. I did have a hard
time deciding. I think what helped me choose psychology was 2 things: I knew I wanted to help people
somehow and I was interested in maybe working in mental health. I also thought about what kind of
degree would make me more likely to get a job. Psychology is quite broad and there are lots of areas
to go into. You can do social psych, neuroscience, developmental psych etc... so there are a few
career pathways you can go down. Some of my other subjects were harder to get jobs in. What
interests you about Psychology and what else have you thought about? Also, I'm glad we both like
that song! It's really helped me as well!Mentee 2022-02-17, 15:58: Psychology interests me because I
would like to have a job where i can help other people and mental health has always been a topic i
enojoyed learning more about. Another thing i have been concidering studying after high school is
nursing because its another job that can help people and there are a lot of jobs available with
nursing as well. The main thing that i think about when concidering things to study in the future
and eventually go into a career with is helping other people.Mentor 2022-02-22, 15:30: I've thought
about nursing too. My friend actually just finished his degree and is now doing an after degree
nursing program, so there are lots of options for stuff like that. Nursing does have pretty good job
security too. I really appreciate that you want to help people with whatever you end up doing. I
think your teacher wants us to go throught these modules: From Rural to Urban, Entering the Job
Market and Paying for School. Since we're talking about jobs, do you want to do Entering the job
market? If you want to go through another one first, let me know.Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:05: My
teacher is trying to keep the class on the same topic right now. If it works with you would we be
able to start the Rural to Urban topic?Mentor 2022-02-22, 17:20: Yup, that's fine! I'll unlock it at
the top. There's a place to send messages there at the bottom like here. You can click the Rural to
Urban on the wheel at the top of the page to access the module.",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-03, 15:25: Hi Kitty, What struck me about the video was the contrast between the
environments in the different places, but that you still bring parts of yourself and your life to
wherever you go. I think it can be easy to feel disconnected from your life before and parts of
yourself when you're in an unfamiliar environment. I think it can be take a while to find out how
you and who you are a person can be expressed within it. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on
the video if you're open to it. I think your teacher also wants you to complete the extension
activities. You do those on your own, so feel free to do them as well. I think you have class on
Thursdays (?).Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:47: Hi Cicely, In that video I thought the way they showed and
compared the two ways of living were really interesting. The video showed that similar tasks are
done in such different ways depending on where you live. I think that the film maker was trying to
communicate how even though the way things are done is different depending on where you live they
are all done for the same purpose and both have useful outcomes. Sorry it took so long to respond I
forgot to check my emails. I have this class monday through friday I just fell behind and didnt have
time to respond. I will start the extention activities tomorrow, Thank you for reminding me.Mentor
2022-03-12, 14:43: Hi Kitty, That's a really interesting interpretation about how things can be done
differently, but for similar purposes! I hope the extension activities go well. After that, please
let me know which one your class is working on next and I'll open it. I also hope you have a good
spring break! We had our reading break for the semester in February and it was nice to have some
time to catch up on stuff. Let me know how it goes!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-30, 23:33: Hi Cicely, A tradition from my childhood that I still do and gives me a
sense of belonging is reading. When I was younger it was a tradition for me to read every day,
whenever I had a bad day I would read and it always helped. Even now I still read as much as
possible because it's still something I enjoy doing, If I do move away from home for school I would
still like to continue to read as much as possible. It is important to me to keep this tradition
because it is something that I think helps me a lot when I'm stressed or am having a bad day. I
think I will be able to continue this tradition as I read a lot on my phone and books, I think if I
do move that it will become something I do more online just to make it easier. Sorry for responding
so late, I had a lot of work to catch up on. I will do the second extension activity tomorrow.Mentor
2022-04-03, 22:40: Hi Kitty! Nice to hear from you again! I hope your spring break was ok. I love
that you love reading. I love it as well. I never used to go anywhere with at least two in my
backpack, and now I have some on my phone like you mentioned. I appreciate you sharing that with me,

13:44: What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you ? How do you keep track of all the
money and all the payment dates?Mentor 2022-04-19, 15:12: What was the most challenging budgeting
issue for you ? I think the most challenging budgeting issue I had is that I really just had no idea
how much money ""things"" cost and how many expenses you have. As an example I had no idea how much it
actually costs to but groceries for the week or what fuel was going to be like and how much money I
should set aside for ""fun"" activities. So I would say just trying to estimate costs at the beginning
was the most challenging for me. How do you keep track of all the money and all the payment dates? I
like to write all due dates for assignements, appointments, payments, etc. in my calender that I
have on my computer. One because with school I use my computer everyday so it is an easy place to
have all the dates, and two because I know I won't lose the dates if I were to write it on a piece
of paper. I also like to keep just a note on my phone in the notes app writing out what my expenses
are (for example: phone bill, insurance, rent, credit card, etc.). That just helps me keep track of
what I for sure need to save for expenses. I am also forgetful of things at time so I use the
reminders app on my phone to create reminders of when lets say my credit card bill is due or to not
forget to pay my phone bill etc. For budgeting I like to seperate my income into seperate ""areas"" or
bank accounts. I will put aside the money that I know I for sure need for monthly expenses, and the
money I have estimated for fuel, groceries and any other things like maybe my car is due for an oil
change. And the money I have left over I like to keep in a seperate account so it almost like I
don't have access to that money so I won't go into my savings to spend money in additional things I
don't need. I also find it helpful to meal plan for groceries. That is one big expense I never
realized when I first moved out. Groceries are expensive so it helps me to have a good idea what I
am going to be making for meals so I walk into the grocery store with a list of ingredients I need
and I am not aimlessly walking around picking up things I don't need.","Mentor 2022-02-28, 17:02: Yes of course! I have opened the converation ""from rural to urban"" now
:)Mentee 2022-03-01, 14:23: 1A) I like having little to no trafic, because it would take so much
longer to get to where your going, and the road rage would be so much worse. B) Knowing everyone and
having lots of connections with people because your in a small town, It makes getting a job easier.
C) the nature and hikes in a small town is so amazing, makes life enjoyable. 2A) i hate the drama in
this town because everyone knows everyones bussines. B) Not having much things to do, less activity
and less intertanment. My question for moving to a bigger city would be is it more stressful do you
have lots of friends, does every store have big line ups or malls?Mentor 2022-03-02, 12:47: Thanks
for your responses! Yes the traffic is definetly a little worse than it would be in a small town.
But, I live in Prince George and the traffic is not too bad during rush hour times! I think just
planning on leaving aroud 10 minutes earlier to get to a destination during rush hour times is more
than enough extra time to get there. It is great to have those close connections with being in a
smaller town. However, being in a bigger place even if you do not have as many connections there are
much more opportunities for jobs in an urban area. I cannot speak for all larger areas but Prince
George is full of hikes, trails, lakes, and many outdoor actvities! It is definietly place for
outdoor lovers to be. Drama in a smal town is the worst. That's not to say that will not happen in a
bigger city but I think surrounding yourself with people who prefer to stay outside of the drama is
a key to that too. There is defiently more opportunites to do a variety of things living in a bigger
place Living in a bigger city is an adjustment but once you get use to it, it is not stressful at
all! Infact its not much different from living in a town its just on a bigger scale! I do not have a
large group of friends, but I have always been someone who has a smaller group of very close
friends. You will have lots of opportunites to make friends whether it is through school, work, or
hobbies you have. I would say no the line-ups are not big! Sometimes during busy times on the
weekend they are a bit longer but go fast! Is there a place where you are wanting to move to after
you graduate school?Mentee 2022-03-03, 13:17: I don't know where I want to live yet, I want to stay
in town because im close to my family. Maybe I would move to Vancouver but I dought it. I haven't
really thoutght about moving because im so young like whats the point in worring about all of this
it makes things stressful, when really we should be worring about our main classes. It's a lot for
someone so young to be worring about everything but it is very good to have in mind life out of high
school isn't perfect and easy.Mentor 2022-03-03, 13:23: That is great you are aware of that! While
in high school yes it is important to keep in mind what you plan for your future but it is also so
important to just enjoy your time and not let worrying about the future ruin your present time. I
will unlock part 2 of this conversation :)",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 18:21: Hi Keira! My name is Kenadie, and I will be your mentor! A little about me
is I am 22 years old currently attending UNBC in Prince George completing my 3rd year of the nursing
progam. I have a huge passion for health care and health promotion so I hope to be able to use my
nursing career to envoke some changes in those areas. I saw on your profile that you want to become
and actress, that is very cool! Is there a certain genre you want to act in? (theatre, action,
comedy, romance, TV, movies, etc). I also saw that you are considering a career in nursing as well.
If you have any questions about what that is like or any other questions about anything else I am
more than happy to answer those to the best of my ability! Looking forward to chatting soon :)Mentee
2022-02-17, 12:13: hi Kenadie, I'm intrested in doing nursing and while I'm doing that I will be
doing acting on the side, I have a aunty who has been in acting moives and one of her best freinds
directs river dale! I was wondering about how your getting through your practice as becoming a
nurse, is it hard and stressful, do you have any spare time other then school? And for that question
about what part of acting I would wanna do is defentily romance and action.Mentor 2022-02-18, 22:30:
Hi Keira! Thanks for your response! Romance and action movies would definelty be fun to act in! As
for nursing school it is hard and stressful at times, but you get out what you put into it. It is
definelty a program where you need to be fully invested in. I also work part-time so there is some
spare time outside of school, however it can become easily overwhelming. Time management and setting
time aside to rest and spend time for yourself is very important.Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:42: How long
will it take for your schooling before you become a nurse, is there ever breaks, do you do schooling
through the summertime? Do you think having a relationship while in nursing school is hard will it
unfocus you from your work.Mentor 2022-02-22, 22:24: I am in the RN program, so that is a 4 year
bachelors degree. School typically runs from the beginning of September until the middle of April.
This year however I have an extended clinical where I will not have school but I will have a
clinical placement in either May-June or June-July (depending on which group I get put in). You can
choose to take additional courses throughout the summertime if you wish to have a lighter following
semester! But that is totally by choice. I have been in a relationship for 5 years now and it is
hard at times trying to divide your time between yourself, school, work, family, friends, and
relationships it is possible. I believe if something is a priority in your life there will always be
time for it if you make it!Mentor 2022-02-22, 22:25: There is also a differerent nursing program
which is the LPN and that is only 2 years. I am not sure how the coursework is like for that program
but I am assuming school still runs from September-April.Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:51: Okay great I love
that the summertime is free, I would definitly take some coruse in the summer just because it would
probaly help out a little more. I was wondering if you could start the rural and urban thing?",,,,"Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:38: question 1- I believe the director is trying to sayin the city you live
kind free because everything is already done for you the building the food, almost everything. And
by living in the country you have to do everything as a team or by yourself. question 2- I don't
really relate to the flim other then i do lots of things on my own and am responisble and help out
family and myself when something needs to be done. question 3- the music made it feel intense and
keep you on track of the point there putting across, while watching the flim I felt stressed for
some reason like I should be helping out more or relizing what people do for their community .
question 4- My emotions felt more up best like woah they did all of this and people in the city live
flike It's so easy but really life is diffecuilt when you have to do everything on your won. And I
feel like moving to a city would be my best intrest but it would be a good change of culture.Mentor
2022-03-09, 16:09: What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the
relationship between living in the country and living in a city? I like your interpretation of the
film. I agree that it was trying to show the difference between country living versus city living.
When you live in a rural area you are self reliant on many things whereas in the city you have
readily access to many different services. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images
presented in the film? I think the film was very projected towards people who may live in a secluded
community such as a reserve where they rely on the land and the animals where their housing, food,
and traditions. I agree where there was a definite focus on teamwork in the rural aspects of the
video How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create
those feelings in you? I agree the music felt very intense. I was feeling a bit stressed while
watching the video also. I think the filmmaker intentionally used this form of music to engage the
viewers In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are
feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? ​​​​​​​I like how you were
able to reflect your own emotions into this video. Rural versus urban living is much different but
there are different ""levels"" of each. For example living on a farm 30 minutes out of town is
different compared to living in a small town. Where also living in a smaller city such as Prince
George is different than living in a bigger city like Vancouver.Mentee 2022-03-29, 14:24: what are

over the differences between rural and urban areas, the benefits of each, finances regarding moving,
as well as any other questions you may have. I have live in both rural and urban areas, therefor
please don't hesitate to ask any questions. To begin please complete the above activites. LMentee
2022-02-22, 13:35: Okay so three things that I like about living in a arural area are: Living
spaceously. I like that house are far away from eachother so that I can have my music loud. I have
lots of animals and I don't have to worry about them getting hit by cars, or theres less of a
chance. There's lots of nature closeby. I like to take a little nature walk every so often and it's
convenient because it's right behind my house. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your
reasons for each. two things I don't like are: The amount of rednecks there are, they gross me out
and make me want to leave, i especially don't like it when they are racist. We don't have enough
stores for shopping\ we don't have a mall. I have a shopping addiction so i would be so happy if
there was more nice stores, also just things to do because it is so boring here. If I want to do
something with friends i basically have to go to walmart. One question you have about living or
moving to the city: I have heard from my dad that the city is crazy expensive and that i would have
to live in a teeny tiny apartment while going to school. Is this true? How do you manage school,
while having to work just to pay the bills. KMentor 2022-02-23, 20:41: Hi Kalee, Moving to the city
can definitely be intimidating at first. During my time in college I've lived both in rural and
urban areas. Yes, cities do typically tend to be higher in price in terms of accomodations, i.e.
housing, transportation, gas, etc, however, this is very dependent on which city you're going to,
what kind of accomodations you're looking into etc. There are ways you can be prepared for the shift
in prices and the change of living in the city. A few of the things I did were: 1. Look into
different housing options. There are many different types of housing you can look into, some will
usually be cheaper than others. Student housing, as well as basement suites/apartments will usually
be your cheapest option as a student but it is always best to look around, and make sure it will be
a good fit. A few alternatives you can try would be finding a Duplex or a house to rent with
roommates, as well as apartments or basement suites. 2. Look into getting some scholarships and
bursaries. There are many different sites you can look into to see what scholarships and bursaries
you'd qualify for, as well as looking into the ones offered in your local area. Scholarships and
bursaries are a great way to get some funding to help towards your college and moving expenses. 3.
Save early. During the years leading up to college I made sure to put away as much money as I can,
that way I always had some money just in case. 4. Look into student loans. Not every student will be
eligible for goverment student loans, however it is always a good idea to look into your options in
terms of loans. Some colleges/universities offer financial aid, as well as other avenues such as
goverment lines of credit. 5. Look into different modes of transportation. Some cities gas prices
are significantly more expensive than rural areas, therefor it is important to look at the different
expenses and weigh out which for of transport will be best for you, i.e. public transport,
carpooling, taxis, or personal automotive. I see space is a concern of yours based on what you like
about living in rural areas and that is definitely to be taken into consideration in terms of your
living arrangements. I see you enjoy listening to music so a nice pair of noise cancelling
headphones might be beneficial for you. In terms of your concerns with your animals, often times it
is difficult to find housing, in the city especially, that will allow animals living. I found when I
moved out that I had to leave my pets at home with my parents, as much as I love my animals, they do
tend to be expensive to care for. As for your nature walks, the amount of nature and the proximity
all depends on the area you're living. Though most places I've lived have hikes, or nature walks not
too far from the city. As for working while in college there are definitely people who do it.
Depending on your program some of them may allow you to do school part-time as well as working
part-time. This takes some learning for time-management. There are people I've met who do college
full-time during the day and work part-time a few evenings a week. One of the biggest things with
working while in school is to learn how to manage your time to avoid burn-out while maintaining your
GPA. Do you have anymore questions regarding moving to the city or anything regarding any of what
we've discussed so far? If you had a choice what type of housing do you think would be best for you
(i.e. townhouse, basement suite, college dorms, apartment etc.)? Research the different types of
housing in the area you're considering going to school and do a price comparison. LMentee

townhouse, basement suite, college dorms, apartment etc.)? Research the different types of housing

either living in an apartment, or having some roomates to split the cost with. As for my pets i
might have to lewave them behind but i will be very sad about it. If my apartment doesn't allow pets
i will get a turtle so that it is easy to hide. Dormitory: super single room (includes meal plan)

Thanks for the quick reply. Before we get started with your modules, I'd like us to start with a
little ice breaker. For this activity I'd like you to share a quote that resonates with you. This
could be from a movie, book, TV show, song, etc. Than we'll get started. You teacher has requested
that you and your fellow students complete the following 3 modules, as well as their extension

you'd like to start with :) LaurenMentee 2022-02-11, 12:37: I feel the need to do an icebreaker

cute. i just got your email so ill go from there now. i feel that there aren't any quotes that
resonate with me, i would like to start reading books. any suggestions? Ps, my name doesn't have a Y
in it :) -KaleeMentor 2022-02-11, 13:01: Hi Kalee, Apologies for the error. What kind of books do
you enjoy reading? I mostly read high fantasy in either the YA or NA category, though I do also read
some romance, and general YA. I can give some recommendations involving pirates, witches, fae,
dragons, greek mythology, etc. Joge is very cute. I've got a 2.5 year old rescue puppy names opie. I
love music, it was one of my hobbies growing up, though I don't tend to lean towards one specific
genre. I have two quote that I find resonate with me the most, both of which I actually have
tattooed. 1. ""One day at a time"" - This is one my mum says to my when I'm going through a rough time
2. ""To the stars who listen, and the dreams that are answered"" - I'm someone who struggles with some
mental health issues, and this is my favourite book quote from a series which got me through a rough
time. Please let me know which module you'd like to start with LaurenMentee 2022-02-15, 13:03: Hey
Lauren, I feel that if I did read books i would enjoy romance novels. I do think I might have a
favourite quote but its really just more of a saying and it's that ""life goes on"" meaning no matter
how bad life may seem or how many problems there are, life will still go on and we can all get
through it. I would like to start with From rural to urban. I have always dreamed of moving to the
city.Mentee 2022-02-17, 12:01: Hey Lauren, should we start with Rural to Urban?Mentor 2022-02-18,

discussion please watch the documentary above and answer the questions. Feel free to ask any
questions or concerns with me. LMentee 2022-02-28, 14:20: Hi Lauren :) here's the Part 2 for rural
to urban. What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the
relationship between living in the country and living in a city? I think that the director was
trying to communicate that it is very different from where humans started and it all changed so
fast. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? Not much from this
film related to me since I live in a small town and not much ever happens. But if anything, I
related that the way that they are moving up and life is changing so fast from their previous
lifestyle, it reminds me that I feel like I grew up really fast. How did you feel while watching the
video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? I felt like the
video put me in a rush and a bit stressed out. The filmaker Had sounds in the background that moved
around me and i felt as though I needed to get moving. In what ways does your emotional response to
the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for
post-secondary schooling? My emotional response does not match the film because i am rather excited
to move to the city and i would prefer it rather than my current lifestyle. The lady in the film
seemed sad to be there, that will not be me. KMentor 2022-03-02, 20:56: Hey Kalee, Good job on your
responses! Did you notice any similarities from the two different types of communities portrayed in
the film? Once completed with this I am goinmg to open the first extension activity 'Keeping
Traditions' unless there is anything else on this particular topic you'd like to discuss with me.
LMentor 2022-03-07, 11:55: Hey Kalee, Just following up. How've things been? Do you have any
questions? Thanks, LMentee 2022-03-09, 13:19: Hey Lauren, sorry i haven't been able to respond for a
while. I will finsh this activity: Did you notice any similarities from the two different types of
communities portrayed in the film? I didn't notice much similarities because both communities are
very different. One similarity i found is that in both communities there are hard working people.
There were many more differences. That's all for this activity we should start the next one. :)

you to answer, and once you have answered them we can talk about our own experiences with this
topic! If you also have any questions that you have thought of, please feel free to ask me! Talk
soon, my man! :)Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:11: Three things you like about living in a rural area. For
each, explain why you like it. The low traffic is nice because, there isn’t a rush hour, and it
doesn’t take very long to get from place to place I enjoy how close everything feels. for example,
how I can walk to most stores within 30 minutes How It feels like more of a community than town/city
Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. I don’t like how there is a lac
off events, for example concerts/music events, sports etc. How there is a lack of stores that deal
with specific needs. for example shoes, sports gear, and computer parts One question you have about
living or moving to the city what is the average price for a living space (condo, house, etc.) and
how hard is it to find oneMentor 2022-03-10, 19:16: Hi Justin! Thanks for getting to me back so
quickly as you must be super busy so I really appreciate it! I hope everything is going well for you
my man. You made some great points about living in a rural area. Being in a small town is so
community-like and it must be so nice to be surrounded by so many like-minded people, rather than
the big city life and the number of different people you bump into on a daily basis. The traffic and
commute from place to place I bet is the cherry on the top. I have to deal with so many annoying
drivers when I go to school or work, so it must be sick that you never really need to worry about
that! I do feel that though, the struggles of being a small community and having very few stores to
choose from for sports needs, shoes, or computers. I bet you would have to make the day trip out to
the city to do all of that, which is super time-consuming too! There are lots of pros and cons about
city and rural living, but it sounds like the community you belong to is a community that cares a
lot about you and all other young kids within it! Finding houses, condos, apartments in the lower
mainland isn't really difficult because everyone uses social media as a way to show off their
listings, like Facebook marketplace, craigslist, and other apps that are designed to find the home
best fit for you. Unfortunately, Justin, finding housing is not hard, but finding affordable ones is
becoming more difficult to find. In Vancouver, a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom condo/apartment would be
upwards of $2000 or more every month with everything included (internet, laundry, parking, hot
water). This is where you kind of got to spend some time playing around with these apps by finding
first, which city/area is best for you and how close it would be to your school or work. I hope that
answers your question, Justin. Please feel free to ask me any more questions about housing or these
apps that people use to find housing because Id love to help you out! If you do not have any more
questions or you feel like everything was answered, let me know which conversation you would like to
start next and we will go from there! Hope to hear from you soon man!Mentee 2022-04-20, 17:33: can

working on cars and trucks with my dad and it really is the best thing ever to see all the
engineering that goes into the making of these cars. I hope to hear from you soon Justin, so we can

living somewhere rural is its a nice close community. You see friendly and fammiliar faces
everywhere you go. Reason two, everything is whithin walking distance. Reason one I dont enjoy
living in a rural area is it is difficult and frustarting when you dont have acess to certain things
like a mall or stores. Reason two is it would be kind of nice to live somewhere where people dont
know you. Here everyone knows eachothers buisness. I have a couple questions about moving to a city.
Was it hard to find an affordable place to live? Should I apply for campus housing rather than look
for an appartment or sweet elsewhere? Can you afford to feed yourself and cover living cost with
money to spare ? and do you have time to work and go to school?Mentor 2022-03-07, 14:21: Hey Jonah,
My sincere apologies for the late reply, I was under the impression of having sent a response! I
agree with those aspects of living in a rural community, that feeling of closeness is something that
is really unique to smaller places. I also agree that sometimes this means you don't have access to
the diversity of resources you might be looking for. Regarding housing, I would say that really
depends on where you go for post-secondary education. Where I am, housing prices are quite high,
especially closer to campus. Direct-entry first year students are guaranteed residence for that
year, I believe, if they choose to live on campus and that comes with its associated fixed set of
costs. People do live off-campus, especially in upper years, but owing to the high prices you may
need to live with roommates. Ultimately, there is a wide range of factors to consider with
off-campus housing including rent, utilities, potential roommate issues, and transport, but it does
offers flexibility. On-campus housing, as I mentioned, should be guaranteed for direct first-year
entrants and is more set; housing in later years operates on an application system based on timing.
Regarding living costs and working, the time you have to work really depends on a variety of
factors. If you are being financially supported (family, loans etc.), that gives you a little more
breathing room. Taking an above-average course load, I was able to work part-time in different
positions around campus but it took a fair bit of time managemnt and the ability to do this really
again depends on your major, course load, and time management. It is also important to consider your
physical and mental health as you do this. Working a full-time job or close to that with a full
course load may be difficult, especially as you transition to university in your first year, and I
would encourage you to explore your options for financial support such as scholarships, provincial
funding etc. In all, handling living and housing costs solely from employment while entering first
year with no other support may require a fair bit of planning and diligence, but bursaries,
scholarships, provincial grants/loans etc, can help. Do let me know if you have any further
questions, we can move to the next part once they are addressed! EashanMentee 2022-03-09, 13:17: Hi!
it was really nice to read your response, I really enjoy your feedback to my questions. I belive I

pronounce your name?Mentor 2022-02-11, 15:20: Hey Jonah! I am also very much looking forward to
being your mentor! You can pronounce my name as ee-shawn. How is school going? Any courses you
particularly enjoy? I personally really like to play badminton and read, do you have any any hobbies
you like to do? If you'd like to share anything from the icebreaker prompts in the instructions
above this, I'd really like to hear that! Lastly, do you have any questions around the program and
how to go through it? If so, do let me know, I'll try my best to answer them. We can then move on to
the conversations. Look forward to hearing back! EashanMentee 2022-02-22, 13:37: Hi Eashan! My
apologies for the late response, i havent been at school in a couple of days to reply. My hobbies
are of very few things. I like to make jewlery, collect crystals and go for bike rides when im not
busy with school work or chores. I also enjoy cooking/baking. Currently in this semester I am taking
Pre calc 10, New media 10, Career 10 and Physical edgucation. I enjoy math the most. It is
challenging, but i enjoy solving problems. The acomplishments make me feel good. When I am older I
plan to be a diagnostic medical sonographer, and I will be applying at UBC, UVIC and BCIT. Thank you
for telling me how to pronounce your name. What do you enjoy most about being an adult and post
secoundary school. Do you have any wise words of advise?Mentor 2022-02-22, 16:50: Hey Jonah, No
worries at all! I really like biking and cooking/baking as well. Any favourite recipes? I lean
towards spicy and fruit-flavoured foods. I also like to collect rocks, any rocks or cyrstals you
like a lot? I think amethyst can really look spectacular. It's so great that you find math to be
rewarding and are making plans on what you want to explore after secondary school! We can certainly
discuss this further in our conversations. As to what I enjoy about being in my current position, I
would say it would tie into the ability to explore my interests in a professional and acedmic
context. I think we will have some great discussion on this once we head into the conversations! It
is my understanding that your teacher has asked we complete the Rural to Urban, Entering the job
market, and Paying for school conversations. Please let me know of which one you would like to start
with and we can proceed with that. As always, if you have any questions around the program itself,
please let me know. Thanks! EashanMentee 2022-02-23, 13:15: hi Eashan! I would be intrested in the
paying for school topic to get started :)Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:16: Actually scratch that! My teacher
wants us to start with the rural to urban",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-11, 17:52: Hey Jonah, I'm glad to hear that! For this second part (you can access by
clicking on the blue link at the bottom right of the page), please watch the video and take a moment
to think about what you saw. I thought it was really illustrative of the ways in which living in a
city can contrast with an urban lifestyle in terms of pace and priorities. In my experience, living
in a rural area meant having to do a wider range of things yourself, but also having more time to do
what you wish to in some ways. I'd be really curious to know what you thought. Did any of the themes
strike you as something you consider when thinking about possibly coming to a city for
post-secondary? Do let me know! EashanMentee 2022-03-30, 14:07: Hi! im back from spring break. I
watched the video and no i would not exepct any as something i would consider when moving to a
city.Mentor 2022-04-01, 20:28: Hey Jonah! Good to hear from you! How was spring break? Do anything
you would like to share? Regarding the video, I see. Have you thought in-depth about possibly moving
to a city to pursue post-secondary education? If so, what sort of thoughts and feelings have you had
around the topic? I remember you had some questions for me earlier, are you excited or worried about
anything in particular? I'd like to get a sense of your thoughts. EashanMentor 2022-04-07, 22:00:
Hey Jonah, Just wanted to follow up on my previous message, I hope it's going well. I would be quite
interested in knowing your thoughts around this topic. We can also soon move on to the next
conversation if that works well. Look forward to hearing back! EashanMentee 2022-04-12, 13:59: Hi! I
am prepared to move to either vancouver or victoria for schooling. I have my plan for post
secoundary planned out. i wish to go to school to be a diagnostic medical sonographer. I do worry i
wont be able to support myself, but hopefully thats not the case. My apologies for the late reponse,
i have been doing some other work in class. Since we last talked, i got a job at A&amp;W, i got a
nose peircing and went to my home town for a week of spring break to vist friends and family. I am

the article attached. Writing a resume is a very important task! This conversation talks a lot about
how to build your resume using transferable skills. Transferable skills are skills that you use both
in your daily life and would use in the workplace. Some examples include communication, team work,
and technology. Some of the transferable skills I used to find my first job were communication
skills, time management skills, organizational skills, and problem solving skills. Since so much of
the volunteering I do is with students/children I have gained all these skills from those
experineces. For example, I work with English language learners and newcomers to Canada. Recently,
at my job I had to problem solve because a student only knew a few words in English. So, I decided
to use Google translate so she could understand what I was saying and answer my questions using
Google translate on her phone. You may have noticed that the example I just gave you includes
communication skills as well. I knew to effectively communicate with the student I needed to use
Google translate to my advantage. I want you to think about your own skills and experineces! Have
you done any volunteering, been part of extracurricular activities, play on a sports team? Are you
part of any clubs at your school? After thinking about this I want you to think about any
experineces you have in each of the following skill areas: 1) Communication 2) Responsibility and
Dependability 3) Quick learner 4) Team Work 5) Technology I'll give you 2 examples from my own life!
For technology, I have been using Zoom over the past year to run after school programs with
students. I have learned all the different Zoom functions and how to use them to teach students. For
example, I use the screen share function to share PowerPoints with literacy activities for the
students. For team work, I could talk about how I was part of the Cure for Cancer Club in high
school. As a team, we raised money for cancer research and participated in community events to raise
awareness about cancer research and connect with cancer survivors. Now it's your turn! I look
forward to reading about your experineces in the skill areas! Let me know if you have any questions
or if something is unclear. GurkiratMentor 2022-02-21, 00:26: Hey Daniel, Thanks for sharing! It is
totally okay that you do not have experinece in formal settings. I'm glad to hear that you have
taken initiative in your foods class. I would highly recommend that you try volunteering at a soup
kitchen, sounds like lots of fun and seems to relate with your interests in baking and cooking. I
know gaining volunteer experince can be pretty difficult with COVID, but if you ever have some free
time on your hands you should try to reach out to a soup kitchen or other organization to volunteer
so you can put those on your resume. What were some of your experineces at summer camp? You listed
so many great qualities. Can you think of a time you were at summer camp and were a good probelm
solver, good at following instructions, or working with others (teamwork)? If you can these can be
listed in your resume! The experinece you have in your foods classes can be put on your resume as
well. For example you could write ""Foods 8 and 9"" on your resume and list some of the skills you
gained from the experinece or tasks that you did. For example, you could say you ""communicated with
my peers to delegate tasks for the receipe/baking process."" What are some other tasks you have done
in foods class? How have you acted as a leader or taken initiative? You can write about your
experinece using PowerPoint in your resume. Plus, if you like debate, you may be interested in
joining debate club if your school has one! Once you answer these questions I will help you with
narrowing down what should go on your resume and then you will be able to write your own for the
extension activity. Talk to you soon! GurkiratMentor 2022-02-27, 13:26: Hi Daniel, Just wanted to
check in again! Have you had the chance to answer the questions I commented last week? Also, have
you had the chance to look into the extension activity - writing your own resume? Hope to hear from
you soon! GurkiratMentor 2022-03-03, 13:34: Hey Daniel, That's great to hear that you helped out
with yard work and house chores. We can defintely put this on your resume. It could look something
like this: Yardworker/House Chores (next to this would go the year you worked on this - e.g., June
2020-August 2020) Then you want to list out the tasks you completed, so it would look something like
this... Painted fences Cleaned gardens to ensure plants and (insert here whatever else was growing
in the garden) were growing properly and nourished Cleaned and prepared a gross basement for
renovations Try to be as specific as possible! Another entry in your resume could be... Foods Team
Lead (put year and date next to this) Took initiative in foods class by leading my group members
through multiple recipes Help my classmates execute recipes by providing guidance and instructions
Feel free to add anything else necessary! Finally, I wanted to let you know that you can highlight
your skills at the beginning of your resume. So you can have a heading titled ""Highlights"" and list
them. So, it would look something like this... Highlights Learned to be a good helper by helping
with yard work such as painting fences and taking care of a garden Learned problem solving skills by
working with classmates on recipes in foods class Learned communication skills by ... (insert an
example here) Let me know if anything is confusing! After you give me the all clear, we will move
onto the next section of the job market section and then the extension activities. You will get to
make your own resume soon! -GurkiratMentee 2022-03-03, 14:15: Hi Gurkiat (: thank you for the

doing arts and crafts with students at work, and watching TV. I noticed that we have some interests
in common! What genres of music do you like listening to? What kinds of pastries do you like baking?
What's you favourite subject in school? Feel free to tell me anything you’d like or ask any
questions you may have about the program or general questions. Talk to you soon! 😊Mentee 2022-02-11,
12:46: Hi Gukirat (: I am looking forward to having you as my mentor. I love baking anything i can
make. Last night i made orange cookies because they're easy and really yummy. Mainly i bake muffins,
cookies, cakes with my mom, or stuff in foods class at school. i like making bread but it always has
a certian taste. i should work on that. I also really need to learn to make cinnamon buns. they are
my favourite and i made them so easily at school but i made them at home once and it was a disaster.
i also want to know how to make pie. What do you like baking? do you cook at all? my favourite
subject in school is foods because there isn't any actual work and it's so fun to make stuff but if
you don't have a good group then it sucks because you have to cook/bake with a bunch of idiots. I
also enjoy english and socials studies. Spotify says my top genres are hiphop, indie, rock and pop.
My favourite artists right now are Kanye West, Puzzle, The Garden, Machine Girl, but mainly i listen
to playlists with a bunch of arists i might not know rather than just one person's music. I'm glad
we have some of the same interests (: I love nature walks, they really are meditative. What kind of
arts and crafts do you do with your students? Also, I do not understand what this program is. Our
teacher explains things very vaugely so i don't really get what is the actual point or goal of this
program is but i like the idea of it.Mentor 2022-02-13, 01:43: Hey Daniel, Thanks for sharing! The
orange cookies sound really delicious! You bake tons of great pastries. For myself, I love baking
brownies, cookies, muffins, blondies, and cupcakes. My sister can't eat wheat/gluten. So most of the
time I'll make her gluten free treats or use flourless receipes. My favourite subjects in high
school were English and Social Studies, very similar to you haha. I did not really like Math and
Science. I also listen to Kanye West, Donda was a great album. To answer your question, I do lots of
arts and crafts with my students. They are usually themed to holidays like Halloween and Christmas
arts and crafts. On Halloween we made ghosts, pumpkins, and bats. And before winter break we made 3D
snowflakes. This program is a way for you to explore some possibilites for your future after high
school. We are going to go through some Conversations that will help you think about what you would
like to do after graduation. Your teacher let me know that you must complete the following
Conversations: From Rural to Urban, Entering the Job Market, and Paying for School. You may have
noticed a giant circle/wheel with these topics/conversations. All you have to do is let me know
which one you want to start with and I will unlock it for you! You can choose between Rural to
Urban, Entering the Job Market, or Paying for School. Which one would you like to do first? Looking
forward to hearing from you! :)Mentee 2022-02-15, 13:13: Hi Gurkirat The things you bake sound
really cool. oranges cookies are super easy so if you would want to make them just look up orange
cookies and theres a bunch of good recipes. I would like to open Entering the Job Market please (: i
don't really care what order we do them in.Mentee 2022-02-17, 12:54: Hi Gurkirat (: I have not done
anything! I was going to voulenteer at a soup house on christmas but they ended up having enough
voulenteers so i was unable to. I'm not in extracurricular activities either. I'm not really sure
what transferable skills i have. I think i would be a good problem solver in the workplace but i'm
not certian. I'm good with communicating, i'm good with helping, good at debate, thinking
creatively, i'm pretty sure i'm a good instructor in topics i understand well, i am patient, i'm a
great helper, good listener, good at adapting, following instructions, and working with others. I am
friendly and helpful. But i don't think i have one specific skill although i really am good with
people i think. I say i think because i don't really have experience in formal settings, i only
really get involved with others at school or in summer camps when i was younger. I have experience
with teamwork in my foods classes at school in grade 8&amp;9 and i have one right now, i plan to
take foods grade 11 and 12 as well. This is also experience communicating because i have to talk
with everyone to determine who is doing what and what our preferences are. In gym i also have
experience with teamwork. I have been a team leader/taken initiative in strategic games and i make
the most out of activities i really dislike or when working with people i dislike. I am good with
making a plan within groups that works for team members. In Humanities 8 we had a small debate unit
which i did well in, i am good with arguing and making a clear point. I would say i am a quick
learner but i do get confused easily with things that have numbers or any mathematics that are more
difficult. I don't really have experience with technology that isn't just using my phone or a
computer, or using apps like powerpoint and word or whatever i need to use for school. I would say i
am responsibe and dependable. Sometimes i am not as responsible as i should be but i am aware of it
when it happens. i make sure to do my part if i'm working on something with others. I keep my word
and promises to friends to do something or keep a secret. I know to track how i work to ensure i
don't fall behind or end up not doing something or running out of time. I do apologise if these
aren't really useful statements. i have absolutely no experience in a real workplace or stuff like
that and i don't really know what i'm good at or what skills i have since at school we do pretty
much the same stuff always, i don't really get to try new stuff most of the time.Mentee 2022-03-02,
14:05: Hi Gurkirat (: I thought i replied last week but maybe it didn't post because i know i wrote
a response, sorry for the delay. I don't remember summer camp well at all so i actually shoudn't
have mentioned it. I have taken initiative in foods class by leading my group though a recipe many
times, and i always try my best to be a good help for my group members. my school does have a debate
team but i don't think i would really enjoy it because i don't have any friends in it and i probably
wouldn't want to go to the competitions (optional). i don't think i have much experience at all that
can be put on a resume, but i did help out my friend and her mom to do yardwork and house chores in
the summer recently to have her mother as a reference on my resume. i helped paint fences, clean the
garden and clean/prep a gross basement for renovations. i know i am a good helper, good problem
solver, good at learning and following directions, and i am pretty good with people.Mentee
2022-03-02, 14:11: Also i haven't read the extension activity, i think it's locked my teacher says

there i can enter the extension but i don't know how to be able to read it",,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-06, 15:00: Hey Daniel, Let me know if you have any questions about the video you had
to watch in this section. In the mean time, I will tell you about both a good and bad interview I
had. I'll start with the bad one so we can end off on a positive note. For this interview, I was
still in high school. I think I was in grade 11 or 12. At this point of my life, I was not too sure
about myself. I walked into that interview with only a little bit of experinece with school clubs
and volunteering. Plus, my experineces did not link well to the job description. During the
interview, the interviewer seemed uninterested in anything I had to say and it felt rushed which was
off putting. Even though I had practiced answering some basic interview questions, there were some
questions I was uncertain about how to answer. My interviewer gave me some time to discuss my
interests but again seemed uninterested in what I was saying. Overall, what I remember from that
interview was that it did not go as well as I wanted it to. I needed to have more self-confidence
and have practiced interview questions better in advance. PS. this was for a job in retail.
Alrighty, let's move onto the best interview I ever had haha. This interview was last year and I
applied for an after-school tutoring job. At this point in my life, I had tons of experience
volunteering and working with students. I had so many stories about the positves of working with
kids and the challenges that come along too. I had prepared well in advance. I learned about the
company using their website so I could show off that I knew about the core values of the company.
One of the values of the company is building meaningful relationships with newcomers to Canada. So,
I shared my own experiences with working with English language learners and newcomers to Canada
during the interview. This was a group interview. So, I ensured that I answered questions first
before anyone else did to show that I was a quick thinker. At the end of the interview, we were
asked a question about what tutors should bring to the workplace. I answered by saying a positive
attitude and high energy. The interviewers really liked my answer and the others being interviewed
used my answer in theirs as well, saying they agreed with me. Some tips I would give you are... Be
confident - prepare well in advance using interview questions online Talk about your experineces and
how they will transfer in the workplace Learn about the company you are applying to and show your
interviewer that you have researched about them and know what they do and their values Let me know
if you have any questions Daniel! Talk soon :)Mentor 2022-03-22, 18:56: Hi Daniel, I know it is
spring break so I am guessing that my message won't reach you until you are back in class. I hope
you are having/had a wonderful 2 weeks off! And when you are ready, have a read through this section
on interviews and you can read some of my experineces with interviews as well which I have already
posted for you. Talk soon!Mentee 2022-03-28, 13:47: Hi Gurkirat (: Sorry for not doing anything over
break, i meant to but of course i did not. I can't watch the video today because i forgot my
headphones, but i wil watch it tomorrow. Hope you are well (:Mentor 2022-04-01, 11:46: Sounds good
Daniel! I look forward to reading your response to this section :)Mentor 2022-04-05, 13:54: Hey
Daniel, I know the program can get quite confusing sometimes. I am going to share my own interview
experinences with you. But also let me know if you have ever been interviewed. How was that like? If
not, how do you feel about interviews? Nervous or excited? Here are two of my interview experineces.
Once you have read them and commented we can start the extension activities! I'll start with the bad
one so we can end off on a positive note. For this interview, I was still in high school. I think I

topic - let me know when you've read the anchor text. There's three questions at the bottom that
I'll just re-list here in the chat for you to answer in your response: Three things you like about
living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. Two things you don’t like and, again,
explain your reasons for each. One question you have about living or moving to the city If you have
any other thoughts or reflections, I'm happy to talk about those too! Looking forward to hearing

gonna be really honest i have no idea whats going onMentor 2022-04-04, 21:31: Hey Damian, No worries
at all, I know it's been a while since we last talked. I'm going to copy the message I sent before
Spring Break, it might help make things a bit more clear: ""There's three questions at the bottom
that I'll just re-list here in the chat for you to answer in your response: Three things you like
about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. Two things you don’t like and,
again, explain your reasons for each. One question you have about living or moving to the city If

hearing back."" Cheers, DamonMentor 2022-04-19, 20:32: Hey Damian, Hope life has been good since we
last spoke! I realize that my last message might've been a lot to go through at once so I propose we
go through this module one question a time, together. The first question is: ""Three things you like
about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it"" I grew up in Aldergrove, BC, which
is a small suburban community in the Lower Mainland. Since graduating high school, I moved to
Vancouver where I spent the last ~8 years as a student at UBC. So it's pretty safe to say that I
have minimal experience living in a rural area. However, I did have the chance to live in Williams
Lake and Fraser Lake, each for a month, during rural electives that I did in medical school. The
first thing I liked about these communities is how tight-knit and friendly the residents were. For
example, pretty soon after moving to Fraser Lake the grocery clerks and gym staff in the local plaza
all got to know me on a first-name basis and made me feel welcomed. The second thing that I liked
about living in these rural communities was the close proximity to nature. I went on beautiful hikes
and spent lots of time outdoors, which was really refreshing compared to living in the hustle and
bustle of downtown Vancouver. Lastly, another thing that I enjoyed was pace of the communities.
Things moved at a slower pace, it felt like people weren't always rushing around like they tend to
do in bigger cities. Anyways, I hope that helped spark some curiosity for you. Looking forward to
hearing your thoughts and opinions! Cheers, Damon",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 15:12: Hey Damian! How's it going? My name is Damon (sometimes gets mistaken for
Damian!) and I'm a medical student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I'm currently
in the process of graduating and transitioning to residency in Internal Medicine. I'm excited to be
your mentor for your Career Life Education class! I'm an open book so any questions you might have
as you look to transition from high school to whatever is next after graduation, I would be happy to
try to answer. I'm hoping to be a resource for you by sharing my own journey from high school to
today. In the spirit of getting to know each other, I'd love to hear about what subjects you enjoy
at school, what your plans are after graduation, and also what kind of hobbies you're into. I hope
to hear from you soon! Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-02-15, 17:10: hey there Damon i see you rip up puck
i do as well. i also see you ref hockey me too seems like we have alot in common i live in a urban
town called Port alberni BC Port alberni isnt the best place to grow up. there is alot of homless
people on the side of the road shooting up doing drugsMentee 2022-02-15, 17:17: to be honest i dont
really any plans to go to post secondary unless its for hockey. my dream job is to or be a welder i
have been intressted in welding for awhile nowMentor 2022-02-17, 00:20: Hey Damian, I play in an
adult league with a bunch of guys from my class, it's always the highlight of my week! I used to
play organized hockey when I was younger and stopped playing after high school. I wasn't nearly good
enough to get a scholarship, but it sounds like you're really into hockey. Have you looked into
pursuing it for post-secondary? Is there an application process for it, or is mostly recruiting? I'm
sorry to hear that Port Alberni has been tough growing up for you. It sounds like you're a mature
guy by the way you talk about it though - if you ever want to talk about it more and the things you
see there I'm happy to listen. What interests you in welding? That's a great career choice - always
in demand, shorter time to get certified and join the workforce, and it pays well. Have you looked
into what it takes to become a welder in terms of post-secondary education and training? Looking
forward to hearing from you. Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-03-02, 17:08: hey damon sorry for the late
response ive been super busy with stuff.its nice to hear we have stuff in common and sorry i didint
mean to say i lived in a urban town i acatualy live in a rural town and no i havent looked into post
seceondary for hockey i just had tryouts for tier 1. i think what intrests me in welding is seeing
the finished project it is very satisfying welding as well.Mentor 2022-03-05, 21:07: Hey Damian, No
worries at all! We all get busy from time to time. I see! Yeah it must be nice to take a step back
and see the finished product after all that hard work. I wonder if we should start one the
conversation topics that your teacher wanted us to cover. How about I list the three topics and you
pick which one to start with? They are: 1. ""From Rural to Urban"" 2. ""Entering the Job Market"" 3.
""Paying for School"" Excited to jump into these topics with you. Looking forward to hearing back.

1047549914,1047554036,2/9/2022 17:43,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-15, 22:42: There are nursing programs everywhere in BC, so there are many options
available! Do you have a number one choice of school? Let's start with paying for school, as it's
one of your class requirements! Are you working while going to school right now?Mentee 2022-02-17,
11:57: I'm thinking of going to a school on Vancouver Island such as UVic or VIU. I have a part time
job right now as a cashier at a drugstore.Mentee 2022-02-17, 12:34: Some questions I still have
about finances and paying for school.... - Is it difficult to find a job in a new place? - Do you
have a job? - How do you balance school and a job? - How many scholarships should I apply for? - How
much should I save for university? - Is living on your own more expensive than you thought?Mentor
2022-02-18, 00:35: I have a friend that goes to UVic (not for nursing) and she loves how much there
is to do outside of school! I've heard their nursing program is great! As for your questions, here's
what I think: - There are jobs available everywhere, many pharmacies hire students to work at the
cashier, and there's always new places (like local stores specific to that area) to work in new
cities! There's different opportunities everywhere! - I do have a job, I'm working as an LPN (I took
the course before I went into the RN program), I am working casually on a medical floor. I haven't
worked many shifts during third year because the schooling is heavy, but I worked a lot in second
year! My friend worked at starbucks during her first year of nursing! - I only pick up shifts at the
hospital when I feel like I have time, like before and after exams are scheduled. My friend who
worked at starbucks worked evening shifts after school or day shifts when she didn't have classes.
Having your schedule organized (writing all the due dates for papers/assignments/exams) can really
help because then you can plan to be really busy at certain times, and you know what to expect! - I
applied to every scholarship/bursary that was applicable to me. Even some of them that weren't
applicable ended up having no one else apply for them, so I got them! There's no limit, and there
are so many scholarships/bursaries out there. I would apply for the ones at your school, and then
after you get accepted there are ones that the university has too! Apply for them every year in
university! There are so many! - I tried to save as much as I could for university, but I had to pay
for rent/car/groceries before going into school. I applied for student loans, which is how I am
funding my schooling. If you work rurally, the government pays back your student loan, I think it's
20% every 1 year you work? There's a list of rural cities on the government website called student
loan forgiveness. - Living on my own is what I expected it to be, I had three roommates during my
first two years of university which helped me with rent cost. You can often find facebook pages for
roommates that go to your university. I try to have a budget for groceries, spending money, and gas.
School is honestly more expensive than I thought it would be (classess, especially practicum courses
are expensive), but the student loan takes that into account and I manage just fine with the amount
they give me.Mentor 2022-02-18, 00:40: You have really great questions! I hope people from UVic come
to your school or have a presentation for you to talk about their programs, school, and campus
because it's super helpful! You can usually see how much the nursing program costs at each
university on their website, they usually break it down to say how much each year costs. my tip: try
to find used textbooks on facebook pages for your school (like UBCO Books buy and sell), you will
save lots of money! new textbooks are crazy expensive! Nursing usually uses the same ones over the
years, they sometimes come out with a new edition, which means they ""changed the page numbers"" but
if you ask your professors for their old reading lists, they will give you them if you have the last
edition of the textbook! It's ok to not always have the newest edition if your professor says it's
ok! I have many older editions and have good grades!Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:30: Awesome. thank you for
answering all of my questions, it's definitly helpful to get advice from someone who is currently in
university. Are we supposed to open a new conversation?Mentee 2022-02-22, 13:58: Thank you! My
brother is graduating this year, and is thinking of going to VIU or UVic as well. I have a few
cousins in university right now, but they're all in Ontario. I'll start on the new conversation
now!Mentor 2022-02-27, 22:01: Hey Claire! Hope you had a good weekend! Which part are you working on
now?Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:13: Hey! I'm working on the scholarship application extension activity.
I'm done the budgeting one but not sure how to submit it. Do you need to see it or my teacher?Mentor
2022-02-28, 18:55: I don't think I need to see it, I'm not sure about your teacher. How was planning
a budget for school? Were you able to get a good idea on how much school costs? There are ways you
can save money in school like buying textbooks used!Mentor 2022-02-28, 19:10: Thank you!",,"Mentor 2022-03-03, 21:40: Hi Claire! I've opened the studying conversation because I think it might
give you a better idea on how to prepare for studying at a university level! I found the transition
from high school to university difficult because I didn't know what to expect, or how to study
properly. In high school in classes like biology, I found it relatively straightforward so I was a
bit lost in classes like psychology and anatomy in university because they were tough courses! Have
you found a studying technique that works best for you? If you have, that's great because it's so
helpful! If not, I hope this conversation will benefit you, and let me know if you have questions! I
will be at the hospital for clinical tomorrow and Friday, so I'll answer your chat in the
evenings!Mentee 2022-03-09, 13:27: What does it mean to study something? I think that studying means
to prepare for a quiz or test and go over the things you need to know for the test. What do you do
when you study? For math, I do the practice questions from my textbook or go over my notes. For
science, I like to use flashcards and re-write my notes to memorize the content. For social studies,
I will look over my notes and textbook, and sometimes do practice questions from my teacher. Have
you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those
skills? I've tried the spaced-out study method, and I found it did work, but sometimes a little bit
of cramming is useful the day before the test. I have also tried the interleaving method, which I
like, because if I feel overwhelmed, I find it helpful to switch subjects to give my brain a bit of
a break. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. The method of retrieval
practice seems to be the most useful to me as I’ve done this, and I found that laying out everything
I know is helpful. Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be
the case I think the most challenging for me would be elaboration because I’ve found that using my
textbook to explain things can be difficult as textbooks often use confusing wording and its not
always easy to find what you’re looking for. How likely is it that you will try some or all these
strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? I
will try these strategies the next time I need to study for something. What have you been previously
taught about how to study? I’ve been taught to use flash cards and how to memorize things.Mentor
2022-03-10, 14:17: Hey Claire! I think flashcards are a great tool to use when studying! I think
that you'll use them especially for classes like pharmacology, Anatomy &amp; physiology, and
psychology if you take it!Mentor 2022-03-31, 16:02: Hi Claire! Good to hear from you! How was your
spring break? I don't see the document you uploaded but I think it's your teacher who needs to see
it! Thanks for trying to send it to me though! Were you surprised at the budget or did you have a
good idea of how much things cost? Did you want me to open the next thing up?Mentee 2022-04-06,
13:17: Hi Sakura! I've saved my study habits tracking extension activity into my portfolio. Can we
start the last conversation?Mentee 2022-04-07, 13:54: Hey! Can we do well being and self care?",,,,"Mentor 2022-04-09, 13:54: Hey Claire! I've opened Self Care for you! In high school I didn't realize
how important self care was, and how important it would be in university! Do you have any self care
rituals or know of some that you would do in university?Mentee 2022-04-12, 14:01: How easy is it for
you to think about self care as something important? I think that self care is very important. What
role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? I find that for me to actually do
self care, i need to find a good time to do it and plan it out, Do you have people in your life who
encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves?
How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life? My mom is really into face masks
and doing her nails, so I often steal her stuff and have a self care night. What are some signs you
have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself? When I
start to get really anxious, I don't sleep well, i dont eat well and i start to break out a lot. How
good are you at taking care of the basics of self care: Getting adequate sleep? I almost always get
8 hours of sleep Eating healthy food? I could do better at this but I do eat fairly healthy Drinking
water? I drink a lot of water ( probaby 7 cups per day) Regular physical activity? I'm very active
and do lots of sports so I'm constantly doing physical activityMentor 2022-04-12, 17:00: Hey Claire!
That's great that you have an idea on what self means to you. In university I find it easy to feel
overwhelmed and get stressed, so I have to plan out times for self care too. You have some great
points!Mentor 2022-04-19, 21:17: Hi Claire! I hope you had a great long weekend! :) Do you have any
more questions about university or life after high school? Did you want me to close this
conversation and open another one? Hope all is well for you!",,"Mentee 2022-02-11, 12:16: Hi Sakura! I noticed that you go to UNBC, and I used to live in Smithers,
which is close to Prince George. I know a few people in the nursing program at UNBC. I like paddle
borading too!Mentor 2022-02-11, 15:28: Hi Claire! I've never been to Smithers before, but hope to go
there this summer! I've only lived in Prince George for 2 years now! How long have you lived in
Northern BC for? I see that you'd like to go into nursing! I think it's a great choice! Do you think
you will come back to the north after high school? Which conversation do you want to start
with?Mentee 2022-02-15, 12:07: I lived in Smithers for about 9 years. It's definitly beautiful there
and I miss it a lot. I've heard lots about how good the nursing program is at UNBC but I'm not sure
if I would want to move back. I'm not totally sure how the conversations work so I don't really care
what we do.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-22, 13:54: Hi! I've opened part 2! Let me know whenever you'd like a new conversation
opened :) I'm glad that it helped, I find that talking to people in university really helped when I
was in high school too! Do you have siblings or friends in university?Mentor 2022-02-22, 14:01:
Hopefully he includes you in the process of applying for school! I haven't applied to VIU
before,hopefully the process is simple! Thanks Claire! Do you know about the pre-reqs for
nursing?Mentee 2022-02-22, 14:03: I've read over the new material and I have few new questions: Is
it difficult to apply for scholarships? (What do you typically have to do?) I also have a few
questions about pre requisites for nursing programs. My parents and I have looked at VIU and UVics
pamphlets, but the pre reqs are slightly different for each school.Mentor 2022-02-22, 14:16:
Scholarships usually have instructions on what they require, like a reference letter, an essay, or a
resume with your volunteer or work experience. Some scholarships don't require anything too. The
hardest part of applying for them myself was finding all of them! There were so many that it was
hard to read all their requirements to see if I qualify for it. but you can get multiple of
themespecially out of highschool which is great! Each nursing program has different requirements,
when I applied to UBC-O and UNBC, they were different. I would recommend taking BIO 11+12, Chem 11 +
12, Pre Cal 12 as they are usually the ones that schools require, but if you want to go to VIU/UVIC
I would focus on their pre-reqs.Mentor 2022-02-23, 13:28: You are very welcome! let me know when you
are ready for the next conversation! :)",,"Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:17: Mentee 2022-03-31, 14:19: I just sent my past week of study habits. I
tried saving it to my portfolio but im not sure if it worked. Also, i completed the budget and
paying for school thing but im not sure how you would like me to submit it. I did it on the printed
plan i was told to use so I only have a paper copy. I have pictures of it, but I'm not sure the best
way for you to see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-22, 14:30: Ok thank you! Those were the courses I was planning on taking anyways so
thats perfect.Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:51: Ok so I've looked at the extension activities and it's
really confusing. I started looking into doing the budget one but there are so many ifferent pieces
and my teacher doesn't know either. I'm not sure about how I'm supposed to do it and the
instructions arent very clear.Mentor 2022-02-23, 14:03: We could just focus ont he budget planner?
This could help you see how much everything costs and you could see how much you could save for
school. I think you have to print out or save the budget planner from the government website and
then see how much everything really costs. VIU or UVic should have information on how much each
semester of school and dorms cost. For groceries I typically spend around $150-200 a month (just for
myself), I don't really go out for coffee and get dinner once every two weeks. Bus passess are often
included in tuition for all students, and paring passes for school are typically very expensive. At
UBCO it was over $600..Mentee 2022-02-23, 14:15: Thank you for the help! My teacher hasn't been very
good at explaining it so I appreciate it. I'l get started on the budget right now.Mentor 2022-02-23,

I was hoping you could answer. 1. What are three things you like about living in a rural city? and
why? 2. What are two things you don't like and why? 3. One question about moving or living to the
city you were curious about that you would like to ask Once you reply, I will let you know by
answering the same questions what it's like living in a larger city! Talk to you soon, AustinMentor

back from spring break!Mentor 2022-04-13, 17:03: I miss talking to you! I was so glad that we were
able to chat with each other earlier. I hope you enjoyed you break. We all need time to decompress
and relax :). What are some things that you did while off? I am just curious to know how you are and
how everything is going. I opened the conversation from ""Rural to urban"" before the break so that we
could chat there. I hope to hear back from you soon!Mentee 2022-04-19, 14:06: heyyy, long time no
see, ive been very ill and havent been able to go to school so i havent been able to reach you, my
break was very great i just kinda hung out with friends and chilled at home. how about you?Mentor
2022-04-19, 18:55: Hi Breelin, it really great to hear back from you! Hopefully your feeling much
better, we gotta take care of ourselves especially now. Undergraduate students don't really get a
""spring break"" its called reading break and it's one week in February sometime. But, I'm done school
now and just about to start working as a Nurse which is exciting! I'm curious about some things that
you've done in the past weeks since we talked so I was wondering if I could ask you some questions?
What are some hings you like about living in a rural city? and why? What are two things you don't
like and why? Hope to hear back from you soon! Austin",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-09, 18:59: Hi Breelin! It's nice to meet you, I'm Austin. Im in my last few weeks of
nursing school before I become a registered nurse. I like spending my time outdoors and I love my
summers because I can go hiking, camping, biking, swimming and have BBQ's. The days are sunnier and
longer which I like as well. Like you, I went into healthcare because I liked helping other people
in my life. I saw on your profile that you would like to become a nurse or a dietician. I think
those are great career choices to have! If you have any questions about what university/college life
is like or what nursing is like please dont be afraid to ask! Lastly, if you look at the
conversation topic wheel above, there are different things we can talk about. Message me the topics
you find most interesting and we will go through them one at a time. I hope you and your family are
doing well amidst the current pandemic. I hope to hear from you soon! AustinMentee 2022-02-11,
12:19: hi my name is bree, how are you doing? i was wondering how you are finding living on your
own? and gow are you able to balence hanging out with your friends and familing with school?Mentor
2022-02-14, 18:26: Hey Bree, I am doing good! Living on my own is great because you have the
independance to do what you want when you want. You can have friends over whenever which is cool as
well. But, sometimes you do miss living at home. There are upsides and downsides to moving out but
it definately is a great experience to have. You have to be more disciplined because nobody is going
to cook or clean for you. In term of balancing time, it isn't too difficult to have time off. The
important thing is to schedule things and do things in advance. I found that highschool its easier
to get away with procrastinating. Once you get into college/university it's much harder because they
teach at a faster pace. So, I encourage you to do a little everyday! If you keep up with the work,
you will have lots of time to see friends and family. There are times when you can hang with friends
in between classes as well as after so you dont need to worry about sacrificing your personal life.
Just make sure to work hard and you will be golden.Mentee 2022-02-17, 11:52: wow this is all such
amazing information.its really cool having someone to connect with who is in collage and being able
to ask questions. its great how you can manage haning out with friends and family and with school,
thats a big part for me because im a very social person. i hope when im in collage i can manage my
time well enough to be able to do that. is any secduals that your on? or how do you manage your
time. i cant wait to have that independance to be ableto live on my own and have my own
resposibilites. can you unlock the From Rual to Urban section.Mentor 2022-02-19, 13:18: Im glad I
could help you out! I'm sure you will be able to find your own rhythm and be able to balance school
and a social life. I like hanging out and I am also very social so if I can do it, Im sure you can
as well. In terms of schedules, it's important that you do things daily and prevent yourself from
procrastinating. In college, nobody is going to force you to do the work, the professors will not
come after you, and if you live away from home, your parents will not be telling you what to do. So,
it is important to be disciplined and set a time aside for work and a time to play. For me, I like
getting things donr early so I always write out my assignments schedules for all my classess and
start earlier rather than later and start crossing them off. There is definately satisfaction coming
from when you can cross of an assignement or a test on the schedule that you make. I will unlock the
rural to urban section and we can continue the conversation there!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and I am student at UVic (Univeristy of Victoria). I am in my third year, and I am studying
psychology. I heard that you are in Port Alberni which is so cool because my mom grew up and went to
high school there! She made a lot of great friends during her time there that she still stays in
touch with today :) How do you like it there? I see you like being outdoors, so I imagine it's a
great place for that! How has your 10th grade year been going so far? I am curious what your
favourite classes are. Feel free to ask any questions that you might have for me, and I look forward
to hearing from you soon!Mentee 2022-02-15, 16:41: Hi Rachel port Alberni is not the best place for
kids to grow up there are lots of people who are in poverty and use the little money they have to
buy drugs. Roger creek separates port Alberni into 2 sides one side is full of drugs and people in
poverty and the other side has more successful people and is a more environmentally pleasing place.
My grade 10 year hasn't been going the best it could be I almost failed socials but within the last
2 weeks i got my grade up to a passing mark. I would say my favorite class is english new media. Did
you feel presured into collageMentor 2022-02-15, 23:06: Hi Brandt, I am sorry to hear about what it
is like there! I wonder if it was separated like that when my mom grew up there. I will have to ask
her. Does it make you want to move away when you are finished high school? That's great that you've
been able to bring up your socials grade. I knew lots of students when I was in highschool who
almost, or actually did, fail a class. Many of them went on to do well in the following years and
even in post-seccondary education. What's english new media like? I haven't heard of a class like
that before. I defintely did have some pressure to attend college/university from my parents and
friends. I also felt like if I didn't go for a while, I would fall behind my age group, so I think I
put some pressure on myself too. I remember coming to the second semester of grade 12 and feeling
very unsure of what I should do. Previously I had thought about going to Vancouver for school, but
once I got to the end of high school, I was so burnt out from all the school work that I didn't feel
very motivated to apply to university. Eventually I decided to apply to UVic just incase I decided
to go, and once I was accepted, I decided just to go and see what it would be like. Looking back I
am very glad that I did so because it really changed my life for the better. I made new friends who
I really liked and eventually found classes that I was interested in and inspiried by. Now I really
love going to UVic and could not imagine what my life would look like if I wouldn't have gone.
Almost everyone I know who has gone to college or university ended up really enjoying it. Do you
feel like people are pressuring you to apply to colleges?Mentee 2022-03-30, 17:59: Hi rachel sorry
ive been really stressed out and had a lot of stuff ive been doing for my future. New media focus
more on online with fake vs real news and is mainly about internet and how to use it to its full
extent My mom doesn’t give me a choice she says im going to university no matter what which im ok
with because I want to see what I can do with my golfing career and I would like to do something
with my lifeMentor 2022-04-01, 20:33: No need to apologize about taking a while to respond. I know
as we approach the end of the school year, it can be a busy and stressful time. Well, I think that
sounds like a good plan! I don't know anyone who attended post-secondary education and regretted it,
even if they didn't really want to go at first. It's been great getting to know you so far! Feel
free to ask me any more questions you might have for me as we continue through this program. I know
your teacher assigned From Rural to Urban (plus extension activities), Entering the job market (plus
extension activities), and Paying for school (plus extension activities). Is there any particular
activity (of these three) that you would like to start with? Let me know and I will unlock it so we
can start working through it.Mentee 2022-04-20, 17:56: the rural to urban one please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saying that we've completed the program. You probably got one too. Apparently I can't undo it but we

week and we can get started on it.Mentor 2022-02-22, 13:33: Hey Branden, I double messed up. I am
mentoring someone else from another school right now and they are required to do the Finding
Inspiration conversation but you aren't. I think this conversation will stay open in case you want
to discuss here, but the first one on the list for your class is From Rural to Urban, so I'm going
to unlock tht one. now. Hope you had a good long weekend!Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:47: Hey Trevor, sorry
for taking a while to respond I didn't finish my response on Thursday in class, hope you had a good
long weekend too! That's really cool how you have traveled all over the world. I definitely want to
travel once I'm out of university or even maybe before. I would really like to go to Japan I've
wanted to ever since I was younger. My dad traveled a lot when he was younger he also traveled to
Fiji and Australia, he said it was really cool to experience different parts of the world. He wants
me to also travel the world so I can get to experience different cultures as he did. I think that is
one of the biggest reasons I would like to travel to Japan because the culture is very different
from ours. All good about the conversation rural to urban thing I totally didn't realize there were
questions and things I was supposed to say until you and my teacher mentioned it to me lol. Three
things I like about living in a rural area are probably the privacy, not much traffic, and nature.
Honestly, Port Alberni isn't that rural but there are definitely countryside parts to it. I feel
there is more privacy because everyone mostly lives in their own house instead of apartments and
stuff. The traffic isn't that bad here during this time of the year but during summertime, there is
tons of traffic mostly people going to Tofino and Ukee. Port Alberni is surrounded by lots of
beautiful places to go like lakes, mountains, the ocean, etc... Things I don't like about living in
a rural area are that it lacks new people and things to do. Even though our high school has 1400
kids you start to see the same kids and people every day it gets kinda lame. There's quite a bit to
do in Port Alberni if you're visiting but once you live here for a few years you've kind of done
most things there are to do. With living in a city do you find you really have to give yourself a
lot more time to get somewhere due to traffic and how you're gonna get there?",,"Mentee 2022-03-03, 20:21: Hey, sorry if I don't always respond right away my teacher likes giving us
lots of assignments lol so I don't always get a lot of time to message back. I believe I am very
good at communicating with others I can make friends pretty easily. I like to take part in class
discussions and conversations. I am pretty responsible and can be depended on. I am almost always on
time for school and my classes I am also always on time for sports. I think I can be depended on
because I am responsible for example my auto teacher trusts me to do harder and more important jobs
on vehicles than other students. I am for the most part a pretty quick learner I like learning new
things. When it comes to school in math and science I find I can pick up on new concepts fairly
quickly. I feel like I'm really good at team work because I play team sports. Also in school classes
I often work with other classmates to complete assigning. I also feel as I can be a good leader in
sports and group projects. Technology is probably where my skill set lacks because I've never taken
any computer study classes but I am taking computer science next year to help build my technology
skills. I have knowledge though for social media because I use multiple social media platforms. I
also know how to use multiple programs like word and powerpoint. I can't think of many other
transferable skills that I have maybe one is that I am good academically and I have good common
sense which isn't always common lol.Mentor 2022-03-08, 03:56: All good on not messaging back
quickly. I'm here for you when you get the chance to talk. If you have things to do, then no problem
at all. I am actually supposed to message you back in 3 days but I failed this time and I think once
before too. I try my best to get away from the computer when I'm not working, like on the weekends,
so I don't always stay as up to date as I should. I think you have some great qualities that an
employer would be looking for. At your age, nobody is really looking for you to have polished
skills, they just want someone who has good attitude, likes to learn, and works well on a team. If
you communicate well, play sports and do well in school, then that gives you a real head start. And
you're right, common sense isn't so common, and seems less common all the time! Sounds like you have
all those things for sure. One stereotype about younger people these days is that they have their
heads in their phones all the time and don't engage with the real world. I know that's not true for
everyone, and doens't seem to be for you, so I think you just need to show that you're a young
person who really wants to do new things and you will impress people. My first job I worked at a
furniture store putting together tables and helping load customers vehicles. I got the job because I
couldn't find anything using the newspaper (yes, before they were online!) so I just took my resume
to a bunch of businesses and walked right in and asked if they needed anyone. Looking back I don't
even think they needed help, they just wanted to help me out a bit and I only worked one day a week
for $8/hour so it didn't cost them much. I really appreciate that they gave me a chance, but I
wouldn't have gotten the chance unless I had put myself out there. When you just put yourself out
there and be yourself, don't try to pretend like you are someone else or know more than you do, then
you will find good people who want to work with you. Are you thinking about getting a job soon? Have
you ever made a resume or done interviews?Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:09: I want to get a job soon. I
would have gotten one sooner but I am just really busy with sports soccer has just ended and I have
provincials in Langley this weekend for field lacrosse so after that field lacrosse is over. Box
lacrosse is starting soon but I think I'll have time for a job while I'm only playing one sport. I
have had a job before where I was a linesman for soccer games I don't really feel like it counted
that much as a job because I never really got that much experience in what it's like to have a job
and I just came in whenever there was a game on the weekend and I never had to make a resume for it
or have an interview so I've never had that experience. I made a resume a long time ago but it
really wasn't that good.",,"Mentor 2022-03-30, 18:21: Just checked your teacher's instructions and it looks like Paying for
School is next. But it does say that you're supposed to do the extension activities for the previous
one so you're probably still working through that. No rush to get here, and like I said, happy to
keep discussing the last conversation too.Mentor 2022-04-13, 17:23: Hey Branden, Just sending a
message here to make sure you're all good. No worries if you've just been busy, just wanted to make
sure we stay in touch. I just watched the videos in this section and found the overall estimate of
$19000 in the Macleans video to be too low. I think I was spending almost that much when I did my
BSc between 2008 and 2012. If you're going to Victoria or Vancouver for school, your rent is going
to be a lot more than 40% of $19000! I don't know about Victoria but it's pretty common to spend up
to $1000 per month to live with roommates in Vancouver! It's just crazy. You still have a few years
to go but definitely paying for school is a really important thing to think about. I was able to get
some help from scholarships, just applying to anything and everything that I qualified for. I
remember getting one from my minor hockey association and that is probably something that you could
look into with your sports. I also worked during the summers and then the rest of the money was from
student loans. Good news with student loans is that you will get help if you live on your own, but
you just have to pay them back eventually! I ended up with about $20000 in loans by the end of
school and it took about 3 years to pay them off after I got a job. It's not great to have to pay a
loan, but honestly it's a great investment in yourself - it definitely pays off in the end and $20k
is not such a huge amount once you have a job as it seems when you're in school :) Are you nervous
about paying for school? Have any ideas of how it might work for you?Mentee 2022-04-19, 18:02: Hey,
Trevor sorry for not responding for a while I've been pretty busy with sports and homework the term
just ended so I was trying to finish my assignments last minute lol. Yea I definitely think 20000 is
too low too, like Vancouver I believe rent in Victoria is really expensive. I'm really hoping I can
get a scholarship for University because like you said with all the expenses of going to University
it can be very unaffordable. I'm not really nervous about paying for school I'm just not looking
forward to it. I have family that has been putting money into an RESP for me so hopefully, It can
cover some if not most of my schooling with that. My biggest concern with trying to save money while
in university is what to eat because ill definitely makes my own food because I'm not the greatest
chef but I can cook basic things and I'd like to learn more and I like to have snacks quite a bit
but I feel like snacks would definitely add up quickly. How did you manage with food while trying to
watch how much you spend.Mentor 2022-04-21, 16:13: No worries at all if you were busy. I hope you
got all your assignments in! That's really great that your family has RESP money for you. That will
be a great start and you have the right attitude about being prepared to make it work even though it
may not be fun. I had to learn how to cook the hard way, just by being bad at it to start, but it's
actually not as hard as it can seem. Following recipes is an easy way to learn and then later you
can have more fun to experiment and make things how you like them. My partner and I used to cook big
meals on Sunday and one night during the week so we had leftovers for the whole week. We also bought
a small used deep freeze so that we could stock up on things when they were cheap, like berries and
bread and things that will freeze well. I think the biggest difference between school being
manageable and too expensive is what you spend on food. If you buy 2 or 3 meals a day, you'll spend
like $200-300 per week but if you try to always bring food from home then you can be under $100, so
that could be like $5000 in your pocket over a couple of semesters. Don't be afraid of cooking! It's
actually rewarding and a great skill to have throughout life :)","Mentor 2022-02-23, 14:04: Your dad sounds like a really cool guy encouraging you to travel. My
parents were kind of on the fence because they thought I'd never come back and get serious about
life :) I did eventually, though. Japan was one of the coolest places I've ever been. I only got to
spend about 2 weeks there but I plan on going back for more. It is such a great experience - so much
to do, so many interesting foods to eat, the people are all very polite and like to have fun. I get
what you're saying about Port Alberni. It can be really nice to be somewhere familiar and les sbusy,
but that has its drawbacks too. I moved to Penticton from the heart of Vancouver last year and it
was a huge change. I really love being close to nature and not having to deal with traffic. The
weather is nicer too. My girlfriend and I have found a great group of friends and, unlike in
Vancouver, people are rarely busy so we can just meet up regularly without much hassle. It's really
nice to be able to go for a hike after work and not have to plan it for the weekend. I lived in
Vancouver for a long time, most of 15 years except when I was out of the country, so I got used to
it. Once you know your routes then it's not too bad getting around. You definitely learn not to
drive and once you get used to it taking the bus can actually be nice. When you know which bus to
take at which time and you can get a seat, then you can just spend a half hour zoned out or reading
or whatever and there's no stress about traffi or parking. One thing that is really nice about
Vancouver is all the great places you can go in just a short walk or bike ride. In a smaller town
there's like the same 5 restaurants that everyone goes to but in the big city there's always
something new to discover. And like you said, there's always new people to meet and you can make
friends who have such diverse backgrounds. It can be harder to meet people in the city because
everyone is on the go all the time, but especially at school there are tons of people in the same
boat and you can make some of your best friendships there - the kinds of people that you'd never
meet otherwise but can really change your life. Right now I'm actually staying with two university
friends in Vernon. They met at university and now they have a kid who is running around just outside
the door. So it can be kind of intimidating but it can also be life changing, and at least once
you've moved away from home you will really know if you want to be there. People who never leave and
experience a different life might always wonder what their life might have been like, but people who
leave and move back make the decision and know that it's really where they want to be. I'm going to
unlock Part 2 of this conversation now.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 18:52: Hey Branden, I'm Trevor, currently a student at UBC doing an MSc in soil
science. I am going to school while I work so I'm on the slow track to my degree. On my way to being
a soil scientist I did a lot of things in university. I started in engineering because my dad is a
geotechncal engineer, but I changed programs after my first year. I wasn't a fan of all the math,
and when I was 17 I didn't want to study as much as I needed to, lol. I went into business, then I
was in anthrolopology for a while, then I thought I would be a teacher, then I got interested in
biology and geology and eventually I got my degree in Plant and Soil Science. It took 11 years if
you include the years I took off to travel, but I got it done! I've been working in mine reclamation
for about 8 years now and I love it. I work with engineers all the time and I don't have to do all
the math :) Outside of school and work, I like to climb, hike and play hockey. I used to play
lacrosse but I was a late bloomer and there were dudes with scruffy beards clobbering me once I was
13 and it wasn't that much fun anymore lol. What makes you want to do civil engineering? Do you have
any plans for where you want to study? I'm here to chat about whatever you want to. We'll get to the
conversation choices below (not sure if your teacher has certain ones you need to do, or you just
pick, but we'll figure it out), but first we can just get to know eachother a bit. Talk soon,
TrevorMentee 2022-02-15, 17:33: Hi Trevor Sounds like you sure couldn't make up your mind on what
you wanted to be lol. I've been pretty set on being a civil engineer for a while now, I've always
wanted a job where I can use lots of math because it has been my strong point in school ever since I
was younger and I feel like I would be wasting that if I didn't get a job using math. Also, I've
always wanted a job where I can feel accomplished not having to do the same thing day after day with
civil engineering I will have new projects every once and a while. I'm not really sure where I want
to study yet probably somewhere on the island or Vancouver because I wouldn't really want to go too
far from where I live now but I would like to go to school in a bigger city. What do you do in mine
reclamation and where did you go traveling within those 11 years? Talk to you later, BrandenMentor
2022-02-16, 14:33: Hey, great to hear that you have such a focus on what you want to do. Civil
engineering can offer great opportunities! My brother was on his way to doing that but he ended up
stopping school after 2 years when he had his engineering technologist credentials. He went to BCIT.
He was going to work for a while and then go back for school but he eneded up finding that he made
enough money as a technologist to be happy and he didn't have all the project management stress that
the engineers had. He moved from a large company and really liked to be at a smaller company after
because there were more projects and variety, like you said. The bigger companies had big jobs that
went on for years and he had to live in camps and didn't like that so much. But there's a lot of
different things you can do and everybody finds what they want eventually. In those 11 years I spent
like 6 of it in school, a couple years working odd jobs in construction, warehouses and landscaping,
and the work was mainly to fund travelling. I was in Australia and New Zealand, Fiji, Southeast
Asia, India, parts of Europe, Morocco. It was a great time and really shaped me as a person. Mayb
eonce you get your degree youll be able to do that too. There's always tons of work in Australia and
a few years working abroad looks good on a resume! In mine reclamation, it's kind of like they mess
it up and we fix it. Making plans to salvae soil, where to place it and how deep, what vegetation to
plant, managing vegetation and soils after planting. All that kind of stuff. I mainly write code in
R to analyze data and model outcomes, and in the summer I spend a bunch of weeks travelling around
Canada going to various sites and checking on our work or planning for new projects. I really like
it and I'm glad that my 11 years from high school to BSc led me here :) Does your teacher have
conversation choices that you are supposed to do? Last semester my mentee had a few that the teacher
assigned, but I know in some cases its more open-ended. No rush to push ahead but we want to make
sure you get your credits!",,,,"Mentee 2022-02-25, 23:45: I definitely would also take the public transit when I live in a bigger
city especially if I'm a student. I don't think there would really be much of an advantage driving
my own vehicle in the city it honestly seems it would just end up being more stressful then taking
the bus or something. I think with university one of the things I'm most excited about is like you
said is the people I will meet there. I think what the director was trying to communicate about the
relationship between living in the country and living in the city is that they are very differnt but
also share similarities. In both there are very hard workers who work to survive and feed their
families, but if someone from the country was put into the city they would find themselves probably
very losses and would probably find it very crowded with all the things going on. Whereas someone
from the city would probably find a small town to quite and maybe even boring. I don't know if I
could really relate to anything in this film because I don't live in a remote town where I have to
survive off the land but I also dont live in a big city. I felt sort of tense and maybe even a
little confused with how much was going on while watching this film. The director uses fast imagery
with intense background music to really push these emotion onto the watcher. I think the tense and
confused feeling really matches the film and the feeling someone from a very small town could feel
about moving to a big city. Someone moving from a small town may feel tense and confused with how
much goes on in a city and how fast pace it is compared to a country lifestyle. I honestly cannot
relate to this feeling of the idea of moving to a big city which I plan on doing in the future and I
really look forward to. I'm sure at first it could be a little overwhelming but I'm sure I will get
used to it very quickly.Mentor 2022-03-01, 14:12: You have such a good attitude about going to the
city. I think you're going to really thrive and enjoy your experience. Even if you decide the city
is ultimately not for you after you're done school, I think you're set up well to have a great
experience. That movie was really quite intense. It was like a pump up video, but then at the end I
saw these two people from the rural areas in kind of strange positions. The man was up on the tower
and all I could think about was how he'd be toast if he fell, and the woman seemed very lost. It
seems like kind of a strange video to show for people who might be nervous about moving to the city
- start with really quick cuts of imagery of movements with music that grows in tension and then
finish it off with one person who is working hard and probably scared he'll die and another person
who seems lost lol. I get why it didn't really resonate with you. You're kind of from an in-between
place, not the bush and not the city, and you're looking forward to getting into the city and doing
your school. Oh well, it was a chance to watch video in class and I always loved that in high school
:) And I actually really liked some of the clips that the director used, especially of the guy going
down the river in the canoe. I'm not sure if you have to do the extension activities but I'm going
to click Complete Conversation and that should bring up the same option for you. Let's do the survey
and then move onto Entering the Job Market, which is the next one I have flagged from your teacher.","Mentor 2022-03-15, 14:15: I hope your provincials went well! That's a big tournament to make it to
so just getting there is an accomplishment. In all my years playing hockey I only made it to
provincials once! You just reminded me that my first job was actually umpiring baseball. I did it
from about 13 to 16. At the time I also thought it wasn't really a job but now looking back I see it
differently. First off, it can be a lot of responsibility and pressure, especially with parents and
coaches getting excited. And besides that future employers will see it as a good sign that you
wanted to get involved in the sport you love, and that you wanted to have that responsibility for a
small amount of pay. I don't know if soccer is the same but I know in hockey right now they are
struggling to find refs. Refs get burnt out and tired of the abuse and most of them do it for the
love of the game and not for the money. So I think that being a ref says a lot of good things about
you as a person and as a potential employee. Everyone has to start somewhere! I hope you're enjoying
your spring break!Mentee 2022-03-28, 17:15: Hi Trevor just got back from spring break it was pretty
good I went surfing in Tofino and provincials went well we placed fourth even though we were first
in our division we ended up having some bad luck and calls in our semi-final and bronze medal games.
Not sure if you have a spring break too but if you did I hope yours was good too. Yea being a soccer
ref wasn't too much pressure because I was a linesman so I wasn't the main ref so all the pressure
wasn't on me. There is a shortage of refs for soccer though it might just be where I live we only
really had one main ref and a few linesmen.Mentor 2022-03-30, 18:17: Dude, 4th place in the province
is awesome! Especially since you're from a smaller town and have to play against all the big
associations in the provincials. Congratulations! Sucks to get no medal, but nothing to feel bad
about. I didn't get a spring break. There is a one week break in February but since I'm working and
going to school it just meant more work for me lol. I don't think you've done the 2nd part of
Entering the Job Market yet, right? Sorry, it's been a while! I looked through the past messages and
wasn't sure if you had. I clicked on Complete Conversation anyway, just in case I'm not getting it
right. We can still work through this stuff even though it's marked as complete anyway. If you end
up making resume or whatever I'm happy to review it - just make sure you don't include your address
of phone number and stuff so we can follow program rules.Mentee 2022-03-31, 17:31: Hi Trevor I felt
good about coming in fourth too, especially for a small town it does suck though that we didn't get
a medal. I will start Entering the job market part 2 now not sure if ill get it done by the end of
class though.Mentor 2022-04-01, 13:59: Hi Branden, I hope you find it useful doing the exercises in
here. I thought the video was actually pretty good. Especially the tips on remembering to bring a
copy of your resume and having a few questions to ask the employers. Even if your questions are
basic, like 'who are your biggest customers?' or 'how many people would be on the team I would work
on?'. Just things to show that you care and your mind is engaged. I've done a bit of hiring lately
and one thing that made a few candidates stand out is that rather than them having something like
'References available upon request' on their resume, they included a letter from a reference. It was
nothing long or relally detailed, and at your stage in life doesn't need to be from anyone related
to what job you are trying to get. Just like a letter from a lacrosse coach saying that they've
known you for # years, you are a good team player and have a good attitude and that the employer can
contact them with any more questions. It just makes it one less step for them to get to know you and
feel good about hiring you. Hope you have a great weekend!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

above?Mentee 2022-04-12, 13:57: 3 things i like about living in a rural area: It's small, i know a
lot of people and i know of most of the places where you can go to entertain yourself. I know my way
around town very well, I know a bunch of different routes around town, and it makes it easier to get
around. there is nice lakes and mountains, during the summers there are nice lakes to swim in and
during the winters we can go up the mountains for the snow. 2 things i dont like about living in a
rural area There is no mall, or shopping center. There isnt really a place where there is lots of
shops/stores to go, its mostly all just department stores and fishing stores. There is not a lot of
places to go and hangout with your friends. living in such a small place there isnt many things to
do with your friends all year round so you usually end up getting bored pretty fast. What is it like
living in the city?Mentor 2022-04-14, 02:13: Interesting! Coming from a small town myself, I share
some of those views as well. I didn't appreciate the small town vibe as much when I was younger
because it was all I had ever known. I had this golden view of the city, thinking it was so much
better than rural life, but that hasn't been the case for me. Getting around isn't as easy, but it's
not too, too difficult so I wouldn't worry about that too much. There are a lot of people though,
and, at least in Vancouver, you're not too far away from that natural scenery that you like. There's
definitely a lot more to do, but that depends on what you like doing, haha! I complained about being
bored a lot when I was in high school, and then I went to Vancouver and realized that I really just
enjoy the usual indoor stuff (anime, video games, etc.). Now, I don't mind the quieter rural life at
all! Of course, it's nice to get out once in a while, but I don't need to do that often so a small
trip into the city (from a rural town) isn't too big of a deal to me (this includes things like
shopping). Do you think you'd like to settle down in a city one day or are you quite comfortable
with rural life? Most people I know love the city life. Some places are still alive during the night
(for parties and dancing, etc.) but that's not my cup of tea. Lots to explore, but it's really up to
you and how interested you are in exploring these things. I do think city life favours those with
lots of extra money to spend on all these activities though.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 02:51: Hi Brady! What's up? I'm Jack, your mentor and 20-year-old third-year
English student at UBC. Do you want to tell me a bit about yourself? I'm into all sorts of stuff,
everything from reading and writing to sports and video games. What about you? Feel free to tell me
anything and be sure to ask any questions you might have! :DMentee 2022-02-15, 14:05: Hi Jack! I'm
15 years old and am a grade 10 student at ADSS. I am into Japanese culture and video games. I enjoy
games that are fast-paced and action-packed, as well as games that are slower and more progressive.
I also enjoy playing volleyball, but I have never played on a team. In the future, I would like to
teach English in Japan. It has been a dream of mine for years, and I would like it to become a
reality one day, and I was wondering if you knew any information on how to achieve this goal. Also,
if you could give me some insight on what a day at school looks like for you, that would be much
appreciated!Mentor 2022-02-16, 00:39: That's awesome! I played volleyball for two years when I was
in middle school - it's super fun! Vaguely connected but have you seen the anime Haikyuu!! ? It's my
all-time favourite! That's a really cool dream. I'm actually thinking about becoming an English
teacher, and I've just begun to explore international opportunities. At least in Canada, becoming a
teacher typically means getting a Bachelor's degree in the subject(s) you want to teach (usually 4
years) and then completing a BEd (1-2 years depending on the province). It's a big question, but I
do know that there are typically a few extra hoops you need to jump through relating to
certification and legal qualification when it comes to international work. This is definitely
something you want to talk about with people who have relevant experiences. I'm curious, what makes
you want to become a teacher? A typical day for me: wake up at 8am, go through my morning routine,
and leave for class around 9 or 10. Then, I attend my lectures. Here's a list of the English classes
at ubc if you're interested: https://english.ubc.ca/courses/. With a full workload in English
literature, I typically have three hours of class per day. There is a bit of discussion in them but
it's mostly just listening to a professor talk while taking notes. You are expected to spend 2-3
hours outside of class for every 1 hour in class, so this means doing readings, discussion posts,
essays, and other assignments; most of the time, this needs to be done before class so that you can
properly follow the lecture. Once my classes are done, I usually just head home, but many people
stay after school to work in libraries and study spaces with friends. Once I'm home (around 3-5:30
depending on the day), I cook some food, relax for a bit, and then start preparing for the next
day's classes after finishing up any work that I didn't get done earlier.Mentee 2022-02-17, 12:03:
Thank you! I would like to become a teacher because it gives me a way to help kids have a future and
to explore different opportunities they have. It is also a way for me to help them with things they
might want to do in the future and to possibly guide them on the right path so they can be
successful. And about Haikyuu!!, I have seen it and it is also one of my favorites, although I still
have a few episodes to watch! Do you keep a journal? Because it is something that my teachers want
me to do to track what I have done or what I need to do, I find it hard to write in a journal every
day. Personally, I don't find it works, but they insist I do it. I would like to know if you have
anything like that or not.Mentor 2022-02-20, 02:24: It's great that you have genuine motivations for
that career! You're in a very good position - most people I know in university don't even know what
they're planning to pursue career-wise! I highly recommend the manga for Haikyuu!! as well.
Personally, I like the anime more for seasons 1-3 and the manga for what happens afterwards. Do you
have a favourite character? I'm a huge fan of Oikawa. And I totally get what you're saying about the
journal. I had to keep one for two different classes when I was in high school: psychology and
English. In both cases, I did not find it particularly useful, so you're not alone there. I've
experienced similar feelings towards many of the assignments in university courses as well (a lot of
them just feel so redundant!). While I don't keep a journal, I do use the notes app on my phone to
write down ideas for books and Youtube videos when they come to me, but that's about it. Would you
be able to tell me a bit more about the journal, like what class it's for, whether it's graded for
completion or content, and what specifically you find difficult about it? For me, it was difficult
to come up with a general topic to write about, but once I had that I had no problem filling up the
page. Is your issue the same, or do you have a topic in mind but just don't know what to say about
it? Something else?Mentee 2022-02-23, 13:29: I would have to say that my favourite character is
Kenma, because he is the one I relate to the most, although I also like Nishinoya. And about the
manga: I have just recently started reading all sorts of manga, and I think I will read Haikyuu!!
next. (You have somewhat convinced me to read it!) The journal is for the class I am in right now,
Career Life Education. It is used for tracking what we do on a daily basis and planning for the
days, weeks, and months to come. I find it hard to write in the journal because my daily routine and
what I do during the day are usually the same, and there aren't many interesting things that happen
for me to write about in my journal. I also find it hard to find motivation to write in the journal
because it's something that I don't feel helps me. I believe the journal is marked on completion. We
hand it in usually at the end or start of a week and get it back at the next class or during the
same class.Mentor 2022-02-26, 02:30: Oh yeah! I'm a huge fan of Kenma and Nishinoya as well. And
sweet! For some students, writing in a journal will be a practice they continue even after their
education, but for others (like you and me) it's not particularly useful. There's a great strategy
that writers use to just get their thoughts out on the page. It's called freewriting. Basically, you
just write anything and everything that pops into your head without stopping. Don't pause, don't
erase, just write. Once you're done, you can clean it up a little if you think it's really bad or
misses the point of the task, but there's a good chance it'll be sufficient. This is a great skill
to learn because it helps you get through assignments that are just graded for completion quickly.
It can even be useful for brainstorming essay ideas (which you'll have to do a lot of in
university). It goes without saying that, like journals, this strategy doesn't work for everyone,
but I'd encourage you to give it a shot. And remember that you don't have to write about
""interesting"" stuff, whatever's on your mind will be more than enough. It could be school, money,
friends, work, love, anime, lunch, the tree across the street, or becoming a teacher - it really
doesn't matter too much. Even just saying that you thought about or engaged with one of the things
mentioned above (plus anything else you might think of) will give you a starting point at the very
least. Also, don't forget that there's nothing wrong with talking about the mundane stuff! Just a
fun little side note: you probably know it but in case you don't... there's an entire genre in Japan
called ""slice of life"" that exclusively deals with the mundane aspects of life. These are widely
loved, award-winning series, and nothing ever happens in them! The climax of an entire arc can be
something as simple as getting out of bed, finding the library, or buying milk at the grocery store.
Ever heard of this genre?Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:41: Thank you! The freewriting strategy helped a lot.
It helped for me to just sit down and take a few minutes to just write whatever I wanted and get it
over with. And about the slice of life genre, I haven't heard of it before, but I will have to look
into it. It doesn't seem like my type of genre, but I might find that I like it. Also, I had some
questions about becoming an English teacher. I was wondering how many years it takes to become a
teacher. How do I become a teacher in a foreign country? Is there anything I can do in my time in
high school to help with becoming an English teacher in a foreign country? Do I need more education
to become a teacher in a foreign country? If you had answers to any of these questions, it would be
greatly appreciated!Mentor 2022-03-04, 02:59: Hi Brady. Sorry for not getting back to you.
Strangely, I didn't get a notification! I'm glad to hear that the freewriting strategy worked for
you! Keep it up - it'll be super useful once you begin university. Regarding the slice of life
genre, I totally get it. I didn't like it at first but I'm finding that the older I get the more I
enjoy it. Teacher stuff: this is a great thing to talk about with your teachers! They've gone
through the process themselves so they'll be able to talk you through the details. The standard
route, though, is a four-year bachelor's degree plus a one year BEd in BC (or a two year BEd in most
other provinces, I believe). However, it's also possible to become a teacher with shorter degrees,
but this will be reflected in your pay and you won't have the most competitive profile. For now, one
of your goals should be to study hard so you can get into university and work towards earning a
bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, I don't know much about becoming a teacher in another country, so
you'll want to refer to a guidance/career counsellor for that. Generally, I believe there's some
sort of small extra certification that's needed, but this is likely something you'd want to talk
about with people who have had more relevant experiences.Mentor 2022-03-04, 03:03: But do keep an
open mind, if you can! I decided in grade eight that I wanted to be a lawyer and this idea stuck
with me for nearly seven years, but now I'm leaning more towards becoming a teacher. How set are you
on this career path? Do you think it could change in the near future?Mentor 2022-03-08, 14:13: Hey
Brady! Haven’t heard from you in a while! No pressure - I understand we all have busy lives - but
are you doing alright? Let me know what’s up when you get the chance!Mentee 2022-03-28, 13:18: Hi,
sorry for not responding. I was sick the week before spring break and could not log into my account.
About my career path, I still like to become an English teacher. It could change in the near future,
because I still have lots of time to choose. Right now, I am doing the most I can to be accepted
into an electrical course at my local college for my grade 11 year. Although I'm not sure if I want
to follow through with this, I think that taking it is a good chance to get experience in this area.
I am looking more into different career paths but am not sure what I would like to take.Mentor
2022-03-31, 00:21: Hey! Been a while. Hope you're feeling better now. Were you still able to enjoy
the break? Regarding your career, that's great. Backup plans and diversifying your skills are very
important. When you have the time, you could also consider looking into concurrent teaching
programs. One of my friends is doing one at UBC. Not every university has them and not all majors
are accepted for it, but essentially you take both the bachelor's degrees you need (the one in your
specialized area - English in this case AND the one you need to become a teacher) at the same time.
For example, my friend is in physics and education, so he takes some of each every year instead of
doing four years straight of physics before starting his education degree. Just something to
consider!Mentee 2022-03-31, 13:18: Yes, the break was slow, but it was nice to have some time off
school. I will definitely have to look into that. With the concurrent teaching programs, are there
any benefits that come with doing these? Or is it essentially just the same as taking four years of
one course straight?Mentor 2022-04-01, 14:46: That's good! And it will vary from program to program,
but there are a few potential benefits. For example, some grant you guaranteed acceptance into the
education program with this path. Although this isn't an absolute, most people I've spoken to find
education programs to be quite easy compared to their specialized area of study. My friend views
education classes as a break because his physics classes are so much work! Many concurrent programs
let you take a mix of these classes, which can help you balance the workload. It really depends on
how sure you are of this path. The following link breaks it down a bit more and resembles pages of
other universities you will likely be looking into in the future (this one is located in Ontario -
it's one I'm looking into at the moment). Some universities, like UBC, I believe, refer to it as a
""dual degree."" https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/bachelor-of-educationMentor 2022-04-01,
14:56: Also, are you down to get started on one of the conversation choices assigned by your
teacher? According to the email I got, we're supposed to look at the following: From Rural to Urban
(plus extension activities), Entering the job market (plus extension activities), and Paying for
school (plus extension activities). Which one do you want to start with?Mentee 2022-04-04, 13:15:
Alright, i will have to look at that link and go through it later today. And yes, i believe that my
teacher wanted us to start on the rural to urban conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

conversation. Three things I like about living in a rural area are: 1. Everybody knows everybody and
there are a lot of connections to different people, so it's easy to feel comfortable in the
community. 2. It's easy to find jobs because there aren't a lot of people in the area 3. It's easy
to make a big group of friends since everybody knows everybody. Two things I don't like about living
in a rural area are: 1. There isn't much to do since there aren't many buisnesses and activities to
do and when there are, they're very limited. 2. As much as there is areas to feel comfortable in,
there are also places to feel uncomfortable. A large amount of poverty and homlessness plagues my
town and many other rural places. Question about moving from Rural to Urban: I have always felt more
inclined to be in bigger cities and I hope to someday live in one, but as someone who has lived in
small towns their whole life, I have little idea of what city life is like. If you could describe
what it's like in 3 words what would they be? Regards, AurayliahMentor 2022-03-29, 21:05: Hi
Aurayliah, Welcome back! I am so glad that you’re ready to dive right in. You make some great points
about living rurally, as those are often the factors people like and dislike. As someone that has
lived in a few cities, I would describe urban living as loud, bustling, and crowded. Personally, I
do not favour living in the city because it is hard to find peace and quiet, or even just a minute
to yourself. Even in small cities, as the one I currently live in once was, everything is in a
constant state of movement because there are more people coming into the city, which means a lot of
building and construction. I think the main thing to consider about living in the city is what is
most important to you, because the positives that you see in rural living are very hard to find in
urban living. And though cities have activities and fun things to do, you will see much more
homelessness and poverty in cities because urban living is expensive and it can be hard for many
people to find jobs or live comfortably. One last thing: if you’re searching for more movement, or
an increase in the general pace of life, then cities are great, but if you are looking for something
comfortable with a moderate pace, then a city is not the place to look. MeganMentor 2022-04-05,
16:47: Hi Aurayliah, I just wanted to check in on you as I haven't heard from you in a few days.
Please let me know if I can help you with anything and I hope to hear from you soon! MeganMentee
2022-04-05, 18:04: Hi Megan, Thank you for checking in on me! I apologize for the delay, I have been
thinking of an answer to your long response! I understand everything your saying; cities are
definitely very different from small towns yet they do have lots of similarities. Living in the city
is not for everyone; an aquired taste if you must. My questions are: 1. What is your favorite part
of living in the city? 2. Would you live in a rural or urban place in your ideal world? 3. What
would you change about living in the city? AurayliahMentor 2022-04-05, 18:14: Hi Aurayliah, I'm
sorry if my information was too much! To answer your questions: 1) My favourite part of living in a
city is probably my ability to hang out with friends. In the city we can do anything at any time,
even just drive around in the middle of the night sometimes, and it's definitely a lot of fun to
have that option. 2) I would definitely prefer to live in a rural areas- I'm a total homebody so I
just need a quiet place to be- and I am actually in the process of planning to move to a smaller
town, just a couple hours away from my current home. 3) If I could change anything, I would live in
a quieter area so that I can have a balance between calm and crazy! That's the main thing I dislike
about where I live now, there is never any quiet. Megan","Mentor 2022-02-25, 15:52: Hi Aurayliah, I thought I would message you here so that you see that I
have opened the conversation! If you have any questions throughout don't hestitate to ask me
anything. MeganMentee 2022-03-01, 16:49: Hi Megan, Thank you for opening the conversation up! My
first questions are: How much do you study in a week, How many hours do you study each day and what
method of studying is your favorite/works best for you? AurayliahMentor 2022-03-01, 17:39: Hi
Aurayliah, I would say that I do not have to study for tests or exams that often. As an art student,
as I am getting my Bachelor of Arts, there are not a lot of tests that I face, except my final
exams, and I don't really need to study for assignments either. English doesn't really qualify for a
lot of testing, so studying is not often needed. There is not really an exact time every week that I
study because it is not really needed for my major or minor. When I do study, I try to study
straight for an hour and then take a half-hour or 15 minute break (I find that I need mental breaks,
hence the 15-30 minute breaks). I don't often study more than three or four hours because, after
awhile, I lose focus and stop absorbing information. When I study, I like to re-write my notes over
and over because writing helps me memorize, and I also read my notes out loud numerous times.
Another thing I do is listen to music, I can memorize easily with music. I think to find the best
studying method for you, you have to try a few methods because everyone learns differently. I am an
auditory learner, so I need to hear and write things or I won't remember them. But if you are a
different learner, say hands-on, then listening won't help you. My advice to you would be to test a
few different types of studying to see what your mind likes the best, and remember that finding that
method can take time, so be patient with yourself. I hope that helps, if you have more questions-
let me know! -MeganMentee 2022-03-04, 16:12: Hi Megan, Thank you for the information! Sadly I am
more of a visual/kinesthetic learner and not a very good auditory learner haha. But I will take some
of your advice. Are we supposed to open up the rural to urban project? If so let me know.
AurayliahMentor 2022-03-04, 17:16: Hi Aurayliah, As far as I know, your teacher would like for you
to complete: From Rural to Urban, Entering the job market, and Paying for school. And we can move to
any of those, or any other, when you feel you are finished with this Conversation. Also, I know that
for visual learners it can be very helpful to highlight and re-write notes, so that is something to
keep in mind when you study. And you can create colourful cue cards to help you as well. MeganMentee
2022-03-09, 16:57: Hi Megan, Yes, as a visual learner I love highlighting and making cue cards. I
find that those things work very well, and I can stay focused with those tools. If there is nothing
else for us to talk about in this section, we could move on to the Rural to Urban conversation.
AurayliahMentee 2022-03-09, 17:08: Hi Megan, Also, forewarning you that we will be taking a spring
break leave come Monday, for a fortnight. I will not be available to conversate at this time. Thank
you for understanding, AurayliahMentor 2022-03-10, 20:54: Hi Aurayliah, I hope you have a great time
on your break! I have opened the next Conversation for whenever you want. Megan",,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-11, 14:09: Hi Megan! I am Aurayliah. How are you? I noticed that we both like reading
and writing, so cool! How is university treating you? How are you liking studying English and
History? Personally those are my favorite subjects in school. I really enjoy learning about world
events, historical figures and reading old books. Whats your favorite book? Regards, AurayliahMentor
2022-02-12, 00:36: Hi Aurayliah, It’s great that we share some of the same interests and like the
same school topics! Reading and writing are basically my whole life, in and out of school.
University is amazing, I love every part of it- especially the English and History. It’s awesome
that you love history, what it is that you love most about history? And I have so many favourite
books, but I think the Mortal Instruments series will always holds a special place in my heart.
What’s your favourite book? MeganMentee 2022-02-15, 16:22: Hi Megan! What I love most about history
is how different people lived and interacted. I enjoy learning what triggered things to happen. My
favorite part about it is learning about different countries and war. But I think that history and
English go hand in hand, because I also love learning about famous authors like Jane Austen and
Shakespere and what they did. My favorite book series is definintly Harry Potter. It has always been
a defining highlight of my childhood and I will always have a huge obsession with it. What is your
favorite band or artist? Also who is your favorite author? AurayliahMentor 2022-02-16, 18:07: Hi
Aurayliah, I completely agree about History and English going hand in hand, that’s why I decided to
study both because I feel like I get a fuller image that way. I love reading and analyzing
literature, but then also hearing about the things that influenced the writer. The look at both
helps me understand the mind of the poet or author in a more detailed way. And I think it’s great
that you have specifics that you love about History! Shakespeare has a special place in my heart,
his work is the reason I’m studying English and History. I find it basically impossible for me to
pick a favourite musician, author or even movies. I listen to all music (like all, even classical)
and I try reading almost anything. I have genres of both that I prefer but I’ll try anything.
MeganMentee 2022-02-17, 15:23: Hi Megan, That's awesome! I looove classical music. It always gives
me a sense of nostalgia and it's very beautiful. Question, if you could visit any era of time, any
at all, where would you go? I would go to the Victorian era. It has always fascinated me how they
lived, and what they did to pass the time. I am currently reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
and it's giving me a pretty good idea. Are you currently reading anything interesting?
-AurayliahMentor 2022-02-17, 16:31: Hi Aurayliah, What I love most about classical music is the way
it calms me. There's nothing to distract you from the music, it's just you and the notes. I think if
I could visit any era it would be either the romantic era or the eras of Ancient Greece and Rome. I
love the works and art that came from both of these times, so I think it be fascinating to visit.
Plus, Greek mythology features some of my favourite stories and figures to analyze, there's just so
much there! Recently I've been reading a lot of young adult and romance books, but nothing that
changes my world or that I would definitely recommend. -MeganMentee 2022-02-17, 16:59: Hi Megan, Yes
I completly agree about the classical music and how it makes you feel. Ancient Rome would be amazing
to visit as well. Are you studying or doing work about anything that is interesting lately? Recently
in my English class we are reading The Body by Stephen King and it is very interesting.
-AurayliahMentor 2022-02-17, 18:36: Hi Aurayliah, I recently took some Russian and Gothic literature
courses. Both were super interesting and I loved all the stories. After taking Russian lit, I
actually went ahead bought my own copies of War and Peace and Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy- both are
amazing and powerful stories. The gothic literature course was really fun because it featured books
I wouldn't normally read, like The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. There was one
short-story that I read a long time ago that I’d recommend, it’s called The Yellow Wallpaper by
Charlotte Perkins Gilman- I read this one all the time and it's an interesting story. Do you like
movies, or are you a TV show person? What are your favourites? -MeganMentee 2022-02-22, 17:01: Hi
Megan, I am very much a movie person, I like movies a lot, specifically horror movies, crime or
period pieces. My favorite movie is either Pulp Fiction or House of a Thousand Corpses, and as I've
said before I love the Harry Potter world. Some TV shows I love are Anne with an E and Stranger
Things. What about you? Watched anything intreguing lately?Mentor 2022-02-22, 18:45: Hi Aurayliah, I
also love horror movies and period pieces. I went saw the new Scream not that long ago and it was
pretty good. Other than horror movies, I am a huge Disney fan, always have been. And I really like
movies by Tim Burton, like Dark Shadows and Corpse Bride. But my all time favourite movie is called
Coraline, I don't know what it is about that one but I just love it. Recently, though, I've been
waiting for a series called Bridgerton to return, which is a period piece and really reminds me of
Jane Austen. I just want to mention that when you feel ready to start one of the Conversations, you
can let me know where you want to begin and we can get started! MeganMentee 2022-02-24, 17:14: Hi
Megan, Ooh I also love Corpse Bride and Coraline. Yes I am ready to start a conversation! But i'm
not sure where to begin if we did. Where do I find the start button?Mentor 2022-02-24, 21:11: Hi
Aurayliah, So the way that the conversations are open is by me. You just have to let me know where
you want to start and I can open the conversation on my end. And we can start anywhere! You just
decide which conversation interests you the most and we can get started! MeganMentee 2022-02-25,
15:38: Hi Megan, Alright I'm ready if you are! I would like to open up 'Studying' if thats
available.",,,,"Mentor 2022-04-12, 07:53: Hi Aurayliah, I just wanted to check in on you as I haven't heard from you
in a week. Please let me know if I can help you with anything! Also, please note that after
completing the second part of ""From Rural to Urban"", we can begin a new conversation whenever you'd
like! MeganMentor 2022-04-20, 18:42: Hi Aurayliah, I thought what might help you, as I haven’t heard
from you in quite some time, would be to hear my thoughts on the video. I think the director of the
film was trying to communicate how with rural living everything relies on you and your family but in
the city you have less work to do on your own as we rely more on technology. And I would say this is
very true, from my perspective, for both. In the city, we have so much technology that most
everything is done for us rather than by us. While watching this video however it made me somewhat
disappointed in myself because if I was placed somewhere like the location in the beginning of the
video, I would be useless. It’s an interesting thing to consider how little I know as something that
has solely lived in the city. Megan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from you! I am looking forward to discussing with you about the Rural to Urban Module! If you want
some other extensions made available to you in the modules please let me know! Looking forward to
hearing your thoughts :) DavidMentee 2022-04-06, 14:31: Hey David This is for the From Rural to
Urban activity. 1. One of things I like about living in a rural area is that I knew everyone and IDK
how to explain why. Another thing I like about living in a rural area is that it's so quiet in the
morning because I love waking up to birds chirping in the morning. My last thing I like about living
in a rural area is that it's right next to the beach because I love walking down the with the sun
setting. 2. I actually only have one thing I don't like and that there are very few stores where I
live so my parents have to drive 80-90 kms just to go grocery shopping. 3. One question I have about
living in a urban area is that ""How do people stand having cars driving by their house constantly so
early in the morning""Mentor 2022-04-06, 17:34: Hi Andrew! It is so interesting reading your answers
to the questions! From what I read, it is vastly different living in a rural area than urban area.
For starters, I do not know everyone in my area, much less my neighborhood. Even though I live in a
quiet neighborhood, it still can be pretty noisy in the mornings as there is a main street not far
from where I live and I can hear all the cars in the morning commute. However, I can imagine it is
much noisier nearer downtown. It is also interesting that there is no near grocery stores near you,
and you have to drive a long distance just to get groceries! This is very different from my
experience as I do not have to drive that far. In response to your question, from my experience the
nearest main street isn't directly outside my doorstep but I can still hear the cars driving by. I
think people just slowly get used to the sounds of morning commute after living in the area for a
long time! But I agree with you that first-timers may not be able to stand the sounds of morning
commute. That being said, it sounds relaxing to have quiet mornings and it would be a nice change of
pace to hear the sounds of birds chirping in the morning for an urban habitant. That being said, I
also have a question to ask you! If there are no near grocery stores for you, are there any public
services/stores near where you live? Looking forward to hearing you back :) DavidMentee 2022-04-12,
14:27: Hey David! There are many very small store where I used to live and there are only 2 small
grocery stores there, one of them you can only access by boat. My parents just prefer to go to the
big stores in town. AndrewMentor 2022-04-14, 17:30: Hi Andrew! That is very interesting to hear!

1047513321,1047554170,2/9/2022 16:40,,,"Mentor 2022-03-10, 15:00: Hi Aiden, I have opened our conversation surrounding entering the job
market. As a way of kicking off the conversation, I'll talk about some of my first experiences with
creating a resume! I found creating a resume to be very overwhelming and intimidating at first. I
wasn't sure how to properly format it, how many pages it was supposed to be or which particular
experiences to highlight. I think asking for help from someone you trust who has more experience is
really important early on and even as you gain more work experience, having someone who can check
over your resume and give feedback is a real asset. Throughout my process I learned to edit my
resume to highlight specific experiences that suited the job I was applying for. At times that even
meant leaving out certain jobs that I'd done, which felt strange at first, but it ultimately put
more emphasis on the attributes of my resume that I really wanted to come through. Keep it simple
was a piece of advice that I've really held on to as well. Employers will have to look through tons
of resumes so having something that clearly gets your point across and is easy to read is important!
Do you currently have a resume, or have you started working on one? Is there a job or volunteer
oppurtunity this summer that you're interested in? Finally, who's someone that you trust to help you
craft your resume and seek out job oppurtunities? I'm looking forward to your responses! AveryMentor
2022-03-10, 15:08: An additional point of conversation for us in this module will be transferable
skills. Transferable skills are particular positive attributes that you have developed through life
experiences that will help you in the job market. For example, I really enjoy working with people in
collaborative settings, which is an asset for a lot of companies. I have always been a part of team
sports and that's helped me to understand how to interact with various different types of people.
Employers will expect you to be successful in group settings and I think this is a skill set I've
really been able to hone over time. Another transferable skill is my time managment ability.
Throughout university, I was a varsity athlete with a full course load and I also spent time
conducting research for the university, coaching a youth team and tutoring other athletes. My busy
schedule throughout university has made me very good at time managment which is a definite
transferrable skill in the work force. Now that I've given a few examples, I'll get you to do the
same. Maybe shoot for 3-5 transferrable skills that you think will help you as you enter
post-secondary education and the job market in the future. Looking forward to hearing from you!
AveryMentor 2022-03-29, 17:54: Hi Aiden, Good to hear from you! I hope you had an awesome break!
What did you get up to? Do you plan to look for summer jobs or do you have other activities in the
summer that keep you busy? Your transferrable skills are incredible! Speaking french is such an
asset in a variety of different careers and like you said, it can help you to learn other languages
if you choose to travel. Coaching was something I did a lot of throughout highschool and university
and I still mention it in job applications to this day. It demonstrates an ability to work with
different groups of people and exemplifies strong leadership skills.",,"Mentor 2022-04-21, 14:47: Hi Aiden, I have opened paying for school as this is the final
conversation we will work on together!","Mentor 2022-02-12, 04:52: Hi Aiden, We will start off this conversation by having you answer the
questions provided above. To give you some inspiration, something I really liked about growing up in
a rural area was the connection I had with my neighbors. I grew up on a street with a lot of other
kids and we would spend time together exploring our neighborhood and playing sports. Something I
disliked about growing up in a rural area was the long commute I had when I started to play
elite-level volleyball. I had to drive 1.5 hours to and from practice at least 3 times a week which
was a huge time commitment. I'm excited to read your responses to the questions! AveryMentee
2022-02-15, 16:56: Hi Avery, One of the things that I like about living in a rural area is the
nature that is here. There is lots of wildlife the life around my house, such as families of deer
and even sometimes deer, and the property I live on is surrounded in forest. There is also two big
lakes just 15 outside of town. Another thing I like about living in a rural area is the traffic. My
family usually goes to Oakville, Ontario in the summer to visit family in the summer winter, and the
city traffic is incredibly busy compared to what it is where I live. Another thing that I like about
living in a rural area is that I know alot of the people in town. We only have one high school, and
once you move up there you pretty much become aquainted with everybody. A thing that I don't like
about living in a rural area is the lack of services here, such as stores or activities. Most of the
stores that you would see in a city aren't in this town, and you have to travel a couple towns over
to get there. And as you said with your volleyball, if I wanted to play higher-level hockey, it
would be a 2 hour driving commitment 3 times a week. Another thing that I dislike about living in a
rural area is how small the town is. I have been on every street in this town 100s of times and I
enjoy the bigger feel of cities when I visit. My question is: Is living in the city better than
living rurarlly, and why? Thanks, -AidenMentor 2022-02-16, 01:44: Hi Aiden, Great responses! You are
so lucky to have such great access to wildlife from your backyard! I grew up near a forest as well
and it's so amazing to be surrounded by nature all the time. Funny that you bring up Oakville as I
am originally from a small town in Ontario near Oakville, so I know exactly what you're talking
about in terms of the traffic. As for the downsides of rural living, I think your responses are
completely reasonable and I think a lot of people living in small communities feel the same way. Are
there any stores in particular that you wish you had in Port Alberni? In terms of city vs rural
living it's very dependent on who you are. I lived in a city throughout university and loved that I
could get to any store I wanted, had easy public transit but also the ability to drive most places,
and had awesome facilities like gyms, pools, beach volleyball courts etc. I think in a place like
Vancouver there is also great food throughout the city and you have access to more culture through
live music, performances etc. However a more rural setting allows me to do a lot of the activities I
love like rock climbing, hiking, biking etc. Rural communities are also typically very safe and can
be must less expensive. If you're someone that loves good food, the fast-paced lifestyle of a city
and the amenities that come with it, I think urban living would be a great choice. However, if you
enjoy spending a lot of time outdoors, value having your own space and have a tight knit group of
friends and family, rural living might suit you better. What are some your non-neogtiables when
determining where you want to live? When you've gone through my response and answered some of the
questions I've given you, we can move on to the 2nd part of the rural to urban conversation. Can't
wait to hear from you! AveryMentee 2022-02-17, 15:28: Hi Avery, That's cool you're from around
Oakville. I would consider it my home away from home. In Port Alberni, I just wish that we had
stores you would see in a mall, like SportChek or Footlocker, things like that. I don't have any
non-negotiables for where I want to live, but what you described of urban living definetly sounds a
lot more enjoyable to me over rural living, plus I have experienced rural living my whole life so a
change will probably be nice. I'm ready to move on to the Part 2 of this part, and you'll also be
happy to know my teacher informed me we are the most progressed in the program in my class!
AidenMentor 2022-02-21, 09:59: Hi Aiden, That's so cool what a coincidence! Also I'm super glad that
you're teacher is happy with our progress. You seem like a great student so I'm not surprised at
all. I've provided my answers for part 2 of the conversation, so you can use those as a guide to
answer your own. You can message me in part 2 of the conversation if you have any questions! Avery",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-11, 03:56: Hi Aiden, I am so excited to meet you! I was looking at your profile and
it seems that we have a lot in common. I was a university varsity volleyball player for 5 years so I
definitely share your love for sports and being active. Working out and training is still a passion
of mine so I would love to hear more about your workout routine. It seems that your biggest goal
throughout this mentoring process is gaining some insight into potential future careers. I
completely understand the desire to have a job that allows you to have a work/life balance so that
you can continue to enjoy your hobbies. You also said that academics come easily to you, so maybe
looking into post-secondary education would be a good fit for you. We'll explore that further as we
work through the program. Your teacher has given us a couple of options in terms of which
conversation we start with. Are you most interested in ""rural to urban living"", ""entering the job
market"", or ""paying for school""? I look forward to hearing from you Aiden! AveryMentee 2022-02-11,
14:27: Hi Avery, Nice to meet you too, I'm glad I got somebody who has stuff in common with me,
especially someone who also likes to work out. Since you said you wanted to hear more about my
workout routine, I get most of my activity with hockey and basketball practices and games, but I try
to hit weights when I can, and I also like HIIT workouts, mainly with cycling or running. I
definetly want to gain insight into potential future careers. A job with a work/life balance would
be good, but I also want something with big pay. Looking into post secondary will definetly be
something I have to do, even if I don't want to, my parents have said post-secondary will be
mandatory. And for the topic selection, I think I'm most interested in rural to urban living topic.
Glad to have a mentor on here, AidenMentor 2022-02-12, 04:43: Hi Aiden, It sounds like you're really
active! Do you have any goals in terms of playing hockey or basketball at a high level? A lot of
colleges and universities in BC and across Canada offer athletic scholarships and it can be a huge
help when finding ways to pay for school. I definitely understand the desire for having a
well-paying job. However, it's also important that you focus on a career that you are going to be
passionate about. You mentioned that your parents want you to go to university. Is this something
that you want as well or do you have any other potential ideas? I have opened the first conversation
surrounding the transition from rural to urban living. I will send a separate message with more
information about our first module. Talk soon, Avery",,,,"Mentor 2022-02-22, 02:04: Hi Aiden, I've watched the film ""Mobilize"" just like you will and I'm
going to share some general take-aways I had from it. After you watch it, fill out the questions
that appear above the link and we will have a discussion about your responses together. The
soundtrack of the film was integral to bringing out emotion in the viewer. As the pace of the music
increased I began to feel more stressed and overwhelmed as the film transitioned to depicting a more
urban way of life. I also like that the film displayed different versions of rural living as no
community is the same. From the forest to the arctic we got to see how Indigenous people used the
resources around them to thrive in their rural communities. It also helped me to sympathize with the
Indigenous peoples of Canada as they were forced to leave their homes and adopt a more urban,
colonized way of life that was so different then what they were used to. My only greivance with the
film is that it depicted urban living in a some what negative light. I think living in an urban
center is not overwhelming or stressful for everyone and that it is very dependent on the
individual. I can't wait to read your responses! AveryMentee 2022-02-22, 17:13: Hey Avery, I think
that the director was trying to tell us that life out in the country is superior than living in the
city. As you said with the soundtrack, the soundtrack got more intense when it got to the city,
communicating the idea that the country is more calm than the ""chaotic"" city. There wasn't anything
I related to in the movie, and as you also said, with the soundtrack, it began to make me feel sort
of overwhelmed when it got to the city, as the director made it much more intense. This movie does
not match my feeling towards the possibility of moving to the city for university. The movie is
""antagonising"" the city, but I kind of want to move to the city, as I'm not a big fan of rural
areas. -AidenMentor 2022-02-23, 02:36: Hi Aiden, I really respect that you were willing to speak
against the movie and explain how your viewpoint differs from that of the filmmakers. It's
definitely hard to have an appreciation for something (in your case, a rural community) when you
haven't had the oppurtunity to explore our options. I think that your desire to leave your town and
see other parts of Canada or the world is completely natural! For our next step, we have the
opportunity to do either/both of the extension activitites or complete our conversation and move on
to a new topic. Maybe ask your teacher what they would prefer and we'll go from there! Talk soon,
Avery","Mentor 2022-03-29, 17:59: Hi Aiden, The second portion of ""entering the job market"" is about the
interview process. I have done countless interviews in the last couple years from coffee shops, to
science programs in elementary schools to more recently when I completed my medical school
interviews! Perhaps my favourite interview was for a youth science camp called EUREKA!, in which the
applicants had to instruct one another on how to properly build a machine without being able to
actually see each other! In recent years, interviews have shifted from the typical ""tell us about
yourself"" to being more interactive, allowing applicants to really demonstrate their intangible
skills. Have you had an interview experience yet? If so, was it a positive or negative experience
and why? Look forward to hearing from you! AveryMentor 2022-04-01, 20:17: Hi Aiden, Where do you
hope to travel this year? What college did you interview at? When we work through the modules, let's
try to make sure we respond in the most recent conversation we're working on. That will make it more
clear for both of us. I've opened the extension activity ""making a resume"" so you can get started on
it! Avery",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-04-13, 16:55: Hey Avery, sorry for the late reply. I have completed my resume. It is not
really tailored to a specific job, but I feel as if it is well done. I will post it to my portfolio.
-AidenMentee 2022-04-13, 16:56: Hey Avery, I think I sent the resume but I'm not 100% sure it was
sent. Tell me if it wasn't -AidenMentor 2022-04-14, 19:02: Hi Aiden, I was able to access your
resume. Great work! I have some suggestions and aspects of your resume that I really liked that I
will go into below. 1) Objective: I think having an objective statement is important as it makes
your intentions and what you want out of the job clear. You talk about desirable qualities in your
opening statement, but you don't list any right away. I would suggest actually listing a few of your
best qualities and then highlighting those in the rest of the resume below. 2) Work Experience:
You're in a stage of life in which you won't have a ton of job experience yet, but the hockey
officiating is a great start. When describing your officiating job you can be even more specific
about the different responsibilities you had (i.e resolving conflict, encouraging young athletes, or
working with other officiants). This will give employers a better understanding of the skills you
gained from this position. *The same comments for work experience also apply to volunteer
experience. 3) Layout of the resume: I thought the format of your resume was really well done and
easy to read. When employers are going through dozens of resumes, having one that can be easily
understood and read through is essential. You could consider combining some categories such as
achievements and certifications as that might shorten your resume a little bit, but that's a
personal choice for you to make. Overall, you did an awesome job and I'm impressed! I have opened
the next extension activity and you can get started whenever you're ready. Avery",,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-24, 18:02: Hi Avery, My teacher said we have to do both of the extension questions.
One of my family traditions is pancakes for breakfast on sunday, assuming everybody is available.
It's not that special anymore but when I was a kid it was special cause I guess I really liked
pancakes. I guess a plan to take this with me away from home would be to hit up a restaurant for
pancakes every know and then, even though they wouldn't taste as good as at home. - AidenMentor
2022-03-02, 01:33: Hi Aiden, I'm really sorry for my slow response! I didn't get the usual
notification that I had a message from you, but I should have checked the website regardless. What a
sweet tradition! Something I loved to do in university with my friends was to go out for breakfast
on the weekend, so maybe that's something you could adopt as a tradition that reminds you of
home.Mentor 2022-03-07, 13:20: Hi Aiden, How are you coming along on the easing traditions extension
activity? AveryMentee 2022-03-07, 16:58: Hey Avery, I've been busy and wasn't at school for part of
last week, but I will send get the Easing Traditions done. - Aiden",,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 01:35: Hi Aiden, You can move onto the easing traditions extension activity
whenever you're ready! AveryMentee 2022-03-07, 17:05: Hi Avery, Easing Traditions has been saved to
my portfolio. -AidenMentor 2022-03-07, 20:26: Hi Aiden, I'm really glad to hear that! Nice work.
Which conversation would you like to move onto next? We can either start with entering the job
market, or paying for school. AveryMentee 2022-03-09, 16:50: Hi Avery, can we do entering the job
markey next? Thanks - AidenMentee 2022-03-28, 17:22: Hi Avery, Sorry for the late reply, I was on
spring break and I wasn't checking my school email. Anyways, I do not currently have a resume, but I
have some ideas of what I would put on there. I don't have any ideas for a job or volunteering
opprutunity in the summer, and somebody that I'd ask to help me with my resume is my Mom, since she
does know a fair bit about me. And for transferable skills, I would say language is one, as I went
through french immersion and learned to speak french over 10 years, I've noticed it makes
understanding other languages easier such as spanish as they are similar. I have also learned how to
interact with different types of people through many different sports, and finally I would say I
have leaned to interact with younger people through volunteer coaching.Mentee 2022-03-30, 17:05: Hi
Avery, The break was good, I mainly had some hockey and went to watch the Canucks. I might try to
get a summer job, but usually I'm pretty busy in the summer with hockey and basketball camps, and
will hopefully be able to travel somewhere this year. I'll reply to the second part now.Mentee
2022-03-30, 17:08: Hi Avery, The only interview I had was for a college school a couple hours away.
In the interview I was mainly asked questions about how I feel about different things relevant to
the location. I would not say it was a negative experience, but I apparently did well!Mentee
2022-04-04, 16:57: Hi Avery, It was a college preperatory school not a college haha. Brentwood
College School. And I'm hoping to travel out east so I can see extended family. I'll go get started
on the making a resume activity. - AidenMentor 2022-04-07, 13:48: Hi Aiden, My mistake, that makes a
lot more sense haha. How is the resume coming along?","Mentee 2022-04-20, 17:19: Hey Avery, I'm not gonna lie, the interview that me and my friend did was
not taken 100% seriously, but we did get it done. I'd say the question that was the most challenging
was what are my salary expectations, as it wasn't a real job I was interviewing so there wasn't
really a real answer for that. For that question, I would most likely have to do research for that
question. My physical presence was certainly not professional since it was just with my friend. In a
real interview I would have to be alot more ""put together."" I was not nervous whatsoever but I doubt
that will happen in a real interview. Breathing strategies would probably be a way to combat that. I
would say three strenghts I displayed were the speed of my answers, my not being nervousness and
going into depth. I need to work on being more professional and not being as silly. -AidenMentor
2022-04-21, 14:38: Hi Aiden, Is there a way for me to see your interview? Did you attach it to your
portfolio? I'd love to see it, plus I might be able to do a better job providing feedback!Mentor
2022-04-21, 14:44: In terms of the summary you gave about the mock interview, I think you did a
great job considering the circumstances. I have been in a similar situation and I know it can be
difficult to take the experience seriously when you're just interacting with your friend. Confidence
is really important in an interview so I'm glad you felt relaxed. While I think coming up with
answers quickly is a skill set, employers definitely do not mind you taking an extra second to
formulate a response that really reflects how you would handle the situation they've presented to
you. I'm glad you had fun doing the mock interview and it seems like you were able to gain some
insight into how you would handle the real thing!",,,,,,,,,
1047551823,1047554062,2/9/2022 16:31,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-17, 16:45: I live in a small town called Port Alberni. I like living in a smaller
town because a lot of people know each other and everyone is usually very nice to eachother. When it
gets to about 9:00pm not many people are driving around, even the main roads are bare, I like this
because its peaceful and easier to fall asleep. Living in a small town as a teenager is awesome,
another reason i like it is because it is easier to know your way around, and to get from one side
of town to the other is probably a 20 minute drive. Something i dont like about this place is theres
not much to do here. We have had the same pool and museum for a long time, so as everyone is getting
older, all that stuff is getting more and more boring. Another thing i dont like is we rarely get
new things. When you first moved was it hard to get used to it all? Was it overwhelming?Mentor
2022-02-18, 16:42: Since birth, I have been living in Metro Vancouver. Unfortunately, I do not have
experience moving from a rural to urban area. However, during my K-12 education, I went to a small
private school in Maple Ridge. I spent most of my schooling with people I knew since I was six. I
did not have much experience with meeting new people, making new friends or attending large events.
I have always been a shy person and I was able to get through school without having to take
initiative in forming relationships. As a result, transitioning to post-secondary was slightly
overwhelming. All of a sudden I had to attend courses with 300 students, participate in class
discussions, talk to professors and teaching assistants, meet with an advisor for course selections
and attend workshops for studying strategies. Every day I was connecting or seeing new people.
Luckily, my university has smaller classes for students majoring in Education. I was glad that I
enrolled in a first year Education course that only had 30 students. There I met a third-year
student who was from a rural area: Sechelt, B.C. She was very nice and understanding. I felt
comfortable talking with her and she helped me work with other students in the class. Slowly, I got
more used to the norms of university and forming relationships with other students and working with
professors.Mentee 2022-02-22, 17:07: Hey Iris, here is a few questions I came up with for you: Would
you say in post-secondary you have to have connections and relationships with other people to
succeed? As a high school student there is a lot of dumb drama around the school, does
post-secondary deal with any drama and/or rumours.? After university do you have any thoughts of
moving outside Metro Vancouver? Would you recommend taking smaller classes compared to the huge
classes in University?Mentor 2022-02-23, 18:38: Hey Adora, thanks for asking these questions: 1)
Would you say in post-secondary you have to have connections and relationships with other people to
succeed? Yes, you want to open up to other students who have similar backgrounds, interests and good
study strategies. Don't be afraid to connect with older students, they often have more experience
and can give you advice. Also, it is important to learn how to ask your professors or teaching
assistants (older students in your university courses who help you with coursework and mark your
assignments and exams) for help. In addition, you want to connect with the librarian and attend
learning workshops offered by your university. These workshops can help with developing good study
strategies, presentation skills and reading and writing skills as well as learning to research and
cite your sources. Another important person is your advisor, this is the person who can help with
course selections and building your degree. Finally, it is good to keep an eye out for volunteer,
co-op education or internship opportunities, these might be on your program's website or in email
newsletters. Having connections with professors can help you apply for positions since they can be a
reference. 2) As a high school student there is a lot of dumb drama around the school, does
post-secondary deal with any drama and/or rumours? In university, you do not have as much drama as
you would in high school. The university environment is quite large so it is not possible for all
the students to know each other. However, if you do end up in a toxic friend group, you could still
experience drama. I would say you have a better chance of avoiding drama at university by being
careful when making friends. If you notice that your friend group has the habit of gossiping, then I
would rethink staying in the group. 3) After university do you have any thoughts of moving outside
Metro Vancouver? I don't think I have any plans to leave Metro Vancouver. I like the location. My
family is here and I don't want to be far away from them. I don't expect to travel outside the
country since there is COVID. 4) Would you recommend taking smaller classes compared to the huge
classes in University? Yes, I would recommend taking smaller classes in your first year. You have a
better chance of building relationships with classmates and your professor. Often in smaller
Education classes, you get to do more group assignments and solo writing assignments. Since the
course has fewer students, your professor can provide more assistance. The smaller classes may or
may not have exams. With the large classes, you may or may not have a group assigment and usually
you do a few solo assignments and take two exams.Mentee 2022-03-01, 16:52: Hey Iris! thank you so
much for answering all my questions so well, I will take all of this information into consideration
moving forward. And to be completely honest, I cant think of anymore questions to ask under the
rural to urban at the momentMentor 2022-03-01, 17:04: Hi Adora, no problem. I am happy to share my
experience with you. If you would like we can move onto part 2 of the From Rural To Urban
conversation.Mentee 2022-03-01, 18:06: That sounds like a plan!Mentee 2022-03-09, 17:21: Hey Iris! I
just checked out that short video (I think.) Your insights made it easier to follow along with the
film, at first I thought I was watching the wrong one, until I saw a type writter and the subway
system. I still dont really know where i want to go for post-secondary yet. I do have my family, my
friends and my boyfriend here, and back in elemantary i refused to switch schools because I didnt
want to leave all these people I knew and go somewhere where I dont know anyone. I was also faced
with the choice of moving out of Port Alberni to Alberta during elementary, but we never ended up
going through with it. I think back on this a lot because it makes me wonder how things could have
or would have gone if I was willing to switch elementary schools or even move to Alberta. Looking
back on it now, even the transition from grade 7 in elementary to grade 8 in highschool was a big
and scary. But I am in grade 10 now and I am not close friends with one person from my old grade 7
class. So as much as I am nervous for post-secondary, I am also kind of excited. Because I am
getting oldering and it is a new opportunity. I dont really know how I feel about moving to a whole
new place mainly because I like Port Alberni and how beautiful it is here, but I am aware that there
are better places I could go than just the post-secondary here.Mentee 2022-03-17, 01:15: Hey Iris!
Here's a little update: Actually a lot has kind of picked up in my life. I got into contact with a
teacher who studies psychology at my school and set up a time to talk. We talked about what it is
going to take to get into psychology(openmindedness, patience, etc.) and a university, in Toronto,
that would be good to look into in a year or two if I'm still interested in psychology then. We
continuted to talk on to other paths I could take, like teaching, and how psychology knowledge could
take enhance your understanding of your students. Second off, I got time to sit down with my boss
and discuss becoming a ""crew trainer,"" which is one step above ""crew"" and one step below ""shift"" or
""swing manager"" and what respondsibilities it will take to become one and contine to maintain being
one. I also baked a pie and made potato chowder. both from scratch today for my family and I, and
painted a picture last night. Just feeling kind of motivational and proud of myself.Mentee
2022-03-17, 01:20: I believe if I continue with my goals and make some new habits of things in my
life right now, that I can be completely capible of moving somewhere to attend a univerisy or moving
somewhere in general. I would just have to mentally ready myself for such a big change, but
regardless I think I will be ready for it.Mentee 2022-03-30, 17:51: Hey Iris. We are back in class
from the break. Next year I am taking a psychology 11 course and a family and relationships 11 class
because both classes sounded interesting. From there I can see if psycology is still something I am
interested in, and if it is then I can continue to talk with my teachers and the support at the
school about my next decision, and use some of the information you gave me of course.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-10, 16:44: Hi Adora, My name is Iris. I will be your mentor. I am 27 years old. I am
currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Educational Psychology. I am interested
in topics like: learning, development, support for first-year university students, peer mentoring
and first-generation students. I have been busy working on my research project, which involves
interviewing first-year first generation university students about their experiences with peer
mentoring. First-generation students are students whose parents do not have a four-year university
degree. These students have a more challenging time adjusting to university and require support. I
am excited to work with you 😁 . I have read your profile and I saw that you are interested in
becoming a teacher or psychologist. Most of my academic experiences are in education and psychology.
I hope that I will be able to assist you as much as I can. Let me know if you have any questions
about how to plan for university to get these careers in the future. Also, I saw that you like to
listen to music and to read. What kind of music do you listen to? What kind of books do you read?
Your story about getting a job at McDonalds is very interesting 😯. If you are comfortable, I would
like to hear about your journey, it seems you overcame hardship with your first job and you are
doing well with your job at McDonalds.Mentee 2022-02-11, 14:13: Hi, Iris! Its good to hear that you
got through everything fine being a first-generation student. Neither of my parents have gone to
university, my mom has been taking some college courses recently in last few years but I definetly
want to go to post-secondary close to after highschool, and something that I've always had a hard
time with is going and doing things on my own. I noticed you are studying educational psychology, if
you could give someone who is looking into same field, some points of advice, what would it be?
-AdoraMentor 2022-02-11, 17:27: Hi Adora, It is nice to be able to connect with a fellow
first-generation student. I am glad to hear that you would like to learn to be more independent
prior to attending post-secondary. Some points of advice that I believed would be useful for someone
entering the field of educational psychology is: 1) to develop strong reading, writing, presentation
and research skills 2) to develop good study habits and strategies 3) to practice time management 4)
to not be afraid of failure 5) to connect with professionals who have similar interests (teachers,
professors, psychologists, counsellors) 6) to volunteer in different multiple settings (schools, day
care, tutoring, mentoring, camps) 7) to research different career paths in education and psychology
since both fields have a wide variety of choices 8) to practice lifelong learning 9) to keep an open
mind and try new things, because sometimes you need to try something that you don't like to find out
what you are truly interested inMentee 2022-02-15, 16:33: Honestly, i missed the whole second half
of your first message until i looked back now.. My music taste has made a huge change from a few
years ago to now. I used to listen to pop or whatever was on the radio but now I listen to a lot of
old stuff. My favourite band is probably 3 Days Grace. About the books a read, a few years ago my
mom bought a book series because one of her friends let me read a few books that were a part of it
and its a great series so we bought the whole thing, I believe I am on the 7th book, the series is
called House of Night and it is a series about young adult vampire-themed fantasy novels by American
author P. C. Cast and her daughter Kristin C. My first ""real"" job was at a place called Healthy
Habits (before this I delivered news papers) and its a local bussiness and they didnt really show me
what i was supposed to be doing, I got a small tour, but it kept getting interrupted. But on my
fifth shift (also mothers day) the boss pulled me aside and said they ""needed more of a self
starter."" Unfortunately I did enjoy that job quite a bit and I was proud of it. But I've been
working at Mcdonalds since June or July of 2021, and i've already talked to my boss about an
opportunity to become more than just crew (crew trainer, shift manager, etc.) And about the list of
advice, was there anything that you had a hard time with? One that seems it could be hard for me
personally would be 4) to not be afraid of failure. But I've been trying to overcome a lot and I'm
sure that could be another goal.Mentor 2022-02-15, 17:16: Hi Adora, No problem. Thanks for sharing
your interests and your work experience. I'm not familiar with 3 Days Grace. I usually listen to
Korean or Mandarian music. I have not read House of Night before. However, I do like watching
Chinese fantasy TV shows, which are often based on books. Your experience with working shows
determination and growth. Being let go at a job is not an easy experience. It seems at Mcdonalds you
have learned to be more confident and take more initative in your workplace. I think #4 and #9 on
the list are two things I had the most trouble with. Being a FGS, I really wanted to make my family
proud. My extended family has some members whose parents do have a four-year university degree and
they always made me feel insecure. I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform well and to avoid
failure. I find that pressure was deterimental to my physical and mental health because I was
pushing myself too hard. I ended up with major burnout and had to take a year off graduate school. I
have resolved these issues recently. My mother, brother, thesis supervisor and professors are all
very supportive so I was able to balance self-care and school. I am striving for a healthier
lifestyle: getting a balanced diet, taking breaks and getting more physical activity. Related to my
fear of failure was avoiding trying new things. During my final year of university, I felt that
becoming a teacher was more in my comfort zone so I volunteered at two schools. I did enjoy teaching
kids, but I found myself more interested in learning about how people learn and socialize. In my
courses, I also noticed that I really liked reading research and a few professors suggested that I
should go to graduate shool. Thus, I made a sudden shift to apply for graduate school. This was the
first time I took a risk in my education. I only had 3 months to apply. I felt unprepared and I was
scared to be rejected, but I went forward with my application. I went to several workshops and did
my best to apply. My application process taught me that the fear of rejection is not worth the
regret of not trying something. I find that I have learned to get out of my comfort zone and take
more initiative in finding new opportunities to apply my knowledge and creativity. I used to only
connect with people at my university, now I am making use of the internet and social media to meet
new people in my field. In fact, this mentor opportunity is one of the ways I am getting out of my
comfort zone and meeting new people and experiencing new things.Mentee 2022-02-15, 17:39: Actually
recently I have also been looking into a healthier life style, like in class we are working on a
bullet journal. I've also been trying to go for walks more and to wake up a bit earlier everyday,
and try to stay motivated rather then sitting around on my phone. Something else that I want to work
on is figuring out about my future and what I need to do or where I need to go. Because for example,
I dont really know what post-secondary I want to go to. I also turned 16 on New Year's and I have
definitley been procrastinating about taking my L test and getting my L.Mentor 2022-02-15, 17:54:
Glad to hear that you are aiming for a healthier lifestyle as well. We can work together to help you
find out some potential post-secondary institutions. I think it helps to create a schedule to deal
with proscratination. If you are dreading to do something, I find it helps to schedule an hour per
day to do some work on it. To start don't put too much detail on what you want to complete. Simply
just pick up the book and read. Once you build a habit of reading the book at a certain time, you
will gradually work on it more. It's good to take notes and practice tests before your official
test. When you are ready to move on, let me know which Conversation you'd like to work on first. I
believe your teacher wants us to do From Rural to Urban, Entering the Job Market and Paying for
School. Double check with your teacher on which conversation we should work on first.Mentee

Iris! I am ready for the Rural to Urban conversation now!Mentor 2022-02-17, 15:49: Hey Adora, I just
unlocked the From Rural to Urban conversation. Let me know if you can access it.",,,,"Mentor 2022-03-03, 17:15: Hi Adora, I have a few insights from watching this short documentary
'Mobilize'. The following are some themes that I noticed while looking at the relationship between
the city and the country: 1) Activity vs passivity Office work in the city Hands-on work in the
country 2) Nature vs technology Cutting down trees, travelling in canoes and developing utensils
from nature in the country Typewriter and subways in the city 3) Slow vs fast movement Enjoying
nature and the simpler things in life in the country Rushing to get to one place to another,
neglecting certain aspects in life to achieve certain goals in the city 4) Open vs crowded Forest
and water in the country Tall and crowded buildings in the city 5) Effort to develop or build things
Using wood in the country Using steel in the city 6) Collectivism vs individualism City life
prioritizes and prefers individualism People compete and focus on personal goals Country life
prioritizes and refers collectivism People work together to achieve goals as a community In what
ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about
possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling?Mentor 2022-03-10, 03:43: Hey Adora, Glad
my notes were useful to you. Thank you for sharing your past experience of dealing with the
struggles of deciding to move to a new location. I am glad that you were able to reflect on the
emotions and thoughts that you had during this experience. I appreciate your openness and honesty
with facing the fear and nervousness of moving to a place where you do not know anyone. Now that you
are older, you are learning to see the positive side of trying new things and looking for new
opportunities. I think that once you find a post-secondary school that fits your needs, you will
gain more confidence in moving out of Port Alberni. You will be fascinated and intrigued with the
new people that you will meet, the opportunities that you will find and the new things that you will
learn. I think it would be worth your time to research potential schools and their locations to get
a sense of what you want for your post-secondary journey. You can look at virtual campus tours and
check out your potential university's city.Mentor 2022-03-17, 02:41: Hi Adora, I hope you are
enjoying your spring break. Thanks for sharing your update with me. I am glad to hear that you have
started to make connections with professionals who studied or worked in your field of interest. To
determine your interest in psychology, it would be useful to start thinking about taking a
psychology course within your final years of high school. In the B.C. education system, you could
have the option of taking Advanced Placement (AP) courses. These are college and university courses
available for students to take while they’re still in secondary school. You could speak to your
school counsellor and your teacher who studied psychology about AP Psychology and see if it is a
good fit for you. I think it would be helpful for you to learn about psychology before you choose it
as your major for university. If your school does not offer AP Psychology you can take it online.
You can also talk to your school counsellor and your teacher who studied psychology about these
options: 1) EdX is an online learning platform that offers courses in various disciplines. This
month, the University of British Columbia is offering a few introductory AP psychology courses on
EdX: https://www.edx.org/bio/steven-j-barnes. To the get the most out of the courses, you would need
to pay. If you want to take the course for free you have a limited amount of time to access the
materials, which would make it hard to learn the content. 2) Coursera is similar to EdX. The
University of Toronto and Yale University are both offering an online introductory psychology
course: https://www.coursera.org/search?query=introduction%20to%20psychology&amp;. You can access
these courses through the free audit option: ""When you audit a course you'll be able to see most of
the course materials for free, but you won't be able to submit certain assignments or get grades for
your work. You won't get a Course Certificate, but you can pay for one at any time during or after
the course. If you pay for a Certificate, you may need to complete more coursework that wasn’t
available in the audit version."" 3) If you are looking for free online college-level psychology
courses here is an introductory psychology course from MIT Open Courseware:
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-00sc-introduction-to-psychology-fall-2011/index.htm.
You can study independently and at your own pace about the fundamentals of psychology. There is a
free textbook, lecture videos and slides, small-group discussion sections, three exams (study
guides, practice exams and exam solutions) and writing assignments. There is no rush to take a
psychology course right away. I am sharing these options with you to give you an idea of what you
could do to prepare for studying psychology at the post-secondary level. Your teacher is correct
about using psychology to better inform teaching and learning. This would be more in the area of
Educational Psyhology, in which you apply psychology concepts to educational settings. Also, there
are psychology courses that focus on children or adolescent development if you are interested in
these age groups. I am glad to hear that you are making progress at your job. I wish you all the
best with your position. It is nice to hear that you are spending time with family and practicing
self-care. It is important to take a break and be around others and do things that you like. I am
happy that you are feeling proud and motivated.Mentor 2022-03-31, 18:46: Hey Adora, glad to hear
that you are back in class. I hope you had a restful spring break. I am happy to hear that you have
already planned to take Psychology 11 and a family and relationships 11 course. These courses will
be beneficial to your future endeavours in psychology or education. I believe you are doing a great
job. It is good that you are planning for your future and actively considering and seeking support
from your school. Would you like to move on to the extension activity? As for your messages, I
noticed that you sent them from the From Rural to Urban part 1 message box. This might lead to
missed messages and miscommunication. It would be best if you could send your messages on the most
recent section we are working on. For example, the next section we will be working on is the
extension activity so we will be using the send message box from that page.Mentee 2022-04-01, 15:21:

Hello Brandon, First-year was really stressful. A lot of content, courses are heavy. I would
recommend only taking 2-3 first semester and mixing the heavy science with some literature. For
example, anatomy with psychology. Or courses that have the same materials/overlapping materials. For
example human motor with stats. I love high volume training, I sometimes go back to the foundations
and basics. I am super picky with my form. It is going pretty well, I am thinking of putting in some
more functional training to improve my badminton performance. As well as losing some weight. The
pandemic has made it hard to lose weight and stay consistent in the gym hahhaha. Hope school is
going well for you! LindaMentee 2022-02-28, 15:30: Hey Linda, Thanks for sharing and giving advice
from your first year of post-secondary. I will definitely try to mix up my heavy science classes
with some literature, so I won't get stressed. I have been really inconsistent going to the gym,
since the restrictions of gyms being closed I've been lacking in going to the gym. I also love
high-volume lifting. Is there any other advice for post-secondary? How's school going for you?

13:25: Hello Brandon, I am currently on a student loan. I would advise you to reach out to your
school early on, book an appointment with a financial advisor. I am guilty of not bringing my own
food and spending a lot on food on campus. We have a Starbucks and Tim Hortons. I had a part-time
job, it was stressful juggling the job on top of the school. I would recommend doing part-time
school if you would like to have a part-time job. Plan your calendar early on, important dates for
school and personal life really helped. Taking days off to yourself is important to reset and start
fresh. There are a lot of things I have purchased that were wants and not needs. I believe that it
depends on your income. If you have extra pocket money, it is okay to buy your wants sometimes. It
can be a reward for your hard work. I think I needed to budget my money more. For example, how much
should I treat myself a week on school food or restaurants near the school? What is the estimated
amount of money I can spend? For my credit card, I have set monthly alerts, I am pretty sure there
is also the option of automatic payment. I would check the payment date and keep notes/have an alert
on my calendar for school payments after choosing my courses. Note: if you are on a student loan, I
would recommend applying 2 weeks before choosing courses. (For student loans, you need to reapply
every semester) The textbooks are extremely expensive, there are facebook groups, other third party
webs that sell used textbooks. Some courses, textbooks are not required. Make sure to check your
course outline. Hope this helps! LindaMentor 2022-03-08, 13:27: PS, For gym motivation, plan it
ahead early in the day. At the end of the day, you will be exhausted and have no energy to go. Also,
don't think about it, just go. Once you are in the gym, you will just do it. Find your core why, why
am I going to the gym? What are your 3 main goals? Remind yourself that. LindaMentee 2022-03-10,

going well for you! After watching the video above ""The Creative Process"", the idea of genuinity
sparking interest stood out to me. Subconsciously, our behaviour changes when we talk about things
that personally relate to us. As I was watching the video, it came to my attention that when we
speak, discuss genuine interests, even our body motion changes. In my case, that is cars. To many
other people, they are a form of transportation (from A to B), but for me it hits different. This
also relates to the fist film maker, in which her idea focuseson intention, and answering the
question ""why?"". I relate to that, subconsciously we would do anything that makes up happy, but
being aware of the right and wrong diverts our main intention of happiness. What about you? What
ideas stood out to you in the video? Do you have any question about the ideas discussed? I am curios
to what you think! I hope to hear from you soon! (P.S: In terms of unlocking the next acitivity, I

as a third year university student I definitely relate to this. During my first semester at UBC, I
was satisfied with taking on more challenges coming from high school. I decided to take five
courses. I noticed that I had less time to do the things I like, the things that recharge my
momentum and refresh me so that I am more productive in upcoming tasks. After that, I promised
myself to take a lighter course load, which enabled me to join a soccer team (intramurals) (""A
healthy mind is in need of a healthy body""). And now 2 years later, I am currently taking four
courses. Even though I was struggling my first year, I tried to find the root of the problem and
obtain a solution. Taking less courses rewarded me with higher marks and allowed me to focus my view
on academics in a positive way (ensuring I take courses I like). I listened to advice from past
students that all take fewer courses! Any stressful events you had to cope with recently? What means
do you use for self-care? How do you know you are in need of a break? I hope to hear from you
soon!Mentee 2022-03-03, 14:28: for well being and self care i could say i relate to this topic
because im not the most focused in school and and i decided to take courses that require a lot of
studying but i soon learned its easy to say something rather than do it. concidering i was also
playing two sports alongside (volleyball, basketball). but to help myself i changed a few courses
around and was able to help myself in ways of getting better at school and having time to play the
sports i like. outside of that i heard its mid terms for you guys, so good luck with that! this
monday my team will be headed to vancover to play in provincials for AA senior boys basketball what
are some things you do to help with studying? like if you cant focus or things along those
lines.Mentor 2022-03-04, 17:05: I totally agree with you, it is difficult to juggle sports and
courses that require a lot of studying. In my experience, I took advance placement courses in my
last year of high school, which shifted my focus from joining the soccer team. It is definitely
easier to say something rather than do it. All of us mention things that we would like to do but do
not end up doing everything. It is important to have good, logical expectations so that we do not
push ourselves to a point that we neglect self care. Sometimes it is nice to have someone that you
can work together with, keeping each other in track, and focused, it helps ticking off the things
you say that you want to do. Oh yeah! It is midterm season, trying my best to take care of my self
during this stressful season! Good luck on your game this Monday! Make sure to let me know how it
goes! When I study, I try to put away things that distract me in a completey different room. For
example, I leave my phone in a different room, it goes along with the saying ""out of sight, out of
mind!"". Moreover, I try to study with other people that are focused, it helps create a productive
environment. Moreover, I try to plan ahead of time, since if there are too many things to do at
once, I tend to lose focus. What are the strategies you use to help with studying? Have you found
some strategies to be more helpful than others?Mentee 2022-03-14, 15:30: hey hows it going, our

I can definitely relate to any stress you might be feeling with what to do post-grad. But I saw in
your profile that you want to be a mortician. That's so cool, how did you decide on that? I also saw
that you're a horror move buff! What are your top 3 favourite horror movies? I honestly like
watching them, but I usually get freaked out after that I need to sleep with all the lights on for a
few days haha. My major is in biology, so I've taken quite a few courses in bio and chem. If you

because it was the major which was most flexible for me to take other courses I would need for med
school because I really enjoy learning about cells, genetics, and proteins of the body. However, the
downfall to the degree is they make you take a lot of courses which personally I find (for my career
goals) are useless. For example, I recently had to take ecology and I am currently taking
astrobiology just because they are requisites to move forward in my bio degree, however, I am really
not interested in them and that makes sometimes studying really tough. UBC is for sure an amazing
place, it is like its own city inside a larger city (Vancouver). I know that sounds quite
intimidating but it makes for it to be a very lively campus and makes for many things to do. For
example, UBC has 2 gyms, two rock climbing walls, a skating rink where they have public skates,
tennis courts (indoor and outdoor), basketball courts, as well as many intermural teams and almost
every club you can think of. Another University near Vancouver is SFU and it is also very nice, they
have been working on building new residences and renovating some buildings. It is a smaller campus
and so for some people that is a really attractive trait. Of course, there are so many others, and
some on the island as well (Uvic). They all have their pros and cons so it really depends on the
career you would like to pursue and your preferences of campus location, etc. If you have any more
questions let me know. I just opened post-secondary considerations for you to look at and read. Let
me know what you think and if you have any questions. Talk to you soon! MichelleMentor 2022-03-11,

thanks for your patience. That's great that your taking biology, it seems like such an interesting
area to go into I'm curious about how you're liking it. It's definitely one of my favourite classes
right now, I don't know if it's what I want to do but I'd like to hear your opinion on it and how
you're enjoying it. I definetely agree, Vancouver feels the most homely out of anywhere I've been,
it strikes a great balance between urban and rural, it's a great place. I'd also like to hear about
UBC. What are your thoughts on the Universities near Vancouver? I could use some help navigating
that area. I think the conversation topics I'm most interested in are Post-Secondary Considerations,
Career Considerations and Dis- and Misinformation. We could maybe start with post-secondary though.

lots of the same interests, and VIU for kinesiology is my number one choice right now for a school.
I saw that you are a baker and I have so many quick and easy recipes and bake usually about once a
week. One dip recipe that is my favorite to go with fruit for any event since I was little is this
cream cheese dip, it's definitely not the healthy option but I would eat it straight out of the bowl
if I was allowed, I will attach it for you to see. I love nature and hiking but during the winter
from November to about March I can't really do much because we get lots and lots of snow so I stick
to snowboarding. I love the sky and views and take lots of pictures of it, they aren't high quality
or professional and I've been saving to get either a newer phone with a good camera or a camera
itself, haven't decided what one I want/ would benefit more from. I have a new picture of the sky

kinesiology student at Vancouver Island University and I’ll be your mentor on here! I'm in my final
semester, and currently going back and forth on whether I would like to pursue physiotherapy or
chiro. If you have any questions about either, let me know... I might have an answer for you! ""Words
to Live By"" --&gt; I grew up playing soccer and one thing someone told me that I still kinda carry
with me today is ""just aim to be 1% better than the athlete you woke up today."" I think it applies
to a lot of things (like being a student... it makes you think how you can constantly be better).
Change doesn't always have to be 0 to 100 and I don't think it should either! Let me know if you
have a quote you ""live by"" too :) A song that has been stuck in my head recently is actually
(several) from Alessia Cara! I refound her music and now it's on repeat haha. Do you have any
current or all time favourite artists? So many questions lol so I'll leave it at that! Shoot me a
message when you're around :)Mentee 2022-01-07, 23:23: I would love to talk about both of your
career choices and how your bachelor is going and if you think it's worth something for me to
pursue, my favorite artist lately has been Adele, for about a few months her songs are usually on
repeat, I like all genres of music and usually find one song play it on repeat until I find another
one.Mentor 2022-01-07, 23:31: You beat me to it!! I'm sorry I didn't see your message first! Oh yes
totally feel you on the cream cheese, BIG fan! I can't believe you know how to snowboard too, if I
had a hill closer to me that would 1000% be on the top of my list to learn. I took a lesson one time
and loved it but the closest spot is two hours from me :/ You must be excited though for Adele's
album, so many good songs on there! I know Easy On Me was one of the first singles released but
still has yet to get old for me hahah. Also the skyyyy, always love a good sunrise or sunset. Where
I am on the island, there's a lot of great spots imo :) Well since you're on top of the game here,
shall we dive into career choices and the kin degree? :) I could probably go on forever so is there
any specific thing you'd like me to share my experience on? I check MentorCity every few days so if
you don't get a reply from me right away, it will almost always be because I haven't checked back
yet! Sometimes school gets to be a lot, but I will always do my best to get back to you within 2-3
days. Or another option if you'd like is we could set a time once or twice a week to send messages
back and forth and then it's more of a ""live"" conversation? Whatever you think, let me know!Mentee
2022-01-07, 23:36: I'm good with whatever work with you! I have school and work aswell to keep track
of so messaging back and forth sounds good to me, my main career choice since I was little had
always been physio as I love being active and still love the school part, I'm just not sure what
bachelor I want to do as kinesiology looks really fun but if I choose to not get a masters I'm not
sure if I have options with it. I also don't know if I want to do 6 more years of school especially
with covid and expenses.Mentor 2022-01-07, 23:52: All valid concerns, so here's my two cents if
you're open to hear it. Some things I didn't fully know or understand when getting my degree: 1)
scholarships/bursaries! there are so so so many opportunities to get a little extra funding to
partially or fully cover your schooling! Whether through your school or outside, it'll take a bit of
time and research to find ones you feel you are a good candidate for but it absolutely pays off. 2)
you can do a bachelors degree in four years (maybe even a little less if you take extra credits in
the summer) or you can complete it over several years. the pace is actually totally up to you. the
only difference may be whether you're considered a full time student or a part time student. At VIU,
to be classified as a full time student, you need to be registered in 3 courses or 9 credits per
semester i believe. You can take anywhere from 3 to 6 courses a semester (depending on the number of
credits) to be considered full time. Part time is anything less than that. 3) same thing with
masters degrees, there are tons of funding opportunities out there! if it's something you truly want
to do, there are resources to assist you. and the sooner you know what you want to do (check!!), the
more time you have to find and access them 4) With masters programs, i was surprised to find out
that very few require a specific degree versus prerequisties. For example, physio programs in Canada
don't specify what degree you need to have.. most state that you need a bachelors degree in general
and then X credits in anatomy, physiology, statistics, psychology, etc. While a science degree would
be a little more diverse in what you can do beyond your undergraduate studies, a kinesiology degree
can be extremely flexible as well :)Mentee 2022-02-22, 14:03: Hey, sorry it has been a while, I have
been super busy with school and sports, all of my scholarships are due tomorrow, and I'm praying to

UNBC. Its finals season so life is pretty crazy at the moment! I am excited to get to chat with you
and hopefully answer as many questions as I can. I read that your dream career would be a sailor.
That is super interesting, for me personally, not being able to see land and being in the middle of
the ocean seems pretty terifying haha! Chat soon! :)Mentee 2021-12-15, 16:55: Hi Kanedie, I’m neil
ybanez from JL Crowe Secondary school, I'm currently in grade 12 and this is my last year and trying
to make the best memories out of it. I find it fascinating that you are going to go into the nursing
industry. I’d love to be a sailor and follow my grandparents path, but I think it's too late for
that now because I kind of took off the easiest class I can have and the one that works for welding
(trade school). I talked to my cousin's husband and apparently they usually get welders here and
there for some repairs in the massive boats they sail. I think that is actually nice and apparently
it's good money. I chose welding because it's a really fun job and it makes me more creative than
usual. I like seeing a project come to reality and building it myself. I’m really really sorry for
the delay here Ms.Kanadie - I was wondering what kind of lifestyle you chose because I know that
nursing can be expensive and tiring? -What advice would you give me since I’m going to move from
urban life to rural life ? -What should I really expect outside the school thing? - What's it like
to go to college and be separated from your family? - What was the inspiration you had when you were
at your lowest? -Whats the day to day basis as a college student? -How hard was it to do time
management for everything?Mentor 2021-12-20, 11:39: Hi Niel! :) Thank you for your reply! No needs
to apologize for the delay, I know that this is a busy time in the school year! I am currently
studying for my last final of my fall semester! Wow! Thank you for all the questions, I will answer
them all to the best of my ability. I was wondering what kind of lifestyle you chose because I know
that nursing can be expensive and tiring? You’re right! Nursing school is very tiring and expensive,
but it is very rewarding. I think I live a fairly average lifestyle for a university student. I have
a part-time job that I work 2-3 shifts a week at while I am in school and on days that I am not
working at my job I am busy with school! It is sometimes a hard balance trying to manage many
different roles, but it is doable. I think an important thing that needs to be priority in anyone’s
lifestyle is their mental health. School can easily become overwhelming, and it is easy to neglect
your mental health, but it is worth taking a break for studying or thinking a school for a few hours
or even a few days if that means it is bettering your mental health. I also try to get together with
friends once a week or once every few weeks because it is also important to maintain your social
life and get out of the house. -What advice would you give me since I’m going to move from urban
life to rural life ? Did you mean to say a rural life (small town) to urban life (city)? If so, the
transition is difficult at first just because it takes a little while to get use to just simply
being in a place that is bigger. But it does become much easier. know for a lot of people
transportation is an issue, so if that is a concern for you, I would recommend getting a bus pass
(which is often offered by the college/university as a part your tuition) and learning the bus
routes. However, if you have your own form of transportation, it is really not a limiting factor
because google maps is easily accessible and can help you get anywhere around town. There are
definitely many more opportunities presented being in a bigger place and many more things to do so
that is a plus. -What should I really expect outside the school thing? I think when you are moving
out and going to pose-secondary school is going to be a major thing that take up the majority of
your time and what you think about most often. However, along with moving out and going to school
there are additional responsibilities that you will have. I think expecting to learn how to budget
your money is going to be very beneficial because school is expensive and it is exciting being on
your own and having the ability to buy whatever you want, but I would just caution you as things
cost a lot of money and it is easy to blow though a few hundred dollars in a day. Another thing is
cooking meals independently for yourself now. I am not sure what your situation is like now, or if
you already cook your own meals, but I found it beneficial to make weekly meal plans so I know
exactly what I am going to have for supper every night. By doing that, it also makes it easier to
save money because you won’t be eating out for every meal. Living outside of home can be hard some
days, and it is totally normal to become homesick. Having some family or friends to talk to about
that really helps because a lot of others are probably feeling the same way. - What's it like to go
to college and be separated from your family? Personally, I moved out of home when I was 17 so I
have been separated from my family for quite awhile. I think I had a unique circumstance where I had
not been living with my mom since I was 14 (due to parents divorcing) and my dad was always away
working so I was used to being on my own already. I also moved out with my boyfriend, so I had an
additional support system with me while in school. I think as long as you have a good relationship
with your family and are able to rely on them as your support system the transition of being
separated while in school is much easier. Also, college has big breaks such as Christmas break and
reading break which you have 1-3 weeks off, so it makes it much easier to be able to go back home to
visit family or for them to come up to see you. I think an important thing to remember though is
that it may be hard to be separated from your family initially, but you are going to college to
better your life/ work towards your career. - What was the inspiration you had when you were at your
lowest? Wow, good question. School is tough and being independent with your life and finances and
all the other things that adults have to do is hard. It is easy to fall into a cycle of doubt and
insecurity and feeling like you are failing and just want to go back home. But what helped me get
out of that mindset is remembering why I am doing this and how proud of myself I am. It is inspiring
to see yourself succeed and beat all the negativity that you were facing whether it was internal or
external. I know the life in which I wish to have so I know these are the steps that I need to take
to get myself there. I do not want to speak on the experiences of others but it is still a constant
battle for me to be my own inspiration and get the negativity and self-doubt out of my head. For
some this is not something that just disappears instantly and then your good, sometimes it is an
ongoing daily battle. But knowing you are not alone and that there is a light at the end of whatever
tunnel you are in is what helps keeps me going. -What’s the day-to-day basis as a college student? I
think the day to day as a college student is very dependent on the individual. I think my situation
is unique because my courses are currently still online, so I have only 1 day a week of lectures
which are held online, and I have one day a week where I do to the school for my lab and then I also
am in clinical at the hospital so much weeks never look the same. However, if I look at how my
schedule was before classes were online it was much more consistent. When creating your schedule,
you are able to choose usually from a couple of options of when you would like to take your classes
during the week. For example, you let’s say you are taking a math class, you will have the options
of doing to class Monday from 11-1, Wednesday from 9-11, or Thursday from 4-6. So, essentially you
create your own school schedule for the semester. -How hard was it to do time management for
everything? For me personally, I am not the best at time management because I am a BIG
procrastinator. But I also write absolutely everything I have to do on my calendar so I can have a
visual reminder of what I need to get done. I think creating a routine and making daily/weekly to-do
lists for you may be beneficial as you can complete things in a priority order. Along with being
full-time in school, I also have a part-time job and I am in a relationship which comes with its own
struggles of balancing and time management. Having this added responsibility of having to being
independent for your time management is hard at times but it is completely doable. Also, since you
are in control of your schedule you are able to complete tasks as you see fit. I hope these answers
helped you a little! Look forward to chatting soon. :)Mentee 2022-01-10, 15:21: HI kaidi :) thanks
for answering all the questions, it really enlighten me and gave me ideas what to expect in college
and being independent im still nervous.. the one that really stands out the most to me was the
mentality that you have for keep moving forward no matter how negative it can be, I'm pretty sure
I'm going to carry that mentality anytime soon because it really motivated me so much, beating that
negativity and seeing yourself succeed sounds pretty amazing. Thank you so muchMentor 2022-01-10,
21:09: Hi Neil! I hope you had a nice Christmas break, I know I sure enjoyed the little break from
school! I'm glad that I was able to help you with some of the questions that you had. Being
independent is definietly the hardest transition I would say, and it is totally normally to be
feeling nervous about it. You are definietly not alone with that feeling. Thank you for the kind
words! It is rewarding seeing yourself succeed that is for sure and I am glad you were able to take
some of the things I said and bring them forward in your life. I do want to say not every day is
rainbows and it is ok to have just a bad/off day. Your mental health is of priority and if you ever
find you are struggling or are just not having the best of day that is totally fine. That is also
why I mentioned having a good support team is crucial so you are able to speak to someone if you are
ever feeling down. :) KenadieMentee 2022-01-15, 17:01: HI! Yes I had a good break from school, I
hope you had a good christmas break and a good start with the new year. now I'm kind of back to
school again so I'm pretty busy with my capstone project about my femur leg because I broke it or
tumour did haha, I'm just gathering some research about the tumour, gamma nail, and the therapy
part, I'm kinda running of ideas, Im thinking about doing the side effects of morphine to me
mentally and physically and thats about it.Mentor 2022-01-17, 22:26: Hello, I am glad to hear you
had a good break! I also had a good break and the new year has been wonderful! I have never heard of
a capstone project, but I googled it and it sounds very interesting! That is crazy that a tumor
broke your femur! Were you aware the tumor was there before your femur broke? I think choosing that
topic for your assignment is great because it is always nice to have previous knowledge/experience
of a topic you are studying so it can better direct your research. I think including treatments
along with therapy is a great addition to the topic! Is there any way you want me to help you along
with your reseach? Maybe help give you some insight/advice in regards using research articles?
Kenadie :)Mentee 2022-01-18, 16:36: HI, im glad you enoyed the break Ms. kaidi. yes I got some
questions, I was just wondering why cant I move my muscle after a leg surgery?, is it because the
anesthetic tecknique. does doctors switch you on hydromorphone from morphine to not get too addicted
?, how long does the side effect last in our system? thanks :)Mentor 2022-01-18, 18:43: Hi Niel, Are
you meaning you cannot move your leg muscle directly after sugery was completed? Or can you still
not move your leg muscle now from the surgery? I would assume you could not move your leg following
the surgey because the surgeon would have had to remove part of your femur and replace it to fill
where the tumor was growing. This leaves your femur very fragile and vulnerable to damage therefore
you would need to withstand weight and excessive movement of the leg for awhile. Did you recieve an
epidural for pain while in the hospital? That would be another reason why you would not be able to
move your legs because and epidural essentially numbs you from the waist down. Doctors will
typically use hydromorphone over morphine because it has a greater therapeutic effect with a smaller
dose compared to morphine. That being said, being able to take a smaller dose with having the same
therapeutic effects lessen the chances of negative side effects on the body, so I guess you could
say hydromorphone is ""safer"" than morphine. However, they are both narcotics and you can become
easily addicted to both. It depends on the dosage you have of hydromorphone as well as what route
the medication is being administered but typically if taken orally, it will have a therapeutic
effect for about 6 hours. I hope these answers helped :)Mentor 2022-02-09, 18:14: Hi Neil, Its been
awhile since our last chat, I'm just checking in to see how you are doing? Is there more topics in

meet you i also enjoy the beach very much and sports is a passion of mine. i am currently attending
Mount sentil secodary school as a grade 10 student. i dont have a very good idea of what i want to

the summer i enjoy doing lots of mountain and in the winter i snowboard. In school i really enjoy
math and doing fotography.Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:36: Mentor 2021-12-18, 04:41: Hi Ilya! I'm excited
to connect with you finally and I hope you've been having a great time at your school. It's fun to
find out that we both enjoy the beach and sports. Great connectin there. Getting to your questions,
about my university experience. I had my undergraduate background in Agricultural Engineering as I
am currently in a graduate program at University of British Columbia (UBC). My university days
during undergraduate were one of the best days as far as I remember because the course opened me up
to a lot of thinking and exploration about the environment. I had both classroom knowledge and field
experience analysing different soil condtions, working on community water supply projects as well.
Currently at UBC, the Land and Water Systems program have been nothing short of amazing! I've been
blown away by the amount of resources I am opened to working with as an environmental professional.
To simply put, the Land and Water program prepares you to be an expert in the two major resources
(Land and Water) that affect agriculture or food production. A graduate from this program could go
on to work in different positions such as environmental facility technician, soil consultant, land
and water researcher, and sometimes a climate change professional. Thinking about your current
academic class and seeing that you enjoy Maths, I think post-secondary degree related to Statistics,
Applied Maths, Mathematical Finance, Civil or Electrical Engineering, may be good programs you could
possibly go explore - just my little opinion. Lastly, I have a simple question for you, What does
life currently feel like for you in your Grade 10 classes? I mean what happens in your day to day
actvities at school? I'm glad to answer further questions before we move on from this current anchor
text. I look forward to hearing from you soon Michael",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your favourite part of this video, a phrase, person, or photograph that stood out to you. For me, I
loved when Léa Pool talked about the photograph of the woman on the bench, and how she looked
lonley. But, she had her book, so she wasn't alone. We both love to read, so this was a connection I
thought was really neat. I loved how she expressed that ideas and projects are our friends. Projects
can often become frustrating, and we forget why we started in the first place. When we think of them
as part of us, or a friend, the intention becomes clear again. So which idea or story stood out to
you, and what did it make you think about or feel?Mentee 2022-01-13, 17:43: Hi Haley! I didn't see
this message till now, so sorry that it took me so long to answer. The story that stood out the most
to me was also Lea Pool's story. I loved how she talked about your book being your friend, because
whenever I read I always feel connected to the characters and story. Right now I'm reading The Song
of Achilles, and I love the characters so much they really do feel like my friends. l also liked
when Mina Shum talked about how everything we do we do with an intention. It made me think back to
decisions and things I've said or done. I sometimes find it hard to continue a project or get ideas
for one, but if I have a project I really like I love doing it and want to continue. - SolyMentor
2022-01-13, 17:53: Hi Soly! I totally agree you about Lea Pools point, do you think books are a
source of inspiration for you? I find a good book provokes a lot of thought in myself. Continuing
with Lea's points, I also agreed with how she said change can be the biggest source of inspiration.
As you go through high school, do you find the future to be exciting and a place to be creative, or
are you nervous about what that change will bring? I'm curious to hear your thoughts or if you had
other ideas. Thanks for sharing your ideas, I appreciate that you're a deep thinker :) - HaleyMentee
2022-01-14, 12:58: Hi Haley! I find a lot of inspiration from reading. I love annotating my books. I
like to look back and see how I was feeling when I was reading the book or some of my favourite
parts. I've lived in the same town my whole life, so I'm actually really excited for a change. I
still don't have a plan for the future, but I think I want to go to post-secondary school. Was it
hard making the decision to become an Elementary school teacher or was it something you always
wanted to do? - SolyMentor 2022-01-14, 17:01: Hi Soly! I do the same thing with my books! I like to
use the coloured sticky notes to mark my favourite paragraphs. The Song of Achilles is a very fun
book to annotate, lots of emotions in that one! I also lived in the same town my whole life, and for
post secondary decided to go on an adventure and moved out with my friends to Kamloops. I highly
recommend looking into post secondary and taking classes that just sound interesting even if you
don't have a career picked out yet, you never know where it will lead you. I decided on being an
elementary school teacher in 12th grade, because of some really great volunteer experiences I had
with younger kids that led me in this direction. Volunteering is also great way to find inspiration
for your future, and also just to connect with others. is there anything else you wanted to chat
about in this section? Any questions or stories? ps. I'd love a book recommendation, I'm looking for
something fun to read this month :) - HaleyMentee 2022-01-17, 14:57: Hi Haley! I don't have any
other questions so we can move on to the next section. I have actually been in a reading slump
lately and haven't read as much as I usually do. But some of my favourites are ""I'll Give You the
Sun"" by Jandy Nelson or ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy by Suzanne Collins. If you have any
recommendations for me I would love to check them out. :) - SolyMentor 2022-01-17, 23:03: Hi Soly!
Sounds good, we can move on to Agency in the World. Thanks for a great discussion on this! I highly
reccomend Everything Everything by Nicola Yoon and the Matched series by Ally Condie. Let's continue
with another conversation! - Haley :)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-06, 17:45: Hi Soly, I'm your mentor Haley! I'm so excited to participate in these
conversations with you. I'm a first year university student from Kamloops, with the goal of becoming
an elementary school teacher. I'd love to hear a bit about yourself, and then we can get started
:)Mentee 2021-12-07, 15:20: Hi Haley, nice to hear from you! I'm very excited to start talking with
you. Right now I'm attending Mount Sentinel Secondary school, and I'm in grade 10. One of my
favourite things to do in my free time is read. I just got into reading not too long ago so I
haven't finish many books. One of my favourite books is called ""I'll Give You the Sun"" by Jandy
Nelson, and my current read is ""Little Women"" by Louisa May Alocott (which is also my favourite
movie). I also love listening to music, one of my favourite artists is Taylor Swift. She recently
re-recorded her album ""Red"" which is my favourite Taylor Swift album. She also made a short film
which I recommend you watch if you haven't yet. Excited to hear from you agian Haley - SolyMentor
2021-12-07, 16:52: Hi Soly! I LOVE Taylor Swift, my favourite song of Red is probably The Last Time.
The short film was so good, and I'm so excited we have such similar interests. I also love reading;
""Little Women"" has always been a favourite of mine as well. I recommend the Anne of Green Gables
series if you love Little Women, and I also recommend ""they both die at the end"" by Adam Silvera, as
I think it has a similar vibe to ""I'll Give You the Sun."" I can't wait to keep getting to know you,
if you have a chance soon, try go through the ""Working through this program"" conversation, and we
can take a look at some of the things your teacher wanted us to discuss. - HaleyMentee 2021-12-09,
17:16: Hi Haley! I'm so happy that you like Taylor Swift too, and thank you for the book
recommendation. I'll have to check them out. I'm confused about what I should do next? I went
through the working through this program article, are we supposed to talk about community
mindfulness next? - SolyMentor 2021-12-09, 22:07: Hi Soly! So the working through this program
provided an example of a conversation, we will be discussing different ones from the list below. How
the conversations work is that we have a section of text (ie. quote, poem etc.) that we both read
and discuss. When we're all done chatting, we finish the conversation, and there be some other
activitites for you to do. For now, I'll have you select the conversations titled Finding
Inspiration, and Agency in the World from the list right below our current messages. These are the
two required by your teacher. We can start with either one you prefer, just let me know if you have
a preference. When we are ready to start, I will unlock it. When we finish these two, if we have
time we can also unlock Confronting Discrimination and Post-secondary Considerations. Let me know if
you have any more questions! - HaleyMentee 2021-12-16, 16:32: Hi Haley! Thanks so much for your
help. Sorry I haven't responed in a couple days, haven't had the time till now. The Christmas break
is starting soon so I will have more time to responded. The conversation I would prefer to start
with is Finding Inspiration, and I'm ready to start whenever. - SolyMentor 2021-12-17, 14:41: Sounds
good! I'll go ahead and unlock that one and we can get started! No worries about responding fast,
this is always a busy time of year, I understand completely :) I hope your Christmas break is nice
and relaxing!Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:13: Hi Haley. Sorry I haven't responded in a while. We had a lot
of snow and just got back to school. I hope you're doing well with all that is happening. -
SolyMentor 2022-01-12, 14:34: Hi Soly! I'm so glad to hear from you. I'm doing well, I hope you had
a relaxing winter break. If you are still interested in keeping up with this program let me know,
and we can continue with the conversations you selected. I believe we are on finding inspiration
right now. If you have any questions or just want to chat feel free to message anytime :) -Haley","Mentor 2022-01-17, 23:16: Hi Soly! This is a super important conversation to have, and I'm really
glad this is one on our list. As a high school student, you are beginning to identify what makes
you, you. Through this you will make goals, choices, and overcome obstacles you may have never
imagined. Finding agency is about learning how to navigate your life, and how to use the resources
around you. In this video, the stories often include some kind of mentorship. Outside of this
program, who might be a good mentor? ie. teacher, parent. And when do we pause and ask for help? Who
do we ask for help? I'd love to hear your thoughts on the video and any of the questions in the
activity :) Feel free to ask me any questions as well. - HaleyMentor 2022-02-01, 14:57: Hi Soly,
just checking in to see if you were interested in continueing the program or if we are parting ways?
I hope you're having a lovely last semester!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

English student at UBC. Would you mind telling me a bit about yourself? I'm into all sorts of stuff,
everything from reading and writing to sports and video games. What do you like to do in your free
time? Feel free to tell me anything and be sure to ask any questions you might have! :DMentee
2021-12-06, 14:36: I love to play sports and video games, the team i support the most is the
cunucks, and yes ik there bad, but they eill get better. My favorite type of games right now are BR
style. In most my free time i engoy either watching anime, playing a video game, and or playing some
sort of school sport.Mentee 2021-12-06, 14:53: What type of games do you play?Mentor 2021-12-06,
15:03: That's cool! I like watching baseball and my favourite team is the Toronto Bluejays. I love
anime too! What are some of your favourite shows? I like Haikyuu, Run With the Wind, and Attack on
Titan. Although a bit cheesy, two of my favourite quotes actually come from Haikyuu: ""You can fly
even higher"" and ""He who climbs the ladder must begin at the bottom."" Do you have a favourite quote?
Also, let me know if you've had a chance to read through the ""Meeting your mentor"" information! As
far as video games go, I play a little bit of everything. I used to be a big fan of the Assassin's
Creed series, but I got pretty invested in mobile games too, like Clash Royale.Mentor 2021-12-06,
15:05: I'm a sucker for inspirational stuff, so that's where I find meaning in those quotes in case
it wasn't clear hahahaMentee 2021-12-06, 15:29: Thats awsome, I also watched those three and did
very much so enjoy Haikyuu. In anime and just overall one of my faorite quotes is ""We are all like
fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even
when that time comes, let's not disappear like a firework and continue to shine forever."" This quote
comes from Bleach, what in my opinion is one of the best. I cant belive you like clash royal, I love
that game I hit masters this season, 6k trophies.Mentor 2021-12-06, 15:47: No way!! Bleach was my
first ever anime. Ichigo was pretty much my hero growing up. Do you have a character or person in
real life to look up to? Anime is one of my go-to things when I have free time (and manga), so I'm
always down to chat about it. I'm surprised you've seen run with the wind - it's a bit of a hidden
gem! And congrats on hitting Masters in Clash. What kind of deck do you run? I played Icebow and
Xbow Tesla, depending on the meta.Mentee 2021-12-07, 12:05: For clash I run a verry mid latter deck,
but ice bow/xbow is a little toxic, but i can respect it because they have nerfed tesla into the
ground. I can't belived you watched bleach, alot of people I know dont try bleach because of the
filler so thats awsome. Acctually two nights ago I just finished JuJutsu Kaisen. I feel as though I
always look up to my Dad, he lives a life were he will try his hardest at everything, and always
will take on any task.Mentor 2021-12-09, 01:31: Haha yeah absolutely. What did you think of Jujutsu
Kaisen? I think Gojo is an awesome character. Have you heard of Chainsaw Man? I loved the manga and
I'm super hyped for the anime next year. And that's cool! You are very fortunate to have someone
close to you whom you can look up to. Are you ready to start working through this program? Also,
just a side note so that you know in advance, I'm right in the middle of finals right now and I have
a bunch of them back to back from the 10th to the 17th. I'm going to do my best to get back to you
as soon as I can, but there may be a bit of a gap, especially towards the end of that period. After
that, I should be able to reply quickly until the end of the program!Mentee 2021-12-09, 16:38:
sounds good, I also thoought Gojo was a good character. I have a friend who also loves to read
manga, I dont know much about chainsaw man, but from the small amount ive heared and seen it looks
really good. I have already started to work under him and have done a few jobs, as of late though
there has been no work for me to undertake. Good luck with your finals.Mentor 2021-12-15, 05:17: Hey
Isaiah! Thanks for your patience. If you liked jujutsu kaisen, you'll like chainsaw man too! And
it's great you already have some work experience under your belt. Seems like we're ready to move on
to the next stage of the program! :DMentee 2022-01-10, 14:01: I'm Sorry xmas Break started and i

finally meet you. I am 26 years old. I am currently a graduate student studying Educational
Psychology at Simon Fraser University. I am looking forward to hearing more about your classes,
interests and hobbies. From your profile, I saw that you are into fashion. What sort of clothes do
you like? What clothes have you made? I will share a little bit about myself. During my free time I
like to watch Korean or Chinese dramas, listen to K-pop, read self-help books, and sing karaoke. I
would like to help you as much as I can, so feel free to message me if you have any questions.Mentee
2021-12-06, 14:42: hi iris, i looked up your university. it looks very big haha. i live in a super
small town so all of the buildings are really small here. yes i am into fashion. i love to go to
thrift stores, i have found alot of cool peices thrifting. i have an old sewing machine that isnt
working very well at the moment, but i have mad a couple cool clothes on it. i see that you like to
sing. i have never played kareoke but i have been playing guitar for about 5 years now, and
sometimes people will pay me to go and sing and play at their parties/events. have not done very
much of this recently due to school and covid. i also see that you are studying schycology, the
study of the brain and behavior? very cool. i am not sure what i wanna study in collage/university,
but i know that i want to go. is university harder then highschool? more stressfull? do you get alot
of freedome?Mentor 2021-12-07, 14:44: Hi Soma, It is great to hear from you. It is so cool that you
went and looked up my university. It's on a mountain with nice scenery. It gets really cold in the
winter, but I have gotten used to it. Don't worry about university being big, when you find your
passion and people who you connect with, it will not seem as intimidating. Thrifting has been such a
trend lately. Many Youtubers have been making videos on it. A few of my favourite Youtubers thrift.
I love listening to music and singing. I am so impressed that you play the guitar. I learned guitar
during high school, but I wasn't very good at it. I hope you are finding other safe ways to
socialize even with school and covid. I am studying educational psychology, which looks at how
psychology concepts can be applied to how people learn. I remember you mentioned in your profile
that you might be interested in studying fashion or art in university? It is good that you are in
this mentoring program. We can start to think about your options for university. The process does
not need to be rushed and there is no need to be scared if you don't know what you want to do right
away. Once you start thinking about and reflecting on your interests, it will come to you. It is
important to plan so that you have a sense of direction. University can be seen as harder than high
school in terms of expectations for reading, writing and test taking. However, at university you
have more freedom in what you study, who you meet and connect with and where you get experience in
volunteering or work. The transition to university can be stressful if you are unprepared. Hopefully
in this program you will be able to gain skills to cope with stress. For example, using effective
study habits and self-care strategies. If you are interested in these topics, you can ask your
teacher about them. Let me know when you are ready to move on. We can go to the next section called
""Working through this program"". It is a blue link at the bottom of the page. We will be go over how
the program works and how to use this system.Mentee 2021-12-09, 17:00: i am ready to move on, i read

quite what it may seem. I love songs where you can delve deeper into the meaning, any songs
recommandations are very welcome! Food for thought: I am a sucker for some baking. My family and I

She-thul. I am a fourth-year student at Simon Fraser University studying a bachelor of arts in
Health Sciences. I have taken a look at your profile and noticed you enjoy food and art! When I was
in elementary school and high school I absolutely loved to draw random things such as cartoons,
people, and objects like fruit. What are some things you like to draw? I also LOVE food, I enjoy
cooking and baking as well! I found a recipe on TikTok called the strawberry tres leches cake! Here
is a picture of it! I love it because it isn't super sweet (which is why I am addicted to it). The
cake is also super moist because the cake is soaked in condensed milk! It is a super easy recipe and
if you love strawberries I recommend you try it! What are some foods you like to make? I also
noticed you like the show Euphoria! I have been meaning to watch that show but have not gotten
around to it! Once I found out Zendaya was going to be in a tv show, I put it on my list! Maybe you
can tell me a little bit more about the show! :) You mentioned you are confused about your career
and what you want to do. I am in the same boat and can relate to this! I am also quite confused as
it is difficult to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life. You and I can definitely
discuss your career and hopefully, I can give you some tips on career exploration! Whenever I feel
lost and confused I like to think about this quote “It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as
you don't stop”. - Confucius”. This quote is important to me because it reminds me that I do not
have to have everything figured out! I just need to keep going :) Just remember, you do not have to
have everything figured out by the time you attend university! For a lot of people including myself,
attending university was the time for exploration and to figure out what I wanted to do! I look
forward to hearing from you! :) -SheetalMentee 2021-12-07, 21:47: Hey Sheetal, I am happy to meet
you :) that's really cool, what do you do in arts of health sciences? Wow that cake looks absolutely
amazing! I will have to try it out. My favourite thing to make is probably crèpes but I do also
enjoy baking apple crisp. Euphoria is a really great show and it's a great I binge I finished it in
about 1 day, it is about A group of students who struggle with substance abuse, love, social media,
and money. What is your favourite show? I saw in your profile you like music, what do you like to
listen to? That is a really great quote thank you for sharing :) - Sincerely NevaehMentor
2021-12-08, 22:16: Hello Nevaeh, The BA of health sciences focuses on social determinants of health
(e.g. safe environment, racism, access to education, jobs, nutritious foods etc.), health promotion,
disease prevention and much more. I decided to do a Bachelor of arts in health sciences instead of a
bachelor in science because I did not want a very science-intensive degree but still wanted to focus
on health. So, this degree allowed me to avoid classes like physics and chemistry but I still got to
learn about health :) I absolutely LOVE crepes and apple crisp! Warm apple crisp with some vanilla
ice cream is the best! Euphoria sounds super interesting! I will definitely watch it! Currently, my
favourite show is atypical, it's about a boy with autism and he is trying to make his way through
high school and university while figuring out the difficulties of being a teen/ young adult. I enjoy
listening to R&amp;B and pop music! I don't really have a favourite artist but if I had to pick, I
would probably choose Kehlani! What kind of music do you enjoy listening to? Please let me know if
you are ready to move on to our first conversation topic! I am super excited to continue to get to
know you :) Talk to you soon! -SheetalMentee 2021-12-09, 17:06: Hey Sheetal, The BA of health
sciences sounds really interesting, I think thats great you can study what you want without having
to take physics or chemistry! Thats awesome! I also really like Atypical, do you have a favourite
character? Im not sure if I have heard Kehlani's music I will have to check it out! I like all kinds
of music I dont think I have a favourite genre but my favourite artist would have to be Lana Del
Rey. I am ready to move on to our next topic but I am confused about what it is. What is ""community
mindedness"" -Neaveh :)Mentor 2021-12-09, 20:54: Hi Nevaeh, My major is proof you can definitely find
a topic to study that you're interested in as the choices are endless! My favourite characters are
probably Sam and Casey as I love their relationship! I think Casey is such a great big sister even
though she can be a little mean! I also love Lana del Rey! Young and beautiful and summertime
sadness are such great songs! I am not sure where you saw community-mindedness, maybe you can
explain where you found it and I will be happy to explain! Our next topic is Agency in the world.
Feel free to ask any questions as they come up! :) See you at our next module! -Sheetal","Mentor 2021-12-09, 21:00: Hi Nevaeh, Welcome to our new module! Please watch the video and answer a

have you been doing? I would love to hear from you when you get the chance! :) Talk to you soon!
SheetalMentee 2022-01-11, 12:19: Hey Sheetal, I just got back from Christmas break. we got lots of
snow! I don't have many experiences with feeling like an outcast, but when I was younger I didn't
fit in with a lot of the kids in my class and that didn't make me feel great. I dealt with feeling
like and outcast by focusing on other things like movies and stuff that interested me. Im not really
understanding what exactly grit and agency is. Some skills I have that can help me acheive my goals
are, I am hardworking, caring, and creative. I know to ask for help when I am confused or need extra
support, when asking for help an obstacle we might face is being embarassed that we need help, the
best way to get over that obstacle might be asking for help more to get over the embarassment or
know that the person will most likely want to help you because helping others makes people feel good
about themselves. What are your experiences with asking for help? -NevaehMentee 2022-01-11, 12:23:
Hi Sheetal, thank you! happy new years to you too!! My break was good, and I have been doing pretty
good as well thanks. How are you doing? did you get a break? - NevaehMentor 2022-01-14, 02:58: Hi
Nevaeh, Super happy to hear from you! I am glad your break was good! I did get a break and enjoyed
it as well! Coming back to school after a break is always a tough transition considering winter
break is never long enough haha! Did you get to spend some time outside in the snow? We got snow as
well! I went outside and built a snowman with my siblings! :) I am sorry to hear you didn't feel
like you fit in with a lot of the kids in your class! Growing up can definitely be tough sometimes
but focusing on things that interest you is definitely a great way to find friends who are also
interested in similar hobbies! From my understanding grit can be another word for courage or bravery
and agency is the ability to overcome an obstacle and the potential to act. So for instance, I would
say the relationship between the two is you must have the strength and be brave (grit) to be able to
have agency and overcome an obstacle in your life. The skills you mentioned are great to have! You
can definitely use the skills you mentioned and apply them towards your goals! Speaking of which,
have you set any new years resolutions? I would say asking for help when needed is a GREAT example
of grit and agency because you have the courage to ask for help when needed and you are overcoming
the feeling of embarrassment that some may feel! Great Question! Sometimes I feel intimidated by the
students in my classes who seem to know the material better than me and because of this, I do have a
tough time asking for help because I worry I might look dumb. However, I am also trying to overcome
this fear of mine by reaching out to my teacher in other ways such as staying after class to ask for
help or sending the teacher an email! Someone once told me a quote ""If you are the smartest person
in the room, you are in the wrong room"" by Lorne Michaels. I have used this quote to remind myself
that I am also in school to learn and ask questions and the fact that I do not have the answers to
everything and am not the smartest person in the room means I am in the right place! Keep up the
good work! Please let me know if you have any questions! Otherwise, let me know if you are ready to
move on to the next topic! Talk to you soon! -SheetalMentee 2022-01-14, 12:48: Hi Sheetal, I did get
to spend some time outside, I went sledding with my siblings. thats good you spent time outside as
well. Thank you for explaining grit and agency I understand them much better now. I have not set any
new years resolutions just yet, have you? That is great you are trying your best to overcome your
fear and reaching out. Wow that is a really great quote! I have no more questions about grit and
agency. We can move on to the the next topic! - NevaehMentor 2022-01-16, 00:20: Hi Nevaeh, Sledding
sounds like so much fun! How many siblings do you have? I don't really have any new years
resolutions either haha! But, there should be absolutely no pressure to create new years resolutions
just because it is a new year! Goals should be set all year round! This is exactly what you did for
yourself by setting a goal to ask for help! :) See you on the next topic! - SheetalMentee
2022-01-17, 14:49: Hey Sheetal, I have three siblings, one older and one younger brother, and Ihave
a younger stepsister. How many siblings do you have? - NevaehMentor 2022-01-18, 20:33: Hi Nevaeh, I
am the oldest sibling among two younger sisters! My siblings always keep me busy haha I am sure they
keep you busy as well! Hope your activities are going well! Feel free to ask me any questions :)

extension activities to complete as well! Please let me know if you need any help! Otherwise, have

time:)Mentee 2022-01-13, 16:32: “Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important
change in your life.” I think this is the quote that stands out to me the most. I think not knowing
the future sometimes can benefit you the most and help you grow. Hopefully this is what I was
supposed to message you back about loll.Mentor 2022-01-13, 22:40: Hey Lexi! We were told that you
weren't required to respond during your break so it's all good. i hope you enjoyed you winter break!
I feel like everyone deserved that extra week off given everything thats going. I'm pretty sure
thats what the activity was asking. I like that you chose that quote because that is the one that
also caught my attention. Not knowing things about the future or not worrying about it too much
really helps you live in the present. I feel like this also helps you enjoy you surroundings and you
get to see things you may have otherwise missed by being so fixated on the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-03, 18:59: Hello Lexi, hope you’re doing well. My name is Ravneet and I will be your
mentor. I’m 22 years old and study political science and philosophy at Simon Fraser University. I
also work part-time and volunteer. In my free time I like to watch sports and movies. I also love to
bake! I look forward to getting to know you this year. Do you have any hobbies or interests? What's
your favourite subject? If you have any questions feel free to send them my way and I’ll try to
answer them :)Mentee 2021-12-06, 14:16: Hello Ravneet, I am excited to get to know you as well. My
hobbies include, Volleyball, Basketball, soccer and hiking. My favourite subject in school is
probably english, because I enjoy writing. What is your favourite subject? What profession are you
pursing? Where do you see yourself in five years?Mentor 2021-12-07, 01:20: I enjoyed social studies
in high school that's why I ended up doing my Bachelors degree in Political Science. I'd love to
pursue a career in teaching. Start off with secondary teaching and hopefully make my way to college.
Ooo in the next 5 years thats a tough one. Hopefully get my teaching certificate to teach secondary
social studies. I'd also love to go to law school and get my Juris Doctor but I need to get more
experience in the field before making a move towards it. That was a good question so I'm going to
throw it back at you! Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Since we've introduced ourselves lets
get started with the program. Click on the blue text that says 'Working through the program'. Let me
know if you have any questions!Mentee 2021-12-07, 12:31: In five years I see myself in school for
sure, I have hopes to go into law and become a coorporate Lawyer. That is my most ideal position in
5 years, although a lot can change. If my plans for law don't work out and I am not ready for the
hard position, I am also very interested in Real Estate. I just read through the blue text, how do I
start this? What are my next steps for this program?Mentor 2021-12-09, 18:44: Corporate law is
really interesting and living in BC you can never have too many real estates especially in todays
housing market. You could honestly do both like combine your two passions and do corprate real
estate. I sent a message under the Working Through the Program tab on the next step! Let me know if
you have any questions.Mentee 2021-12-13, 11:54: Yes, that sounds pretty interesting. I could see
myself enjoying that. I just read what you wrote under working with the program, I understand, I am
just unsure about what my first steps are. Should I start something?Mentor 2021-12-14, 01:08: I have
opened the first conversation titled Finding Inspiration. Let me know if you can click on it on the

activity?Mentor 2022-01-19, 00:56: Yes you can work on the short reflection piece where you answer
the questions under the Extension Activity - Three Lines under the Finding Inspiration tab. Once
you've completed it upload it to your portfolio we can complete this conversation and start on the
next one. If you have questions let me know!Mentee 2022-01-24, 14:08: Hey this website it very
confusing for me to use lol, I dont know why but I'm like struggling to find the topics and use
this. My course is almost over, and I would enjoy talking about more things like post-secondary
school, and paying for school then the other activities. That would be alot more useful for me to
know. Also what your future plans are for going into law.Mentor 2022-01-25, 15:56: All good I was
going to suggest we talk a little bit more about things you actully want to get to know since your
course ends on friday. In terms of paying for post-secondary my first year of univeristy my parents
paid for because the didn't want me to get a student loan for my undergraduate studies. I went to
SFU Burnaby campus so I was living at home. SFU is a bit more on the pricier side when it comes to
tuition but since I live in Surrey I didn't have to pay rent for residency on campus. I would
commute everyday to school or once i made friends that lived nearby we would carpool. My second and
third year I managed to pay for my own tuition and books/supplies because I started working
part-time. I also applied and got two scholarships in high school for a total of $5000 so that
defintely helped cover some costs as well. I 110% recommend applying for scholarships and awards
theres literally so much free money out there that insitutions and companies hand out every year to
senior high school students it's insane. And you'd be surprised how much of the money isn't given
out because no one applies for them. In terms of my future plans of going to law. Since this whole
Covid thing it's been really hard to get in person experience in law firms because you either need
some sort of legal certification or a long term volunteer. The in person volunteer I did get wasn't
enough so I've applied to the Legal Administrative Assistance/Paralegal certifcation program. So
come this September I will be doing that program, they give you paid experience and a job right
after so I will do this for a year and then start applying for the 2023-2024 law programs across
Canada and in the UK as a backup. I've written the LSAT once last year and scored a 159, so I'm
hoping to study a bit more and rewrite that before I start applying as well. Hope that answers some
of your questions. Were there any other questions you have about post-secondary? Like programs,
application process, university life on and of campus, clubs etc.?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-18, 00:37: Hey Lexi just wanted to check in on how your activity was going and if you
had any questions!Mentor 2021-12-18, 00:40: Mentor 2021-12-18, 00:40: Mentor 2021-12-18, 00:42:
Looks like I had to send the 3 pictures I took indivudally... weird. But I took 3 pictures like in
the documentary well at least I tried to lol! Let me know if you have any difficulties viewing the
images.Mentee 2022-01-13, 16:36: I just took a look at the pictures you sent, and I think I like the
flower one the most. The flower presents a peaceful thought in my mind about spring and the smell of
flowers, and I love the bumble bee pollinating the flower. If we didn't have bees we wouldn't have
flowers, and that is what stands out to me most.Mentor 2022-01-13, 22:56: Good choice! The flower
picture is my favourite because I didn't even notice the bee until a couple hours after taking it.
Also, just wanted to make sure that you uploaded your images and the short reflection on the
experience to your portfolio. Let me know if you had any questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

school year! I usually go by Michelle so feel free to call me that. A little bit about myself: I am
a current university undergraduate student working towards a degree in biology. My home is in
Vancouver, BC, but I currently reside in the United States. My university is located on the east
coast, in a city called Baltimore where I currently live. In my free time, I like to cook and listen
to music. I'm not a big sports person although I do occasionally go watch games and like to ski in
the winter when I get the chance to. Tell me a little about yourself! What is your favorite class?
What do you like to do during your free time? Feel free to share anything you want with me! I look
forward to hearing back from you!Mentee 2021-12-07, 12:19: Hello, One of my favorite classes is
Career Life Education, which I can consider about what I want to do in the future. I haven't decided
what job I’m interested in, so this class helps me to think about it. I’d like to go to college in
Canada after I graduate high school. I like to watch YouTube, cook, exercise, and listen to music in
my free time.Mentor 2021-12-08, 12:05: Hi Kotomi, Career life education sounds like a useful class.
Wish I had that during high school. We had a similar course called Planning 10 which taught us
miscellaneous life skills such as tax filing, workplace safety, etc. Wasn't the most exciting class,
but was definitely helpful in the long run. I'm here for you in helping to figure out your future
plans. I have lots of friends going to various Canadian colleges and universities so I can
definitely try to give you a taste of how different colleges are. As for being undecided right now,
that is completely normal and gives you chances to explore different career paths. I also want to
share a picture of a jellyfish that I took over Thanksgiving. I was in New York and had the chance
to visit the aquarium there. It was a lovely experience. That said, the aquarium in Vancouver is
even more impressive so I highly recommend visiting it. Jellyfish is probably my favorite marine
organism. I don't know why but they are very calming to stare at. Here is the link to the picture:

2021-12-14, 00:35: Hello I'm interested in cooking. I don't decide what job I would like to in the
future though. I have a final project as an assignment for the Career Life Education class. I like
to cook and give to my family and my friends. So I'm thinking about making a dinner course, which is
like a full course of restaurants. I am glad if my host mother and my roommate like my plan.Mentor
2021-12-15, 19:55: That sounds like a great idea and a fun project! What kinds of food are you
thinking to make? I have a strong preference for Asian food, so I tend to make Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese dishes, although I do occasionally crave Italian and Mexican. Now that I've got to know you

2022-01-13, 16:53: I think the video was realy cool getting the diffirent filmmakers to pick a
picture anw write one it was a really good way to think. In life though we strive off goals you see
the rich and famous they have many goals they wish to acomplish. theres the people that can put
their head down and work on thier goal if they know they can make it and theres the people who have
no goals now im not saying the people who dont have golas early on in life arent goin places your
life could change at any time at any time you could lose your home if your very unlucky or some days
if your extreamly lucy you could win the money to buy more homes that you know what to do with. But
people can decide their fate ususally if they try hard enought and look both ways when they cross
the road. basicaly most of your future and your life is based on the fact of a goal that you had and
how hard you tried to get there you control your life and thats about itMentor 2022-01-14, 12:18: I
think that's a good perspective to have to ensure that you have strong work ethic and are
intentional with what you're doing. It seems like your view aligns more with Mina Shum and her idea
that life is based on intention and working towards goals. I thought it was interesting that Roch
Carrier had almost the opposite view where ""creation is an accident"". I think it's good to have a
balance of these ideas - like you mentioned, sometimes circumstances out of our control are able to
have a huge impact on our life, whether it's positive or negative. I think being grateful for the
circumstances that allow you to focus on your goals in combination with a strong work ethic is
important.Mentee 2022-01-16, 15:37: yes theres is also the part of life beinggratfulthe you get to
live today a little bit of a dark thought but very true is to enjoy your life because your hear
could stop at any moment for no reason and it actually happend to someone one of old guitar teachers
students his heart just stopped while he was sleeping so ya definetaly live every moment you have on
this earth because you only have one a really cool quote i herd is ""If you got 86,600 dollars every
day you would try your hardest to spend it all in that day right and then the next day you got
another 86,600. Thats the same with your day 86,600 seconds in your day dont waste time doing things
that arent productive or you dont enjoy yes being entertained for a couple hours is good because it
helps your mental health but all day scrolling not worth it. if all you get from it is junk and a
couple songs stuck in your head thats not going to helpypu in the long run do stuff to become
succesful. as well as live your life because you never know whats going to happen next"". just like
living you life like theres no tomorrow. just enjoy a life you wont regret.Mentor 2022-01-17, 11:58:
That's interesting I've never thought about the amount of time you have in a day as money to be
spent - that's a cool way of looking at it! I definitely agree with you that spending too much time
scrolling can be harmful and not a good use of time. What kinds of things do you try to do to be
productive and live life to the fullest?Mentee 2022-01-17, 12:04: Most times I try to have fun or
create things the will bring more fun or build things or improve on my education so in the future I
can get a well paying job in order to have expensive hobbies like dirtbiking and skiing so I'm
basically living life to have fun and make things easier that's why I'm working now so I can get a
car and make travelling easier and more fun as well as help my future self by learning to drive and
also working now to educate myself in the small engine industry because that's one of my hobbies and
I actually just last Thursday got an engine for a go kart I'm building with a friend so that's huge
because it runs, it's powerful and I got it for free so I had a pretty good Thursday now all that's
left is the frame and wheels and he probably has most of thatMentor 2022-01-19, 11:25: Oooh that's
so exciting that you got an engine for your go kart! It's great that you have so many interests and
are ambitious! Also I've been meaning to ask - how was going to the physio office before the break?
Did it make you more or less sure that it's a job you would want to pursue?Mentee 2022-01-20, 17:02:

laughing for hours because he kept it on there and actually forgot about itMentor 2022-01-23, 12:51:

much more about studying and plagurism as well as some questions I'm still thinking of about but ya
if we could continue that would be amazing and yes I love my new term I did well in math and science
and I'm now in academy pm basically we learn about computers and photography and many other things
like that I know it had not really anything to do with the job I want to go into but credits are
credits the faster I'm in college the faster I make money. And if you ask your teacher if we are
aloud to switch to a less confusing app that would be greatMentor 2022-02-03, 11:37: Okay great we
will continue on then! I'm glad you had a good semester - the academy pm thing sounds pretty cool to
me even though it's not necessarily related to your career path. High school is the perfect time to
do those types of electives and have fun with your classes! And sadly I can't switch us to a
different app : ( I know this one can be confusing sometimes but I don't really have a say in the
matter, it's just the way the program is set up. If you're ever having trouble figuring out where

2022-03-09, 22:52: Hello yes I'm am very busy but spring break is coming up on Friday so maybe we
could make a time to converse every day if that's possible for you? I am doing great school is good
and it was definitely worth it to have my hard classes together so the my other half of my school
year is fun. How are you doing I've heard that having to do the practicum in the physo course in not
needed now I bet your happy about that my mom said that was a very stressful part of the
courseMentor 2022-03-10, 12:27: Ya sounds good we can definitely talk every day if you'd like! I
sort of did a similar thing with my semesters in making my Fall semester harder so I could have a
more relaxed Spring semester! I did end up doing a practicum but I actually didn't mind it too much
- I got really lucky with where I was placed and I learned a lot. I'm doing well! I've done a couple
interviews for physio school so now it's just a waiting game to see if I get in : )Mentee

to?Mentor 2022-03-21, 13:08: No problem - sorry to hear that I'm sure it was tough to say goodbye.

goodMentee 2022-03-22, 01:16: I really like that idea around all this. it's very informative and
cool to learn about new studying methods as I am just getting into the part of school where I need
to learn to study more because things get harder and you're taking more information in in a day. I
like to use review and practice and that's what I use but I herd flash cards work well. as well
practicing work is also a good one that I do. making links strategy they said in the video and
intervals were cool where you switch topics I thinks that's what that are called pls correct me if
I'm wrong the one about asking questions to your self and writing down the things you know spoke to
me. as well afterwards going back to make sure it's correct of course and then you know what to
study. I think I should take notes in math now but I don't know how I would so if you have any tips
for taking notes for math that would be great. The page set up really helped. My questions to you is
how do you study there is a lot of information you learn in a day how do you remember it all? This
subject really helps me we don't really learn how to do this in school so it's cool to see something
new.Mentor 2022-03-22, 14:50: Ya I always think it would be beneficial for schools to teach us how
to study before it becomes a necessity! Everyone has a different method that works for them so it's
great that you're trying out different techniques now instead of later on when the stakes are
higher. I think the way you study should be tailored to fit the subject you're studying for.
Flashcards are great for subjects that are all about memorization like anatomy (I love the website
quizlet to make digital flashcards!!), but might not work so well for classes like math or physics
where it's more application-based. In those types of classes, I like to write out my notes in a way
where I break down problems into steps. So if I was taking notes for a specific unit in math, I
would list every type of problem I need to know for the test, then write an example problem of each
type where each step is showcased very clearly. That way, I can get really comfortable with the
steps of each problem and see where my gaps in understanding are. When it comes to taking notes in
class, I think it's easy to get carried away with writing down everything the teacher says, which
can actually distract me from truly listening to what they're saying. Instead, I like to be very
selective with my notes, and listen for cues that tell me I should be writing something down. For
example, when a teacher says 'the key to this is...' or 'students often get confused about...' or
'the take home point is...' I know that's something I should probably take note of. This just takes
practice, but over time, you'll come to notice those types of cues that will help with note taking.
If a class has a ton of information for me to learn each day, I think it all comes down to
repetition. I have to constantly be reviewing those topics and checking my understanding so I don't
get lost as the class moves forward. One thing that helps me is to practice explaining concepts to
friends that are in the same class. Sometimes we all just sit down together and take turns going
over things that didn't make sense to us in class. I'll also make review sheets where I look at my
notes from class and try to condense them down to the most important points. I think of all these
strategies as 'active studying' which always works better for me than 'passive studying' which is
basically just reading over notes. I can get distracted much more easily when I'm passively studying
so I try not to do that too often.Mentor 2022-03-22, 14:51: That was a lot hahah but hopefully it
helps! Let me know if you have any other questionsMentee 2022-03-22, 14:59: No that covers a lot
that's great help for and I think like you said passively stuying is what I did in math this year I
only got a 73% and I was very confused on what I was doing wrong so I think I know now and will be
able to study better also my teacher was not very good but hopefully next year if I practice this
summer I can improve and I had one more question you seem smart enough to get into the program but
what is your gpa I'm wondering so I know how high mine has to be and just making sure you did a
physiology batchlors correct?Mentor 2022-03-22, 21:09: Are you wondering what my high school GPA was
or what my university GPA is now? And my undergrad degree is in Human Kinetics, which is the same
thing as Kinesiology. It's a very common undergrad degree to apply to physio school with!Mentee
2022-03-22, 21:28: I'm wondering your university gpa ok ya idk why I though you did physocolgyMentee
2022-03-22, 21:29: Mentor 2022-03-22, 21:34: Oooh I think you thought that because I have a minor in
psychology. My major is human kinetics though. GPA is scaled differently at different universities
but my percentage average is in the 90s. A competitive average for physio usually starts somewhere
in the high 80s. Extracurriculars are also a big deal though! So if someone has a lower average but
good work/volunteer experience, community involvement, and references they still have a good shot of
getting in. There's a lot more that goes into a strong application than just grades now, so that's
something to keep in mind too!Mentee 2022-03-26, 23:46: Thats great that the universities are
starting to see potential in people! Even if they are not the smartest. I had one more question is
there any batchlores degree that dosent allow you to do the physo degree or does it allow all
batchlors? thats cool ya human kenetitics is good it gives you a good jump start on the physo degree
I have looked into maybe deciding on going to a sotial workers batchlors because thay do also the
same as in psycoligy but you can work after the four years in a high paying job say at a hospital or
a goverment building helping others whch is good for learing how to deal with people in distress
because you will also need that in physo. so it would be good if its one you can get in the course
withMentor 2022-03-27, 14:29: I agree! I think admissions should definitely focus on more than just
grades. Physio schools usually accept any Undergraduate degrees as long as you have fulfilled the
prerequisites (usually prereqs are anatomy/physiology, a couple psychology courses, English, etc.
but it depends on the school). One thing I wish someone had told me in high school about applying to
physio is that UBC requires Physics 12 or a first year university physics course. They are the only
physio school that requires it, but I ended up having to take a physics course last Summer because
in high school I only took physics in grade 11. I took biomechanics in university and that didn't
count as a physics either - UBC is pretty strict with their prereqs! So if you think you might want
to apply to UBC physio, it would probably be a good idea to take that course while you're still in
high school. A Social Work degree would definitely be acceptable for physio and I think it's a great
idea to have an undergrad that you could get a job with after 4 years. That way if you change your
mind or if it takes a couple tries to get in to physio, you'll still have a great career set up for
you! So as long as you can take those prereqs while in Social Work, I think that would work
well.Mentee 2022-03-27, 16:04: thats great ya id love to know more abot getting into UBC im already
learning german and i know you need a second language to get in so the more i know the better so
taking physics 12 will be goodMentee 2022-03-27, 16:04: Mentee 2022-03-27, 16:04: Mentor 2022-03-27,
22:17: Ya I'll let you know if I can think of anything else that would be helpful for getting into
UBC! Do you have any other questions about studying, or would you like to move on to the next
topic?Mentee 2022-03-28, 01:42: Yes thank you. Nope we're all good to move on but I'd like to go
more into depth into studying if that's okMentor 2022-03-28, 16:20: Okay ya feel free to ask
anything about studying at any time and we can go more in depth! Or if you have any specific
questions now we can work through those before going to another topic. If you want to move on, just
let me know what topic you'd like me to open next!Mentee 2022-03-28, 16:22: Ya let's go onto study
habitsMentor 2022-03-28, 16:28: Ooh okay so the study habits section is actually an extension
activity so it's like an extra activity for you to do on your own if you'd like. There's not much
material to discuss there because it's meant to be an individual activity. If you scroll all the way
up to the conversation wheel, you'll see all the different topics.Mentor 2022-03-28, 16:28: But if
you want to talk more about study habits we can definitely do that now!Mentor 2022-03-28, 16:30:
Were you more wondering about studying for tests or note taking in class? Or more about studying in
university?Mentee 2022-03-28, 16:30: Ok ya I'll go through that on my own then I'm in school right
now so when I get home I'll go though itMentee 2022-03-28, 16:32: Ya more about studying now and
taking notes that's what I wanted to learnMentor 2022-03-30, 12:12: Have you ever heard of/tried the
pomodoro technique for studying? Sometimes I find that helpful if I'm having a hard time staying
focusedMentee 2022-03-30, 20:24: No I haven't what's it about?Mentor 2022-03-30, 21:02: Basically,
the idea is to break your study time into intervals. Usually the pomodoro technique is based on 25
min study intervals, separated by 5 min breaks. I find it useful because 25 mins doesn't feel too
long, but if you're really focused you can get a lot done. If I'm having a hard time concentrating
and feel like I've just been staring at a computer screen for hours without being productive, I'll
just do 5 rounds of these intervals and I find it gets me in a good work flow.",,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-03, 17:12: Hello Hayden here from the mentoring program I am you new mentee. I am so
excited for to be your mentee i later in life would love to become a physotherapist like my mom as
well as you. I love that you also did a phycolgy batchlors degree that is the batchlors degree i
want to do as well; I want to do this batchlors degree as well because i want to go into hopefully
being a sports teams physotherapist and if players are stressed or anxious i could help them. i wish
to talk about the journey and what other things i should do right now to prepair for college and
universityMentor 2021-12-03, 19:02: Hi Hayden! It's great to hear that we have a shared interest in
physiotherapy and psychology - if you have any questions about my experiences in university feel
free to ask! I'm in my fourth year at UBC Okanagan in the Health and Exercise program and am in the
process of applying to physio school. I love hiking, weightlifting, and cooking - what are some of
your interests? I'm excited to get to know you more and go through the mentorship program together :
)Mentee 2021-12-06, 00:35: Hello Claire I wish you luck with your application to the physiotherapy
program. I will have so questions for you hopefully on Monday or Tuesday that can help me learn more
about becoming a physiotherapist. I love any physical challenge you can throw at me; in my free time
I also hike and on occasion will weight lift with my friends of course I'm one of the weakest of my
pack but I feel a bench press pb of 100 pounds is decent for my size and weight. I love sports such
as soccer,volleyball, skiing, mountain biking, snowmobiling, dirtbiking, yes the previous two are
sports, running, cliff jumping, scootering and Hiking. I have been playing guitar for 11 years and
have been obsessed with music since I could hear. I am currently working as a soccer coach during
the seasons we play and just got a job as small engine mechanic at the local recreation vehicle
shop/ doing chores the old guys don't want to I love it there and everyday I'm at school that's all
I am excited about is to go to work for the two hours I get until they close to do what I love. I
can cook but don't enjoy it it feels like a chore to me but I can make a pretty good breakfast egg
sandwich lolMentee 2021-12-06, 15:24: lol sorry for the absouloute monstrosty of a paragraph i
didn't notice till nowMentor 2021-12-06, 19:16: Hahaha no don't worry I didn't think it was a
monstrosity at all! That's so cool that you play guitar - I play it as well! I'm not very good but
it's fun : ) It's great to hear about all the things you like to do it seems like you're super
active and have lots of interests! So nice that you like your job working at the mechanic shop -
when I was in high school I had to go through a few jobs I wasn't too excited about before finding a
good one at a rock climbing gym. It makes such a big difference to enjoy the work you're
doing!Mentee 2021-12-06, 19:28: Ya it makes anyone such a better employee if they enjoy there work.
I see here we could share a quote so one of my favourite ones by Bruce lee that's always pushed my
through life "" do not pray for an easy life pray for the strength to endure a difficult one"" and a
song that sums up my year of 2020 would have to be it's a long way to the top by AC/DCMentor
2021-12-06, 22:07: That's a great quote I'll have to remember that one! I can't think of a song that
sums up my year well but I've been loving listening to Ziggy Alberts lately! Which conversation
topic do you want to start with? I think your class has to do the 'Finding Inspiration' and 'Agency
in the World' topics - is that right?Mentee 2021-12-06, 22:13: Yes I believe that's the two. I'll
have to give ziggy a listen I haven't herd of him.Mentee 2021-12-06, 22:23: What's your favourite
song of his I already like his music it's like the same genre of music I make I already want to
learn his song goneMentor 2021-12-07, 14:55: My favourites are 'together', 'searching for freedom'
and 'hands I can hold'! I would love to be able to see him live someday!Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:56:
Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:57: Ya I love concertsMentor 2021-12-08, 14:30: It's been so long since I've
been to one with COVID and everything but I'm hoping this Summer to go to some outdoor ones!Mentor
2021-12-08, 14:30: Which topic would you like to start with?Mentee 2021-12-08, 14:56: Yes I always
go to a huge concert every year it's called canna fest but since covid I have my gone but I think
this year I am. I'd like to start with Agency in the worldMentor 2021-12-09, 12:33: That sounds so
fun! Okay we can start with that! Just click on the 'working through this program' button and then
we can get started","Mentor 2021-12-12, 23:25: Let me know what you think of the video when you watch it! I always find
the concepts of grit and agency interesting and extremely important - both topics have come up many
times in my psychology courses throughout university!Mentee 2021-12-12, 23:42: I think it's
interesting how there's also people with no grit or agency like my friend no hobbies nothing he does
nothing that's exciting aside from when I drag him to volleyball. What happens to these people what
do they do later In life do they eventually fin something they like and peruse this thing they
enjoy. Why do people all of a sudden change like the guy in the video that was in prison he could
have just ignored all those things but he got out there and graduated why all of a sudden go from
doing nothing about it to doing college courses. I believe agency in the world as well with grit is
a very important thing in life it's a factor to what makes everyone different and how successful
people are in life as well as how proud of themselves they are. Do they have there dream job and
ideal life or if they would have had a bit less grit would they be not as successful with the same
amount of agency if they had the grit they do?Mentor 2021-12-13, 22:40: Yeah I often wonder what
factors make someone have grit and agency and how those qualities can be developed. I think a huge
part of it has to do with the types of relationships you have in your life and your beliefs about
yourself. If you are surrounded by people who demonstrate grit often and expect you to have that
mindset as well, you will probably come to believe in your ability to persevere and foster those
types of qualities. When I was in high school, I had a friend who was super academically gifted and
helped me out a lot in class. Because of that, I wasn't pushed to figure out concepts for myself,
since I knew she would be able to explain them to me. Once I got to university, I no longer had that
constant level of support, and I had to become much more self-reliant. I started to see that I was
capable of figuring things out for myself, and people started coming to me to explain concepts to
them. Putting myself in an environment that was uncomfortable helped me grow as a person and develop
more grit and agency. Because it's not comfortable, it's tempting to choose the easier route, but I
think placing yourself in situations that push you is key!Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:26: Yes I feel this
is the position I'm in and sort of exiting this mindset right now because I've always had friends
smarter than me but I've also had people come to me for help and it gets frustrating because I am
always having to help them.Mentor 2021-12-16, 16:13: Yeah that can definitely get frustrating
sometimes! I've noticed that it usually helps my learning to explain concepts to people though so
sometimes it can be a good thing to be in that position. Do you feel like you have a lot of agency
and grit already or do you think those are areas that you need to work on?Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:18:
I feel like I have a good amount of grit as well as agency but I could improve on not giving up on
school work and waiting for the next day to finish the workMentor 2021-12-17, 13:42: I struggle with
that too sometimes so we can both work on that hahaMentor 2021-12-17, 13:42: Do you have any
questions from this topic or would you like to move on?Mentee 2021-12-19, 01:47: Haha yes. Yes let's
move onto the next oh by the way this Friday I get to go into a physo for the first time and Learn
and take some notes as well so hopefully by then Thursday I'll have a fair bit of questions on what
college and university is like now because it's probably changed with the technologyMentor
2021-12-20, 15:20: Oooooh cool that'll be interesting - for sure send any questions my way! And just
click on the 'complete conversation' button to move on to the next page!Mentee 2021-12-20, 15:25: Ya

finding inspiration and yes it is the one we need to do",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-03-22, 00:22: Are we here?Mentee 2022-03-22, 00:25: If we're not find the one with the

had nothing to study yesterday but today I do because I missed school today to go skiing with
another class so I'll track what I do todayMentee 2022-03-30, 20:27: Mentor 2022-03-30, 21:03:
Great!Mentee 2022-04-14, 22:08: Hello I'm back I went on a dirtbiking trip as well but I got in some
studying and some of the study tactics worked and some did not I found another I tried and really
liked where you start work and set a five minute timer then at the end of the timer you ask yourself
if you want to take a five minute break or keep working and many times I just kept workingMentor
2022-04-16, 12:41: Ooooooh that sounds like a good strategy! That way you're always choosing whether
or not you want to study more and it doesn't feel like you're 'stuck' studying. What classes do you
find the most and least challenging?Mentee 2022-04-16, 12:45: Ya I really like it!! I find Math the
hardest and science easiest and English and Sotials are in the middle but the easiest non
academically would be physical education why do you ask? I am starting to study for a drivers test
now my learners license I'm so excitedMentor 2022-04-18, 13:04: That's super exciting! When is the
drivers test? I asked about what classes you find most challenging to study for because I was
wondering how your study strategies are different for math when compared to science or english. I
think it's important to customize the way you study to each specific subject!Mentee 2022-04-18,
14:03: Ohhh ok cool I see what you mean. I have my drivers test asap so probably may 5th because my
birthday is may 4thMentor 2022-04-20, 20:38: So exciting! You'll have to let me know how that goes :
) Did you have any other questions for me about study techniques or university?Mentee 2022-04-20,
20:42: Yes of course I will. I had a question about Anatomy 12 so I was going through the
Administration requirements for physical therapy and it wasn't there so maybe they switched it i

now in school I'm looking forward to the end of semester (I'm stuck in Science and Math). I have
always enjoyed my elective classes, love artsy stuff, and hope to keep creating. I look forward to
getting to know you! Food for thought - I've always loved tacos. They are easy to make, delicious,
super customizable and impossible to get bored of. Even if they completely fall apart, they still
taste incredible. Musical Interlude - My taste in music changes frequently, but I never seem to get
sick of this one. Mr. Blue Sky &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuJIqmha2HkMentor 2021-12-06,
15:12: So great to read your message! Oh geez, I bet you're feeling exhausted with science and math!
How many more weeks do you have left until winter break? What are your favourite types of art/or
artsy things? Yay! Mr. Blue Sky is a classic :)Mentee 2021-12-07, 12:11: Only two more weeks haha!
I'm mostly interested in digital painting, but have recently gotten into animation. I was actually
thinking of going to an arts college after school, and I was wondering what that transition is like
from school to college?Mentor 2021-12-07, 13:07: Eek 2 more weeks! It will be so nice to have a
break :) Digital painting! I have to admit I'm not exactly sure it is? It sounds super cool, do you
have any examples? Pursuing arts sounds like a super plan - there are so many things you could look
into - lots of schools offer bachelor of arts programs, and also graphic design programs! The
transition from high school to college is a crazy time, haha! I think there are 2 separate
challenges - the first starts when you are still in high school and trying to figure out what the
heck to do. I reccomend starting to think about this early, so when it comes time to apply you have
a solid plan. It sounds like you have some ideas of what you are interested in and would like to
pursue, so this is great! The second challenge - is adjusting to university life, which is hard to
describe, but it is wonderful :) I had a unique experience, because I decided to go to a school in
my hometown so I didn't get the experience of living on campus. I know from the experiences of my
friends, living on campus really helps you become you! It was definitely a challenge for them at
first, adjusting to the freedom, but they made so many new friends, got to experience a lot more
events, and figured out how to fend for themselves. I think, before university its easy to see how
its so much about 'school' but its about so much more too - extracurriculars, forming relationships,
and becoming who you want to be!Mentee 2021-12-09, 16:57: I would love to show an example. This was
done in a program called photoshop; it simulates painting on a canvas without the need for supplies
or the long cleanup. :)

(paste link into google) That was super helpful to hear, I was definately nervous about the
adjustment, but I am ultimately looking forward to it.Mentor 2021-12-09, 18:41: Darn! I can't make
the link work but I did google digital painting - it looks like a whole nother challenge in
comparison to painting on a campus (I'm thinking a digital pencil?)!! What would you say inspires
your paintings? Yeah, of course. I could go on and on, haha, the adjustment is not easy (say if you
are close with family members, or are in a relationship and move away) but it is definitely
figure-outable! Especially with the support of friends and classmates :)Mentor 2021-12-09, 18:42: Oh
no! That should say canvas, my bad!Mentee 2021-12-13, 15:08: I'm usually inspired by other artists
when I draw or my own ideas, but sometimes I just doodle and see where it takes me! I think there's
some sort of program we're supposed to be working on, I'm not exactly sure where to start, any idea
what we're supposed to be doing first?Mentor 2021-12-13, 15:20: Hi! Happy Monday! Yes, if you want

Daniel, Great! I was actually also part of theatre production back in high school, it was a lot of
fun! Nice to meet another user of the pogo stick, I'm also learning that. I don't personally watch
anime, but know many people that do! Any dishes from French and Japanese cuisine you like in
particular? Also, how are your experiences with school? Are there any courses you really like?

2022-01-14, 17:59: Hi Brynn, Excellent work! Good to see you are on top of things. :) Now, let me
ask you a couple of things! First off: How do you go about studying currently? Do you think there
are any certain techniques/strategies that you learned about that you think you might try out? Why
do you think this strategy works well? If this helps, I'll tell you what I do. I've tried to do the
""Pomodoro Technique"" before, and have found that usually doesn't work for me. I try to go by tasks
rather than by time. So if I have three things to do, I'd finish each task, and take a break between
each. I take longer breaks if I notice that I worked for a longer period of time. If you aren't sure
about the strategy that does and doesn't work, I'd highly recommend giving some new techniques a
try. It makes it much easier to learn if you know how you study best. If you can figure out a solid
study strategy and you choose to attend university, you'll have a much easier time. If you have any
questions about the anchor text or the study strategies, feel free to let me know! -RayyanMentor
2022-01-24, 11:01: Hi there Brynn, I believe your semester is coming to an end, congrats! If you'd
like to, you can continue working on the conversations beyond class, let me know if you're
interested! If not, that's completely fine! We can move on to the ""wrapping up"" portion which will
just be a quick survey. It was great working with you! :) -RayyanMentee 2022-01-24, 14:57: I dont
believe i will be able to continue but thank you for being my mentor and i enjoyed working with
you:).",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-06, 01:45: Hi Brynn! My name is Rayyan and I'm going to be your mentor for the next
couple of months! I am extremely excited, but before we start, here are a couple of things about me.
I'm 18 years old and I am currently studying engineering at university. In my free time, I really
enjoy reading books and playing sports, specifically badminton. Let me know what your favourite
activities are! :) Being a big reader I love a lot of quotes, but one of my favourites is ""Our
greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."" -Confucius. I really find
that this quote keeps me going during difficult and stressful times. Whenever I can recall it, it
always gives me a reason to keep pushing forward. Let me know if you have any favourite quotes!
Another thing I want to share with you is this piece of music, which is on YouTube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiMCmTN5WOc. It's from Cars 2, which you may have seen. I really
enjoy watching the movie, and it reminds me of the time I went to watch the next movie, Cars 3, with
my friends in theatres. If you've seen it, tell me what your thoughts are, as well as perhaps any
movies you really like! I'm thrilled to be your mentor Brynn, and I hope you can learn something
from all of this. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll try to answer!Mentee
2021-12-06, 14:24: Hi Rayyan, I am very excited to be matched with you and hope we get to know
eachother better throughout these next couple months! :) I love playing volleyball and outdoor
activities such as fishing and camping. I also love cooking and baking. My favourite schhol subject
is math, what is yours? As for quotes I don't read very much so sadly I don't have a favourie quote.
Also I enjoyed the song you sent. :) I haven't watched cars in quite a while so I don't remember
much from the movie, but my favourite movie would have to be Pixels staring Adam Sandler.Mentor
2021-12-07, 13:12: Hi, again Brynn, I'm extremely glad you are excited about this! I hope we both
learn a lot from this experience. It was nice to hear that you enjoy math; I think my favourite
subject in school is also math, but I also really enjoy physics and chemistry. (Probably why I am in
engineering now). Do you have any idea about what you want to pursue after high school? Also,
unfortunately, I haven't seen Pixels with Adam Sandler, but I will definitely try to watch it, given
your recommendation. Any specific reason why it's your favourite movie? If you're ready to move on
to the next step of the process, where we'll have to watch a video and have a short discussion about
it, let me know. As always, feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer.Mentee
2021-12-13, 14:53: Hi, Rayyan I would also love to go into engineering after school. What type do
you majour in? also yes I am ready to move onto the next step.Mentor 2021-12-14, 18:25: Hi Brynn, I
currently haven't chosen a specialization for engineering just yet, but I'm looking to do biomedical
engineering (fingers crossed). Do you have any that you are interested in? I've moved on to the next
step of the process, it's called ""Working Through this Program."" You'll find another message there
explaining what to do.Mentee 2021-12-16, 17:01: Hi, Rayyan I am quite interested in chemical and
electrical engineering, where are you taking engineering.Mentor 2021-12-16, 21:56: Hi Brynn! That's
great to hear that you have narrowed down your options! Those are both excellent fields, and I'm
sure you will find a place in either one. I only know bits and pieces about both, but if you have
any questions, be sure to let me know. As for your question about where I am studying, I,
unfortunately, can't be more specific than saying that I am studying in B.C. P.S. If you press
""Working Through this Program"" at the bottom, it should lead you to another page where I left a few
messages about what you can do to learn more about this program!",,"Mentor 2022-01-26, 11:01: Hi Brynn, I enjoyed mentoring you, thank you for always putting in the

about finding inspiration. Tell me where you find inspiration? Do you specifically look for it or do
you allow it to come to fruition on its own? For me, when I am trying to be inspired I try to do
something completley different from what I want to find inspiration for. If I had a problem such as
issues with my tenants at my rentals that needed to be solved in a creative and tactful way I will
try and go do soemthing else like ice fishing or school work and than sleep on it before making a
decision. I find that when I sleep on it I often find a logical and creative solution that works
nicely!Mentor 2022-02-27, 11:01: LOL... hey man, you are probably wondering why you keep getting
messages from me, especially the recent ""introduction"" message. They assigned me new mentees this
semester, and did not delete you from my mentee list. So i thought you were a new mentee for me.
They also switched up the lay out of the website, so I couldn't see all of our old messages, again
leading me to believe I had a new mentee also named Brennan. Sorry for the confusion! Take care",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-09, 23:12: Hello!Mentor 2021-12-10, 00:53: Hi Brennan, Sorry for the delay here! It
is crazy with exams going on and I forgot to send an intro message! Thanks for reaching out! So, I
am a paramedic from Ontario and came to BC to take Rural Pre-Medicine at Selkirk College with the
hopes of becoming a doctor. I love the small town life here in BC. I was from the city back in
Ontario, near Toronto. Have you ever been to Ontario? You must also be coming up on exams, how is
your studying going? Have you given any thought to post secondary? What do you hope to get out of
our time together? Tell me a bit about you! Share a cool story?Mentee 2021-12-10, 15:00: v Hi Brock!
The only time I've been outside of B.C was when I went to Drumheller to look at dinosaurs when I was
7. School has been relatively easy so far with not a lot of studying. I'm not entirely sure about
pot secondary school. I am incredibly passionate about working in law enforcement when I get older.
Ideally, I would like to work my way up through the system, which often requires a few diplomas.
I've been thinking about some classes in Law and justice and toxicology. I assume that police work
and paramedics have a lot of similar responsibilities and similar mindsets. Currently I'm 16 and
living in a cabin on my parents property next to the river. Recently I've been getting more into
fitness and healthier lifestyles. No pressure to respond super fast if your busy, everything is
pretty relaxed here right now.Mentor 2021-12-11, 19:41: Hey man, I am impressed with your grasp on
writing, you have a mature coherent writing style. It is a strong quality to have! Love that you are
living in the cabin, that is a cool experience and gives you some independence that will build
character for your policing career. Police and paramedics do share some similar mentalities and
experiences, but we do approach 911 calls with a different lense. In the most basic form, cops
assume everyone is lying and we assume everyone is telling the truth lol. My brother is a cop, and
currently an instructor for the peace officer college. When you get hired on with law enforcement
you are sent to a college for 4-6 months to train before hitting the road. If you are serious about
policing I would recommend taking a criminal justice degree. Diplomas are a dime a dozen for
policing. A degree will hold more weight. Additionally, the experience of taking 4 years of classes
will only strengthen and mature your brain to improve your policing ability. The other benefit is a
degree will keep more doors open. If you decide you want to do law school after being a cop, you
would have a degree to apply, but could not apply with a diploma. Also, you could leap into a
masters or even a PHD! My brother did a criminolgy degree at Laurier online! You could keep living
in that cabin and get a degree! Although I would recommend moving away for post-secondary and
gaining some life experience! Police forces really like to see diversity in life experience. It
really allows cops to connect to the communities in a more profound way. As for fitness, I am on
board with that! You cannot beat staying in shape, especially if you want to be a cop. You WILL get
into fights and you will need to be strong with good endurance to survive the fight. It is no joke!
Personally, I am hitting the gym 4-5 days a week, plus some yoga, mountain hunting, skiing, and
mountain biking! So, why policing?Mentee 2021-12-13, 15:24: The primary reason I became interested
in law enforcement is I love the idea of every day being different. I don't want to walk into the
same building everyday and work for 8 hours and then retire. 4 years of secondary school is a little
intimidating. That feels like a lifetime even though I'll only be 22 when I finish. Recently I've
been thinking about pursuing the E.R.T which I think you need to have something science-ish like
toxicology. I've found it really difficult to find things about the E.R.T online though. I dont know
alot about how universities work so forgive me if this is a stupid question, but would it be
possible to get a degree in toxicoligy while also doing other classes for toxicology? If you know
any thing about the E.R.T, please lemme know. - ThanksMentor 2021-12-13, 22:29: Can you clarify if
you are referring to the ERT for police? If so, you would not need a toxicology degree/courses to be
on ERT. It is competitive process you would apply for and many things would come into consideration
for the team, including fitness level, and performance on the department. I actually am a tactical
paramedic instructor! Although I have never been involved personally as a paramedic on ERT. Your
thought process for policing is spot in. It will be something different every day! I resonante with
a lot of what you say in regards to that. lol...Have you ever seen the movie train spotting? If not,
I would recommend it! The end monologue speaks to what you said. Great movie, caution though, lots
of drugs, some scottish accents that are hard to understand, and some pretty intense scenes. But
really nothing you haven't seen in video games like grand theft auto or call of duty lol In
university, regardless of what degree you take there are always electrive allowing you an
oppurtunity to explore differnent interests. I appreciate 4 years seems like a life time, but in the
grand scheme of life its not that bad. Another path, is to take the 2 year police foundations
course, work your way onto a police force or sheriffs department, and than while working get a
degree if you wanted. Both me and my brother did that. The added benefit was our work place gave us
money towards tuition! I barely paid for any of my degree :) So that is an alternative route.
However, like I indicated before, police forces like to see someone with added life experience and
really everyone and their cousin has a police foundations diploma. It does not mean you won't get
it, it just doesn't hold as much weight is all!Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:38: Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:38: I
was referring to E.R.T in the R.C.M.P. I have ambition for more than just being a police officer for
the rest of my life. I'm still pretty undecided on what that might be though. I still don't want to
work an office job and am trying to find something to fill that. If you have any suggestions, don't
hesitate to suggest them. Thank you for all the insight so far. I hope you have a good holiday
break! I'll try to stay in regular contact.Mentor 2021-12-19, 00:34: I have to say I am very
impressed with your writing and handle on language. This is an invaluable skill that will pay
dividends in your bright future. In terms of ERT, my understanding is there are not necessarily
pre-requisites, however it is a competitive process. So the better your resume the better chance you
have! In the first responder world, I think the police is the best route in BC. If you were in other
provinces I would probably vote paramedic to be honest! As it stands right now, BC Ambulance is a
challenging place to work, hence why I would vote for policing. However, there has been drastic
changes to the service this year and many more to come which may improve the career of being a
paramedic in BC. Of course there is always fire fighting, but I do not think you would find the job
rewarding. there are rarly fires to fight, and on medical calls I am the boss, they carry my bags,
hold equipment and do CPR for me. I personally would not find that meaningful. However, they are
paid the best of all first responders and do the least amount so if you want to make over 100K,
sleep, eat, workout, and only work 7 days a month than firefighting is for you. For police and fire
I would still highly recommend a degree program. With that being said, currently the RCMP is so
desperate you could do police foundations diploma and get in there. The downside is they send you
where they want lol so you could end up in a really remote area away from home. Also, I have not
heard good things about that service. Another important point, policing does a very thorough
back-ground check. For example, if you get audited on your taxes and had to pay a penalty, you would
not be eligible for some police forces for a few years. So keep that in mind! If paramedic is
something up your alley, you can complete the PCP program in under a year, and than immediately take
the ACP program. If you are an ACP in BC, the world is your oyster and it is transferable across
Canada. So if you ever wanted to move to Ontario or something that is an option. You could probably
start that program while finishing up highschool I would think. Other jobs that are not office jobs
would be trade work. Plumbing and electrical is fairly lucrative.Mentee 2022-01-13, 16:43: Hello!
Sorry for taking so long to respond, I promise I didn't forget! My phone broke a few days into
winter break. I'm still figuring out how to deal with out having a phone, so for now, I'll be using
some of the school laptops. As for firefighting, I am more interested in that than being a
paramedic. When my older brother was 17 he entered a program that let him work with other
firefighters working against the forest fires for the summer. It somewhat inspired me to try and do
the same thing for this upcoming summer and is currently my main short term goal, although I don't
want to do it full time. Recently I've been pushing myself to get in better shape so I can make this
a reality. I'm not that concerned about background checks, but I admit that I don't know what being
audited for taxes means, so maybe i'm not all good lol. I have given a lot of thought to other first
response careers (especially because my mom worked as a paramedic), but none of them have captivated
me as police work and I can't really imagine doing anything else at this point.Mentor 2022-01-15,
21:44: Audited basically means the government wants to make sure you did not mess about with your
taxes, and if you did they will penalize you and force you to pay the taxes and huge penalties.
Sounds like you are passionate about policing and I think that is fantastic! It would certainly be a
great experience and resume builder to take on the fire fighting program you mentioned. No worries
about the delayed response buddy! Life happens and this relationship is completely guided by what
you are looking to get out of it. :)Mentor 2022-01-30, 17:30: Hey buddy I understand your semester
is coming to an end. I just wanted to say this was a great experience for me and I hope it was for
you as well. You seem like a mature guy with a good head on your shoulders and I am confident you
will do well with your future. If there is anything more you want to discuss of course feel free to
reach out :) Take care budy!Mentor 2022-02-13, 20:25: Hey buddy, sorry for the delay in reaching
out. Its mid term season for me plus all my damn extra curriculars and medical school interviews so
its been hectic! I am taking a study break to touch base and get to know you a bit better. I see you
are interested in becoming a cop which is fantastic. I have worked for the last 13 years as a
paramedic, so I have worked with plenty of cops. My brother is also in law enforcment and current a
seargant at the training academy for peace officers in Alberta. RCMP certainly has come a long way
in the last few years!!! not only in terms of pay, but training and equipment. I think you will find
it to be an awesome and rewarding career. I see you have mentioned some interest in university work.
I would highly recommend pursuing that if you want to be a cop. There are lots of applicants to the
police force, and having a degree will definitely set you apart. Moreover, I think going to post
secondary will teach you some valuable life skills needed to approaching policing in an pragmatic
and humanistic way. Plus university is a lot of fun!!! :) Do you have any mentors currently that
have inspired you to pursue becoming a cop? Or was it something else that inspired that career
choice? Tell me a bit more about you too if you would like Talk soon buddy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then one more of your choosing. Let me know where you'd like to start and I'll go ahead and unlock
that conversation so we can get started! Talk to you soon:)Mentor 2022-01-22, 16:09: Hi Kamryn! So
with your semester coming to an end, eMentoring is coming to an end for your class as well. If you
would like, we can continue working through the the conversations after your class ends. But I
totally understand that you are busy now and have a lot to catch up on so if this is not one of your
top priorities I completely understand! If you would like to continue with the program let me know,
but if not thats totally ok and you can fill out the survey to wrap up the program that I linked
here. https://www.mentorcity.com/en/organizations/161/surveys/102 It has been great getting to know
you and I wish you all the best in the future!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

December to end of January. Here are a few things about myself. I'm currently in my 3rd year
studying Computer Science at UBC. In my free time, besides studying job-related skills on my own, I
like playing FPS games such as CS:GO and Valorant and following esports events. Recently, I take on
walks in different areas in Vancouver and listen to audiobooks or podcasts since it reminds me of
travelling and I also enjoy listening to people sharing their stories as well. I would like to know
more about you! Since you mention you like playing Valorant, are you following the VCT in Berlin? If
so, are there any players or teams that you cheering for? You can also feel free to share with me
what you are currently following in Valorant, volleyball, or anything else besides those two!Mentor
2021-12-14, 21:23: Hi Derrick, how is everything going for you recently? It's understandable that
your teacher might have a lot of materials to go through at the moment and don't have enough time
for eMentoring. But if you do get a chance in class to log on here and we can finish 1-2 modules
before Christmas, you don't have to worry about craming them towards the end of January :DMentee
2021-12-17, 12:58: Hey Danny, I'm sorry I haven't been responding. My teacher is forcing me to write
to you right now, but you're actually a sick and nice dude. I'm so sorry LOL I've been so lazy and
don't have a sleep schedule. I did follow the VCT Berlin Champions anad SO SAD GAMBIT LOST MAN.
DUDE, NA actually just got destroyed. What's your favorite team? I was rooting for Team Envy, but
sadly they did not make it. At the very end, I was rooting for Gambit but Ascend is too good. Just
heading on to Winter Break and again, I'm sorry. Hope you're doing well and everything's been good
for ya.Mentor 2021-12-17, 13:54: Hey Derrick, thank you for sharing! It's nice to meet another
person who follows esports as well, I don't get to talk about it many times outside of Discord :D, I
wasn't following the VCT closely but I was cheering for Liquid because I followed Scream and Nivera
since they were still playing in CS:GO. I hope you have a good rest through the winter break as
well. Before our next conversation, can I ask you to skim through these two pages: 1/ Working
Through This Program - This page has a video that helps you navigate the website and it's a good
reference to go back to if you get confused about how to go through the modules (even I am confused
occasionally) 2/ Conversation Choices - On this page specifically, choose the conversation topics
your teacher asked you to go through and one conversation topic you want to learn and discuss with
me. Feel free to use the chatbox either here or on those pages to ask your teacher or me questions
on the conversation topics or the program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bump It Up playlist a try and it was pretty good for lifting weights to hahaha. I definitely got
some good gym motivation from it. Unfortunately, I don't play Valorant or Apex but I have a few
friends that are into it. How do the competitions work? Are there some good prizes for the winners?
As for your question about university, this is something we'll get to tackle in our first
Conversation on this platform. I see that you have selected 'Post-Secondary Considerations' so I
have gone ahead and unlocked that one. When you get the chance, work through the material and let me
know when you are done. But, to prelude, I think university is a solid choice for many new high
school graduates. I remember from your profile that you have an interest in astrophysics. This is
certainly a tough kind of career path to 'freelance' and would probably require some formal
education. If this is what you are passionate about, then post secondary schooling is definitely
something to consider. I have a feeling we will get to discuss lots more about this after we each
have read the anchor! Cheers, SebastianMentor 2022-01-16, 23:14: Hey Adam, I hope you had a safe,
fun restful winter break! I'd love to hear all about what you got up to. I also wanted to follow-up
with you regarding where we left off with the first Conversation Choice (Post-Secondary
Considerations). Let me know when you have finished reading the anchor so we can discuss!Mentor

ready to continue! Best, Sebastian",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-01, 00:12: Hey Adam! My name is Sebastian. I am super excited to begin this
mentor-mentee relationship with you. I understand if it may not be your number one choice to
participate in this program, however, I believe me and you can achieve a great deal meaningful work
over the next while. More than just helping you exercise some of your post-secondary options, I am
also here for you as a peer. A quote that I want you to think about comes from one of my favourite
movies: ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"". Ferris Bueler famously proclaims that ""life moves pretty fast. If
you don't stop to look around once in a while you could miss it."" I think this is a perfect quote to
think about as you transition from high school to post-secondary life! I also wanted to share a
photo I really like. The photo is taken at Tofino, which I got to visit last. Although the water is
cold, it's the closest you can get to feeling tropical in BC!
https://unsplash.com/photos/_wM1ZSWlUIc I don’t expect you to tell me your entire life story in
response to this message, however, I want you to know that I am always open to hearing about your
life outside of this program’s context. As we begin this process, I will likely be a resource more
than anything, but I hope we can continue to develop this relationship to help you accomplish your
goals. Looking forward to hearing back from you! SebastianMentee 2021-12-07, 14:25: hi sebastain
nice to meet you i am also looking forward to getting to know you just want to tell you a little bit
about me. I really enjoy playing games and looking at the bigger pitcure in things i love to look
into things about space as it really intersts me and my favourite kind of music is EDM i listen to
it religiouslyMentor 2021-12-08, 23:28: Great to hear back from you Adam! I too am fascinated by
some of the bigger ideas as they relate to biology which is my field of study. I love to ponder
about our place in the universe and where we come from- it is truly amazing how complicated
everything is! What kind of games do you enjoy playing? I personally like sports games like Madden
or MLB the Show, however, I started playing Spider-man recently and have really enjoyed that too. I
have also certainly warmed up to EDM more over time and actually listen to it while I study (no
lyrics means I focus much better). What EDM music would you recommend to the naive listener like
myself? Also, I just wanted to confirm that you have read the anchor text and understand everything
about the program. Once you have done so, you can select the conversation topics of your choice.
I've been told that you must select 'Well being and self care', 'Entering the Job Market', and one
more of your choice. However, if there are additional conversations you would like to have, we
certainly can. Sorry for the long-winded message, but I am super excited to start this mentoring
journey with you, Adam! We will definitely make the most of it! Best, SebastianMentee 2021-12-15,
12:28: nice to hear back from you too, as for edm i actually make my own playlists and am working on
making my own mashup mix which is puttting a bunch of songs together what to listen to tho depends
on what kind of edm you are into so for me its more of a mid tempo or a more chill vibe aswell for
videogames i play i am more into first person shooter games such as valorant and apex when gaming i
like the competitve aspect of things so i also compete in tournaments for apex val no so much
though, back to the edm thing though if you have sound cloud you can check out some of the playlists
ive made my user on there is Fetched if you are more into like a mid tempo house beat i would
recomend my bump it up playlist. as for someone who is in university as your self would you
reccomend doing if you do not know what you want to do after highschool ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about each other, like what are your hobbies, what do you like to be called and such and such. Hope
you can learn sth throughout this period, and if you have any questions, remember to tell me and
I'll answer them the best I can :DMentee 2021-11-28, 22:45: Hello, my name is Makayla. I enjoy
writing, drawing, and I am interested in a fair bit of history myself, though its not something I'd
go to Uni for. I'm new to this whole mentor-mentee thing, so what will we be covering?Mentor
2021-11-29, 18:26: So nice to meet you, Makayla! Well the short answer for what we will be covering
is answering your questions about how to plan for post-secondary. I know that you're interested in
finding inspirations and such for post-secondary, so we can start off from that first. But before
that, I want to make sure both of us understand how this program works so click the ""Working Through
this Program"" button and read thru everything, then we can officially start, sounds good?Mentee
2021-12-07, 02:08: So sorry about the wait! I've been distracted with Christmas things, I'm sure you
know how all that goes. I skimmed over the explanation, and I'm ready to get started.Mentor
2021-12-08, 00:27: Don't worry about it :) so from what I see from your conversation choices, you
picked out ""finding inspiration"", ""studying"", and a couple of other choices, do you want to start
with ""finding inspiration"" first?Mentee 2021-12-08, 00:30: That sounds like a good plan. Inspiration
is something I struggle with a lot. As a writer, the hardest part of writing to me is just getting
up and actively making the decision to write. I've heard from many others that it is something they
struggle with too, and its something I want to work towards, because at this rate I hardly see
myself publishing by the end of 2023.Mentor 2021-12-08, 00:35: yeah, inspiration is sometimes hard
to find, I struggle with it as well, it's quite tough. :/ But you don't need to rush to publish by
2023, you can do that whenever you want, there's no deadline for that honestly, and that's sth a
need to tell myself too So I just looked thru some of the requirements that we will need to do and
in order to move onto the next conversation, you'll need to complete this conversation, which means
you'll have to click the ""working though this programme"" button until you find a quiz that you'll
need to complete. How about you finish that up then we can keep going?Mentee 2021-12-08, 00:36:
Alright, I'll get started on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right now :). I just opened finding inspiration for you to get started on!Mentor 2022-01-16, 20:52:
Hi Arden! First off, happy new year! I hope you had a nice winter break. I realized I haven't heard
from you in a while and so I wanted to check in with you. I hope you are well and hope that we can
get back to our conversations soon :)Mentee 2022-01-17, 15:27: Hello Michelle, I hope you also had a
enjoyable winter break (if you had one...), my winter break was extended by a week because of covid,
but I have since retured to school. I've just read through finding inspiration, and thought thought
the video really resonated with me, because I enjoy doing photography as a pastime. What should I be
doing next?Mentor 2022-01-18, 23:51: Hi Arden, That's very cool, what do you generally take pictures
of? Scenery or pictures like the pop can in the video? My artistic side leans more toward music.
What do you think of the quote by Lea Pool, ""Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the
most important change in your life""? Personally, I believe that what she is saying is that not
knowing keeps you in the dark about things, and the more you know and grow your knowledge of the
world and grow skills the more you can appreciate things of life. For example, I play a few
instruments and I notice that people who do not play instruments do not appreciate the complexity,
hard work, and dedication of musicians in the same way I do. Side note: you can move on to the
Extension Activity, and if you already have done that, we can complete this conversation and move on
to the next.Mentor 2022-01-25, 20:03: Hi Arden, I found out that you have just finished the
semester, and to my understanding, you do not have to complete this anymore unless you would like.

which interested you! I enjoyed getting to know you either way and wish you luck in your future
endeavors! Michelle :)Mentee 2022-01-27, 15:53: Hello Michelle As you have said, my simester has

agree, that picture is quite beautiful, it focuses on the little details! I personally am quite a

Michelle, I am doing good! In my free time I usually study Japanese or read, once theres more snow I
will probably also spend alot of time skiing. Grade 10 is pretty easy so far, which means I have
more free time than I can use. Im not watching any TV series right now, but I have heard that the
Wheel of Time adaptation is good (I've read the series before but I haven't wached it yet). What
genres of TV series or books do you enjoy?Mentor 2021-12-07, 03:26: Hi Arden, nice to hear from you
again! Wow, Japanese is pretty impressive! I do like reading, especially about alternate human
societies as I find it gives me an escape from my own society. My absolute favorite TV series in
Grey's anatomy (most people tell me it is pretty predictable). I noticed that you checked off your
conversation choices, which is great! However, I was under the impression that your teacher wanted
you to complete the conversations ""Finding Inspiration"" and ""Agency in the World"". Could you please

Some of my hobbies are painting, watching movies/tv shows, and sometimes hiking. I also like to hang
out with my friends and be with animals. This past year and a half has definitely been a struggle,
ever since the first quarantine, I havent been motivated to do much so I have fallen behind in
school, but im am slowly trying to get back to where I was. Currently, I am intereted in the medical
field but I know that I would have to have better grades to prusue that type of career. I would love
to know how its been for you while studying biology if thats alright. And I am looking forward to
getting to know you as well :)Mentor 2021-12-03, 12:12: Hi Sabina! I know exactly how you feel about
losing motivation during covid. I am going through the same thing and it has been a struggle to
learn how to study properly again and gain the motivation back that I had in my first year of
university. Hopefully school remains in person for us both and we can continue working on that! I
have found it helpful to study with friends (in a covid safe manner) since we can motivate and help
each other! I am not sure if that is a feasible option for you, but if it is I would suggest giving
it a try! That's super interesting you're thinking of going into the medical field! Don't be too
discouraged about grades. You still have lots of time before reaching medical school and there are
plenty of qualities they are looking for when hiring in the medical field :). Studying biology has
been great at UBC. It was hard leaving my small town and living on my own in first year. On top of
that, the course loads are much heavier at university. Although there were some initial struggles to
adjust, I have made great friends and I love learning. In first year I wasn't very interested in the
math and physics courses I had to take so I had to work very hard in those courses. However, now
that I am in third year most of my classes are biology classes which I am super happy about and I
really enjoy them. I'm happy to answer any questions about my experience studying biology! If there
is anything else you'd like to know that I didn't cover in this message just let me know! Have you
read through the anchor text ""Start Here""? If so, we can get started on 'Working through this

MAKE time. I try to hit the gym 4-6 times a weeks and eat healthy. It is not always easy, but I find
myself to be happier because I am not neglecting important aspects of my life. What are your

not realise that we had modules. Thanks for the message at the bottom of your most recent message!
This is a really important topic to me and i'm glad i could talk to you about it. Im just wondering
on some strategies you have to not feel so overhwhelmed or experience burnout. Especially with your
busy lifestyle how do you do it man!?!?! Sometimes i feel like i have to choose between school,
work, and family as its hard to balance my time and do whats best without eventually having to
recouperate from all these things. Any tips you have on balancing your time and just keeping
motivated and positive would be great!Mentor 2022-01-22, 21:12: I feel ya man… it can be tough to
make time for everything. It is something every needs to learn how to manage. My advice would be to
dedicate 100% of your focus to what you are doing. If you are hanging out with friends/family, try
not to stress about school. I have made the mistake of trying to study when I should be relaxing… in
the end you are not able to really do either. Sounds simple, but making a daily scheduled is key!!
Taking the time to plan you next day will give you a sense of purpose and it will feel great when
you are able to accomplish everything. In that schedule you have to set aside some time for
yourself, whether that means grabbing a bite with your friends/family to just browsing through
videos on YouTube. It is easier said then done, but if you are able to start doing that now it will
make things a lot easier when you get busy. You hear it all the time, but write down your major
goals. Set your priorities and understand that in order to have a balanced life you will may to give
up a little in each category (school, work, family/friends). What are some of your life goals? What
kind of things do you do to relax and enjoy life? I was informed that your semester ends Friday!!
Your teacher noted that we will be ending the eMentoring requirements for class (I will unlock
""Entering the Job Market"" task becasue I think it is required). We are also supposed to complete a
module of your choice so let me know which one you want to discuss. This was the message I receieved
""please let your mentee know that they can continue working with you beyond the end of the semester,

we prohibit sharing of contact information). If your mentee does not choose to continue on their
own, say your goodbyes, and encourage them to complete the end of program survey (unlock ""wrapping

about careers and post secondary courses. Its so cool to see that youre in med school, i would love
to hear more about that and what its like in the surgeon lifestyle. I am also into the medical side
of things as i'm trying to get my first aid level 1 right now but eventually get up to level 3. Im
interest in health and safety and am looking into related courses at BCIT. On another note its sick
to see you like kanye and drake! i love their music and other artists like young thug and gunna. My
favourite album is The Life of Pablo by Kanye though. Also i was wondering if you have any knowledge
in investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies? Nice meeting you though you seem like a pretty cool
dude i cant wait to talk more!Mentor 2021-11-24, 21:54: Hey Spencer, how’s it going!? I would love
to talk about careers and post-secondary courses. It’s cool that you are already learning valuable
first aid skills and looking into courses at BCIT. I remember how difficult it can be to navigate
through school websites and determine which courses are required. Although I went to UBC, I can try
to help out with any questions you may have about courses at BCIT When you say that you are
interested into the medical side of things, does that mean you are considering pursuing a career in
health care? If so, what careers are you considering? Hahaha yeah young thug and gunna are good too.
TLOP is also my favourite album! Production on TLOP is unreal, so many good songs. It is up there
with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in terms of his best work. Good to see the Kanye and Drake
beef cooling down. If they ever did a collab it would do major numbers. What’s your favourite song
from TLOP? I think I would have to say Waves or Famous. What are you listening to now? Life of a
surgeon… its tough. I am in my third year of medical school so I am currently doing rotations at
various hospitals. I did a 10-week rotation in surgery which included general surgery, orthopedics,
anesthesia, plastic surgery, and neurosurgery. Every rotation was cool and I could type pages about
it. Some of the cool things I saw… people would come to the emergency room with their hands cut in
half, electrical burns deep enough that you can see the tendon, and people with burns. It is wild. I
was lucky to be in the operating room and helping with the surgeries. Obviously, I am at the
beginning of training so I would only do basic stuff like guiding the camera in someone’s abdomen,
using tools to push aside organs, and suturing up the incisions at the end. They even led me cut
someone’s scalp open for neurosurgery! If you have specific questions about medicine or surgery I
would be more than happy to answer them Sorry, but I am not that knowledgeable about stocks or
crypto. I am looking to learn more so if you do have questions I can either look it up or ask others
around me. I see that you have to complete the Well being and self care, entering the job market
conversations, and at least one more before January 21st. Is there a particular order you will like
to tackle these? Is there anything you would like to share about what is going on for you right now?
For example, I am currently in my emergency rotation so I am working at crazy weird hours. I am also
looking forward to the UFC card on December 11Mentee 2021-11-25, 13:16: Its going pretty great! I've
been looking into getting my Occupational Health and Safety degree at BCIT. I think I am going to
take a year once i graduate to fingure some things out and work for a little bit. We did a litle bit
of work with a counsellor yesterday learning to send out transcripts and navigating the college and
niversity websites. Im gonna sure be glad once i get all of figured out because it is quite
confusing to see what requirements i need. One thing I would like to ask is that if I dont have a
required class how would i go about getting it once im out of highschool? Im looking into the
medical side of things and seeing what the options are. More so into the side of health/safety such
as a health and safety coordinator or safety officer. Which is someone who views worksites of any
kind (mines, stores, recreational centers, construction sites) and make plans to ensure worksites
are safe. There are many paths and options to the career which interests me. The carreer requires a
degree or certificate in Occupational Health and Safety. My favourite song on The life of Pablo is
definately 30 hours but Waves is such a good song. If Kanye and Drake made a song together it would
be one of the best songs ever for sure. Ive been listening to lots of drake lately especially his
album If Youre Reading This its too Late. Youre life as a surgeon sounds very eventful man, holy!
Where have you had to go for youre rotations so far? Also I couldnt imagine how nerve racking it has
to be cutting people open and moving their organs around?!?! How much longer do you have at UBC? And
also what is the most recent operation youve gotten to work on ? and is there anything youre looking
forward to thats coming up in your class? And what hapeens during your emergency rotation? Its great
what youre doing though, keep up the good work man!Mentor 2021-11-26, 10:54: Glad to hear that
thinks are going pretty well. Occupational Health and Safety sounds like a fun job! Lol, yeah it can
be confusing and daunting to navigate a university site. In terms of taking classes after you
graduate, I think you are able to do them in the summer. Since you are connected with the counsellor
maybe they would be the best person to ask. Life of a surgeon is wild, but right now I am a third
year medical student. After we finish 4 years we apply to become a doctor (eg. family doctor,
surgeon, neurologist, etc.). I actually just finished my emergency shift about an hour ago. Saw
people with spine injuries, injured knees and broken hips. So far I had majority of my rotations at
Vancouver General Hospital. I have done general surgery, anesthesia, orthopedics, neurosurgery,
plastic surgery, internal medicine and psychiatry. Lots of cool things too see. One thing I am
looking forward to is by OB rotation, where I will get to help deliver babies! I have at least 1.5
more years at UBC before applying to residency which can take anywhere from 2-6 years. I am new to
mentoring so I am learning as I go. I will move us to the next session so we can continue to chat
and work on some task!Mentee 2021-12-15, 12:28: Hey Ajay, Sorry ive been unresponsive as of late but
things are going good i've been spending my time learning more into the health and safety field. I
have been quite successful too as i have found a program i may want to pursue which is a masters
degree in health sciences. i am looking into obtaining my bachelors degree in environmental health
at unbc.And also workwise i'm applying to be a terminal attendent at bc ferries! which sounds like
an interesting job that i will be more satisfied with then at safeway. How have things been for you
lately? What kind of rotation are you doing right now?Mentor 2021-12-17, 16:56: Glad to hear about
the new things goning on for you! What does the application process look like to obtain a bachelors
degree in environemntal health? I imagine that it is exciting and also daunting to get the
application process started. Do you have any questions? Maybe I can help The terminal attendent
position does sound fun! What would your roles be if you were to land the job? Today is my last
shift in my emergency rotation. The rotation has been pretty wild. Some of the highlights include
suturing peoples faces, suturing eyebrows, cardioverting someone (delivering electrical shock to the
heart) and seeing a wide range of cool cases. I am looking forward starting a new rotation tho,
emerg is tough becasue the schedule is all over the place (eg. I am scheduled from 4pm-1am today). I
prefer a set schedule so I can plan my days better. Just wanted to give a heads up that I may not be
around my computer much between today and January 3. Going back to abbotsford to spend time with my
family for the holidays. Do you have any plans for the break?Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:40: Hey Ajay! How
was youre Christmas break this year? Did you and your family get to do much for the break? I imagine
travelling nowadays with everything going on would be a bit tough, what was it like travelling? The
application process to obtain a bachelors degree in environmental health, i am still trying to
figure most of it out. lol. But I think I am going to start a general science program at coast
mountain college in prince rupert and then transfer to unbc after the first year to finish my
bachelors degree, which i am quite excited to hear as I would like to spend some more time in prince
rupert. Just to give myself some time to save up money for tuition and all the other expenses that
you probably know all about. This week I plan on enrolling in the first year science program at
coast mountain college. I am still trying to figure out the process of applying for scholarships and
bursarys though. The terminal attendant position would be mainly me helping out passengers while
they are waiting to board the ferry, some parts of loading the ferry, and also the terminal
maintenance Have you started a new rotation now that you are back at ubc? Hopefully it will workout
better for you because i could not imagine a 4pm - 1am schedule. Also what is the process of
cardioverting someone?Mentor 2022-01-13, 00:45: Happy New Year! My break was awesome! On my forst
day off I headed up to Whistler with a few friends. We rented out an Airbnb and snowboarded for a
couple of days. The weather was great so I was able to practice in good conditions. It was my 3rd
time snowboarding so I’m still trying to learn how to use my lead foot to navigate. I then headed to
Abbotsford to hang out with my family. It wasn’t snowing the day I travelled so the drive was
smooth. It was nice to spend time with my family and not worry about studying. Played a bunch of
card games and whooped my cousin in FIFA (ps4). Now I am back at VGH during my internal medicine
block. I am in a new clinic each day. I spent a few days in the Pain and Symptom Clinic which cares
for people with terminal illnesses (various types of cancers). Heading into the rotation I thought
it would be depressing because these people will pass away with their condition. To my surprise,
most of the patients were in good spirits! The visits were focused on making sure that their pain
and symptoms were manageable. This includes prescribing opioids such as hydromorphone and laxatives
to help with constipation. The doctors were also very nice so I have been enjoying the rotation. I
am looking forward to tomorrows clinic which is a cardiology care centre. Lol, but I am not down for
my dermatology rotation next week… I am not a fan of skin conditions. Cardioverting arising in many
different conditions. There will be emergencies where things feel tense and you are not sure if the
patient will live. Thankfully, I was part of a chill situation for my first time. A man came to the
emergency department because he had some chest pain. We did an ECG and noticed that his heart was
beating funny. He had a condition called atrial fibrillation. This condition can be fatal so we had
to shock his heat back into the proper rhythm. Looking at the dude, you would not think there was
anything wrong. He was calm and pretty relaxed. We gave him some anesthetics and put the pads onto
his chest. From that point on its pretty simple. You wait until the machine is charged and the
patient is asleep or extremely drowsy. I then pushed a button and the machine did the rest. It was
pretty wild because he whole body spazzed out. His heart went back into normal rhythm and he walked
out of the hospital 45 minutes later. I imagine that it is pretty stressful/nerve wracking to figure
out the bachelor degree. Have you talked to anyone about it? Do you have specific questions? If you
would like, I can take a look at it if you send me the link. Oh man! Prince Rupert is pretty far up
North! I bet that it would be pretty cool to spend some time there. Have you ever been to Prince
Rupert or know anyone from there? What are some things that excite you about Prince Rupert? Seems
like you have a good plan going. Tuition can be a huge burden and you probably hear about people who
don’t plan well and end up paying student debt for many years. Hopefully you are able to land some
scholarships! If you ever want me to read over any essays don’t be shy to post them here! Hope your
new year is off to a great start. Any new year resolutions? Also, keep me updated about the terminal
attendant position! Oh, don’t forget to click on the “Wellbeing and Self Care” link in the green
circle! From my understanding we have to complete some mandatory modules for your school. I took a
look at that page and left my thoughts at the bottomMentee 2022-01-20, 12:50: That sounds like an
awesome winter break for sure! If i ever have to come down to UBC I think we will have to get a game
of Fifa going lol. I used to play lots with my brother when i was younger. Do you have a ps4 where
you are staying at University? If so i would love to play some games with you, I mostly have been
pplaying Nba 2k22 and Grand Theft Auto lately. I bet theres some pretty sweet snowboarding hills
down in Abbotsford. I've never snowboarded before but i've wanted to for quite awhile. I imagine it
gets pretty fast going down those hills though. Your rotations seem very interesting too, so when
youre in the rotations do you have hands on experiences with the patients? Did you have to put the
pads onto the mans chest with the heart issues? I think medicine and health is quite interesting and
the coolest jobs in the world so i love to hear what actually goes on in these situations. I have
spent a bit of time as a physiotherapist shadow i guess would be the term. I had spent a few days at
our local hospital meeting both in and out patients which was interesting. And yeah i must say the
morals were quite high and everybody was very kind and caring. Another thing is that i applied to
college a few days back! I plan on taking my first year general science classes at the Coast
Mountain College in Prince Rupert before transferring to UNBC to get a Bachelors degree in Health
Science. The program i would be taking is called Community and Population Health. It includes public
health topics, environmental topics, but what im really interested for is the microbiology and
disease control parts of the Class which wont be until the 3rd and 4th year. I look forward to
hearing from you and your rotation stories again! Happy New Years! Cheers!Mentor 2022-01-22, 21:01:
Hahaha yeah maybe one day we can play a game of FIFA, but I do not have my PS4 in Vancouver. I am
new to snowboarding. I encourage you to try it sometime! I can be a bit difficult in the beginning,
but it is not hard to control your speed. Every rotation has been great. In this case I did not put
the pads on the patient. I was busy and joined the team when they were already set up. The pad
placement is depicted on a diagram so it is pretty straight forward. How did your physio shadowing
go? Is there a reason you do not want to do that anymore? That’s cool that you had a chance to see
both in-patient and out-patient. I did not get a chance until I was in medical school. How did you
get that opportunity? What did you see and/or do? Shoot! It is unfortunate that you will not get a
chance to study microbio and disease control until your later years. It’s a tough subject to study,
but very interesting! Maybe you can get an opportunity volunteering? (eg. research positions) I just
finished my dermatology rotation. TBH I am not interested in derm and it is one of the few things I
“ruled-out” in my first year of med. However, it was actually really cool. I had an opportunity to
use a nitrogen gun. People came in with some wart-like conditions and one of the best treatments is
to freeze it off. I basically shoot compressed nitrogen onto their skin (-150 degrees Celsius). It
is painful for the patient, but it is effective. I was also part of a surgical team that removed
skin cancers. They do a “Mohs procedure” to treat certain types of cancer. Basically, we go in an
cut out the cancer. We then put the tissue onto a slide and look under a microscope to see if there
is any evidence of cancer on the borders we cut. If there is a sign of cancer cells, we go back to
the patient and cut out some more skin. It is a cool procedure because it basically cures the cancer
and we ensure that we are not leaving anything behind. Couple of interesting cases included a person
with skin cancer on their lower eyelid and another person with cancer on the side of their nose. For
the eye patient we basically cut out their lower eyelid… crazy to see. The nose person had a large
cancer so we cut out the entire left side of their nose... it is wild to see because the hole is
pretty deep. For the nose person we actually had to cut out some skin from their shoulder so we can
replace the skin they lost on their nose!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there any initial responses you might have from the video? Do you relate to some ways each of the
filmakers find inspiratin? Are there any strategies you already turn to when trying to keep yourself
motivated/inspired? Any other questions you may have about this topic, feel free to ask as well :) I
personally like the idea of the unknown and the curiosity that comes with trying to discover things
that I do not already know. I also try to take inspiration from most things that already exist in
life and trying to change it little by little until I have something new. I believe we've talked
about how you were planning to go into the art industry in the future as well. I think finding
inspiration would be very applicable in that field!Mentee 2022-01-20, 13:04: I like how they showed
the flimakers in different areas and in different seasons, it shows that you can find inspiration
anywhere even in winter. I do relate to the filmakers when they found inspiration in nature! i use
to take photos of nature and it would give me a lot of inspiration when i was in nature :) A
strategy i used a while ago is going for a walk and finding anything that inspires me! One strategy
i use more recently is going onto pinterest and finding inspiration photos/drawings! i think your
strategy for finding inspiration is really good! i know others that use that strategy too :) i agree
with you for finding inspiration is applicable for the art industry :)Mentor 2022-01-21, 03:38: Hi
Reba, I agree! You can take inspiration for art from a lot of places, online, or even from personal
experiences and express those abstract ideas visually. Pinterest is a great place! I also browse
around Instagram or DeviantArt as well. If you are not familiar with DeviantArt, it is a place where
different kinds of artists post their artwork. Some are really talented and worth checking out :) I
think that place is also a good source to find art related inspiration. I'm glad you already have
some strategies you prefer, though! Knowing what works for you can keep your motivation up even if
you feel stuck. Here are some other ones that I've just discovered myself as well from this website,
if you're interested! https://tinybuddha.com/blog/50-ways-to-find-inspiration-create-explore-expand/
I know your teacher wants you to finish these topics by tomorrow but if there is anything else you
want to discuss (about this topic or other ones) just let me and your teacher know. I can shoot the
eMentor staff an email about extending the program too :) If not, that is okay too! I'll complete
this convo and we can wrap things up with some last thoughts/reflections on this program :)Mentee
2022-01-21, 12:51: Ive heard of Devianart but i have been on it myself! If i need inspiration ill
definitely check it out:) Ill look at the link you sent too :) I think we can wrap things up :) I
just want to say I had an amazing time talking with you and being your mentee! Thank you so much for
taking time out of your days to mentor me too :) It means a lot to me and i really appreciate it! I
learned so much from you and i cant wait to put what i learned to good use :)",,"Mentor 2022-01-03, 04:30: Hi Reba, This is the next topic we will be talking about! Once again,
please read the anchor text above. Have you had a chance in school to create a resume yet? If so,
you may be familiar with how to isolate some transferable skills already. I can also help you with
wording and phrasing as well, since they went in depth about resumes and interview skills in our
school's Co-op program! :) You can list off some things you may already have, or come up with new
ones based on each skill area listed above as well. Feel free to ask about any other questions about
getting your first job too! I remember I had to apply to around 7 places before I got my first
part-time job in university, so I totally understand that it can be tough to start off!Mentee
2022-01-09, 01:23: I have already made a resume! i actually made one at the start of the class
because the other class i have this term is work experience! im doing work experience at the middle
in my town! I had my teacher for work experience check my resume and once im done work experience
ill be adding it to my resume! some of the skills i have on my resume are quick learner, good
communication and punctual! ive had one job so far but it was just newspapers when i was younger, i
split the work with my twin when we did it! a question i do have is how do you write a cover letter
for your resume?Mentor 2022-01-10, 03:52: Hi Reba, That's great! Are you able to think of examples
where you communicated effectively or demonstrated how you were a quick learner? I would look at all
the different things you did that made you successful at your newspaper job. Additionally, any
experience in school such as groupwork/projects you've done is also a good source to extract
transferable skills from too (leadership, communication, problem solving, etc.). When I created my
first resume to seek for my first job, I had to really search through all my in-school,
extracurricular, and personal experiences to write down as I did not have any work experience back
then. Usually when transferable skills are listed, it's also in more detail. Instead of putting down
""quick learner"", you may want to elaborate a bit more. For example: ""Able to adapt quickly to
workplace through problem solving and..."". If you have exercised a certain skill for a while,
quanitifying your experiences is a good idea too! For example, one of my points under Skills in my
resume is: - Empathetic qualities and organizational skills honed through over 6 years of customer
service experience Additionally, keep in mind that your skillset in your resume will need tweeking
from time to time depending on what job you are applying to. Try to match the job description and
what the job is looking for as close as possible when listing out your skills! Just by going down
the list above (Communication, Responsibility or Dependability, Quick Learner, etc.), do you feel
comfortable listing some examples where you've demonstrated each skill by elaborating a bit more on
the points you already have? :) I am able to proof read some for you if you'd like as well. As for
cover letters, their basically used to highlight or elaborate certain points in your resume and
anything that cannot be covered on your resume that the job might be looking for. In these letters,
it is a good idea to go through key points in your past experiences that you feel like relates to
the position and how this makes you qualified for the job, explain why you may be passionate about
the position/field of work, your prexisting knowledge about the company in the introduction
paragraph (need to do research on company's website!) and how it might align with who you are/your
own values, and anything that you believe might distinguish you from other applicants. Addressing a
cover letter usually follows this format: Full date Name of Contact Person (first, last) Title of
Contact Person (if known) Company Name Division/Section (if any) Street Address City, Province
Postal Code and then you can start writing your letter below :)Mentee 2022-01-10, 13:52: The only
examples i can think of when there is group projects or when i have to talk to others i can
communicate good with them and get work done and when i started doing work experience at the middle
school i quickly learned what the students were doing. Im pretty good with being on time and not
missing a day of school, i havent missed a day of school in like 6 years. ill start writing my cover
letter and start witht the info you gave me :)Mentor 2022-01-10, 19:56: Hi Reba, Great! I think you
should definitely include those in-school experiences too. It sounds like you've also shown
initiative and responsibility by making sure work is completed on time, which you can include as
well. If you know any computer programs such as Mircrosoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.) or
Google Suite (Docs, Calendar, Sheets, Slides, etc.), that is something to add to your resume too :)
Was your newspaper job delivering newspapers? Depending on your tasks for that job, I think you can
also try and write on your organizational skills, communication, teamwork, adaptability, or
attention to detail if you haven't already :) Once you're done your work experience, you'll have
even more skills to list down too! Here are some links that lists some common transferable skills
employers tend to look for, just to add on to what was listed in the link provided in the anchor
text. You can go through these and reflect back on what you've accomplished in your previous work
experiences so that it may be easier to construct your resume :)
https://www.skillsyouneed.com/general/transferable-skills.html
https://www.livecareer.com/resources/resumes/basics/transferable-skills-set I've also recently found
a handout that our school's advisor provided for us, and I think they've summarized the steps pretty
well when trying to match your skills to a job description: 1. Research employer 2. Note down tasks
and duties for the position 3. Note down required skills and knowledge for the position 4. Match
tasks with your own experience 5. Match requirements and qualifications with your own skills and
knowledge Let me know if there are any additional questions for this section! If you are ready, I
can open up pt.2 :)Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:28: i have microsoft office added to my resume already but
i didnt think to add google suite! ill add that to my resume :) yes! my newspaper job consisted of
loading the newspaper into my carriee bag and going door to door to deliver the papers in addition
to any ads i had to deliver with it! Ill look at the links you provided too :) i dont think i have
any more questions for this section! im ready for part 2!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-11, 04:10: Hi Reba, I have unlocked our first conversation topic as per your request:
Wellbeing and self-care :) Please read the above text + article and watch the vid! Personally, this
is a topic I am very passionate about as I have many people in my life that struggle or have
struggled with mental illness or mental health issues to some extent. I also totally agree with how
self-care shouldn't be treated as an reward and just want to reemphasize that. I'm not sure what
family bacakground you grew up in, but a lot of my friends (including myself) had parents who'd
place a lot of emphasis on academic success, to a point where everything else was neglected. It was
not until university I made a switch in my lifestyle and learnt to take care of myself better, so I
hope that you have some strategies in place that you know works for you when times are hard :) If
so, what are they? Are there areas you feel like you can improve upon as well? Let me know anything
you may want to discuss under this topic too :)Mentee 2021-12-13, 13:30: Im also passionate with
this topic too! Many people around me (including myself) struggle with mental illness and mental
health. I also agree that self-care shouldnt be treated as a reward! The video and article brought
up some good points about mental health! Lots of people put others before themselves and it can
really affect the person. Being reminded that taking care of yourself is important! Others often
forget to take care of themselves. The article mentions that doing the basics can help you a lot
when taking care of yourself and I agree with it :) Doing a selfcare action plan is very beneficial
for yourself and for the future! I feel like acedemic success was put more on my twin and I than it
was on my older brother, my parents put more pressure on grades for us than they did for for my
brother. I only started this year to take better care of myself and my mental illness. It's been
hard especially with with other stuff going on as well as doing school. I do have some strategies
but I think I could improve on them and find better strategies that will help me :) The strategies I
use for when times get hard are that I watch my comfort anime, I talk to my boyfriend about it, or I
play games with my boyfriend to make things a little less hard :) I feel like I could improve on
talking to someone about it when things get hard, I don't want to overwhelm my boyfriend or
anything. I want to talk about opening up to someone about mental illness or mental health, I feel
like a lot of people struggle to open up about their mental illness or mental health to
someone.Mentor 2021-12-15, 02:45: Hi Reba, I do agree that some people can overextend themselves for
others sake. It really important to explore exactly how much of yourself you're capable of offering
and set boundaries. It is not selfish. I'm also glad you have your outlets :) It is important to
have multiple resources to either vent or let out your frustrations though! I have a very close knit
circle of friends who I open up to, but I think it's important to ultimately open up to other people
too as you can get different types of perspectives as well :) Are you the type of person who is more
outgoing and have a lot of friends or the type to have a small circle? I found that meditation/yoga
also helps a lot. Meditation itself was pretty hard to get into, but once you do, it really helped
to calm my anxiety at times. Try giving a shot as well and let me know! There are very useful guided
mediations on Youtube. They tell you what to do (breath in/out, etc.) and all you have to do is
follow along. I have also found this helpful pdf a few months ago from the Canadian Mental Health
Association. It lists many free/low cost counselling services you (or people you may know) might
find helpful :) Most are in the lower mainland, but since everything is virtual because of COVID,
I'm sure the location shouldn't matter that much. I'll attach it here:
https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/q-and-a/where-can-i-find-free-or-low-cost-counselling Just click on the
link "" list of lower-cost counselling options in the Vancouver area"" in the text! Yea, it sucks that
mental health/illness is still a taboo thing to talk about. I personally think that once you're
older, people are more receptive and understanding to the topic, though! It felt like a different
story when I was in high school for sure. However, in terms of opening up to people, I feel that
everyone should first know that it's an important thing to do so. Start off with the people you
trust (family, partner, friends). Seeking counselling services (whether it be school counsellors or
a separate organization) might be a better option to some as well since it's a third party who's job
is to listen and not judge you. Liscensed counsellors/therapists also tend to be older than you, so
you might also gain some insight from a more mature perspective into the situation compared to just
consulting your friends. Regardless, there is always going to be resources out there (I can
gaurantee!), it's just important to take the initiative to seek and take them!Mentee 2021-12-15,
12:46: I need to work on boundaries, Im not with my partner anymore, he broke up with me on monday
:( I realize now that I didnt set a lot of boundaries and gave a lot of myself to him. i think
setting boundaries and not giving so much of myself would be good for the future. Im the type of
person to have a small circle of friends, recently though its only been a couple of people in my
circle, but besides that im usually by myself. opening up to others is hard for me, I want to open
up to others in the future though! I was doing yoga a couple years ago! I really liked it but I
stopped after i got hit to recover :( I'll do some yoga and tell you how it goes! I was going to
counselling in the past but I stopped because the counsellor I was with just wasnt for me :( I
really appreciate the pdf and I will look at it!Mentor 2021-12-18, 01:43: Hi Reba, I'm sorry to hear
that. Break ups are hard and sadly it's something almost everyone goes through. I hope you are doing
okay right now. If there is anything in particular that you may want to ask about, feel free to let
me know. I have confidence you're able to grow from this experience, though :) Just like how you
overcame other obstacles so far. I hope you embrace new and better relationships in the future as
well :) I used to have a lot of trouble opening up too! But I felt that venting to somebody who I
know will be accepting and supportive of me always made me feel better :) It's good that you have a
small circle to open up to at the moment nevertheless! I would still encourage to try again with
therapy if you find yourself ever struggling in the future. I think it took me around 4-5 tries
before I found somebody I felt was suitable when I went to counselling back in high school. It's
pretty common for people to do this before finding a right fit, and that's okay. Being open and
receptive to their suggestions is another huge thing too. I've had friends in the past that would
give up therapy immediatley because they did not believe that their counsellors suggestions would
work without trying it out for a period of time. I hope something on that pdf is of use to you
:)Mentee 2021-12-21, 22:17: Thank you so much for the kind words, it means a lot to me :) I am doing
okay right now! I'm doing better than I thought but its still hard I would have to wait for therapy
because they are really busy and don't have enough people to for everyone to come :( but once I have
the chance will go back to therapy and try a new person! One of the questions I have is what are
some things I can do for self care when im anxious?Mentor 2021-12-24, 03:39: Hi Reba, What type of
anxiety are you referring to? I would first identify if there is a common theme that makes you
anxious to try and address it. I've personally struggled with social anxiety before and something
that would trigger my anxiety was talking to people and being amongst large groups. If this is your
case as well, I would encourage you to put yourself in environments where you can continuously
practice talking to people (whether that be at school clubs, customer service jobs, etc.). Little
steps is key! Don't push yourself too much, but also don't go out of your way to avoid situations
that make you uncomfortable. Over time you'll start to adapt and notice progress! Regardless the
type of anxiety, some coping mechanisms I recommend in the meantime is exercising (increases
dopamine, increases mood!), talking with friends, going out, meditation, and practicing mindfulness.
Here are some links explaining mindfulness, if you are not aware:

previous message, please choose the next topic you will like to discuss as well in your next reply!
If there are furthur questions regarding this topic, I can answer it while introducing the next
discussion's anchor text or save it to the very end to discuss too :) I know that your teacher wants
you to complete all three topics by January 21st, so I want to make sure we have plenty of time for
the other two as well!Mentee 2021-12-27, 22:34: I have dianosed generalized anxiety disorder and im
pretty sure I have separation anxiety but I haven't been dianosed for it yet. I have meds for when I
have very bad panic attacks too. I mostly struggle with overthinking, panic attacks and intrusive
thoughts but I have been more mindful and self aware of my anxiety :) I will look at the links you
sent :) The next topic I would like to talk about is getting into the job market :) I plan to get a
job after highschool so I want to be prepared!Mentor 2021-12-31, 01:08: Hi Reba, I see. Practicing
mindfullness can definitely help with overthinking and intrusive thoughts. There is also an app
called Sanvello that you can download as well. It provides resources in identifying/preventing
overthinking by introducing you to mindfullness. They also have multiple discussion boards/chats
that connects you to the community with topics such as anxiety, work/school stress, depression,
health, etc. It also provides tools to help deal with such mental health issues as well! Have you
tried breathing exercises when coping with panic attacks? Although I don't think I ever experienced
one myself, I used to have a girlfriend who did and I found that coaching her through these
exercises helped! I would suggest to focus on something (speck on the floor, an object in the room,
etc.) when it's happening so you can feel somewhat grounded while doing deep breathing. Usually
people suggest a breathing pattern of 4-1-4 (breath in for 4 counts, hold for 1, breath out for 4
counts) :) I will unlock the topic ""Entering the Job Market"" as well so we can have access to the
anchor text before discussing :)Mentor 2021-12-31, 01:14: I forgot to add: there will be an
anonymous survey that needs to be completed before we move on to the next topic! I'll unlock it once
it is finished :)Mentee 2022-01-02, 17:41: i will look at the app! it seems like it will be useful!
i still use breathing exercises when i have a panic attack and i would ground myself, usually 5
things i can see, 4 things i can touch, 3 things i can hear etc! my ex would coach me through them
too but now im on my own so i do it myself :( ill do the survey right away so the next conversation
can be unlocked :)",,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 02:33: Hey! My name's Julia and I’m currently a student studying health sciences

of addressing the conversation prompts above, I would say I look up to Chadwick Boseman as a public
persona just because I admire his charisma. Another figure I admire is probably Audrey Hepburn just
because I find her very intelligent and kind. Breakfast at Tiffany's is also my comfort movie lol

is A Silent Voice! I like sushi, chocolate and fruit! I like to play games and draw :) One of my
personal goals is to relax and take care of myself more! One question I have for you is do you watch
anime?Mentor 2021-11-25, 13:11: I've been meaning to watch A Silent Voice! I've been holding off
just because it looks like it might be sad and I'm waiting for a day when I feel like getting
emotional lol Yes, I do watch anime. I usually enjoy darker ones like Parasite, Death Note, or AOT
but wholesome Studio Ghibili film are a favourite as well. I have to say my favourite from Studio
Ghibili might have to be Spirited Away :) What kinds of games do you like playing? I mainly play
shooters but I like any puzzle solving collab games that I can play with friends too. I also take
you're interested in pursuing a career in art in the future? Is something like game development of
interest to you or are you more interested in the fine arts?Mentee 2021-11-29, 12:23: A Silent Voice
is definetly a movie to watch if you want to get emotional! I use to watch darker animes but now I'm
into more wholesome ones :) I like playing shooter games too! More recently I have been playing COD
with my partner but I have been playing Genshin Impact since the beginning of the year! I originally
wanted to be a lawyer but I changed what I wanted to pursue since I got a severe concussion 2 years
ago. I'm more interested in fine arts! I mostly digital draw but more recently I have been wanting
to do painting since I painted a canvas last year :)Mentor 2021-12-01, 06:40: Omg I'm so sorry to
hear about your concussion! That must've been scary. I hope you're healthy and doing well now,
though. Regardless, I believe you're still capable of pursuing whichever carreer you want
nevertheless. I hope that the accident is not stopping you from doing so! :) Painting is very fun as
well. I've recently been doing some oil painting. It's a very finicky medium for me but I'm slowly
getting the hang of it. All my friends play Genshin Impact too! I've been meaning to try it out.
Maybe I'll check it out after all my exams are finished since I've heard a lot of good things about
it. Additionally, whenever possible, please go over the Working through this Program link above if

I tried oil painting but i struggled with it a lot, I hope you do well with oil painting :) There is
a lot of good things about Genshin!! They added so much recently and theres a lot to do! The only
thing you have to worry about though that it takes up a lot of storage, on mobile it takes over 14

poem above for your interest :) I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to open up and share with me
some of your experiences during this short time we've had to talk :) Thank you for all the kind
words in the previous message you've sent as well. I'm glad you've found these topics helpful and
I'm very happy I was able to help! This is a new experience for me as well so if you have any
constructive critism or any feedback about the conversations we've had or the program itself, please
let me know too! :) I'd love to improve. There is also an end-of-program survey to be completed if
you feel like it. Additionally, if you ever need anything, feel free to contact me on here again.

let me know if there are any questions or concerns you have about interviewing. It definitely gets
easier the more you do it because the first one I prepared for was all over the place despite
preparing days in advance due to my nerves haha As you get more comfortable, there won't be that
much pressure and you won't have to think about all the different things you have to do to present
yourself constantly because they will all come out more naturally :)Mentee 2022-01-13, 12:27: I feel
like some of the stuff in the video is common sense, like you shouldnt be rude to the person
interviewing you, if you are rude to them then you obvisously wont get the job! You shouldnt be rude
to someone you dont know either If you dont know an answer to one of questions in the interview
should you just say that you dont know? I feel like making up something on the stop isnt good! How
did your first interview go? ive never been in an actual interview so im not entirely sure how it
goes!Mentor 2022-01-14, 01:03: Hi Reba, I think doing thorough research about the company, possible
compititors (if it's something related to a retail job) and just preparing beforehand alone can
prevent from not knowing a question most of the time, as weird ones don't appear too often. From my
experience, questions that caught me offgaurd usually are ones that ask about experiences I do not
have. In this case, I would refer back to the ones that I already have and relate it the best I can
to what the job is looking for. For example, if the job is looking for data entry and I have not
worked with statistics before, I can say that I have categorized client information in a spreadsheet
for an administration job or something like that. Worst comes to worst, if they ask you something
that is impossible to improvise, then all you can say is that you do not know. However, interviews
would mainly ask you questions related to the job description, your qualifications, and alongside
some other common ones like ""What do you know about the company? Why do you want to work here? Tell
me about yourself"" and ""What are some of your values/hobbies/strengths/weaknesses/ideal work
environment?"" During my first interview, I was pretty nervous so I did not articulate my answers as
well as I would have now. They did ask a lot of the common interview questions I have prepared for,
however I felt like the employer became disinterested mid interview and was no longer listening.
Looking back, that was kind of unprofessional and made me glad I did not end up getting that job lol
I never had an experience like that later on, though. Usually employers are pretty respectful.
Here's some more interview questions to look at if you're interested!
https://www.mcgill.ca/caps/files/caps/guide_interviewquestions.pdfMentor 2022-01-14, 01:09: I forgot
to mention that it might be very useful to record yourself answering some premade interview
questions when you practice in the future as I noticed I personally say filler words like ""um"" or
""uh"" a lot when I'm nervous. Playing back a recording of yourself can really help you notice any bad
habits that you may have, which might be hard to catch otherwise!Mentee 2022-01-14, 13:02: I will
definetly prepare beforehand for an interview! ive done mock interviews in the past during school
but it was always short and its a few questions. i think i could answer most of the questions i
would be asked in an interview with no problems but i would probably still get nervous. im glad that
interview experience only happened once, i agree with you that it was kind of unprofessional of them
to not listen to you mid interview! i will look at the link you sent me :)Mentor 2022-01-16, 02:34:
Hi Reba, Oh, that's great! I went into this without having done any practice interviews so you'll
definitely be more prepared then I was. Don't worry though, after a couple of interviews it'll be
less nerve-racking for sure. Are there any additional worries you might have with
interviewing?Mentee 2022-01-17, 11:58: What should you wear for an interview? i know you should
dress nicely like a blazer with a blouse but what else can you wear to an interview?Mentor
2022-01-17, 17:30: Hi Reba, Usually anything buisiness casual will suffice! You're right, this will
include blazers/blouses/dress pants/a nice sweater/formal A-line skirts, etc. That is safest option
in my opinion! It was also recommended by our school's advisors to dress like so as well. The
formality of your clothes might also depend on the organization you'll be having an interview with
too, but I would just avoid anything like jeans, graphic t-shirts, jumpsuits and stuff like that for
interviews in general. Hope that answers your question! If you don't have any more questions and
feel comfortable with moving on to the next topic, let me know and I can open it up after
evaluations :)Mentee 2022-01-18, 12:26: Thank you for answering my questions! I dont have anymore
questions and i am comfortable with moving onto the next topic! ill do the evaluation so we can do

time, there is an article for you to read about writing a resume. Let me know some skills you have
that you think would be important to include on your resume :)Mentee 2022-01-13, 13:26: I'm not sure
what kind of skills I have that is good for a resume. The only skill I sort of have is being a
pretty fast typer, not sure how much words per minute, but I feel like I'm a good typer.Mentor
2022-01-14, 12:52: Hi Ole, being a fast typer is actually a really great skill to have on a resume!
Definitely a skill that not everybody has. I've included this on some of my resumes also. I bet
there are actually a lot of skills you have for a resume- you just might not think about them all
the time. For example... -do you have experience working on teams, either at school, or on a sports
team, etc.? This shows you are a good communicator and good at team work, both of which are really
important skills to have -have you done any volunteering? This can show all sorts of things-
initiative, leadership, etc. -even just things like showing up to school on time can show
dependability -are you friendly and/or patient? If you're applying for a customer service job, even
just being nice is something that is really important! No manager wants a customer to walk into
their business and to be greeted by a mean employee -are you organized? These are just a few things
that come to mind, but I hope you can see that there are lots of skills for a resume that you
probably have inside of you, but just don't think about :) They might sound like basic things, but
they're all actually really important! I have included all of these things on resumes I've done in
the past. Let me know if this gives you any more inspiration!Mentee 2022-01-18, 12:59: I used to
play on school sports teams. I find working fun when I know someone I work with there, or can make a
friend there or something. I just recently started working in the meat department at safeway and I
have a friend that works there so we can talk there and it's fun. I don't know if working in the
meat department is much experience because the main thing I do is just clean. But sometimes I do
other things like price the meat and package it.Mentor 2022-01-18, 19:28: Hey Ole, hope you're
having a good week so far! That's awesome you used to play on sports teams. As I mentioned before, I
honestly think there are so many important skills that sports show- commitment, communication,
leadership, working well under pressure, coachable... and so many more. Also that is great that you
are getting work experience at Safeway! Having work experience will make it easier to get employed
in the future. Being able to put that experience on your resume shows your future employers that
you've been a reliable employee in the past, that you know how to learn new job skills, that you
know how to interact with customers, etc. And you now have a reference for any future employers. I'm
going to head over to part 2 of this topic- I'll send you a message from there which you can respond

that self-care is something that you think about? I think for me, self-care is something I know is
important, but even with this understanding, it's often hard for me to feel like I have time for it.
For example, when I'm in school, I just always feel like I have so much to do that taking a break to
do something I enjoy sometimes can feel like a ""waste of time"". I'm trying to work on changing my
mindset on this but it's definitely hard at times!Mentee 2022-01-24, 12:48: Yea I feel like I think
about self-care quite a bit. I usually take time to think about myself and what decisions I'm
making. But recently I've been doing stupid things, but sometimes they are really funny, but
sometimes the decisions I make are just stupid. So I just need to focus myself a bit more
againMentor 2022-01-24, 16:17: Fair enough! Sounds like you're thinking about the decisions you're
making which is really important. I think another important thing is that self-care is something
that can be built into our everyday basic survival activities if we want it to be. For example, do
you get enough sleep? Is eating well something that you think about? It's interesting to me that we
can practice self-care just by changing our mindset on things that we already have to do every day.
Everyone has to eat and sleep, but if you are eating and sleeping in a mindful way, this can be
self-care.",,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 13:41: Hi Ole! My name is Hailey, and I will be your mentor this year! It’s

add everything together. I'm almost done it, but I'm not sure how much time I've spent on it. It's
definately over 30 hours. I'd want to spend even more time on it, to completely perfect it, but it's

When I watched the video, it definitely made me think about past interviews that I have had. For
example, the video suggests not using one word answers in interviews. I agree that this is super
important but it can be hard to think of things to say when you are on the spot! Something I try to
do to prevent this from happening is do some prep for the interview where I think about all of the
skills/personality traits that would be good to have for the job I'm applying for, and then come up
with the common questions I think they would likely ask to get me to talk about these skills. Then I
think about what my answers to these questions would be, and if possible, I try to think of a story
from my life that can back up what I am saying. In my last job interview, I was able to guess almost
every question they asked me before I had even walked in the interview room!Mentee 2022-01-20,
12:25: Do you have a memorable interview story?Mentor 2022-01-20, 14:57: Hey Ole, this is part 2-
looks like you found it! I think probably my most memorable interview story is from a few years ago
when I was applying to be a camp counsellor in Victoria. At the time that I was interviewing, I was
actually travelling in Thailand, so I did my interview over the phone in the middle of the night
(because of the time difference). I also hadn't been in Canada for 6 months so it felt weird to be
applying for something so far away. I ended up getting the job which was good! What about you?Mentee
2022-01-21, 12:37: My only job interview was with Safeway. It wasn't really an interview, because we
were just at the front desk of Safeway, and we were standing. All my other jobs never had
interviews, such as offloading, delivering newspapers, working with my friend for his dads company.
Working with my friend was my favourite job, we talked a lot and were such slow workers. But it was
only a summer job, that was my first time working with him, and I would want to do that this summer
aswell, unless I'm working at the port. I liked it because the friend I've worked with is a good
childhood friend, and he was my neighbour for a bit, but I moved to my mom's house and I barely seen
the guy. So it was awesome catching up with him. He graduated a few years ago, so thats why I never
seen him much. But Safeway is also fun because I also work with a good friend sometimes, but the
other people I work with aren't fun people.Mentor 2022-01-21, 18:52: That's sweet, sounds like you
have a lot of work experience! I bet it would be really fun to work with your friends, I honestly
don't think I've ever had a job where I got to work with one of my close friends. But I've
definitely made new friends through work which has been nice. Since your school semester ends next
Friday I'm going to open up a new conversation on well-being and self care, I think this is one that

Kin sounds perfect for you :) Have you thought about what kind of career you want to do with it?
Maybe physiotherapy or occupational therapy? Those are usually common with people interested in kin!

Dear Nathan Hello, I hope you are doing well and I hope the end of the term is going smoothly for
you. I want to wish you all the luck with your project and the end of the term. I uderstand how busy
and stressfull end of terms can get trying to finish up assignments after assignments as well as
exams. You got it, just pull through and it'll all be worth it. Below I will list my answers to your
questions: 1) I really like your plan of looking into paramedic and fire fighting programs.
Personally, I believe the paramedic program will be a more fulfilling field for someone who is
interested in healthcare and sciences. But if there is a unique program that allows you to qualify
for both and to do it at the same time that sounds like a great option for you, so you dont have to
spend time on two different programs individually. The honest truth of the option of becoming a
biologist is that you cant stop at a Bachelors degree you need to continue your schooling to at
least a Masters degree if you want to make a better income and have better and higher job
opportunities. For me, since I knew I wanted to continue my schooling by applying for medical school
I was ok with that fact. 2) I was in school for 5 years and the reason for that extra year was that
I went to another university to finish my Associates degree and then applied back to UBC to finish
up my Bachelors degree. Typically however, undergrad programs are 4 years in length to get a
bachelors degree. 3) In regards to taking a gap year, it really depends. I didnt take a gap year but
I sorta wish I did because I have worked so hard in highschool none stop and each year took a summer
school classes that by the time first year of university came around I was burntout mentally. But,
if you feel like you dont have that exhuastion feeling then I would say dont take a gap year because
it will slow your process. The reason why I say that is that maybe in uni you would want to try
""co-op"" opportunities which is usually a year long. Co-op are opportunities for students to go
abroad to study and get their credits or be connected to an organization and work for them for a
year and then come back to school (I encourage you to look it up online so you are familiar with it
ahead of time). So, if you later decide to do co-op then you will be pushed behind for 2 years
technically since you have already taken a gap year. also another reason would be maybe one
term/year you dont do so well in your classes then you would have to take less classes and by nature
that will slow down your credit collecting process hence why some people finish a Bacheors program
in 5-6 years. Or you might want to do what I did or you simply want to take it easy and take less
courses each term which all naturally slow you down so if you already fell behind a year because of
a gap year you will graduate later than your fellow peers. But, if none of that matters really then
go ahead and take the gap year also if financially you need that gap year then its understandable.
4) general advise regarding post secondary education: - take it easy dont rush yourself or overwork
yourself quality of how you do in classes is always more important than the quantity or the number
of classes taken in each term. - sometimes you are required to take a number of classes due to
requirements but ensure you balance your course work. what I mean is make sure that if one term you
have 4 courses and 2 are very hard to ensure the other 2 are easier or have less course work. - have
fun but at the same time dont neglect your school work it is very easy to fall behind school work in
university/college. - reach out for help earlier rather than when its too late and the damage has
been done. - go to prof's office hours where they provide extra help to students, that way you can
build relationships with your profs. - make sure you are tracking your credits so you ensure each
term you are meeting the credit requirement and so when last year of your program comes you arent
stressing about being short on credits and then having to stay an extra term just because of that.
5) for careers I would say research about the ones you are interested in then see how the schooling
required for it is like and dont worry if you arent sure still but since you are interested in a
specific field that requires a specific program I would say its better to think about it theraly
because once you start in that field its harder to be able to do generalized careers since you got
the certificate of a specific program that allows you to land one specific kind of job. I hope that
made sense. I hope I was able to answer your questions the way you were expecting. I would
appreciate you to read through the next section of the ""entering the job market"" coversation topic
and ask questions relating to those areas so we progress through the topic. Thank you for taking the
time. Best of luck to you.",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-25, 00:01: Hi Nathan This is Sahar, I am so excited to get to know you and talk to
you about topics that interest you as well as those that your teacher has chosen for us to go over.
I also can't wait to help you with questions that you might have. But before that, I would love to
hear more about you, your hobbies, interests and some fun facts about you. To start it off, I will
share some fun facts about myself. I am 24 years old boomer who has already graduated University. I
refer to myself as a boomer because although I am young but I have an old soul, so I can realte to
you but I also can relate to the older folks. One more fun fact, I am an immigrant from Iran. I
moved here when I was 14 years old and had to deal with adjusting to a brand new foreign culture all
by myself. I am also bilingual, fluent in Farsi and English. I would love to know whether you are
also bilingual or not. Lastly, incase you wanted to know I graduated UBC with a Bachelors in
Science- Biology and I also have an Associates degree in Science Biology. So that makes me a
Scientist :). I have way more fun facts about me that I will share as we get to know each other, but
I won't bore you too much. I cant wait to hear all about your fun facts.Mentor 2021-12-06, 20:25: Hi
Nathan, I hope you are doing well and are enjoying the snowy days that are approaching. I just
wanted to follow up and see how you are doing. I would love to hear back from you. I have been gift
shopping for my family and friends for Christmas I would love to hear what you have been upto. Feel
free to message me whenever you can :)Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:39: Hi sahar I'd like to apologize for
taking so long to respond. Ive been pretty busy with both my school work and after school
activities, my mom is pretty scary so when I get home I always have lots to do. Christmas this year
has been pretty fun for me. The town I live in Prince Rupert almost never snows but this year was
very different for once we had a snowfall it was crazy. We had so much snow it blew my mind. When
the snow was dying down I went Christmas shopping with my younger cousin, I wanted to make sure to
get gifts for everyone so I even got my girlfriend to help me find something for her parents. How
was your Christmas? Some hobbies and interesting facts about me would include, I enjoy playing
sports like badminton, soccer and softball, I have a French bull dog named Daisy she's white with
black spots, I'm indigenous and my native background is from an island called Haida Gwaii, and my
favourite subject in school is biology. Recently do to COVID I haven't been able to play the sports
I love thankfully I've been able to go to the gym where I can play badminton, a few years ago we had
2 people who've played in the Olympic and they helped teach me and my partner. Ive been playing
badminton since I was in grade 2 as for softball I've played for 5 years but the past 2 seasons have
been canceled thanks to COVID. I have 2 sisters both older then me one is a nurse who moved out her
name is Stacey and the other a pharmacist named Calli. I wouldn't quite call you a boomer yet my
sister Stacey is older then you and I would classify her as a boomer. I think its amazing that
you're a scientist ive always wanted to be one but my grades aren't exactly the best so I've been
thinking about specializing into a specific science related job. How long did you have be in school
to become one? The transition from Iran to Canada must of been very difficult. I was born a raised
here so I couldn't imagine what it was like. I hope you've been enjoying Canada, I bet its a lot
colder here. Thank you for waiting for me to respond ill try to respond faster for now on. I also
hope you'll be able to understand me for some reason my grammer has never been the greatest. I hope
you had a great Christmas and a happy new year🎉Mentor 2022-01-13, 04:39: Dear Nathan :) Hello, I am
so happy to hear that you are doing well and no need to apologize, I understand that managing
school, home works and extracurricular activities can be time consuming. I had so much fun reading
through your message it was very detailed and I was able to get to know you more. I was extra happy
when I saw that your favourite subject is biology, a subject that I have majored in. So, we both
share that interest; don't give up on that interest just beacuse you believe your marks aren't what
they should be there is always time for improvement and anything is possible you just have to try
applying and take the chance. I am glad to hear that you had an exciting Christmas with family and
friends, mine was very fun too. I will be talking more about how I was able to get my degree as we
move onto conversation topics and I am happy that I have a few years left till becoming a complete
boomer haha. Your sisters sound lovely and successful just like yourself. Nathan, since some time
has passed we are a bit behind on the conversation topics that your teacher has required by the
deadline of Jan 21. So, what I was thinking was to get started as soon as we can, first you can
choose which of these topics you want to start with first. the topics are 1) well being and self
care 2) entering the job market and 3) a conversation topic of your choice. Then, I would appreciate
if you can read through the ""working through this program"" section so you are aware of what this
program looks like. Once, you confirm with me I will open the coversation topic of your choice one
by one as we complete them so hopefully we can finish on time so you don't face any issues. Can't
wait to hear from you and thanks again for reaching out.Mentee 2022-01-14, 13:10: Hello sahar =D Im
glad to you were able to get to know me. Science has always been my favourite subject but when I got
into high school I realized I was able to take all sorts of science classes. As soon as I got into
grade 11 I tried to take as many as I could this year I'm taking biology, chemistry and physics.
I've already taken and passed biology, after my current classes ill be taking chemistry and I'm very
excited. Recently in my careers class I think ive decided I want to be a paramedic and a fire
fighter as both of those jobs connect. I've been talking with my tutor Megan and her boyfriend works
for the hospital in many town and thanks to her I'm able to volunteer at the next health clinic and
meet and talk to paramedics I'm very excited. When I got onto this website and realized you have a
biology degree I was excited so I may ask you a question now and then. I was wondering how long you
had to be in school or you biology major? And what was the hardest assignment you had to do. I agree
im hoping we'll be able to get as much stuff done. Currently im not sure if you were told anything
about this but in my careers class i have a project worth 50% of my grade called the Capstone
project im a little bit behind on it but ive been slowly progressing in it. The subject my capstone
is on is steps/how to become a paramedic. The topic I'd like to choose is 2) entering the job market
I think i have experience in this topic because ive had a job at one of the grocery stores here for
over a year. I will read through that as soon as i can. Hopefully we'll finish them all. Thank you
for taking time to read and respond.Mentor 2022-01-16, 16:20: Dear Nathan Hello, I hope you are
having a good day today. I am so happy to hear that you like sciences since many people are
intimitated by it. I am also happy that you seem to know what you are interested in career wise and
what I'm going to do after sending you this is that I will officially open the ""entering the job
market"" conversation topic so we can dive deep in that topic and work through it as soon as we can
so we get you as caught up as possible with what your teacher required. to answer your question, it
typically takes 4 years of under grad to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Biology degree but it may
differ based on if you choose to go on co-op and how many classes you choose to take in each term.
For me since I was away for ~2 years to finish my Associates degree in Biology; I finished my
Bachelors in 5 years. My hardest assignment I would say were some of the Chemistry lab reports, they
were challenging but I was able to at the end work through them by working hard. I am sure you will
do great on your Capstone project and your topic sounds really exciting and engaging. The careers
you are interested in are exciting and I can't wait to officially discuss them as we start the
""entering the job market"" conversation officially. I will now send you this message and proceed to
open that conversation topic so watch out for that. Thank you for taking the time and responding I
can't wait for us to proceed through this program.Mentee 2022-01-21, 12:45: Hello Sahar Next week
ill be presenting my capstone I'm excited to get it done and over with but I still have to finish
and i'm not looking forward to that. Thankfully my tutor has helped me come up with a plan on what
to do and how many slides I want. I honestly don't know how or why I got interested in science but
out of all my classes it was the most interesting, I think theres like 4 other people in my grade
that also like science. I'm ready for the ""entering the job market"" I'm hoping we can get this topic
done. I'll try to respond faster but since I have one week left of my classes I have a lot of work
to do. Thank you for answering my questions. Before i choosing to become a paramedic i was thinking
of other science related jobs and one of them was getting a degree in biology and trying to become a
biologist or something like that. I think its really awesome that you managed to survive that many
years in school especially with such a difficult subject. It's to see how long you were in school, I
was looking at different paramedic programs and schools and they all varied in length. I think i saw
one program going for 2 and then I saw another going for over 2 years. Chemistry for me has always
been one of the subjects i had absolutely no clue what to do but I'm taking chemistry 11 and 12 for
my next classes so hopefully ill be able to get at least a B in those classes. Since I'm almost done
my grade 12 year I'd like to ask another question. Do you have any advice for college or if i should
take a gap year or not? My parents don't want me to take a gap year however almost everyone i know
is taking one, and getting a job to get money then going to school after a year sounds pretty good
to me. For an actual career ive been thinking of multiple things but after thinking a lot becoming a
paramedic sounds perfect for me, I've also been thinking of becoming a fire fighter as those two
jobs go perfectly together and ill get paid even more. My teacher told me that we're starting it and
she seemed pretty happy thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond. I hope these
past few days have good to you, and i hope you have a good weekend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

important? I know when I first started university I struggled with the large workload and didn't
take the time to care for myself by doing things such as exercise and being with my friends. Do you
set aside time to care for yourself on a regular basis?Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:07: Hey Tommy so far I
think I have been doing pretty good with self care I am active working out or doing sports for 4
hours a day. I meditate for about 20 minutes every night. I supose I could start washing my face and
doing skin care. I make sure to talk to friends but I am always busy. I talk to the girlfriend all
day well working on stuff etc. I should also eat more I am just always busy.Mentor 2021-12-09,
12:49: Wow, Julius! It sounds like you know how to take care of yourself, especially through staying
active and talking to your girlfriend. Are there any other people in your life that encourage you to
take care of yourself? If so, what kind of things to they do to take care of themselves?Mentee
2021-12-13, 13:15: I am not sure what friends do to take care of their selfs but I do not have many
close friends just due to the fact that I am so busy but I do have lots of friends that are just not
as close that encourage me to take care of my self etc. For many of the people I do know there is
one way they take care of them selfs and that is by talking to me. I help out alot of people going
threw depression etc I do my best to help them and help them stay away from the edge.Mentor
2021-12-15, 11:21: Very interesting Julius! It sounds like one of the ways you care for yourself is
by talking to others and helping them through some of their problems. It is good to hear you have
many friends that you are able to talk to when needed. Before we move on, have you ever noticed
anything in your life that signaled to you that you need to take better care of yourself?Mentee

next few months. I am 21 years old and I study Psychology at the University of Victoria. I think it
is very cool that you're interested in business and entrepreneurship. What kind of business did you
start when you were 12 years old? I also see that you enjoy video games - I do as well. What are
your favourite games to play? Feel free to tell me anything else about yourself and ask me any

Howdy Tommy nice to meet you! You said you studied psychology if you do not mind how has that been
so far and what exactly are you stuying to do. I am jsut intrested because for awhile I was really
intrested in becoming a psycho therapist but I am no longer sure. I do not think I can handle that
much school. I got really interested in psychology around 5 months ago when I was hosting a
relationship advice podcast that quickly turned into metal health due to some of the people we met
and the psychological issues they faced some were very interesting and we never thought we would see
first hand. When I was 12 I started my lighting/audio business that I still have but every since
covid has been shut down. I am still trying to learn as much as I can about business and have been
working on it online. Started building a new one 3 days ago that I am going to work on over the next
6 months.Mentor 2021-11-24, 22:11: Hi Julius, studying psychology has been very fun so far. I have
gotten the chance to take many different psychology courses that have studied relationships, the
brain, and many other things! I am studying to be a doctor in the future since I love to help
people. Being a psychotherapist does require lots of school but would be worth it if you are
passionate about helping others! It is very cool that you started a business at such a young age. It
sounds like you are very creative and have lots of cool ideas that I would like to hear more about!
And Julius, make sure you check off the ""Entering the Job Market"" box below since it is required by
your teacher.Mentee 2021-11-25, 13:04: I selected job market also what kind of doctor are you aiming
to be. What are your plans to survive med school not many people can put up with 10 plus years of
school. I know I could never. After school I only plan on working for maybe a year after that right
away I wanna just start in business and work for my self.Mentor 2021-11-25, 18:42: I am not sure
what kind of doctor yet. I think I would plan to work as hard as I possibly can and make sure I
realize that all the work will be worth it one day! That is a solid plan Julius, it sounds like you
have many ideas which you could turn into your own business. What would be your favourite kind of
business to start up? Also, it does not show that the job market box has been checked off, so maybe
just try one more time and we will start one of the conversations . Which conversation would you
like to do first?Mentee 2021-11-30, 14:16: You can pick the convo I am fine with anything. But for
buissnes I am not sure my dream one might be in real life a advanced airsoft buissnes mixed with
advanced lighting or some other cool stuff. I would also love to work online maybe owning a software
company or something. The doctor thing is cool one of my friends has told me about how it has been
so far for her. She is a 4th year neruoscience student that wants to become a Pediatric Oncologist
so sometimes I ask her about that stuff. Actually everyone around me is into that kinda stuff my mom
is a nurse and girlfriend is in nursing right now she wants to become a Anesthesiologist. But yeah
many medical people and students around me.Mentor 2021-12-01, 01:11: Both of those ideas sound super
cool! I always used to enjoy playing airsoft with my buddies and think that it could turn into a
pretty awesome business. You've got lots of time to come up with other ideas if you're not sure
right now! Ok sounds good Julius, we will start off with well being and self care and then we can
move on to entering the job market after that .",,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-20, 13:35: Hey Julius, do you have any questions about the interview video?Mentee

great - that is until school started back up hahaha back to being busy. I'm really glad you tried my
technique and it worked!!!! I feel it causes less stress if you're able to implement it. French huh,
good luck with that essay! Since the new year started I have taken up relearning mandarin! Its
really fun and I have some penpals on an app called hellotalk - if you want to continue your french
learning its worth a shot - duolingo as well, I paid for the full version but you don't have to if
you don't mind ads. As for the capstone, I haven't done one until university actually for an art
history course (it was basically an essay) - I feel like its just a fancy word for ""big final
project"", so try not to stress too much. If you want and if its not too late I can help you
brainstorm! Try to make it about something you enjoy - like if it were possible to connect it to
skateboarding somehow haha. Also I hope you don't mind I have moved on to the general discussion
topic that you chose, after a few messages (hopefully we have the time) we will move onto the last

you have any new years resolutions? Mine is to continue learning mandarin!",,"Mentor 2021-12-07, 20:56: Hi Hunter! I'm so happy to be hearing from you :D ! I'm glad you got
pokemon pearl, wow already victory road!!! I'm only on the fourth gym :/ haha, what's your pokemon
team looking like? I hope you don't mind I have moved on to the self care section of our
conversation, since you asked me about if I have any tips for writing essays and doing projects!
Honestly its tough, even for me, but self care is a great motivator. For essays I do my best to
break it up into days so that I don't have to do it all in one day and get overwhelmed, leading to a
mental breakdown lol. So if its a 5 paragraph essay I'll take one day on the introduction, one day
on a body paragraph, one day on the next body, and so on. That way you can reward yourself with free
time after only doing about 30 minsutes of work! And make sure to take frequent breaks! I know you
can feel bad taking so many breaks, but honestly coming from me sometimes you need to browse twitter
for like 10 minutes. Its like a mini reward! Always be proud of what you do, even if it is only a
little bit that you got done. Being hard on yourself won't solve anything, it'll only make you feel
bad. When I mention self care, what comes to mind for you? For me its playing on my phone for
breaks, drinking water, taking my medication when I need it, brushing my teeth, cooking for once,
talking to my boyfriend, etc. What kinds of things do you do as breaks when you're overwhelmed? Do
you get sad/overwhelmed often? I know in highschool I used to, I was caught crying in the bathroom
once and was taken to a school counsellor. Remember if you're ever feeling bad you can always reach
out, if anything I'm here for you!Mentee 2021-12-15, 12:34: Hello Sonia, when i think of self care i
think music, playing video games, meditation and breathing techniques things like that. For me i
think music is the most effective theres something about listening to music that calms the mind , it
also makes me more productive when it comes to doing work ive noticed that i get a lot more done
when there is music playing. I tend to litsen to chill tunes and rap, what about you? what do you
prefer? When i have projects and essays given i seem to never what to start them and it takes me a
while to actually even try to start, not doing it all at once seems like a good idea for me, i will
probably try that, I have a couple essays due for my french class after the winter break so maybe
ill give it a shot for those. Also i have a feeling taking breaks frequently wont make me feel so
bad. some otehr things i do when i feel overwhelmed or sad is to go for walks, when its not winter i
would also go out with my skateboard i find that skateboarding really helps with my mental health so
it kinda sucks when it snows so much. By the way my team in shining pearl is torterra, palkia,
medicham, togekiss, houndoom, and luxray. Torterra and luxray where the first pokemon i had so they
kinda carry my team, i got all the way to the champion after the elite four and realised i was
severely under leveled so i have some grinding to do lmao.Mentor 2021-12-18, 17:37: Hi Hunter! I'm
so happy to hear from you again :D ! Those are really great self care techniques, I feel like you're
even better at it than me lol! I should learn from you. That's awesome you came up with strategies
for combating sadness like listening to music and going for walks/skateboarding, that's the
essential of what self care is - taking time for yourself. Everyone needs time to ponder and feel
happy, otherwise life feels meaningless. Talking/hanging out with friends can also be self care! Do
you have any close friends you can rely on? Also regarding music, this might sound werid but its
really cool you enjoy it. I might be a psychopath but I don't actually enjoy/listen to any music....
LOL werid I know. I just don't have the ear for music I guess :( I'm glad you'll try my strategy for
essays! It really helps, I'm telling you haha. Less stress. I'm glad taking breaks doesn't make you
feel bad, everyone needs a break! Even if its a half hour break every ten minutes lol that's how I
do it (maybe not the best...). Your team sounds super strong! I chose chimchar for my starter but I
don't usually keep my starter on my team since they're not cute when they evolve. I only keep cute
looking pokemon........ my team is chimecho, gardevoir, drifloon, and luxray! So we both have a
luxray - he looks so cool fully evolved. Good luck with finishing the game! Hopefully there's some
post game to enjoy. After your reply I will move on to the next self care section, hopefully we can
finish all our sections before your teacher needs them by! Sorry if we end up going a bit faster
near the end of things. Also feel free to talk to me or tell me about anything you'd like! I hope
your winter is good!Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:39: Hi Sonia,how are you? I have an essay due for french
class pretty soon i think i dont remember when but i think its soon. i tried that technique and it
helped so thank you for the advice. i also have my capstone to do, it's kind of hard to even start,
i have no idea what to do it on. Did you do a capstone when you graduated? I dont know why its so
hard to come up with a subject ive had a lot of time to think about it but i cant seem to come up
with anything. At this point im getting a bit worried because i dont have a lot of time left. Im
sure ill figure somthing out.",,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 19:01: Hi Hunter! I'm Sonia! I'm a fourth year UBC student studying English and
I'm really looking forward to getting to meet you! I notice you like video games as well, what kind
of games do you play? I only have nintendo stuff haha. Currently playing the pokemon Diamond remake,
its a lot of fun! Do you like pokemon? As for the prompts, some of my favourite ""words to live by""
is by Yusei Fudo from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, he said ""There is not one card in this world that is useless""
refering to his cards in his deck. I value this quote because I feel like it is meant not only to
refer to cards, but to people too. Everyone is useful, even when you feel useless and hopeless there
is still someone who will treasure you. I find that really beautiful. What is your favourite quote?
As for the ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" prompt, I'd like to show one of my favourite
yu-gi-oh cards. Sorry, kind of nerdy with all this yu-gi-oh stuff, I know, haha. Its a yu-gi-oh card
called ""worm solid"", look it up if you can! I can't figure out how to attaches images to the text
just yet :( Its kind of ugly, but that's what I like about it. All the colours are really nice and
something about it is just epic. What do you think of worm solid haha? What do you find uniquely
beauitful in this world?Mentee 2021-11-30, 12:30: Hello Sonia nice to meet you aswell, I am
attending my last year of highschool. I do enjoy playing video games a lot, my fovourite one right
now is skater xl, it is a skateboarding simulator game it is more realistic than other skateboarding
games and thats why nit is my favourite. I also have a nintendo switch and i think im going to get
one of the pokemon remakes it looks like a lot of fun, i played the original pearl on my ds when i
was younger and liked it a lot. I remember i tried to start watching yu gi oh but i never made it
past the first season, I never really got into the card game at all but from what I watched i thunk
my favourite character had to be the grandpa, he was such a unique character and always seemed to be
in a good mood and i admired that.Mentor 2021-11-30, 19:31: Hi Hunter! I'm so happy to hear from
you!! I hope you're doing well :D I'm not sure how semesters work in your highschool, but the end of
the year is always busy with school work :( so good luck! Its really cool you play a skateboarding
game and skateboard too! It would be cool to see your skateboard, I know skateboarders always have
the coolest stickers on them! And yeah pokemon pearl was awesome! I played the old one too, I
totally recommend the new one, the new mining is really fun. That's nice you know a bit about
yu-gi-oh hahaha, sorry to talk about it so much. I'm interested to know more about the kinds of
things you watch! Do you like anime? youtubers? television? movies? After your response let me know
if you're ready to move on to the next section and we can continue!Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:03: Hello,
I am well how are you doing the way our semesters are these past couple years have been weird, we
are doing two classes a day over ten weeks so its a little different than usual. It is better than
last year though when we were only doing one a day. I bought shining pearl on i wanna say thursday
and its really fun, as of now i have made it to victory road. I dont watch anime a lot but i did
watch attack on titan and i cant wait for part 2 of the final season, for movies i enjoy horror and
comedy movies, i watched the newest halloween movie and i thought it was pretty good. I cant even
remember the last time I watched cable lol, i only watch things on netflix and things like that. In
school I kind of find it hard to find motivation the actually study for things and put effort into
essays, projects etc. Do you have any tips to help with that? It would help a lot,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

biking. what should do for it am kinda cunfusd on it right nowMentor 2022-01-11, 20:46: Hi Joel!
Happy New Year! I’m not sure about the exact criteria that you have for your capstone project, as
that will vary based on your school. However, in terms of possible ideas, you could make a video
highlighting the benefits of mountain biking along with clips of yourself on the trails. Another
option would be to do a research paper on the benefits of exercise and time in nature, then relate
this to your passion for mountain biking. If you provide me with the criteria of the capstone I can
help you further, and we can continue to brainstorm after we have completed the rest of this
program. In the meantime, we should complete the requirements laid down by your teacher. To do this,
if you would move to the section known as “Conversation Choices”, which can be reached by clicking
on the blue button right above the messaging box. Under this section, there will be a series of
boxes for you to check off. Your teacher has asked for you to check off “Well-being and Self Care”,
“Entering the Job Market”, and one more option of your choosing. Once you have checked these off, I
can unlock your favorite and we can begin that topic! I am very excited to continue to work with you
through this program! Feel free to ask me any questions you have, I will make sure to reply to you
as quickly as I can! I hope to hear from you soon!Mentor 2022-01-23, 15:44: Hi Joel! As you know,

worked on, as long as we try to improve then everything is going to be ok. Same here sorry for the
wait, I just unlocked the conversation on wellbeing and self-care, let us begin our great journey
(woohoo）Mentor 2022-01-10, 22:07: Happy New Year Hendrick, how were your holidays? Did you relax all
the way through the days just like me? Keep in mind that the future is your story to write so make
next year the best one yet! Now that we are back from the holidays, we can finally make some new
progress on our Well-Being and Self Care Conversation. (clear throat) Self-care is a critical aspect
of life and I learned this through experience, thus I’m warning you to pay close attention to this
Conversation so you can be better prepared（‘-‘）I remember I had some difficulties dealing with
self-care back during my first uni year. It was the first time I had to leave my family and live
independently, so I had a lot…A LOT to learn about how to keep me alive while surviving through
school. Like cooking every day, grocery shopping without a car, paying bills and surprise surprise,
*self-care*. After some chaotic time and getting into bad shape, eventually, I learned the
importance of self-care and slowly started to take care of myself, such as healthy meals, a regular
sleep schedule, balanced work and rest time. Anyways, that's just my experiences, you can look
through the pages and try to answer some if not all of the questions listed, also if you have
questions don't be shy to text me :DMentee 2022-01-13, 14:15: Happy New Years to you too, Faith. I
think I should pay close attention to this conversation too, because my self-care strategies and
whatever haven't been the best lately. I haven't been getting proper sleep, and because of that in
the mornings I have trouble getting out of bed on time for school, and I've been late pretty much
everyday this week. Or since it's a new year, I guess I've actually been late for everyday this year
so far. Which kinda sucks. I've also felt a little stressed and sad because I'm a little behind on
school work and it's kinda giving me anxiety. I don't think I've been drinking enough water either.
I've heard it's good to drink 8 8oz glasses of water everyday, or in total that's 64oz, which is
equal to half a gallon. And if you like the metric system better, half a gallon is about 2 litres. I
think I've been drinking like 500mL-1L everyday, which isn't THAT bad, but I've also been drinking
stuff like energy drinks and pop, which I've heard is pretty bad for your body. I haven't been
exercising too much, and my eating habits haven't been the best either. Anyways, I'll stop with the
rambling. I read the article listed above, and considered some of the questions listed, and it's
making me think that maybe I'm not the best at this self-care stuff :/Mentor 2022-01-14, 21:33:
Totally relatable!! I also struggled with the sleep schedule and healthy diet, not going to lie I
almost fell asleep during afternoon classes because I went to bed late the day before (don't tell
anyone) AND this would be the perfect chance for us to look into our self-care routine and reflect
on areas where we can improve and adjust. Now it's your time to shine! Look into the 2 Extension
Activities: Your Self Care Action Plan and Adulting 101, give them a try and complete them to the
best of your abilities. Based on what I know, this is going to be read by your teacher so be extra
alert. Lastly, you know the drill, need help or have a question? Just ask ;DMentor 2022-01-20,
19:06: Hello Hendrick, this is your lovely mentor speaking :P How's everything going? Haven't heard
from you for a while and I miss you already... don't forget to connect with me back on the platform

bit.Mentor 2022-01-24, 02:53: Sounds good to me! Let me know if you think you are done with the
current conversation so we may open the next one (?Do we have the time tho?) I know your school is
ending pretty soon but since your teacher said we have to do 3 conversations I'm kind of worried
about your grades ;-; （Whispers：Let me know if you want to extend the Ementor time）Mentor
2022-02-02, 03:34: Hello Hendrick, I just want to say that it was very nice meeting you! I think we
both share many similarities and faced the same troubles too! Although we didn't get to other
conversations, I felt like we both learned a lot of things and reflected on self-care. In the end, I
wish you gained something from the Rural EMentoring program and good luck with your school ;D",,"Mentor 2021-11-23, 20:38: Hello Hendrick! How's everything? ;D This is Faith and I will be your

at UBC (almost there...). I'm taking 3 courses this term, two of which are fish diversity courses
and one entomology course (yea or nay?) I know I know, I admit that I am a huge animal lover, so
this term was a lot of fun for me (...also pain). I enjoy painting, reading and mobile gaming in my
free time! (I see you are also into gaming?) I wish you could tell me about yourself. What class are
you in? How good are you with your hobbies? Is there anything else you want me to know about you? If
you have questions, just send them to me and I will try my best to answer them！Mentee 2021-12-01,
12:47: Hey, Faith. I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How've you been? Yes, I do play a lot of video
games. I'm not really competitve about it though, like some people are, I just like to play for fun.
Right now, I'm just doing two classes, Careers and French. I am in French Immersion, but if I'm
being honest, I don't like it very much. I've wanted to quit, but since I only have one more year of
school left, I might as well just finish the year in the French Immersion program because I've heard
that completing it can be beneficial. Sorry for taking so long to respond. I just haven't been on
this website too much.Mentor 2021-12-03, 04:30: Hello Hendrick, I'm doing pretty good but had a very
busy week cos it's the final season (again :/) And SAME HERE I'm not a competitive gamer as well,
although I wish I could become better at it. French is indeed a very useful skill, base on what I
know, a lot of the government positions require both languages, so I would definitely recommend you
to continue your learning French. Anyway let's get back to business, please complete the Working
Through This Program, and apparently we need to complete 3 conversations: Well being and self-care,
Entering the Job Marker, and one of your choice (exciting); don't forget to check your selections in
the Conversation Choices! If you have any questions or things you want to discuss just text in the
box. Also, let me know which one you want to start first! We have until January 21st to complete
these requirements so we can spend roughly 2 weeks per conversation, we will start with our first
topic next week! In order to set up deadlines and stay on top of things, it's a good idea for us to
arrange a weekly meet-up time, so please let me know your availability!Mentee 2021-12-09, 13:09:
Let's start with well being and self-care. Because why not, I guess. I usually use this program
during my morning class at school, which takes place at 9am - 11:26am. So somewhere within that
window would work best for me as a meetup time. If that doesn't work for you, or if you'd like to do
it at a different time, then let me know. I'm not really too woried about what time we meetup at. As
long as we can find a time that'll work for the two of us.Mentor 2021-12-10, 23:18: Sounds good to
me! Don't forget to do the Working Through This Program and check your selections in the
Conversation Choices! We can unlock the Well being and self-care after you compete these tasks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

college are low, I am leaning towards choosing an electrician, but I still do not know. I like to be
active as well and like every boy I like to play video games for fun. My hobbies are playing sports
like basketball as i've been on the basketball team every year, I recently picked up volleyball and
cannot play on the team because it is already made, I would like to ask how you pronounce your name
and how you handle your living situation.Mentor 2021-11-25, 22:42: My name is pronounced et-ee-n.
It's a little tricky. I did move out of my parent's home for University. It was really tough are
first because I missed them a lot and it is hard to adjust. But after a few months, I got used to it
and created a routine to help me stay focused. Volleyball is a great sport to pick up and is kind of
unfortunate you couldn't play on the team, but at least you still have basketball. It is okay not to
know what you want to do after you graduate. Hopefully, we can talk about it and I can try and help
guide you to a decision whether it be trades or not. Did you want to share at least 2 of the prompts
listed (Food for thought, Symbolic strength, etc) whichever ones you'd like to share?Mentee
2021-11-29, 12:33: Thats great to hear and yes I do, these are words to live by, ""You can have
freedom or you can have peace, but do not count on having both at once.""- Robert A Helin. I find
this quote very interesting because it means a lot and shows that freedom and peace are not the
same, you can have a moment of peace but be in a war. You can have freedom but still be locked up.
Another is public persona, I think this person is defitnetly look up to is my Uncle, His name is
Christopher Nelson, He works at the port and has a lot of work experience spanning from volunteer
work and working in a school district and cook, he has worked a lot of hands on jobs and still has

studies.Mentor 2021-12-02, 22:12: I'm glad school has been good for you! How long have you been

Social studies and English are great subjects, what is it that you like most about them?Mentee
2021-12-07, 13:50: I've been playing volleyball for the past 3-4 years, I played in my grade 8 year
as well as played on the junior grade 9/10 volleyball team my grade 9 year. What I like most about
English and social studies is that it gives me a chance to voice my opinion or my thoughts. I have
very bad social anxiety so it's extremely hard for me to talk to others or participate in class
conversations, so I enjoy having the ability to write down my thoughts and my opinions.Mentor
2021-12-09, 21:05: That's awesome that you've been playing volleyball for a few years. It's nice to
have something consistent throughout school. I also feel quite anxious about speaking up during
class, so I totally get what you mean. It's very nice to have classes with opportunities to share in
a different way, no wonder you enjoy English and Social Studies. It's been so nice getting to know a
bit more about you. If you're feeling ready we can begin the next stage of the program by clicking

hoping to pursue a master's in physiotherapy after undergrad! I will be your mentor for the next
couple of months:) Having read your profile it seems we have a lot in common but I'll share a few
more things about myself here. I love hiking, cooking, my dog (Hershey), and running. I love trying
new vegan restaurants and food. Currently, my favourite place is Grounds and Green in White Rock
because their Influencer bowl is amazing (It's got the perfect amount of crispy tofu and the fresh
pesto sauce is so good! Highly recommend)!! The prettiest hike I have done is probably the Lindeman
Lake trail because it ended at a beautiful teal coloured lake with trees all around it. I would love
to get to know a bit more about you! What are your hobbies? Do you play any sport?Mentee 2021-11-30,
12:39: hey! i do not play any other sports because in 2017 i had a surgery at bcch i had the taylor
spatial frames on for nearly 10 months. had to physio with them in the hospital for 2 months twice a
day and 2 months at sunny hill and then went home and had the frames on till.and then a year later
during the summer after that i had my second surgery on my knee.with all the physio therapy i hadto
do througha period of maybe 2 years that is exactly why i wanna go into pediatric physio therapy.and
since i no longer do physio therapy i workout 5 days a week in the gym.and other random facts like
yours is my favourite food to chose to eat is suhi my favourite is a deep fried calidronia roll with
nigiri or other favourite food is chinse food,since i lived in sucha small town there are only a few
restaurants for my two favouritesMentor 2021-12-01, 14:22: Omg, that seems very stressful! I'm glad
physiotherapy helped you recover though! I also went through an injury that resulted in surgery (not
as bad as yours though). It was a compound break in my forearm from basketball, and I basically had
to stop playing because of it. Also, pediatric physiotherapy is a very rewarding career path. I
actually currently volunteer at a kids physio clinic and it is so much more fun than regular physio.
If you have any questions about this feel free to ask! If you are ready, we can start the program:)
I have read through and watched the ""working through this program"" videos, and believe you have to
do the same before we can open up a conversation. So, once you're done doing this, shoot me a
message and we can decide which conversation to open up first. I think 2 of the conversations
(self-care, Entering the Job Marker) are assigned by your teacher and then you get to choose one
btw.Mentor 2021-12-09, 01:05: Hi Carsen! How's it going? I was wondering if you got my last
message?Mentee 2022-01-10, 13:15: i cant seem to find the start up videosMentor 2022-01-10, 14:33:
Hi Carson! Just above the Send Message box (the one you've been writing to me in) towards the right
side, it should say ""Working Through this Program"" in blue. If you click on this it will lead you to
the readings and videos. Let me know if you find it!Mentee 2022-01-11, 12:09: i found it now, i have
read through how do we start or chose a convorsation now?Mentor 2022-01-11, 23:05: Hey, I will
unlock the conversation! So you have to complete 3 conversations: self-care, Entering the Job
Marker, and one more of your choice. Let me know which other one you want to do other than the two
assigned by your teacher and which one you want to start with and I'll unlock it.Mentee 2022-01-12,

2021-11-28, 01:42: Hi Hari, Wow, there are some great resources here! I found the career page from
Work B.C. especially interesting because i shows which occupations are most in-demand currently.
UBC's application deadline is December 1st if you want to be eligible for scholorships, so I have
been working on my application the past few days and didn't realize how much of my life I had to
consider so soon. I am applying for a bachelor of commerce. That sounds kind of math-y. If I didn't
do that well in all of my high school math classes, do you think UBC would still consider me? I have
mostly A's with the exeption of pre-calc 11 and physics 11. That scares me! I will spend some more
time reading through these sources and will get back to you with more questions shortly. Thank you!
RuthvenMentor 2021-11-29, 03:15: Hi Ruthven, I'm glad you found the resources to be interesting.
While it's definitely useful to use the context of occupations that are currently in demand as a
guiding factor, I'd recommend you also research industries and job roles that are nascent now but
hold a lot of promise. You'll find occupations that sit within the intersection of the two and that
those might be interesting to consider. Don't let your previous grades stop you from applying. I'd
say, go ahead and apply and give it your best shot. If it requires you to submit a letter of purpose
then that's a great way for you to explain why you want to do the course and why you'd be a great
fit for the school. Most universities look at the story and not just at the grades. Also, in terms
of being scared, don't worry at all. Give it your best shot. That's all you can control., and once
you've tried everything you can, rest easy knowing that you have. No matter what the outcome
:)Mentee 2021-11-29, 14:40: Hi Hari, That is a good idea-looking at nascent and promising
occupations too. I'll continue to apply for whatever interests me regardless of fear of not having
grades good enough. Writing essays and other responses is good practice for me anyway! I will try to
get into pre-calc 12 next semester too... I need it for commerce at UVIC and UBC, so if I struggle
with it, I will just get a tutor and try my best. Thank you so much! RuthvenMentor 2021-11-30,
00:07: That's a great attitude to have. I'm sure if you try hard enough, sky is the limit :) UVic
and UBC are both great schools. Have friends from both of those universities, and while school is
definitely hard work, they loved every minute of it.Mentee 2021-12-07, 10:21: That's very nice and
encouraging- they look like fantastic schools, I hope I get into one of them. I still don't know
what to apply for at UVIC though. Either business or the faculty of humanitites or education social
sciences... too many interesting courses.I'm trying not to worry too much about what faculty to
apply to because I heard you can transfer to another after a year of study.Mentor 2021-12-09, 23:16:
Yeah there are a lot of different options. Apart from the courses, I'd also encourage you to talk to
a few students at each university to understand a little bit more about the culture within the
different faculties, the options available on campus for extra-curricular activities and development
outside the regular courses, the support given for finding jobs and just general opinion from people
about the staff and professors. These are all important too in terms of developing into a holistic
individual during these programs. As you have these conversations, you'll also get a general sense
of the community available at these schools.Mentee 2021-12-26, 19:20: Hi Hari, I haven't checked in
for awhile as I was on a trip and having computer problems, I'm sorry! Yes, checking in with friends
and people I know who've attended my schools of interest is a good idea... My biggest decision to
make right now is wether or not to take a gap year for travel or going straight to university; a
friend of mine did take a gap year and said she is very happy she did and has no regrets. she worked
and saved money, so it benefitted her in that way. She would be a good person to ask questions
related to that. My parents have similar interests to me, but have taken very different paths in
their schooling and career lives. I will talk to them more too. I agree with you that I will benefit
from getting to know about the unique opportunities and communties at each school. Flyers and
websites can be helpful, but an actual person who has experienced things as a student, and a person
there for enjoyment is a source of information that will help me too. RuthvenMentee 2021-12-26,
19:26: Also, I was wondering if you have any tips for organizing your work and tasks for school.
Lately, I have been struggling to organize my life! I often find myself with piles of paper to-do
lists, countless alarms and reminders on my phone, and folders of notes everywhere. It's ridiculous.
Step one should probably be to buy a new planner for 2022. Got any organization tips up your
sleeve?Mentor 2021-12-29, 10:04: No worries at all. Hope you're having a relaxed holiday, and that
the increased restrictions haven't impacted your plans too much. I look forward to hearing more
about how your school exploration journey progresses. In terms of productivity, two things that have
helped me immensely are:- 1) Google Calendar: I run everything through google calendar charting out
my day, and booking time for everything. This helps me stay extremely organized and ensures that I'm
getting through everything that I need to do. I even schedule time for things like browsing through
youtube, etc. This makes sure that I don't spend too much time doing it, but also gives me something
to look forward to sometimes when I need to get through some mundane work. I'd recommend blocking
time for specific papers, and almost planning out your entire day. This doesn't mean that you can't
move stuff around etc, but at least this gives you great visibility on everything that you need to
achieve in a day/week. 2) Zero-Inbox Emails: I'm not sure how many emails you need to deal with on a
daily basis, but this is something I'm religious about, and has seriously helped me boost
productivity. It ensures that I don't miss anything that requires me to take action and at the same
time, helps me feel at ease as it's reinforces that I'm on top of everything that I need to
do.Mentee 2021-12-30, 23:40: Google calender is a great idea; I already use Google on every device
so it would be convenient. I have never thought of doing that before. I like the idea of adding
leisurely activities such as watching youtube... Having something to look forward to after a busy
work day is a good way to get motivated. Usually, my inbox is chaos, and junk gets mixed in with
important emails. I will definetly use your zero-inbox tip. I think it'd give me some peace-of-mind
when it's that time of the day to sit in front of the computer and sort through it all. Thank you
very much!Mentor 2021-12-31, 01:00: Yes those two things have significantly improved my
productivity. I hope it helps you too. For the zero-inbox, would recommend moving mails that don't
need any action from you to different folders which make it easy to find anything in the future, but
also help eliminate clutter. Look forward to hearing how 2022 becomes incredibly productive for you
:) Happy New Year!Mentee 2021-12-31, 01:09: Awesome! I actually just finsihed archiving/deleting all
of my ancient emails, and organizing the new mail into five diferrent folders based on urgency to
reply etc. Happy New Year to you too!Mentor 2022-01-07, 11:13: Hi Ruthven, Trust you're doing well.
Came across this resource recently that I thought you might find helpful as you look to explore
different paths - https://educationplannerbc.ca/ Regards HariMentee 2022-01-11, 00:38: Hi Hari, I am
doing well, thank you. Funnily enough, all university applications (at my school, at least) are
being submitted through that site this year, so I am somewhat familar with it, but have never really
explored it's other content. I will check it out now! Thank you very much for the suggestion.
RuthvenMentor 2022-01-11, 12:19: Oh that's interesting. I wasn't aware of that. Also, if you want to
explore some of the other conversation topics on this platform, I'm happy to open up the same. Let
me know which ones you'd be interested in. Regards HariMentee 2022-01-16, 01:14: Yes, I actually
just submitted my application to UVIC's business school through Education Planner the other day! I
also browsed the site some more and found a page full of scholarships to look through. Maybe ""Paying
for School"" would be a good topic to open? Wherever I end up, money will always be necessary. Thank
you, RuthvenMentor 2022-01-16, 10:44: That's good. Congrats on getting your application in. Looking
forward to hearing how it goes. I've opened up the conversation as requested. Hari","Mentor 2022-01-16, 10:43: Hi Ruthven, As requested, I've opened up the next conversation topic. Let
me know once you get a chance to go through the content, and similar to last time we can have a chat
about any questions you may have. HariMentee 2022-01-18, 00:34: Hi Hari, Thank you for opening this
discussion! I've read and watched the content in the text, and wasn't surprised that scholarships
came up so often. The hard part for me is managing my time so I actually apply to all that I am
eligible for, and also figuring out which scholarships those are. What are your experiences with
scholarships? I also would like to ask you how you keep track of payment dates? Forgetting important
tasks is my biggest nightmare! Another question I have is about budgeting: when is a good time to
create an annual budget? Thanks again, RuthvenMentor 2022-01-18, 14:21: Yeah scholarships are
definitely a large part of this process, and there are always so many that keep coming out. That
could make it hard to stay on top of everything. I would try to keep it all as organized as possible
using a central excel sheet or something with the various deadlines listed to make sure that you are
constantly ahead of schedule. With respect to payment dates, google calendar can be a good tool. Set
a reminder for yourself a week or two before to make sure funds are arranged, and another the day
before due date and one on the due date. That typically works for me. You will find your own process
for the same, but this might be a good starting point. Starting an annual budget at any point of
time is a good idea. You do not need to wait for anything at all. It's always a good habit to start
keeping track of your spending, and trying to balance the same. There are a lot of easy-to-use apps
and tools to help with the same, and I'd make sure to keep enough time monthly to review the same as
well. Keeping a budget is just the first step, making sure that you're constantly looking at it and
finding ways to be better is the second and more important step.Mentee 2022-01-24, 17:34: Thank you
for the tips. I'm going to make a spreadsheet right now to start organizing scholarships with their
deadlines and other important information, as well as adding the deadlines as reminders in Google
Calender. As for a budget, I will try to be a more mindul spender- and keep track of purchases and
expenses with a tool of some sort. I'll look for some apps. Maybe I will set a monthly reminder to
look through my spending and saving history. Thanks, RuthvenMentor 2022-01-24, 19:34: That sounds
like a great idea. I'd consider looking at apps like Mint or YNAB as a start. I'm sure there are so
many more. One of the coolest things that I learnt about spending and being mindful of that is ""A
dollar saved is two dollars earned"" - It basically means that we would do a lot for earning an
additional dollar, but typically even if we do earn an additional dollar, that means we only make an
additional 50cents or so after tax. However, if we save a dollar, then that's an entire dollar that
remains in our pocket. It's just a different mindset to have since typically saving money is seen as
uncool. In case you read a lot, I'd also recommend reading books like ""The Wealthy Barber"" or ""Rich
Dad, Poor Dad"". These are some great books on personal finance habits and understanding how some of
the underlying things work. Regards HariMentor 2022-02-01, 08:31: Hi Ruthven, Just wanted to check
in on how everything's going? Are you currently working on applications or are you thinking about a
gap year instead? Would love to hear what's been going on? Regards HariMentee 2022-02-04, 19:39: Hi
Hari, Things are going okay, I have been quite stressed lately with school- not because it's been
difficult, more like keeping track of what needs to be done and when; I have poured lots of energy
into certain areas while forgetting the rest (like working hard in English 100, and neglecting
French homework and online courses, etc.). The stress about not completing everything in school on
time has led me to prioritize that over applying for scholarships/bursaries/schools, something I
need to do very soon too. Thank you for the book titles!! I love reading, novels and nonfiction.
Especially audiobooks during the morning, because I can listen while getting ready for the day,
cleaning up, and other chores. My dad was the owner of a bookstore and my mom is a library
techinician, so books are plentiful around my place. And that quote- about one dollar spent is two
earned- that is very mind-opening. I can be a careless spender, I admit. There are many things I
limit myself to in terms of spending, for instance, I do not shop online unless i absolutely need
to; living in a small town without many stores means that most people do shop online frequently, so
that has been helpful. The bulk of my spending is definetly for activities like jiu jitsu classes
and going out for coffee way more than the average person (cafes are my favourite places to study),
but I think that the main thing that needs to change in my spending is keeping track of it. I
downloaded both budgeting apps you've suggested, I haven't yet gotten into the habit of using it for
all of my spending yet. I think that writing reminders to use it in my physical agenda may help with
tha as it is always with me when I'm out and about. I am currently leaning towards going to
university after graduation. Lately, the idea of post-secondary education has seemed more exciting.
I need to apply to more schools than I have, very soon. I made a spreadsheet for scholarship
applications and corresponding deadlines, thank you for suggesting that! My hope is that I will
complete some of those applications before they are overdue. I am working on updating my resume
right now to send to my school's counsellor's office for the BC Exellence award, in hopes that it's
not too late- I didn't realize that the due date was approaching so soon. I think I'll send a
message to a school counsellor today to inquire about the ther bursaries/schoalrships available, my
own school counsellor has been absent lately, too bad because he is so helpful! Thank you very much
for checking in. RuthvenMentor 2022-02-09, 16:36: Hi Ruthven, It's definitely understandable that
you're feeling a lot of pressure. You have a lot going on, but the fact that you know what all you
have going on in itself is a big first step. As long as you are aware of everything going on, you'll
find your own methods to get through each of the tasks that you have. It's really interesting to
hear about your parents, and your love for books. I absolutely love books and I have been trying to
keep on track with my reading habit this year. With respect to the budgeting apps, there are some
that are directly connected to your bank account that help make tracking easier. Though I find that
going through it manually is a good way to be aware of your habits. It's good to hear that you're
excited about post-secondary school. You're going to do great :)Mentee 2022-02-22, 01:57: Hi Hari,
Thank you so much! Yes, this past week, I have been feeling more optimistic about school. I have
been signing up for more info sessions for UVIC and UBC, the schools that hold the most interest to
me that I've applied to. A friend of mine actually created a group spreadsheet of scholarships and
bursaries, which they shared with my friends and me, which is very nice; now I have one spreadsheet
for deadlines of the scholarships I will apply for to track which I have completed suggested by you
and one to aquire and suggest other ones toand from the shared spreadsheet. I think that the
positive peer-pressure of my friends applying for scholarships will make things easier for me. I
also got accepted into VIU a day after applying last week- I applied to a few schools in addition to
UVIC and UBC so I would feel better knowing I have backup. It worked, and knowing that people do
often transfer to other schools is comforting. In regards to bugdeting- I am not very good at
tracking my expenses still, and the bank I am using right now doesn't allow me to access online
banking because I set up the account as a ten-year-old. Switching to another bank is on my to-do
list, and I'm expecting to get some assistance from a parent with that. Hoping that it'll make
things easier to track if I can access my bank accounts on a device readily available. I found a
copy of The Wealthy Barber in the classroom of my grade 11 philosophy teacher. He's got a pretty
large collection of books in his room and let me borrow it. Last year, when I was in his class, he
told the whole group that reading it would change our lives, so better late than never! The novel I
have recently startd is ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"", which I got at my favourite
little bookstore (the only one in my town, too). I hope you keep uip the reading this year, it's
such a rewarding hobby! Lately, I have been trying to find balance between my in-person and online
classes. Prioritizing assignments that are due soonest, spending more time on things I struggle with
most... the things I am terrible at. I think that setting scheduled times to work on specific
assingments would be good. Using Google Calendar and my agenda have proved to be quite useful for my
organization! I rarely forget about appointments until the last minute now, so that is fantastic.
I'm hoping to continue to improve my organization outside of scheduling, too. Thank you, Ruthven
:)Mentor 2022-02-22, 16:17: It's great to hear that you got into VIU. Congrats. I'm sure you'll hear
good news from UVIC and UBC soon too. It seems like you have a lot on your plate, but are still
doing a great job managing it all and ensuring that you're on top of everything. That is incredible.
Be sure to take some time to reflect on that and pat yourself on the back for the same :) I'm very
glad to hear that your prioritization and scheduling have improved. That is great. Time management
is such an underrated skill and will serve you so well as you progress in your career. That sounds
like a great novel. Will definitely look it up. I just started reading Atomic Habits by James Clear.
It's supposed to help with the creation and maintenance of habits. It's been a good read so
far.Mentee 2022-03-01, 00:21: Hi Hari, I just finsihed Atomic Habits yesterday! It was a great read-
I think many of the changes in my organization were influenced by it. I think you'll enjoy it. Thank
you so much, three of my friends got early acceptances to UVIC so I'm very impatient! I have a
couple of projects on my mind right now that I'd love to take on- mainly I'd like to start another
class at the learning centre across the street. The problem is I need to prioritize my online
classes right now, because it's taken me so long to get started. I think that having goals for the
next few monthes will give me an incentive to do the work. Getting started is super hard for me when
I don't have a teacher in person. My goal for this coming month is to start applying for
scholarships, but I am a master procrastinator. I know I need the financial aid and applying won't
necessarily be that difficult, but or whatever reason, these tasks feel impossible! Time management
is so important- I will always waste some time, but I will continue to notice what and why I lose
focus and do things that are unnessesary, and try to learn from that.Mentor 2022-03-02, 17:51: I'm
glad you enjoyed Atomic Habits. I finished reading it a few days ago too and I really liked it. It
made sticking to habits seem easy, if only it were that easy haha. I did find a lot of things
extremely useful, especially the Habit Tracker sheet which I have been using quite religiously each
day to stay on top of my habits. I definitely understand the trouble with getting started on tasks
and them seeming like they're incredibly difficult. I find that breaking them down to slightly
smaller pieces helps me get started and once I'm in the flow of things, going through and wrapping
up more comes easier. Maybe that might help you at least chip away little by little at the tasks
that you have ahead of you. Often I look at something and feel like it's too big to deal with right
now and often procrastinate as a result of that. We all have things we can improve on when it comes
to time management (and everything else too to be fair). As long as you're maintaining the attitude
of identifying ways to potentially improve and keep going through that process, you'll be in a
really good place!Mentee 2022-04-02, 00:23: Hi Hari, I hope you are doing well. Everything right now
and the past month has felt super fast and busy, but I have been learning a lot through it all. Over
spring break, I took advantage of the extra time off school and worked at a farm camp for kids for a
week. Due to my frequent over-spending habit, I think it's best that I put all of what I earned that
week into savings. It was a job in addition to my usual other two, so it makes sense. I've been
trying to help my friends, a Ukrainian family of seven, with fundraising and events in our town to
send priority items to Kharkiv, where they lived until mid 2020. The people I met through those
fundraisers and their planning were amazing. So many people in my community came to support them,
and those who were most involved or who travelled a great distance to bring donations amazed me the
most. I am really lucky to have such a fantastic community. I was accepted into UVic's business
school, Gustavson, in March! It's very exciting because I have decided that I do actually want to go
there. I have already applied for on-campus residency. The next step is to keep up with
bursary/scholarship applications... I have applied for two smaller ones last week, but I will really
need to do more. I have a nice list of most that I am eligble for. But in addition to saving and
scholarship money, it has been heavily suggested by my parents that I start applying for a summer
job (and probably stop working at my current two, where I don't make a hefty wage). I know of a few
places where I may be able to get a higher-paying job; the silly problem I have is that leaving a
job is not something I've done before, and it causes me a bit of stress! I do not know when to bring
this up with my current employers if I do get a new job, but I suppose there is some time before
summer vacation anyway. I am so excited to move away for the first time, and go to university. It
seems unreal. I have lived in the same place with my family for the majority of my life, where I
know everyone, so it'll be a huge change. Money is definitely the biggest stressor about university
for my parents and me. There is always something else to do instead of applying for scholarships and
bursaries, though, and my poor time management and procrastination don't make my education goals
seem realistic to my parents. Luckily, I have been doing a better job with avoiding spending moeny
when I don't need to. I'll keep that up, but there are so many things to consider with paying for
school! I need to print those Habit Tracker sheets!!! Maybe that'd help me keep track of the little
steps I need to take each day to accomplish the tasks that really do seem bigger than they are.
Thank you, or Дякую (I've been learning a little Ukrainian), RuthvenMentor 2022-04-04, 22:13: Hi
Ruthven, It's great to hear from you again. I'm so glad to see that you have been staying productive
over these last months and even helping support donation drives and fundraisers for the Ukrainian
cause. That is very noble of you and I'm so happy to hear that. It's great that you got accepted
into UVic and that you are excited to go there. I have some friends that went there and they
absolutely loved it! I'm excited for you to discover the programme and the campus. I'm sure you'll
have a great time. It's smart to be on the lookout for other jobs. Depending on your relationship
with your bosses, I'm sure they'll be happy to see you move on and grow in your own career. My only
advice would be to make sure that you leave things on good terms with the people that you work with.
One, because it's the right thing to do, and the right way to treat people that have supported you
for so long. Two, because you never know when you might need something, I'd recommend letting them
know earlier rather than later, so that it doesn't come as a surprise to them, and also doesn't
cause them any inconvenience. Again, this depends on your relationship with your employers but
that's always usually best. I definitely understand that money is a big stressor during these
stages. You're doing the right thing by looking at scholarships and job opportunities. If you do
have the time, and the skillsets, maybe you could also consider looking at taking on some part-time
freelance projects on platforms like Fiverr. Just something to consider if you're interested and are
looking to make some extra side-hustle money. Regards HariMentee 2022-04-05, 00:27: Hi Hari, It's
great to hear that your friends loved UVic, so far I have only heard good thing about it. Thank you
for the advice with my jobs, I agree that talking to my bosses sooner rather than later will be
better for both parties. I think that I'll work at a summer day camp on the farm for most of the
summer; it pays more than my current jobs and I think that I've learned a lot working there-it's
very fun but hard work! I'm very curious about this Fiverr platform you've mentioned, I love a good
side hustle... will definitley be doing some Googling on that tonight. I was wondering, do you have
any book suggestions for preparing for university/business school? I was recommended the Complete
101 Collection by John C. Maxwell by my friend's business-people parents, which I'm a third-way
through, and it has been fun to read so far. Thank you, Ruthven :)Mentor 2022-04-05, 13:07: I don't
know if there are specific books tied to preparing for business school but here are a few business
books that I found extremely useful. Lean Startup - Eric Ries Zero to One - Peter Thiel Masters of
Scale - Reid Hoffman The Hard Thing about Hard Things - Ben Horowitz Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel
Kahneman How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie (A good guide to connecting with
people in general, which is huge for business) Uncommon Service - Frei &amp; Morris Radical Candor -
Kim Scott Unsure if this is what you were looking for, but should be a good list of all things

Do let me know if you have any questions at all and I'll do my best to answer them. Once you look

love to make scones. I really like them because of how easy they are to make and customize. I use a
plain recipe, https://www.food.com/recipe/simple-sweet-scones-66409 , and then add extra ingredients
to make them unique. Lavender scones are my current favourite. And for the ""Musical Interlude"", my
song suggestion for you today is ""still feel."" by the band Half Alive. I love how it combines
different genres and sounds to create something special, plus the music video is cool because of the
dance routines the band performs. Thank you so much, RuthvenMentor 2021-11-21, 22:23: It's great to
meet you too. Thank you for sharing those things. I checked out Stil Feel. It was really cool.
Especially loved the simplicity of the music video. I know a lot of artists/bands have tried that
specific treatment, but thought theirs was really well executed. With regards to check-in, more than
happy to exchange at least 2 messages or so a week, if not more. Since this program doesn't
necessarily operate real-time (unlike other chat rooms or instant message systems), it may not be
necessary for us to stick to an exact time which will give both of us a little bit more flexibility.
I will try my best to answer immediately though when possible on the off chance that we can catch
each other real-time once in a while. I was travelling these last couple of days and hence couldn't
respond immediately to your post. I apologize for the same. In terms of the topics you wished to go
over, those are great starting points. Since you mentioned business school, how about I open up the
topic called ""Post-Secondary Considerations""? The way this program is meant to be structured is that
there are a few content pieces to read/watch for every ""conversation"" and then we can chat about the
topic in as much detail as you want until you feel like you'd like to explore another topic. Does
that work for you? If you see a better topic to start with from the list above you can let me know
too and I can open that one. HariMentee 2021-11-23, 00:44: I'm so glad you liked the song! What
types of music do you listen to? Twice a week or so sounds good to me- and I'm glad that a strictly
timed schedule isn't necessary, because of how unpredictable mine is these days! and no worries
about not respnding immediatly- life is busy and travel is important. Opening with the topic
""Post-Secondary Considerations"" will be perfect. I'd love to learn more about what made you decide
to get your MBA, how difficult the transition from highschool was into whatver you did directly
after, and about the decision making process for post-secondary education. However you see fit to
start the topic will be great.Mentor 2021-11-23, 18:01: I listen to anything under the sun really,
ranging from jazz and blues to heavy metal. I love all kinds of music and what I'm listening to on

open that ""Conversation"". There's some material there for you to go over, and then we can chat there
about the various questions you have and I can go over my journey as well.Mentee 2021-11-28, 01:51:

final exams are coming up soon so things are getting a little stressful but I'll get through it. I
hope you've also been doing well! Thank you for going through the questions. Identifying between
information and disinformation is very important as it can alter certain things by a big factor. I
went through your answers and here is what I had to say about them: Q: How much of a role do your
emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? My emotions aren’t involved
in anything that I click, and I’m not active on any of my social media accounts. I just click onto
whatever seems interesting to me. That's totally cool! I didn't actually use much of my social media
accounts either for a while in my life. I saw the people I needed to talk to in person anyway, so I
had no real need to use social media. I would like you to keep in mind that your use of social media
may change in the future - so just try to remember not to get too emotionally invested in social
media as it can be harmful. Q: Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you
ever been drawn in by misinformation? I am a careful consumer of media content, although I don’t
really believe anything that anyone says to me. I like to look at the facts for myself and find out
if the information is real or not on my own. ​​​​​​​That's a great way of thinking! It's always good
to look at facts on your own and not believe everything you see right away! Q: What are your

​​​​​​​I was the same way during high school. I don't know what happened to me but when I got to
post-secondary, I became so much more outgoing! Regardless, it's important to remember that people
can have different opinions, so if you don't necessarily agree with them that is okay! Q: How

have gone and read through it, I will review your answers. Let me know if you have any questions
regarding anything! :)Mentee 2021-12-16, 11:16: Hi Herman, I hope your day is going well. I have a
few questions I'd like to ask you about self-care. 1. How might the transition to post-secondary
schooling make self-care more difficult? 2. How easy is it for you to think about self-care as
something important? 3. What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need
to be taking better care of yourself? 4. How do you avoid burnout?Mentor 2022-01-19, 15:50: Mentor
2022-01-19, 15:59: Hi Ariana! I apologize for the late reply, I was dealing with some life stuff.
Regardless, here are my answers: 1. The transition to post-secondary schooling often does make
self-care more difficult just because you have to think of so many other factors now. You have to go
out and buy your own food, work harder in classes, and have to make new friends among other things.
But, it is still important to leave some time for self-care as it is something that must be done for
you to succeed in other aspects of your life. 2. Personally, I don't set aside time for self-care
for myself. Instead, I just take a break and do some self-care for myself whenever I feel like I
need it. I do have some friends who instead book off a time every day or every week and schedule in
self-care for themselves and that seems to work for them! 3. Some signs that I have noticed in my
own life that indicate that I need to be taking better care of myself are seeing that my
relationships with friends and family are becoming more volatile, I'm getting more agitated than
usual, and just feeling more down than usual. Sometimes if I'm even feeling overstressed, I take a
break from life. 4. I avoid burnout by taking breaks whenever I feel necessary. This can be as short
as 5-minute breaks between assignments or even just taking the whole day off if I feel that I need
it. I believe that positive social interactions greatly minimize feelings of burnout (as burnout is
not completely preventable) because I'm able to communicate how I'm feeling with other people who
likely feel the same way.Mentee 2022-01-25, 15:43: Hi Herman, the late reply is just fine. I wanted
to ask you a few questions before the end of the program. What you said about burnout and self care
does make sense, I'm more of a work driven person myself, but I'd like to know about your general
experience in university. Here's a few questions I've written down: 1. Would you say that the work
load that comes along with college/university is tough, but rewarding? 2. How do you properly divide
your time between your personal life and education? I deal with a lot of forgetfulness when it comes
to studying during my own time, and I want to improve how I manage my time for it, but I don't know
where to start. Once again, any late reply is fine with me. Thank you for being my mentor, Herman,
and I hope this year is good to you. You've taught me a bit more than I expected from this program,
and for that I'm truly grateful.",,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 19:01: Hi Ariana! It's so great to meet you! This is my first time being a mentor
with this program, so I look forward to working with you. I'm in my fourth year at UBC - Vancouver,
where I'm finishing up my Bachelor of Science in Biology. Originally, I wanted to become a doctor
but over my time at UBC I realized that what I really love doing is teaching so now my plan is to do
my Bachelor of Education after this degree is over and become a high school teacher soon. What are
you thinking of doing career-wise for now? It's okay if you aren't sure yet, I didn't know what I
wanted to do until my third year in university, haha. The instructions for this introduction said to
choose two topics for us to talk about so here is what I've chosen: Words to live by One of my
favourite quotes is ""If you can dream it, you can do it"" - Walt Disney. I actually used this as my
grad quote! I like this quote because I'm a really big Disney fan, so I obviously have a bias
towards it. But also, I like how concise and powerful it is. It's easy to understand and has a
really big impact. It's almost like a sort of mantra to use when I need encouraging words! Beauty is
in the eye of the beholder https://i.pinimg.com/564x/73/bd/bb/73bdbb0daf253a0c81bb28628e97e4ac.jpg
This picture is of the airport in New Delhi, India. I'm actually from India, so I fly back from time
to time to visit my family and we always land at this airport. One of the first things I see is this
sculpture of hands. To me, it symbolizes a welcoming to my own country! Whenever I think of home in
India I think of this sculpture, which actually is saying ""welcome"". I associate really good
memories with the sculpture in this image, so I think it's really beautiful. I look forward to
hearing from you soon! - HermanMentee 2021-11-22, 17:22: Hi Herman, It's nice to meet you too, and
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to get back to you. To answer your question about what I
wanted to do in the future as my career, I'm not entirely sure; lately, it's been a fluctuating
concept for me. I know that I like art and storytelling, and I'm pretty good at programming things
on a computer, but I haven't really decided on a job yet. All of the possibilities I've come across
just don't interest me. I also like your quote, Walt Disney Studios has always been a favourite
thing of mine too. Their films are just so spellbinding, and the stories they tell are really
unique. My inspiration comes from music rather than words, however I can understand the impact they
can have on a person. That picture from the airport is also pretty cool. I think Canada definitely
could have more art in public spaces, having stuff like that to come home to and visualize would be
much more comforting. Musical Interlude I like all sorts of music, and I don't have much of a
preference so long as it has good rhythm and beats. One song, however, has been on my mind all week.
I think it's just something nice to listen to from time to time, and it's ""Save my Soul"" by Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy. Unfortunately, I can't link it right now, but it's easy to find on YouTube. Food for
thought I'm not much of a chef, I'll admit to that, but I'm particularly fond of a stirfry recipe I
make from time to time. My mother showed me how to prepare it when I first began cooking, and it's
been a meal that I've loved from the youngest years of my childhood. It's just a simple amount of
beef diced into bite-sized pieces, and bite-sized peppers, green onions, and mushrooms, all poured
into a pan with a crushed clove of garlic and a variety of spices. One teaspoon of cornstarch, soy
sauce, and a small bowl of water are added into the mixture, and then it's all prepared on top of
cooked rice. I'm no cook, and I often mess it up when I'm preparing it alone, but it's my favourite
food. I think you'd like it. My teacher only told me to introduce myself to you, so I don't think
there's anything else to say. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. - Ariana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually was mentioned right at the beginning of the video: ""everybody wants something."" Putting it
into my own words, people don't do things by accident. There is purpose and intent behind others'
actions. My thoughts and feelings that come up in response to this idea are those of agreement. I
totally believe that everything everybody does is purposeful. Nobody wakes up in the morning and
goes through the motions of their day by accident. Granted, certain things in life do happen by
chance (e.g., finding five dollars on the ground, meeting the love of your life), but the actions
that got you in those situatons happned because you wanted them to. I don't have any questions about
this idea. I do believe it realates to my future because basically everything I do everyday is done
purposefully to contribute to my future. I go to school, my job, and volunteer in order to get into
graduate school and work toward my future career. Basically, my whole life is structured around
working towards my future, so like the idea states, I want my future career, and everything I do is
planned around that.Mentee 2021-12-05, 17:15: Hi Khalifa, I think I figured it out. Thank you so

regarding the documentary, right off the bat I have mixed feelings. I do believe that everything
happens for a reason to a certain extent. I do agree with working to accomplish long term goals by
knowing what you want and what you need to accomplish in order to get there. I am not the type of
person who has really planned my life. So right now, all I'm working to do is graduate high school.
I am on the right track to doing so because I complete my homework, I volenteer, and I participate
in class but besides that, I don't really know what I want to do after that. I have no idea what my
future holds so I don't really know how to work up to it, or how to plan or accomplish my post
secondary goals. I have also never been a planner but I do mostly agree with the initial message of
""everybody wants something."" I think that that is very true, and it really resonated with me. Have a
great day! I look forward to continuing our conversation.Mentor 2021-12-22, 16:50: Hi Anoush, No
need to apologize! I hope your surgery went well, and that you are recovering quickly. It was great
to hear some of your thoughts regarding the documentary and my message. It's totally okay not to
have everything planned out! For some people, planning is actually stressful, so I compeltely
understand that sometimes it is easier to live in the present! It's so amazing that you have some
goals set with regards to graduating, working hard and volunteering—it sounds like you are juggling
a lot and I commend you for that! If you want to talk more about post-secondary goals and what your
future may look like, I'd love to discuss that with you. There are some great conversation
options—""Post-secondary Considerations"" and ""Career Considerations""—that explain some of the things
that are important to consider when planning your future. If you want to do one of these

dont really know at all what this means. I look forward ro researching more about it. I was also
confused that I only got one results. I am not sure if that is how the quiz works or not, but I was
hoping I would get some more diverse answers in this one. Abilities Quiz Results: Other proffesional
occupations in health diagnosing and treating. Recreation, sports and fitness policy researchers,
consultants and program officers. Other performers n.e.c. Outdoor sport and recrerational guides.
Other technical and co-ordinating occupations in motion pictures, broadcasting and the performing
arts Authors and writers Actors andd comediens. Binding and finishinf machine operators. Allied
primary health practicionars. As you can see, I got a very broad range of topics. I did not manage
to do the SUbjects Quiz because it would not load, but I was hoping we could discuss my results
together. I am confused about some of them, and less so about others, but either way I think that
these are good careers to consider. After I took the quizzes I browsed the website alittle more, and
recenrly I have had a strong interest in working for myself and being an entrepenuer. I would love
to start some small businesses and aquire more as time goes on, but I still need to research what is
required for that. have a wonderful day!Mentor 2022-02-15, 15:08: Hi Anoush, When I took the Career
Preferences Quiz, it did provide me with a few different options. I'm not sure why they only gave
you one! Maybe try completing it again? Both audiology and speech-language pathology are great
fields to go into, as they help individuals with a wide variety of disabilties. However, you have to
be quite interested in linguistics (the study of how the English languge works, its components,
etc.) to pursue these careers, as usually undergraduate education in linguistics is a prerequisite
to enter the master's degree programs required for these careers. Here is some more information
about audiologists and speech-lagnuage pathologists:

program that you can opt to enter in your third year at Sauder.
https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/options/entrepreneurship I think this might be
interesting to you, as it gives you the opportunity to ""design a venture, build a prototype and
develop the business model required to raise funding and possibly launch the venture."" There are
also tons of other business programs that you can explore at UBC, SFU, UVic, and other

that one quiz again, and got a much bigger rangee of possiilities which I will share with you in a
different message. Both of these articlees were very helpful for me in terms of gaining more insight
into these careers. I also borrowed a booklet from VIU and I have been exploring their classes and
what I might be interested in. I think I carry some of the traits for entrepreneaurship, and I think
that would be a really interesting thing to look more into. Thank you for the definition and article
about audiologist and speech pathologists, that also helped me gain some broader knowledge of what I
would want to do. I have also been wondering where I would want to live while I attend university,
and trying to establish where I would to go based on that as well, and it has been very difficult.
How did you decide what you wanted to go to university for? Did you have any specific place that you
wanted to live in mind? I will cotinue to do some more research on universities, but the more I
discover and the more I get excited, the scarier and more overwhelming it gets. Anyways, thank you
so much for all of your help, you have made this process so much easier for me. I haope you have a
wonderful day!Mentee 2022-02-16, 16:49: NEW CAREER RESULTS: Authors and writers. Artisan and

interesting to me than the first time around.Mentor 2022-02-16, 20:27: Hi Anoush, First off, I just
want to let you know I appreciate your kind words so much! I am so glad I made this process easier
for you—that makes me so happy! It's so great to hear that you got some info from VIU as well! I
have read great things about that school! I know it is a smaller isntitution, and I remember reading
about how the students that go there love it because it feels like a little community. Usually, in
larger universities, you do not get that feeling since that classes are much, much larger. To answer
your quesiton about where I decided to go to university, honestly, I just chose the option that was
closest to home. When I was in high school, I thought I wanted to move to another province and do
school in Ontario, for example, but the closer and closer it got to the time for applications, I
just decided that I wanted to stay in my area. I made that decision because I wanted to be near my
family—I didn't think I would be able to venture out on my own just yet. I don't regret my decision
at all. I am not too much of a social butterfly, so moving abroad just wasn't for me. I know you
mentioned that your family in Victoria, so going to a unversity in that area, although somewhat
unfamiliar, may be a great option because you have your family to support you! However, if you feel
that you want to move elsewhere in Canada, or even around the world, that gives you an opportunity
to meet new people and experiences a new culture and community! You seem like a very outgoing and
kind person, so I'm sure you will have no trouble with that. :) What are your feelings about moving
away from your current area for school?Mentee 2022-02-17, 23:59: Hi khalifa, My feelings about
moving away from home to persue a career are quite mixed. A part of me feels like I want to be close
to home and remain nearby nature, whereas my other half is telling me I need to not rule out any
options and just figure out what I want to do unrelated to the place where I choose to live. I
personally really value going to smaller schools and being in tighter communities because thats what
I have grew up in. I am also really not a fan of major and larger cities, which pushes me more to
the Vancouver Island end of things. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. I 'm definetily
in the same boat. I want to be close to my mom and dad, and I really love how easy my access is to
things right now where I am., A part of me feels like there is more oppurtunity if I move somewhere
biggerr and farther, but right now i am perfectly content with the situation that I am in. I was
also talking to a friend of mine who is going to university next year, and he told me that I could
also consider taking a gap year to work and stay where I am if I don't quite feel ready to leave. i
have really been pondering that as a possibility for myself. I would love to stay close to home and
that would give me some time to earn ssome money and figure out where I would want to be. I would
also love to know how you decided what you wanted to go to school for if you are willing to share. I
am also a very social persona and I really value the relationships that I have here, and I know I
will aquire more as my high school years progress, so I am also feeling torn about leaving my
friends. I know I would be able to make new ones, and I know that I should make my decisions for me
and not others, but that is very hard to do. Have a glorious evening!Mentee 2022-02-20, 21:57: Hi
Khalifa, I am not sure if you got my last e-mail or not. Absolutely no rush at all, I do know that
this is a reading week for universities, I just wanted to make sure you did get my previous message.
Either way, please let me know. Again, no rush at all, I am just checking in. Have a wonderful
evening and do not forget self care in this busy time!Mentor 2022-02-21, 00:06: Hi Anoush, Yes, I
received your message! Don't worry! :) It sounds like you have put a lot of thought into how you
feel about moving or staying for post-secondary, which is great. You still have a couple years to
decide, and who knows, you may find your answer within those couple years! I think your friend's
suggestion of taking a gap year is awesome, especially if you're unsure of what path you want to
take after you graduate high school. Like you mentioned, it gives you some time with your family and
it also allows you to save up some money! There is no need to rush into school again if that's not
what you're set on. School will always be there when you're ready. :) To answer your question about
how I decided what to study: I actually entered university pursuing a Bachelor of Science, because
this is what I thought would make me most successful. When I was in high school, I didn't really
have a lot of knowledge about what programs universities offered, and all I ever heard about was
business or science—those were the only options that I was told would give me a career (which is
compeltely false)! Two years into pursuing science, I decided it wasn't for me. I had always loved
psychology in high school, and I loved it in university as well. I just didn't think I would have
career options if I got a psychoology degree, because this is what I kept hearing from people around
me. Eventually, I decided that I should stop listening about what others had to say, and just do
what I'm passionate about! I am so glad I made that decision. I am much happier doing psychology,
and it allowed me to figure out that I also love education. I guess the big takeaway from my story
is to just do what you love—that is what will make you successful in the long run. :)Mentee
2022-02-22, 19:57: Hi Khalifa, Thank you for sharing your story with me. It was exceptionally
helpful to hear that you decided to switch your career path halfway through. It made me remember
that people change and it is okay to change my mind when it comes to how I persue my future careers.
Yes, I have ethought about how my future might look, and I thnk that I am gong to take a gap year
and then maybe attend post secondary after that. I still have two years of high school, and things
will likely change within these two years. I will still continue to research many of the other
career option that I got during the quiz, because I still feel frazzeled and unssure and extremely
overwhelmed, bt I am just going to try and keep it casual. I have lots of time to decide these
things, and today I went over next step sfor next year with y teachers, so I am completely aware of
what I need to do before grade 12. Have a nice day!Mentor 2022-02-25, 16:26: Hi Anoush, I am so
impressed by all of your planning for post-secondary, especially considering you still have 2 years
of high school left! I wish I would have been as prepared as you—it would have made the transition
in to university a lot easier. I am 100% certain that when the time comes, you will have no issues
figuring out what you want to pursue. You are doing all the steps necessary to figure out your
future, which is so, so amazing. Like you said, it is best not to worry about it to much, and just
have confidence that you will continue to figure out where your passions lie as time goes on. You
are still so young, there is no need to stress to much about these things. As long as you are doing
what you can and using the resources available to you (like this mentoring platform!), you will be
absolutely fine. Please let me know if you have any other questions. If not, we can move on to part
2 of this conversation. Have a wonderful weekend. :)Mentee 2022-02-26, 15:21: Hi Khalifa, Thank you
for the reassurance. I am just trying to get through high school before I make any concrete plans
for later, but I am feeling very setteled in my life and my decisions right now. I dont think that I
have any more questions, so I would be happy to move on. I do not know what I would want to talk
about next though. I will look at the optins and see what I want to talk about next. Does this
conversation have a part two? Thanl you so much for all of your help! I hope you have a wonderful
day!Mentor 2022-02-28, 19:09: Hi Anoush, Yes, this conversation has a part 2—let's move on to that.
:)Mentee 2022-03-02, 16:23: Hi Khalifa, Okay cool. I am glad that this converstion hs a part two,
because there is still a lot I want to talk about and explore. I am having some trouble figuring out
where to turn next when it comes to research. Do you have any prompts for what I could do or explore
next? Have a really wonderful day!",,"Mentor 2022-01-04, 15:23: Hi Anoush, The tools listed in the anchor text are a great way to learn
more about all of options you are able to pursue post-secondary! I definitely wish that I would've
used these tools when I was going to graduate high school—I had no idea what to expect! If you have
any idea of potential careers that you may be interested in, the WorkBC link above
(https://www.workbc.ca/CareerCompass/Browse-Careers.aspx) is very informative, as it shows you what
post-secondary education is required for those careers. If you don't have any idea of what careers
you're interested in, that's totally okay! I wasn't sure about my career path until my third year of
university. I entered university thinking I wanted to be one thing, and over the years my mind has
changed multiple times. That's what post-secondary is about—figuring out where your interests lie.
It's okay if you don't have everything planned out! Did you discover any programs you might
consider? What sparked your interest in these programs?Mentee 2022-01-04, 17:44: Hi Khalifa, Already
this is an interesting topic for me. I spent a little bit of time exploring that website, and just
researching the things I'm interested in. I have always been a person with a lot of hobbies, but I
have trouble deciding if I would want to persue some of those things to a greater extent. That is
one of the reasons why I have so much trouble when people ask me what I want to do in the next
coming years. I hope we can discuss some of these things more extensively, and I hope I share with
you some of my considerations and some of my questions. Have a glorious day!Mentor 2022-01-04,
18:23: Hi again! It's great to hear that you checked out the website! Did you find any careers or
programs that interest you? Also, I'd love to answer any of your questions if you have them!Mentee
2022-01-04, 21:13: Hi Khalifa, Like I said previously, it has always been a struggle for me
navigating hobbies and dreams, but I quite like this website. It helped me explore new and exiting
options. I have always been really interested in phycology. Over the past few years it has been a
goal of mine to become a phycologist for kids and teens. Or to become a marriage counseller. More
recently though, I have been really interested in health education too. I would also like to start
my own bar/restaurant someday. So as you can see, I am all over the place. I think that's why I so
much thinking about it, because so many things jump out at me.Mentor 2022-01-05, 15:53: Hi Anoush,
It's great that you have multiple interests—that just means that there is more options for you to
explore! My major is psychology, so I do know quite a bit about the different pathways you can take
if you are interested in pursuing psychology or mental health work. To become a psychologist, you
need a Doctorate degree (4 year Bachelor's degree, 2 year Master's degree, and 2 year Doctorate
degree = 8 years post-secondary), and to be a counsellor, you need a Master's degree (4 year
Bachelor's degree and 2 year Master's degree = 6 years post-secondary). It is quite a lot of work to
get to these places, but if it's what you're passionate about, it's worth it! If 4+ years in school
post-secondary doesn't sound that appealing, there are certificates or diplomas you can complete
that are related to mental health, which are much shorter. For example, there is a Mental Health
Community Worker Certificate (1 semester) at Douglas College:
https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/cncmhw Or, a Child and Youth Care Worker Diploma (4 semesters)
at Douglas College: https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/dpcycc These are just some examples, let
me know if they sound interesting to you. :) As for health education, SFU, UBC, Douglas College,
Kwantlen Polytechnic University (and I'm sure many other schools!) offer programs in health
sciences. Perhaps you might find those programs appealing if you look into them more.Mentee
2022-01-13, 23:53: Hi Khalifa, Having multiple interests is really overwhelming sometimes, but
recently I have really been exploring (and getting excited) about what I might want to persue in my
future. right now I don't feel too concerned about how many years of university I would need to do
to accomplish something. As long as I am happy and enjoy what I'm doing I think everything will be
alright. I am still exploring what I want to do and discovering new interests as I go. I feel a
constant pressure from society to know what my future holds though, and it makes me feel incredibly
stressed and anxious. Do you have any advice on how I could maintain my interest and curiosity for
discovery without getting too stressed out or frazzeled?Mentor 2022-01-15, 18:13: Hi Anoush, That's
a great question! I totally hear you. There is a lot of pressure from society to figure out what you
want to be when you grow up, but you're right—who you want to be and what you want to do with your
life is a constantly changing idea that may take awhile to figure out, and that's compeltely fine! A
great way to maintain your interests and figure out where your true passions lie is just to take a
few different university classes post-secondary. If you apply to a general studies program at any
college or university, you have the freedom to take courses you're interested in, and there is no
pressure to complete a degree or have a set plan. There is an option to do a Bachelor of General
Studies at some institutions, but if you take a class you really like and decide you want to focus
on that, you can always decide to transfer to a program in that field. This way, you are not
stressed out trying to figure out exactly what you want to do, you have flexibiltiy in the classes
you take, and you can go from there. Here is a link to a general studies program so you can learn
more about it: https://calendar.kpu.ca/programs-az/arts/general-studies/ Let me know if that helps.
:)Mentee 2022-01-19, 18:31: Hi Khalifa, Thats all really helpful for me! I had no idea that programs
like that existed. Do you know if all universities have the option to take a general studies
program? I was just curious because I was thinking about maybe going to UVIC.It is close to my
family and it is still in Cananda. Also, do you have any recomendations for universities in Cananda
that might offer general studies programs if UVIC does not? This conversation is actually
interesting to me. It is making me feel excited for my future,which is something I am frequently
not. Have a really nice day! Thank you for all your help.Mentor 2022-01-20, 18:35: Hi Anoush, I am
so happy that you're feeling excited for your future! That's so awesome to hear. It seems that UVic
does not have a general studies program, however they do have ""Area Undecided"" option that you can
choose that is somewhat similar. You can apply to the Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Science, or
Faculty of Social Sciences and choose ""Area Undecided,"" and it allows you to have flexibility in the
courses you take for your first year only. Then, it looks like they expect you to choose a major
after that. Here is some more information on it:
https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/programs/undergraduate-programs/index.php If you click on this
link and scroll down, it gives you some more information on the ""Area Undecided"" options. Keeping in
mind being close to your family, Victoria Island University also offers a program similar to general
studies, called Exploratory University Studies (EXPO). Here is the link so you can learn more:
https://www.viu.ca/programs/exploratory-university-studies As for some other schools who offer this
program (not on Vancouver Island), but still in BC, there is Kwantlen Polytechnic University,
Thompson Rivers University, and University of British Columbia Okanagan. Let me know if that helps.
:)Mentee 2022-01-20, 20:17: Hi Khalifa, That is all really helpful. Thank you so much. I am
definetily interested in the programs that you have mentioned. I also took some of the quizzes on
the WorkBC website and I got many different but exciting results. I have been having fun studying up
on Universities, but I am also still very young and I have a couple more years of high school left
to go before I have to make any decisions. We also had a guest speaker in my class from UBC, who was
a gender proffessor. It was a really interesting talk, and she brought up alot of interesting things
that I would like to research or even study further. Anyways, I hope you are doing well. Have a
wonderful day!Mentor 2022-01-24, 14:54: Hi Anoush, It's so great to hear that you are excited about
your future! I'm so glad that you found that presentation by the UBC professor appealing—it sounds
like they were talking about gender studies, which is another great field that a lot of
post-secondary institutions offer programs in. Also, you are so right—you are still very young and
have a couple more years to explore what you're interested in pursuing, but it's so great that
you're getting a head start. :) I wish that I would have done what you're doing at your age! This
will help so much when it's time for you to leave high school. Do you have any other questions about
this conversation topic? If not, let me know which conversation you would like to do next, and we
can move on! :)Mentee 2022-01-25, 19:56: Hi Khalifa, I would like o move on to a new conversation
topic, but I saw that this was only one part of a two part talk. I would like to know if we have to
complete the second half of this conversation before moving on to a new subject entirely? If we can
move on, I would like to talk about Career Considerations. I am not sure if we already talked about
that, but I would like to talk about next. Have a wonderful day!Mentor 2022-01-25, 20:24: Hi
Anoushm, You are so right—I completely missed that! There is a part 2 to this conversation, so let's
move there next. :)",,"Mentor 2022-03-12, 19:10: Hi Anoush, I have unlocked the From Rural to Urban conversation! It looks
like it is your job to start this conversation (see above)! I look forward to reading your answers.
:)Mentee 2022-03-15, 18:51: Hi Khalifa, Right off the bat, there are many questions and concerns
that come to my mind. when it comes to things I like about living in an urban environment, so many
ideas come forward. 1.First of all, living where I do, I have relationships like many others don't.
It's because there are not a lot of activities to do in Duncan, so people resort to spending time
with other people. 2. I am constantly exposed to nature which for me is wonderful. I am very much
grateful to live where I do because it'll that reason. I have gone to tiny diverse schools, allowing
me to experience alternative education, and learning about people from all walks of life. 3. I have
easy access to many required things, and they are merely walking distance away. The things I dislike
are very important and terrible things. 1. Racism. I have grown up in a place where many indigenous
people still live. Everyone else is pretty much white, and on the daily I witness acts of hate and
racism towards the local Indigenous people. 2. Many things that may be necessities are not around,
and sometimes we have to wait for awhile before we can get access to those things. One question I
have is related to nature. It is incredibly important to me that I have access to nature whether
that be forest or ocean. What sort of access to nature do you have? is it accessible to you?
Anyways. Have a very nice day.Mentor 2022-03-20, 15:02: Hi Anoush, Wow! Those are some great points
you make aboutliving in a rural area. I am sos orry to hear that you see acts of racism quite
frequently, and also have some difficulty accessing some necessities. Granted, when living in an
urban area, racism is still present, but of course you do not see it on a daily basis. Also, living
in an urban city like Vancouver or Burnaby, for example, there is also quite easy access to many
resources and amentities, even if not within walking distance, they are still very accessible by
transit which would be within walking distance! That was a great question you had about my ability
to access nature. I live in Surrey, where there are many small parks that include forests, as well
as two beaches where you can walk right into the ocean (mostly in the summer, otherwise it's too
cold). If you are willing to travel though, there are also a lot of large parks and beaches in
Vancouver that are much more abundant than in Surrey. Additionally, there are lakes and trails that
range from drives of 40 minute to a few hours, and if you are willing to do those drives, those are
great places to experience nature. In other worse, yes nature is accessible here in the urban areas,
however they might not be as close as what you're used to living in a rural area. It definitely will
take a commute of some sort to go to a park or beach, but they are here!Mentee 2022-03-22, 22:02: Hi
Khalifa, Thak you for your input on living in a city and still finding nature. That is extremely
important to me. I have another question for you: What do you like and dislaike about living in a
city? It would be helpful for me to know if I am going to abruptly be adapting to city life. Have a
wonderful day!Mentor 2022-03-29, 19:43: Hi Anoush, Sorry it has taken me awhile to respond—it seems
that I missed the notification that told me you responded! To answer your question, I like living in
the city because everything is so close by. For example, if I need to pick up something from the
grocery store, it is a 3 minute drive, or if I want to get food take-out, there are tons of places
that are a short drive away for me to choose from. Also, I like to travel to Vancouver sometimes
just for a change of scenery, and I like that I can drive to the skytrain and go to Vancouver that
way, or I can just drive directly. In other words, everything is pretty transit accessible when
living in a city. There are also many things to do in the city, such as visit arcades, go to the
malls, bowling alleys, different art classes, etc. What I dislike about living in the city is how
busy it is! The traffic is quite bad during rush hour (2:30 pm - 6:00 pm), and if you are living in
a city like Vancouver, it gets quite loud at nighttime on Fridays and Saturdays, as everyone is out
partying! If you are planning to transit and live in the city, if you have to travel during rush
hour, it is important to schedule enough time to get to your desination, and sometimes this could
involve leaving 2 hours early. So, there are definitely pros and cons to living in an urban area!
How are you feeling about living in the city after considering these things?Mentee 2022-04-03,
00:55: Hi khalifa, Sorry it took ME so long to respond. I was actually just in Vancouver visiting my
sister, and I experienced many things that you mentioned. When it comes to night life, I am
relatively okay with that because I like having the option to go out sometimes if I want, and being
in a city there is always something going on to attend. As for everything else, I have relatively
mixed feelings. in a place like Vancouver I like the oppertunity to take public transit because it
is better for the environment, whereas here, there is very little reliable public transportation. I
enjoy the multitude of things to do in cities, and there is more oppertunity to meet many different
types of people from all walks of life. I also just genuinly feel very uncomfortable in cities. I
love to go and visit, but everytime I think of spending years at a time in a city, I feel almost
repulsed. I don't really know what I need to do in order to change that. I am open to living in a
smaller city, but places like Vancouver ans Toronto make me exceptionally uncomfortable. I have
another question for you. I do not know if this question makes sense, but as a person, have you
noticed any signifcant changes in your life living in a big city? i hope you have a great
evening!Mentor 2022-04-05, 21:32: Hi Anoush, I totally understand where you're coming from! I
actually don't live in a very big city (not as big as Vancouver anyways), but it is one of the more
popular smaller cities in the Lower Mainland. It sounds like it may be a good option for you to live
in smaller city like Surrey, Langley, Delta, or New Westminister (if you are wanting to stau=y in
BC), as these are definitely not as busy or crowded as Vancouver. In these areas, there are a lot
more suburban neighborhoods that are quiet and family-oriented. Living in one of these towns also
gives you the opportunity to travel to a bigger city like Vancouver when you want to! This way, you
don't have to be there 24/7, but you can visit when you feel like doing some of the cool things that
are offered in Van! Since I live in Surrey (a fairly busy city), it hasn't been too bothersome for
me. I actually quite like it. There is a lot here, and it is just a 30 minute skytrain or 40 minute
drive to Vancouver. I don't think living in Surrey has caused any big changes to myself as a person
or in my life, especially because I was born in Surrey, so it's all I've ever known! I definitely
don't think I would be able to move to a very small suburban town though. I am too much of a city
person. :)",,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-23, 12:39: Hi Anoush! As you can see, I've unlocked the Well Being &amp; Self-Care
conversation! Being completely honest, self-care is definitely something I struggle with. Being a
full-time student and working, volunteering, and studying takes up pretty much all of my time, so
I'm really used to being on the go. If I do take a break, I almost feel guilty because I'm not being
productive, which is something I definitely need to work on. I try to remind myself that it is okay
to relax, and that I deserve it! When I do enagage in some self-care practices, it usually consists
on laying in bed, watching Netflix, or watching TikTok. :p I would love to add onto my self-care
practices by being a bit more active (e.g., taking walks, doing a 15 min workout everyday), but it's
easier said than done! Do you feel as though you are engaging in the basics of self care, such as
getting adequate sleep, getting your nutrition in, taking breaks from work, etc.?Mentee 2021-11-25,
18:44: Hi Khalifa, Self care has always been a topic of interest to me because i was raised by
parents who really cared bout that anf tried to teach my sister and I about the Importance of it.
More recently i have started my journey of self care and self love. My mom loves to cook, and
because of her cultural backrounds I have grown up eating rich, nutritionous foods. Every dinner she
makes, she puts a little of every food group on the table. Over quarentine I lost my motivation for
self care, so I made sure to go in walks everyday with my family. That was great for my mental and
physical health which I think are very closely related. Now I am an avid hiker, and I love being in
the outdoors. Its very easy to quickly be hard on youself when you stray from self care practices or
when you don't have time or motivation, but I just try and be very kind to myself. I am just one
person and i can only accomplish so much at once. AnoushMentor 2021-11-28, 14:27: Hi Anoush, Wow!
That's great! It sounds like you are really making an effort to enagage in some self-care practices.
It is so amazing that your parents encourage you to do these things and support you on your
self-love journey! I agree that it was quite difficult to stay motivated during quarantine,
especially because there weren't many acitivites to do while stuck at home, but I'm so glad you
found an acitivty that worked for you! I love your point ""I am just one person and I can only
accomplish so much at once""—this is something that I should also tell myself. It is so easy to put
pressure on ourselves because of all of the responsibilties we juggle, but understanding that we are
human and sometimes we need a break is something we should always keep in mind. Please let me know
if there is anything else in this conversation that you want to discuss or if you have any questions
for me about self-care and post-secondary life. If not, we can move to another conversation (this
was a short one!).Mentee 2021-12-02, 20:59: Hi Khalifa, I apologize for not answereing sooner. I
think we can move on to a new topic. I feel asthough there is so much pressure on me to know what
university I want to go to, and to know every step of my future. I am just trying to take it one day
at a time and trying to tell myswlf that I do not have to lIsten to others when it comes to my
future because I make my own path. Even still, I would like to start the Finding Inspiration topic.
Recently I have been I hope you have a wonderfulvery interested in sexual health education, and I
was hoping we could have a general conversation about post secondary education as well as the next
few years of high school I have left. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. AnoushMentor
2021-12-04, 15:49: Hi Anoush, Sounds good! I will unlock the Finding Inspiration conversation, and
then once we finish that, we can move to a General Discussion, or even Post-Secondary Considerations
or Career Considerations if you're interested (those are great topics for figuring out a little bit
about what you want to do in the future).Mentee 2021-12-04, 16:41: Hi Khalifa, That all sounds good
to me. I would love to talk about post secondary education even though I have very mixed feelings
about it. Just let me know once you've unlocked it. Have a wonderous day. Anoush.Mentor 2021-12-04,
16:44: It's unlocked! Just click on the Finding Inspiration conversation in the wheel above.

wheel above but it seems like it is related to our previous conversation on self care. I will keep
working to see if I can figure out what you meant, but I may need some more direction. Sorry for the
Inconvenience! Have a great day. AnoushMentor 2021-12-05, 16:57: Hi Anoush, If you click on
""Complete Conversation"" just above, the Navigation Wheel (the big green circle with all the
conversation topics in it) should appear. If you click on ""Finding Inspiration"" in this big green
wheel, it will take you there. :) Hopefully that works!",,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 22:06: Hi Anoush! My name is Khalifa and I'm going to be your mentor! I am
currently attending SFU, studying psychology and education. What are some things you are studying in
school that interest you? I'd love to know more about you—feel free to tell me anything! I see in
your profile that you mentioned you grew up in a hippie household—it'd be great to hear more about
that! :) I hope we will get to know each other better, and please know that I am here to answer any
questions you may have during our time together.Mentee 2021-11-11, 15:04: Hi Khalifa! Its so nice to
meet you! Right off the bat I just want to say that I think it is amazing that you are studying
phycology because I have always been very interested in that. For a long time i really wanted to be
a phycologist for kids and teens. I think we have a lot in common! I am also a peoples person, and I
love spending time with friends. I am really exited for us to get to know each other better. Have a
wonderful day! Anoush.Mentor 2021-11-13, 14:05: I'm so glad to hear that we have things in common!
I'm excited to talk more. :) I'm just going to move us on to the ""Working Through This Program"" page
so you can get to know the platform and see how it works.",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-03-02, 16:39: Hi Anoush, Here is part 2 of the conversation. After you read the anchor
text and watch the videos, let me know if you have any questions. My question to you is: In watching
these two videos, did you realize something new about what might shape your own career choices? How
might these realizations change your career goals? I noticed that in the videos, the individuals who
were speaking clearly valued a sense of community and being connected with nature. Also, I feel that
the questions metioned before the video are very important when considering your future carrer path,
especially. ""Will this career offer me financial security?"" and ""How much opportunity or job
security does this career path offer?"" A lot of the times in post-secondary, people get their
degrees and have no clue what to do afterward, because there is not a lot of job opportunities in
the field that they studied. This is something worth thinking about when deciding what
post-secondary path to take.Mentee 2022-03-04, 14:07: Hi Khalifa, Watching these videos made me
realize that here is a lot more need for health care proffessionals in more rural enviroments.
Though I do not know if healthcare is the path that I would want to persue, it is stil nice to keep
that in my back pocket. I am also very excited by the prospect of working near home and in more
rural enviroments. i think this realizatrion definetly defines my career choices, because I am not
really sure that I would want to work in healthcare. Though its a much needed proffesion, like the
anchor text mentioned I do not want to do something that I am not entirely passionate about. I don't
want to end up in a situation where I get a degree and then do not know where to go next, which is
why I am interested in entrerpreneaurial carerer paths. I have not studied them that much, but it
seems like something that is helpful for many things. I really have no clue though. I definetily
need to further study that (as well as other careers) to see what best suites me, and to be
extremely clear where my interests lie. I don't have any questuons for you at the moment, but I will
be sure to let youy know when I do! Have a realy nice day.Mentor 2022-03-08, 13:31: Hi Anoush, I had
the same realization as you—healthcare jobs are in need in rural areas! It is a good path to keep in
your back pocket, but I agree, do not pursue anything that you are not 100% passionate about! It
sounds like we're mainly done with this conversation, so which conversation would you like to move
onto next?Mentee 2022-03-09, 18:53: Hi Khalifa, that sounds great. I think next I would like to talk
about From Rural to Urban. To me that feels like an appropriate next step. Thanks for everything. I
look forward to our next conversation Have a splendid day!",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-25, 20:31: Hi Anoush, Just looking at these articles, it can make post-secondary seem
quite scary! There are a lot of changes from high school, and the biggest one is that you have SO
much independence. You are in charge of your learning, and what you get out of university is
definitely up to you! It can definitely seem overwhelming at first, and I definitely didn't really
understand how to naviagte university until my second year. It might have taken others a shorter
time to adjust, or maybe even longer for others. The point is, everyone is different, and since
university is a big change, it will definitely take some time to get used to. I know you are only in
Grade 10, so you have a lot of time to prepare. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these articles,
and please, let me know if you have any questions about post-secondary life!Mentee 2022-02-01,
18:42: Hi Khalifa, I hope you're doing well. Though the article was very overwhelming and scary, it
was very helpful. I knew most of this information already, but it went way more in depth about it. I
am still not sure what I want to do or where I want to go, but that article made me both excited and
petrified about entering post secondary. If you are willing to share with me, It would be nice to
hear about your experience. You absolutely don't have to if you don't want to. Do you have any
advice on managing all of the things they mentioned in the article? I hope you have a wonderful
day!Mentor 2022-02-04, 16:47: Hi Anoush, I am more than comfortable sharing a bit about my
post-secondary experience. To be quite honest, it has been pretty average. I wouldn't say I have
liked it, but I wouldn't say I have disliked it. For the first two years, I was constantly changing
my mind about what I wanted to do, and I was in a major that I was very unahppy with. I kept telling
myself to push through it, becuase I had already completed two years. However, it got to the point
where I realized that I did not want to continue on that path, because in reality, it wouldn't
benefit me in the future, as much as I tried to convince myself it would. After those two years, I
switched into psychology, and I couldn't be happier! I think my experience is a great example of how
it is completely fine to not have a specific idea of what you're going to do post-secondary, and
even if you do, it may change, and that's okay too! Post-secondary is about exploring who you are
and where your interests lie. I actually learned a lot more about what I am interested in through
working and volunteering while in school. There may be work or volunteer opportunities available
through the institution you attend, or you can look for opportuntiies on your own (which is what I
did), and this may be a great way for you to figure out what fields you might want to pursue
academically. For myself, I work in education, and it showed me that I want to become a teacher, so
that is the academic path I am on now. 4 years ago, when I started post-secondary, I would have
never thought this is where I'd be. As for tips for managaing the things listed in the article, I
would say use the resources that your university/college makes available to you. For example, use
the instiution's ""How-To"" pages on their website when it comes to course planning, enrollement,
usign the library, where to find classrooms on campus, etc. Also, consult with an academic advisor
when you start at a specific institution—they are there to help you, and can answer any of the
questions that you have. For you, I know that you're a bit unsure about what path you want to take,
so once you choose an institution, meeting with an academic advisor can help you figure out how to
explore the areas that you're interested in! I wasn't too involved in the student actitivites that
my university has to offer, but that is definitely an option to help make the transition to
post-secondary less overwhelming. Most schools offer ""welcome days,"" tours, and other events that
help connect new students with each other. This is also something you can research when you enroll
at an institution. :) I know this was a very long message—I hope it's not too much! Let me know if
you have any questions or comments! Talk soon!Mentee 2022-02-05, 19:02: Hi Khalifa, Thank you for
sharing your personal experience. It is really helpful for me to hear your opinions, because I know
someone who absolutely hates post secondary and it really discouraged me. Mostly I just want to come
to a decision about where I want to go to universty, and figure out what I want to do there. I took
some quizzes on the WorkBC website, and I got some interesting results. For example it said that I
would be good in trades or business. I really want to start my own business someday, but I am not
sure if I would want to go to universty for four plus years just to do that. Anyways, thank yoyu so
much for all your help, I will keep you updated if I have any questions. Have a wonderful
fday!Mentor 2022-02-08, 15:18: Hi Anoush, It's great that you are exploring your options and doing
some planning—that's the first step, so you already have a head start! It sounds like there is
nothing left to discuss here, so you can go ahead and click on compete conversation. I will unlock
the Career Considerations conversatio next. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are. Don't ya think so?Mentor 2021-12-01, 15:03: When I was writing my first resume I honestly
thought that there was nothing really special about any of these things, especially since they are

city?Mentor 2022-01-25, 16:32: Hey Ryder, City traffic like in Vancouver is horrendous at peak
hours, cause everyone has to get going at the same time, but that's why transit rocks there! A house
is worth more than an arm and a leg around 500k to 1 million for an okay one. Do you download games
or do you only buy physical copies? Cause ever since I have lived in small towns downloading games
has made my life way easier in that respect. And yes having everything an arms length away is
something you can't get anywhere but a city.Mentor 2022-01-25, 16:32: Whats the next topic that you

interestingMentor 2022-01-17, 12:11: Hey Brooke! Yes it was very interesting. An idea from the video
that stood out to me was how everyone has such different perspectives on the photographs due to
everyone having different perspectives and life histories. What was one idea that stood out to you
in the video?",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 12:41: Hey Brooke! Hopefully you should be able to access the studying module.
One of the big changes that I found going from high school to university was the amount of time and
the way that I study. So just to start off the module with a question for you.. What study
strategies do you currently use in your classes? Did the any study strategies in the video seem that
it would be useful for you? Feel free to ask me any questions you have!!Mentee 2021-11-24, 15:10:
Hey Emma! I don't have any certain strategies I use to study other than reviewing my notes and then
focusing on anything I don't understand, but the strategies in that video seem like they would be
very useful and they make sense.Mentor 2021-11-25, 22:08: Hey Brooke! Thats great that you focus on
the things that you dont understand and study those aspects harder. A lot of the tips within the
video are things that I do in university and I also am an academic coach so they are things that I
suggest to the students I work with. Its really great to start practicing how to do active
studyingwhich is doing practice problems and explaining concepts to other people, as in
post-secondary I have found studying is a lot less about memorization or reading over notes (passive
learning) but more application so like problem solving type questions. Also the tip that they
mentioned in the video about switching between subjects while studying is helpful because in post
secondary there is usually a lot of deadlines around the same time as Im sure is the same thing in
high school while trying to juggle all your classes. The one strategy in the video that I still
struggle with is spaced practice so starting to study early becuase I find its hard to start
studying for final exams for example, when I have all these other assignments due for all my classes
before final exams start. Out of the strategies mentioned in the video can you think of one that may
be challenging and why?Mentee 2021-11-26, 11:57: Hi Emma, I feel like doing spaced practice would be
sort of hard for me because if there's a test coming up I'll study only as much as I need and I'll
find things I don't know and learn them, I don't think I would be motivated to study every day and
finding things to do each day.Mentor 2021-11-28, 17:32: Hey Brooke, I totally see how spaced
practice could be difficult if you run out of material to study. Good luck with your test by the
way! Which subject is it in? One thing I do when I have run out of material to study is make up my
own questions and then text myself on them, cause in a lot of my classes my professors don't provide
practice material or tests which is unfortunate. Do you have any questions about post secondary
studying or how classes work,any of that sort of stuff?Mentee 2021-11-29, 16:43: Hi Emma, the tests
I'm referring to is in math, I can't think of any questions I have right now but I will let you know
if I doMentor 2021-12-01, 11:19: Hey Brooke! Good luck on the math test! Let me know if you are ok
to move onto another module and which one you would like!Mentee 2021-12-01, 12:43: Hi Emma, Thank
you! Maybe we could do confronting discrimiation?Mentee 2021-12-01, 12:43: Mentor 2021-12-02, 22:54:
Hi Brooke, Sounds good! I believe that you just have to fill out a feedback survey and then we
should be able to move on!",,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-05, 23:53: Hey Brooke! After watching the video, what do you think of Dr. Caron's
response to the ignorant and hurtful comment her fellow surgeon made? Were you surprised by what her
other collleagues did? Here is my response: I think that Dr. Caron's response to the comment was
justified and that she handled it in a respectful manner by telling the fellow surgeon that what he
said was not acceptable and was not ok in a way. I was kind of surprised by what her colleagues did
as I think that they could have told the surgeon that what he said was discrimatory and hurtful.
Although I think they did the right thing by moving away from the surgeon to show that they did not
approve of what the surgeon said. Let me know what you think!Mentee 2021-12-09, 11:40: Hi Emma! I
think that she handled the disrespect in a good way and I think it's surprising that someone like
that would say such thingsMentor 2021-12-09, 14:09: Hey Brooke! I agree that she handled the
disrespect in an appropriate way. Why do you think it took the surgeon and just society in general
to admit our mistakes?Mentee 2021-12-13, 14:48: Hi Emma! I think it took the surgeon and society to
admit to mistakes because they may be ashamed of it and they would want to hide from it and ignore
their past.Mentor 2021-12-14, 11:51: Hey Brooke! I totally agree with your answer. No one wants to
admit when they are wrong and it may take time for them to fully see that their actions or
behaviours were discrimatory. Is there anything you you want to discuss in regards to this module or
any questions you may have? I have three final exams in the next two days so it might take me more
time to respond.Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:04: Hey Emma! I don't think I have any questions or anything

share a little bit about myself :) I currently am in my 4th year of studies in biology at UBC in
Vancouver but am from Kelowna. Some of my hobbies are playing tennis, ringette and soccer, walking
my dog Radar and camping/hiking. I am hoping to become a large animal veterinarian for my future
career. A quote I try to live by is; ""you still have a lot of time to make yourself be what you
want""- S.E. Hinton. Since I am in my last year of my degree I stress about the future and this quote
reminds me that sometimes I need to slow down and just enjoy where I am right now. An image that I
think is beautiful would be this one: (EB Adventure Photography/Shutterstock. 2021) These past few
weeks in Vancouver everyone has been trying to catch the northern lights, I unfortunately did not (I
couldnt get myself to wake up early in the morning to search for them). I find the different colours
of the sky and Vancouver as a city look super vibrant and alive. I'm so excited to have some
conversations with you this year! Here are a few questions so that I can get to know you better. Do
you have any pets? Whats your favourite subject in school? What are some of your hobbies? Feel free

them my way!!Mentee 2021-11-16, 00:12: Hey Emma! Im Brooke, im in grade 10 and im super excited to

and cats. Some of my hobbies are doing rodeo, freestyle skiing, playing rugby and just hanging out
with my friends and having a good time. My favourite subject in school would be science because the
things we learn are interesting and I can understand it well. Next year I would like to take a
course for equine massage therapy and start doing work with that and then when I graduate I want to
go to college for a vet tech program. Here is a picture of some mac and cheese I made once, it
tasted pretty good and I was proud of myself. And here is a photo that I think is beautiful, it is
at the top of the ski hill last year on a clear day.Mentor 2021-11-17, 13:39: Hey Brooke! Thanks for
your response! Thats super cool that you live on a farm with all those animals! Do you have a
certain event you do in rodeo? My favourite subject in school was science too, it is very
interesting. Massage equine therapy sounds like a really interesting course to take and of course
being a vet tech would be such a rewarding job. Seems like we both are wanting to get into the
veterinary medicine field which is super cool. Your picture of the ski hill looks super nice, those
are the best days of skiing when its not foggy at the top of the mountain. I ski at Big White when
I'm home and sunny days of skiing are the best. Let me know if you are ok to move on and we could
both start the working through this program page!Mentee 2021-11-22, 11:46: Hi Emma! The events I do

about how something one experiences personally may be different from how another person, who is
looking from the outside, sees it. From this, I thought that it was kind of hinting at the idea that
something that may be inspirational to one person may not be for another. This is why when we try to
find something that can truly inspire us, we shouldn't base it entirely on what another person finds
inspirational. For example, I personally love playing soccer, and was even on a soccer team in high
school. This is why if I saw a picture of a soccer ball, I would find it truly inspirational because
it would bring back those memories and how I should continue to play what I enjoy. Yet if someone
else, who doesn't play soccer, saw the same image, they may not find it all that inspirational, or
even interesting at all. And this idea can even be applied to everything I do because it further
enforces the idea that everyone should try to be themselves and find their own inspiration, be it a
person or otherwise. What are your thoughts on this idea that inspiration is different for different
people, William? And what other ideas did you find interesting from this short video?",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-09, 17:36: Hey William! How are you? My name is Mehak, and I’ll be your mentor from
here on out! (Are you excited? I sure am!) Well, I’ll just start off with a quick little
introduction. I am 19 years old, and in my second year at UBC studying Chemical Biology. Now I hope
you could tell me more about yourself, it could be anything. Like you could talk about your hobbies
and interests. I see that you like watching Netflix (I do too!), so what's your favourite movie or
show? What is your favourite subject? Right now, my favourite subject is Chemistry because it can
get very interesting, but in high school, I loved math, mainly because of how accomplished I felt
after understanding the topic. And of course, if you ever have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask
(I’m here for a reason haha).Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:47: Hi Mehak I am excited about you being my
Mentor, I don't have one favorite movie or show in mind but I just finished Kurokos Basketball and
HunterxHunter, I also like going ice skating on the weekends, and Playing Video Games with my
friends, I'm always super nervous in class whenever I sit in the front and I don't know what to do
any tips?Mentor 2021-11-17, 03:13: Ice skating seems so much fun, it's been so long since I last
went ice skating that I almost forgot how it's like. Oh, you've watched HxH too? I watched it a
while back but stopped midway. What was your favourite arc if you have one? I liked Greed Island,
but I know a lot of people who didn't like that one. I also love playing video games! I used to play
a lot, but now I have a lot of other things to keep me occupied. I used to get super nervous too
when I was in high school, but what I learned was to just not overthink it. Like, I'd sometimes just
get nervous just thinking about how others look at me, so I just started doing things that keep me
occupied and keep myself distracted, and personally, it worked great!Mentee 2021-11-22, 11:50: Yeah,
Ice Skating is fun, you should go ice skating again sometime maybe you can learn how to hockey stop
if you don't already know. My favourite arc is the Chimera Ant Arc because Mereum uses his nen to
find everyone around the kingdom and moves so fast it's like he teleports right to them and knocks
them out effortlessly, that was just so cool even his royal guards were stunned at his
ability.Mentor 2021-11-22, 23:00: Yeah, I'll definitely try to free up some time for that! Oh yeah,
I watched to just the end of that arc. Mereum's ending was honestly quite sad, but it was a good arc
overall. Okay so, I think we can move on to the next section, Working Through this Program, if
that's fine with you. If so, you can just take a look at that section and leave a response
there!Mentee 2021-11-25, 13:51: OkMentee 2021-12-07, 14:30: I would like to start the next
sectionMentor 2021-12-07, 14:33: Hey William, could you go to the Conversation choices page (its the
one after working through this program), and let me know which conversation you would like to start
with first (or you could just let me know here) :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

going through the material, and let me know if you have any questions or things you'd like to talk
about. Self-care is something that I'm super passionate about actually. What have you been doing in
school to keep yourself sane?!Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:24: Staying sane is very difficult at the moment
lol. I maintain it by just trying to do things that I love on my spare time, such as drawing,
watching a show, buying crystals, as well as other things haha. What have you done to stay
sane?Mentor 2021-12-14, 14:01: I am in the same boat with finals this week haha. That's cool! So
giving yourself time to unwind and focus on things that are non-school related? I find that it is
also a good way to take a step back and refocus on school once you are ready to again. I also love
collecting crystals, so I've been doing that too lol, as well as spending time with my family. How
are you currently managing with your classes?Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:46: I have been managing my
classes alright. I tend to get distracted very easily, so I do have to change that ASAP. It is very
hard for me to stay on task. Although my work is very good when I do it on time haha. How are the
finals?Mentor 2021-12-18, 23:28: I just finished up with finals! I'm happy that it's over and done
with lol, I find that studying is very time-consuming. What do you do to keep on task? I used to
have a lot of trouble concentrating, especially during class or when doing homework so I made a
""homework"" schedule for myself and that has been working quite well for me.Mentor 2021-12-24, 09:29:

winter been?Mentor 2022-01-12, 17:46: Hey Sienna!! I figured as much haha, I have younger siblings
in high school as well and they were glad winter break went to the 10th, too. My winter has been

better. Still having trouble organizing my stuff hahaMentor 2022-01-20, 12:38: I used to have a lot
of trouble with organization through school too! I found that having a planner was super helpful :)

you are ready!Mentor 2022-01-25, 01:02: Hey Sienna, I am not sure if you have chosen not to continue

If not, good luck with school, and I hope the rest of your year goes well.",,"Mentor 2021-11-08, 18:09: Hi Sienna! My name is Jayne and I will be your mentor this year. I am
super excited for the E-mentoring program, as it is quite new to me. I think it's awesome that this
program is in place. Currently, I am in my fourth year of nursing, and I am loving it so far. Have
you done the E-mentoring program before? Also, what grade/courses are you in this year? I look
forward to speaking with you soon!Mentee 2021-11-15, 13:49: Hey Jayne! No, I have not done this
program yet, and it is very confusing haha. I would love to learn more about the nursing program you
are taking. I also read that you had a job or something in Terrace once, I was born there and lived
there until I was 12! Looking forward to hearing back from you!Mentor 2021-11-17, 01:22: I agree,
it's a bit confusing for sure. It's my first year doing it as well, so I guess we can help each
other through it lol! I'm studying at UNBC for my degree as a Registered Nurse, are you interested
in going into a nursing program after highschool? I'd love to answer any questions if you have any I
did an Employed Student Nurse position in Terrace working in Mental Health, which you can apply for
in your second and third year. Basically you work as a student nurse under a ""provisional license""
and get paid, and it is amazing experience. I loved living in Terrace for a summer, it was awesome!
Would you like to discuss anything else from this Anchor Text?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047547291,1047549754,11/8/2021 15:05,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-24, 14:11: My apologies for starting this conversation, I was busying finishing my
school work for the end of the semester and then became distracted with the winter break. I hope
you're having a good holiday and getting a bit of a break from the school work. I'll start this
conversation by answering the anchor questions, feel free to answer the questions as well, or just
share your thoughts about how you study and what methods work well for you. What does it mean to
study something? For me this means to spend time to learn about the class content outside of class
time. What do you do when you study? This depends on the course, but normally I skim a text book and
write notes, I'll ask myself questions and try to answer the questions as I skim the text book. This
allows me to read faster and target my reading to what I think is important. What have you been
previously taught about how to study? I have a tutor in college and they told me to follow the SQR4
method. This stands for ""Survey"" the textbook which is reading the headings and titles, then ask
""Questions"" about what you surveyed, and then ""read actively"" which is reading the text to answer
the questions, and then ""respond"" which I do by writing notes. Here is a link if you are interested
in learning more about SQR4 method: Reading Textbooks with SQ4R - Study Effectively - Guides at
University of Guelph (uoguelph.ca) I enjoyed the video, it gave some tips and skills I didn't know
about. Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience
with those skills? One I use often is the connecting abstract concepts to concrete examples. Often
at the start of many classes an instructor will ask if anyone has any questions about the reading,
most of the time the class is silent, I think because most people didn't read the text. But, if I
did read the text book for the weeks class, I would try to ask the professor for an example to a
concept I read about. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. Connecting
abstract concepts to examples I find to be the most useful skill. It allows me remember the
information. Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the
case The strategy I would find most challening is switching, I find switching topics very
challenging when I'm studying or doing homework. Normally I'll read a magazine or comic book
inbetween study topics to get my eyes off the computer screen and shift my focus. Do you have any
questions about these strategies? Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you
explain what would make this additional strategy effective?\ Strategies I would add to the list
would be Study Groups. When I join a study group I am able to explain my understanding to others and
this helps me remember what I am studying, I also get to listen and learn from other classsmates
about concepts I might not understand. I think study groups are the most effective way for me to
study. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything
that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? It's hard to be focused, especially for
harder topics. What gets in the way is time and motivation. Honestly, many times I don't have the
time or motivation to complete all the six habits, so understanding which skills work for me is
important. I don't always write notes or recall my learning through practice tests, so I use the
connecting ideas to examples skill instead. I definately see that the amount of time I spend
studying reflected in my grade. So finding the best study method that works for you is very
important. What is your favourite way to study?Mentee 2022-01-18, 17:36: For me, studying is
something I do when something requires it [incoming quiz, test, etc] and how I study depends on the
material I am given. If it is just words and their definitions, I game-ify it and award myself
points when I get an answer correct to help me remember. For any other sort of material, like a
story, I skim over important events and take notes on that. 1/3 [I am doing this little thing in
parts, as the text does not save when I don't send it and my brain isn't working right these past
few weeks, but I will finish these questions :-)]Mentor 2022-01-19, 18:23: Game-ifying what you
study is a unique and great skill. What type of rewards do you use when you get answers correct? I
hear you about brain not working right, my brain seems foggy as well, I really enjoy reading your
responses but don't feel pressured to finish the questions unless you want to. It does suck that
this program doesn't save our messages if we don't send. Happy new year btw, talk soon. ChrisMentee
2022-01-24, 17:26: To answer your question, the only reward I get is the happy chemical my brain
gives me when I get things right. Occasionally I reward myself with candy or some other sweet thing.
All previous studying information I got from my mom, who game-ified my studies to help me remember
the studying material so I'd get good marks on my test. The most helpful studying strategy to me is
retrieval. Usually, I know most things about the subject already and I just need little refreshers
from the textbook to fill in the gaps. I think game-ifying falls under the category of retrieval (if
you jump straight into a game without reviewing). It's a nice method to see what you already know.
2/3 [thank you for being so understanding :-D] RookeMentor 2022-01-26, 16:35: It sounds like the
game-ifying technique works really well for you. I think about those happy brain chemicals a lot
when I am studying and writing, and try to figure out how to get more happy brain chemicals as it
makes studying easier. I would encourage you to focus on this skill as your education advances, like
changing the questions or modify the rewards and always reflecting on what works for you. Even in
the workplace we have to study and memorize things, and you already have a skill to use which is
awesome. You got me thinking about tests, and what I am surprisingly having more open-book exams
this year and last semester, this is different than pre-COVID times. Many times exams are openbook
online, through Moodle or some other website, and the teachers tell us to use our books, or we are
allowed to bring in our own hand-written notes. So part of my studying process now is note taking,
which have tons of doodles on them. It sounds like our mentor time is ending on Friday :( Do you
want to talk about anything else before then? I want to encourage you to always be yourself, and
shine bright. Our conversations got me thinking a lot about my expression and how important it is
for me to love myself and be myself even when it is hard and uncomfortalbe; so thank you for your
insight and thoughts.Mentee 2022-01-28, 18:01: This message may not make it to you on time, but
thank you for being my mentor. Things have been rough the last few months, and I'm glad you stuck
through me not being able to reply back. Your responses were highly appreciated and I learned a lot.
Thanks again, Rooke",,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 14:06: This was a very inspiring video as Dr. Nichole explains her story. This
story made me think about the power a bystander has in situations. What I thought of was how all of
the other doctors walked away from the table after Nicole left the lunch table. If the other doctors
didn't do this than the surgen who made the racist remarks about working with Indigenous people
possibly would not have thought about why what he said was wrong. Also, it was important to
acknowledge how uncomfortable Nicole was, and how hard it must have been to make a statement. This
takes bravery, and her story shows her bravery. In university there situations when people say
discrimatory things, often these messages are subtle and not blunt. Many times people are excluded
from groups for being Indigenous, disabled, queer, age; this is just as discriminatory and wrong.
The cool thing is university is a place to learn and connect so asking questions and calling people
out on their poops is often, but now always, accepted. I've learned that part of responding to
discrimination is about understanding where the beliefs come from. If I am called out for something
I've said I naturally want to respond by apologising. When I unintentionally offend or hurt someone
I feeI awful and horrible, but in this moment I realise it's not about my feelings, I need to
reflect and think about where my beliefs about what I said come from, how I learned the beliefs, and
how I can unlearn the beliefs to be a better person. I think this is why the doctor took so long to
apologise. What he did was wrong, the bystandards realized it and walked away, and he then needed to
think about what he did and apologise 4 years later. Confronting discrimination is a big and heavy
topic. What are your thoughts of the video? Are you willing to share any of your stories about
confronting discrimination?Mentee 2021-11-30, 15:05: Though I have known about discrimination
against Indigenous people, I have actually never heard someone really talk about it and their
experiences with it. This video opened my eyes to how it is still here and needs to be dealt with.
The statement and the bravery that went with it to speak up about the hurt it caused Nicole
surprised me because if I were in her shoes, I would just shut up and just let it happen. The
reactions of the other surgeons were surprised me too, and it makes me happy that other people can
recognize their mistakes and let other people know about them. On the note of reactions of surgeons,
his apology. 4 years is a long time to think, but I'm glad that he changed his stance and unlearned
the hurtful things he thought about Indigenous people. A little story on my experiences with
discrimination: I don't exactly confront discrimination, it usually confronts me. I was in the
classroom doing my work on my Chromebook and I overhear some girls talking loudly. They usually talk
like that but it wasn't the noise that caught my ear, but the topic. The girls openly and very
loudly admitted that they are transphobic. Even if it was a joke, I didn't think it was funny. They
then went on to ""disprove"" the existence of trans and nonbinary people and I no longer felt safe in
this classroom. They don't bother with the right pronouns, don't bother to know how it affects me. I
have yet to bring this up with the teacher, but I alone can't change their minds. There is only one
of me and three or more of them.Mentor 2021-12-02, 16:41: Thank you for sharing you experience. I
cannot imaging the resilience you have to be your true self in high-school and work through your
experience of discrimination. Big virtual hugs, you're a strong warrior. Pronouns are important and
I should have mentioned my preferred pronouns are they/them when I introduced myself. I identify as
non-binary but I did not come out as non-binary in highschool because I didn't feel safe to be
myself true self. Not saying anything and just keeping silent is a form of resistance for safety
concerns. Silence is needed sometimes for safety reasons even though it is unfair and unjust. I
think it is important to understand discrimination comes from beliefs and values instilled in
people, beliefs instilled in the doctor that discriminated against Nicole, and beliefs instilled in
the girls who discriminate against you. Those girls should be punished but they probably won't be,
but hopefully society will move in a direction that allows everyone to be their true self without
discrimination. My experience in university is more positive than other work and public
environments. There are also opportunities to join groups and there's more power and safety in
numbers. But unfortunately discrimination still happens. In groups, I think people eventually gain
courage and bravery build up and people's silence become a strong voice.","Mentor 2021-11-09, 14:27: Hello Rooke, It's great to meet you virtually. How are you doing this
week? My name is Chris and I am in my 3rd year at university studying Social Work. I really enjoy
going to university but there were a few challenges I had to overcome at the beginning. I am happy
to answer any questions you may have about university. What conversation choices do you want to
start discussing? A quote that I love is from the Nacho Libre movie by Jack Black when he says to a
boy when he serves the porriage, ""today is especially delicious"". This quote is great and I find
myself saying it a lot in the morning when I'm motivating myself for the day. I also think Nacho
Libre is the funniest movie ever. A lonely landscape I can think of is when I visit downtown
Vancouver. Outside by the Waterfront Skytrain Station, above the Canada Place sails, is a space to
sit and look out at the city. I enjoy going to this spot because I can see all the buildings around
me, listen to the noises of sirens and cars, and I can smell the ocean. In the midst of all the
hustle that Vancouver has, I feel lonely but content as I know that I have a space to be myself in
this large world. Talk to you soon, I hope you have a great week. Sincerely, ChrisMentee 2021-11-15,
14:13: Greetings Chris! School's been sorta tough lately since I have to well, do school things, and
think about a decision that will drastically change my life. Though it's nice to meet you too :-) My
name is Rooke, and I am currently in grade 10 and will hopefully get into a trades program. I am
creatively inclined and love to draw and animate. I sometimes draw out my feelings to destress or as
a drawing prompt. A question I'd like to start with is how is it like in university? Is it true that
school and homework are really hard? What are the educators like? The students? (i just really want
to know so I can be prepared for what may go on in the future) A phrase I live by is ""Don't pass
out."". I originated this phrase when I was doing a double day (which means two sets of martial arts
classes in one day) in my jiu-jitsu class after the first class. I was really tired, but as the
saying says, I have to keep going through it, no matter how tired I am. A song I'd like to share
with you is Solar Waltz by Cosmo Sheldrake. Mr. Sheldrake's music sounds so very ethereal, it was as
if you pulled it from another world. This song in particular sounds regal, something fit for a ruler
of the deep forests, or a lullaby to a sleeping prince. It's very soft and warm, like a cup of warm
hot chocolate. (I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and if you didn't, thank you for taking the
time to listen to this song! Cosmo Sheldrake's music is very underrated, so I want to expose his
lovely music to other people) Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkQW5xr9iGc See you
at some point next week! Thanks for your time, RookeMentor 2021-11-17, 23:26: Greetings Rooke, I
love your phrase ""don't pass out"". It shows you must have some great stregnth and resilence to keep
pushing when you're at jiu-jitsu class or getting through a hard day. I will probably say this
phrase to myself when I'm having a hard day. Your phrase also relates to the song you shared from
Cosmos Sheldrake. The Solar Waltz is a wonderful ballad that is very poetic discussing the need to
keep working and living life. I think there's a hidden message of joy in the emotional song Cosmos
Sheldrake sings, as it illustrates how life changes and new things grow when other things decompose.
It was a pleasure to listen to. Thank you for introducing me to Cosmos Sheldrake. Being in
university is like managing your own full time job. It was hard at first cause I had to learn how to
organize my time. But now I love it cause I meet so many different people, I get invovled with
student union, and go to events. I tend to be very busy but I'm busy doing things I enjoy. Many
students don't show up to class, or go to class over Zoom, and then show up for the test. School and
homework can be hard, but it also can be easy. It depends on the professor or instructor. For me, I
found homework hard at first but then I started going to the writing centre and got connected with
the accessibility centre. I got a tutor who helped me out a lot, they showed me how to use a marking
rubric to write my assignments and meet the criteria that a professor asks for. I think that
accessing student services, such as the Writing Centre and Accessibility Centre, helped me pass my
first two years in university. Most people in university are very supportive and will help you
succeed, but you have to ask and seek the help on your own by emailing people and setting up
appointments. Often these appointments are on Zoom or virtual meetings. It requires some good time
management skills, I use Google calendars all the time to remind me about appointments and classes.
The educators are very supportive, most of the time the the professors (profs) want you to pass. I
always email my professors and ask them questions about assignments. Their answers always give me
hints to the homework. Normally they are very nice people. The students are great, I've definately
made more friends in university than I did in highschool. All the students want to help eachother
out. For example, there's a test tomorrow, so I met with some students earlier this week to study
and go over the text book. That helped me a lot because if we didn't meet I would just read the text
book over and over again. So now I feel prepared and I had a good time studying with others. Wow,
that was a lot of stuff to fit into a message. I hope it wasn't too much. Those were some great
questions, I hope I answered well enough for you. We can start a conversation if you'd like. I think
we're suppose to complete two by the end of January. ChrisMentee 2021-11-22, 11:49: Hello Chris,
Sorry for the delayed message, home has been quite busy. I'm happy to see that you enjoyed Solar
Waltz, I didn't even notice the correlation between my phrase and song of choice until I read your
message. (i think that was pretty neat, thanks!) Also, thank you for answering my questions. They
really showed me some insight into what post-secondary might be like. A module I'd like to start on
is the Confronting Discrimination one, as I have issues of that nature in the school I'm in. Thanks
again, RookeMentor 2021-11-24, 13:43: Hi Rooke, Thank you for the message. No need to apologize for
the late response, it wasn't late, and life does get very busy all the stresses of life. school
semester finishing, floods affecting our province, pandemic worries. Life can become a lot very
fast, take it step by step. It takes energy to respond to emails and it's alright if we don't

How are you? What grade are you in? What interests do you have? Is there anything you would like to
tell me before we get started? Feel free to ask me any questions.Mentee 2021-11-15, 13:35: Hello,
Jasroop! I am looking forward to hearing from you, and learning about different post-secondary

further my undertsnading of what the financial field looks like career wise.Mentor 2021-11-25,
04:10: Sounds great! Accounting is a great option for people who like working with numbers, so it
should suit you well. Depending on where you want to study, you can begin an accounting-oriented
post-secondary path if that's what you wish. From my understanding, accounting is a job that
involves using basic mathematics. Talking to an academic advisor at your prospected institute or
your secondary school counselor is always a great option to make sure you are on the right track to
get to your goal. Also just wanted to make sure if you are familiar with how this program works

the process, something happens and this is the essence of creation. It’s something that you cannot
plan. You have to do a lot of planning but what is important is not planned.” This is the inpiration
quote that stood out to me the most. For me the most inspiring events in my life have been by
chance. These inspirations result in hard work, but I do not feel hardwork results in inspiration.
An example from my own life would be, while working as a paramedic I was called to a patient who was
dying from cancer. I was able to help that person die at home comfortably, which inspried me to
pursue medical school and that is why I am now at Selkirk College doing pre-med. So for me in this
case, the hardwork has come after the inspiration. PS: I also love to hunt! I will be going out this
afternoon for deer and turkeyMentee 2021-11-26, 11:58: that is very inspiring and i will remember
that quote for the furture.Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:30: what inspired you to be a paramedic?Mentor
2021-12-07, 14:43: Great question! Well, my father was a paramedic and had done a lot of great stuff
in that world which was inspiring. Originally, I wanted to go to medical school and become a
phyisian, however, the amount of schooling required felt prohibitive! I was more interested in
chasing girls and going to parties at the time I was in highj school. Paramedic was 2 years of
college, paid great, fantastic job experience, and was medicine so that was the route I took! Now, I
have returned to the journey of medical school and thats why I am at Selkirk College taking the
rural premedicine program :) My dream would be to be a doctor on an ambulance :)Mentee 2021-12-08,
12:43: Mentee 2021-12-08, 12:48: thats great right now ive been trying to figure out what i want to
do and im really into cars so i want do to something with cars like a mechanic. but evrything is
turning electric so mechanics wont havea job anymore eventually so im not really sure if i
should.Mentor 2021-12-10, 00:57: Well I think you will still need mechanics for electric engines,
just different type of a mechanic. Maybe becoming an electrical engineer would be a good root? You
could still work on electric cars than! There are other options as well like airplane mechanic,
airplanes wont go electric anytime soon. I took auto class in highschool, and my final project was
to change the brakes on a car. Long story short, the brakes did not work so I failed the exam
lol...I am no good with vehicles! Is there another topic you would like to discuss from the assigned
conversations?Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:17: yea i was thinking of doing something with electric cars but
im not a hge fan of them. another topic we could talk about could be paying for school, what would
is one of the best ways to pay for school?Mentor 2021-12-19, 00:24: Yes in terms of paying for
school there are number of strategies you can take advantage of. #1, have a job and save money.
Ideally, would want to save 25% of every pay check. This will keep money available for school! #2.
Look at getting a student loan. they are interest free in BC so that is great! Even if you do not
need the student loan, I would still take the money, open an Tax Free Savings Account, have the loan
put into a GIC (gauranteed investment certificate) and you can make some extra money on the
interest! Than once you have to pay the loan back, it is sitting in your TSFA plus the extra you
made on interest!!! Alternatively, if you have a financial advisor, they can invest the money into
low risk portfolio. Financial advisors can be found at the bank. #3. Look for scholarships and aim
to apply to 20 of them before the end of the summer! This will be huge. #4. Explore all the options
financial aide has at your post secondary school. They have access to bursarys and scholarships.
Those are all great strategies in my opinion!Mentee 2022-01-21, 11:44: sory for the late responce.
yea i was planning on getting a job soon but i not sure where i want to work.Mentor 2022-01-30,
17:29: Hey Noah, sorry for my delayed response. My understanding is your semester has come to an
end. So it has been a pleasure helping you out this semester. If you have anything further you would
like to discuss I am avialable. Take care buddy!",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-30, 11:36: It seemed from your message you were ready to move onto the next topic, so
I have opened up paying for school. The Macleans articlesuggested sharing textbooks with a
classmate, however I would advise against that. It would be a lot of extra effort to do that and not
worth the cost savings. I would definitely recommend buying used text books. They are ALWAYS
available, and typically schools have facebook groups for used books. In terms of student loans, BC
has loans and grants you can access. I did not go through BC as I am from Ontario, so I am not
completely sure of the process. With that being said what I did with my student loan, was invested
any extra in a tax-free savings account in high interest savings account and mutual funds. The loan
is interest free, so if you have extra than you can earn a little bit of cash on the extra to help
pay the rest of the debt down. There are also lots of scholarships out there. Admittedly they are a
lot of work to apply for and I have not had a lot of success sadly! But, each school as their own
financial aide officer that can help you apply for scholarships and bursaries, thats where I have
had always had success in getting some extra money. Also, if you have a diagnosed permanaent
disability like ADHD or dyslexia, you can get forms filled out with financial aide to apply for
extra grants and funding from the BC government. BC gives thousands if you fall into that category.
Watch for sales, theres always lots of sale for the stuff you need. Another pro-tip for sales, is if
you are buying online fill up your cart, put in all your information, get to the point where you are
about to pay and than close the browser Often companies will send you an email with 10% off to
encourage you to buy the product. Hope that helps buddy",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 19:59: Hey Noah! sorry for the delay! I have been busy in exams and lots of
assignments. Do you have anything specific you would like to discuss? I am currently a full time
student at Selkirk college taking their rural pre medicine program. I work casually as a paramedic
at the moment but have been an advanced care paramedic for 12 years before coming to Selkirk
College. What's your favourite thing to do with your spare time?Mentee 2021-11-15, 13:52: Hello

time to read through the module, watch the video, and take notes of ideas/statements that stick out
to you!Mentor 2021-11-19, 20:48: Let's also discuss our ideas/feelings towards the video. I'll go
first! Personally, I resonated with the ideas of Mina Shum. As she said, ""You have an intention, a
want, a desire that needs to be filled"", I believe this is 100% true. Often times, you may feel lost
in life, however inspiration can be found from the inner light and inner desire to reach your goals.
For example, in grade 12, I was confused on what program I wanted to apply for in university.
However, I searched for goals that I wanted to fulfill, intentions that I desired to complete, and
figured out my plan from there! Please share your thoughts using the prompts provided in the module
:)Mentee 2021-11-24, 14:59: Hi Rhea, The words that Roch Carrier said ""creation is an accident""
stood out to me, this makes me think of when I try to write a song. When I pick up my guitar and sit
down to start writing, it almost seems too forced. But when I'm just playing for fun, I end up
coming up with a whole bunch of riffs and licks that would become a song. Also, what Denys Arcand
said about being authentic and truly yourself- I always find new ways to express myself. I see too
often that people are just copying artists and themselves over again. Finding new inspiration and
getting out of the ""formula"" of creating is the way I like to go. I liked the idea of choosing a
photo and writing about it. I might do that to find inspiration. :)Mentor 2021-11-27, 03:38: Hi

I'm going to open the Extension Activity now!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-12, 01:48: Hi Milla! Happy new year :) I opened the next conversation. Take your time
reading this module and answering the associated questions! I'm happy to discuss anything about this
topic, and if you need help or any sort of clarifiation, please let me know. Looking forward to our
discussion!Mentee 2022-01-12, 17:18: Hi Rhea, as I was watching the video and reading, I kept
thinking to where my family goes back, there is a place that makes up the fabric of ourselves. In
Europe, there is a midieval town in Estonia called Tallinn, even though it's not the raw land and
nature of the area, I understand the history within every brick and stone that was laid by hand to
make this village, and utilizing the deep forests around it. I also totally understand how having
places within you makes you feel more connected to them. When I visited where my parents,
grandparents, and great grandparents are from, I didn't want to leave! For one of the questions it
says to recall a story of the land where you live, I can't rememer any at the moment but It made me
think of northern Finland. There are the Sami people that were first in northern Finland, they herd
reindeer and care for them, and that's all they care about. There are beautiful landscapes, lakes
and islands, auroras, and deep forests. The Sami people take care of their land, using it to hunt
and gather, and herding reindeer or a living. There is something sacred about being alone with
nature and the natural resources provided. I think that is the traditional way for them to think and
do their resposibilities in a way that makes sense for them. I found this village of Hauyat very
interesting and I haven't heard of it before. I enjoy imagining of what is underneath of you, how
many people have stood in the same spot, seen the same things over hundreds of years, it's hard to
conceptualize. There is a certain respect in knowing how the land beneath you was treated for
thousands of years. I tried to answer some of the questions, I hope it's clear enough :)Mentor
2022-01-17, 02:58: Hi Milla, Excellent responses! I found your passage about Hauyut very touching. I
have now unlocked the ""Ways of Knowing part 2"". Again, if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-09, 22:46: Hi Milla, My name is Rhea and I will be your mentor this year! I am

I like my courses this semester. I have math, socials, French, and Careers. They are all quite easy
for me and I am working hard especially in math. I am a student at Norkam in grade 10 and I am very
interested in doing the IB program at my school next year. I might be interested in one of the
shorter programs at UBC so maybe I could ask you a few things as questions come up. I'm looking
forward to it. :) MillaMentor 2021-11-16, 00:32: Hi Milia, thank you for your response!! Those sound
like some very interesting courses :) Perfect, if at any time you have questions regarding different
types of programs at UBC or questions regarding application processes, I'm more than happy to help!
As a way to get to know each other a little better, let's choose two options from the list provided
above to tell each other about ourselves. I chose these 2 options: 1. Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder - something I find beautiful is my dog Ace. He is an 11 month old Labrador Retreiver. I
find him beautiful as his happiness and excitment always put me in a good mood. 2. Food for thought
- my favourite meal to cook and eat is poutine! Every time I go out with my friends, I always order
a poutine! Please pick 2 choices from the list and tell me more about yourself! Looking forward to
your response :)Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:13: Hello :) Musical Interlude- I love music (especially
metal) but I also like soft and classical pieces. I play guitar and I have my creative output from
there. It says to share a song, so I'll share ""Scream for the Silent"" by Apocalyptica. I like it
because it has contrast in the music and strong melodies instead of lyrics. Cultural Knowledge- My
dad is from Estonia, but I recently found out that I am mostly Finnish (it's the country right above
Estonia) so I have really gotten into the Finnish culture of being shy (like me) and spending time
in nature and in the Sauna. I really felt home in Europe so I'm planning on moving there after a few
years of post secondary in Canada. Looking forward to our conversations to come :)Mentee 2021-11-16,

2021-12-10, 16:56: Hi Rhea, My photo is of a bridge, at an angle that is looking down it from about
3 feet above the ground on the right side touching the post of the bridge. I'm not sure how else to
explain it :) It has a sense of mystery to it, with the editing, colours, and details, I enhanced
the feeling of question. (I'm pretty sure it is a horse trail but also a hiking trail, so it will
make sense) Here are my three sentences: It it a gray day, my feet are cold and my sweater is damp.
I sit here, looking down this bridge with the question of if I'll ever find my horse again. I feel
as though this trail is my only hope, and this bridge must not crumble beneath my feet. (I don't
know where I was going with this, it might not make much sense) Have a great weekend!Mentee

until we're back in school. Happy holidays! Chat in the new year!Mentor 2021-12-26, 18:22: Hi Milla!
I hope you are having a safe, restful and fun holiday break! I'm so sorry for the delay in the
response, I was unfortunately swamped with exams this month. Thank you for the details regarding
your picture, I loved it! Here's a quick description of my photo: I took this picture on the way to
school, as I was passing the Alex Fraser Bridge. My image captures the bridge itself, several cars
stuck on the bridge due to the traffic, the beautiful, snow filled mountains in the background, as
well as a pink/purple ombre looking sky (it was such a cool picture, I really wish I could show
you)! Here are my response to my picture: The image I chose was familiar; I go down this route
through this bridge every day to get to school. But this time, there was something different. The
mountains were more noticable due to the heavy snowfall on the mountains, and the sky was far from
ordinary that day. It's crazy to think that, even in our everyday lives, little changes in our daily
routines can leave us in absolute awe. I look forward to hearing from you in the new year, Milla!
:)Mentee 2022-01-10, 13:11: Hi Rhea! I hope you had a good holiday break. Thank you for the
description of your photo! It seemed beautiful. I think we should move on to the next topic because
there is only three weeks left in this semester and I have to have a least 2 conversation choices
done with a few extension activities. I'm interested in Different ways of knowing. I'm not quite
sure what it's about but it seems interesting. Happy new year!","Mentee 2022-01-17, 12:32: Hi Rhea, One thing that stood out to me in the video was the spiritual vs
scientific table. I understood how silence can be a way of communicating, even in my everyday life,
I feel pressured to fill that silence, sometimes speaking ends up being miscommunication. I think a
lot of people need to feel comfortable in silence and take a break from talking all the time about
things that really don't matter. Like how people are more important than the nature world when it's
really the other way around. Do you notice that there isn't enough silence around you? Or do you
find silence somwhere? I think it was really cool that Jeff used the 7 values to guide his business.
I think that a lot of people try to live by these values but of course, there are people who don't.
Which value do you think is most difficult for people to live by? I think it's humility because we
live in a world where ambition and pride are valued at top of most people's lives. I also think that
it's hard for people to love everyone, from every walk of life, and see past their differences. I
also really love that painting in the text. It reminds me of hiking and finding edible and medicinal
plants in the area. We found pine needles for tea, fireweed, st.johns wort, and some berries in just
a small area. I think it's really grounding to realize that a lot of medicine and remedies are all
around you. Connecting back to the invention and innovation, there is already everything we need
provided by the land and in our bodies. Like moss as anti-septic for baby diapers! It's really quite
amazing. Sorry I'm not so great at asking questions :)Mentor 2022-01-21, 02:05: Hi Milla, this is a
great discussion! In today's generation where everything is constantly ""go, go, go"", I definitely do
feel that it can be hard to find silence and peace. I agree with you that sometimes people feel
pressured to avoid the silence! I agree with you that humility is the hardest value to live by!
Remaining humble and accepting ones strengths and challenges is a challenge observed in many age
groups in different areas. Your discussion was very engaging Milla, thank you for the questions! You
did a great job :)Mentee 2022-01-21, 11:43: Hi Rhea, I think this conversation was interesting too.

stood out to me is how each of the five filmmakers have their own way of finding inspiration. I
think that shows that often you are inspired by your own experiences and that is what makes you
unique! What stood out to you? How do you think these ideas may apply to you?Mentee 2021-12-13,
14:48: i have yet to watch the documentary, but some of these ideas deffinately apply to me. i draw
a lot, so inspiration is a big part of how i get my ideas when i get a burst of creativity out of
nowhere. it's really interesting to see how film makers find inspiration to make movies, a favorite
example of mine is with the film 'how to train your dragon', where one of the main dragons named
toothless was actually inspired by the directors' cat, which is very noticeable in both the dragon's
design and behavior.Mentor 2021-12-15, 22:52: I love your movie example! I think it's really
interesting how the things that people create often reflect what inspired them. I also like to draw
:). We can talk about this more once you have had a chance to watch the video! Feel free to bring up
any of your thoughts as you watched it.Mentee 2022-01-12, 16:56: its so interesting how simple
everyday objects and activities can spark enough creativity in a director to create a movie, said
spark i myself have felt a decent few times, though i never had enough motivation to fully flesh out
the idea, leaving it ultimately scrapped...😅 upon watching the video, i just remembered that it's
not just objects and activities that can inspire a movie or a short film, but literature aswell. a
good few movies are based off of books, like the before mentioned how to train your dragon and
jurassic park as a few examples, both of which being some of my favorite series of all time.Mentor
2022-01-13, 10:07: I agree! Any object or experience can turn inspire you to do anything, not just
make a film! And, yes, literature can be a big inspiration for projects like these. But I also think
that the original book or story must have been written after the author was inspired just like this!

that is super important for everyone! Sometimes, it can be harder to take care of yourself when you

the times when it is most important to take time out of your day for yourself! Some things that I
like to do on a daily basis include getting enough sleep, taking breaks throughout the day, eating
healthy, and getting some physical activity! What do you like to do to take care of yourself?Mentee
2022-01-20, 12:59: self care is deffinately something i need to work on, though that doesn't mean
it's something i don't do. i've been working hard on making sure i have a good sleep schedule and
eat enough healthy food, aswell as have a good way to destress like drawing or playing a video game
to release built up anger.Mentor 2022-01-21, 10:52: It's great to hear that you have been making
sure to take care of yourself! Of course, you can't build all of these healthy habits overnight but
it is important to keep working on these things. For example, something I am working on is getting
enough physical activity everyday. Let's talk about time management! How do you think time
management and self care are related?Mentee 2022-01-21, 11:56: yes they are. you can set up
different times for the different things in your self care routine rather than doing all of it in
one time period, like taking a shower at 7:00am then jogging around the park after dinner as a few
examples i thought of.Mentor 2022-01-23, 17:34: I agree, those are some great ideas on how to manage

lie. I also really enjoy listening to music and watching regular tv too. Mainly indie and rock
music, and I watch cartoon network and t+e. Adventure time, and steven universe are the best. Then
if you don't know about t+e it's just conspiracy theories and the paranormal. Now that all that is
out of the way. What anime have you watched, and what kind of music do you like listening to?Mentor
2021-11-17, 15:16: Hey Knox, Thanks for your reply! You have watched a lot of anime and I'm sure

very cool, I love conspiracy theories and paranormal content. I have also watched Adventure Time, it
is a really entertaining show. I used to watch it all the time when I came back from school. My

because i go there so much. I have had a lot of injuries. so i will for sure think of some questions
to ask you!Mentee 2021-12-01, 12:48: so some of my questions are 1. how long do you have to go
school to become a physiotherapist assistant and a physiotherapist in general 2. what kinds of
things do u do for a physiotherapist assistant 3. what classes would help me become a
physiotherapist in high school for my grade 11 and 12 years 4. what are some universities would you
recomend for physiotherapy 5. and what classes I should take in universityMentor 2021-12-02, 18:13:
A physiotherapist assistant doesn't require schooling. It's a part-time job. I used to volunteer at
a clinic and they offered me a job afterwards. To become a physiotherapist, you complete a four-year
bachelors degree first, before entering physical therapy school which is a 2 year masters degree. My
job is to bring patients in and out the room, apply heatpacks in the problem area, and adjust
electrotherapy machines during their treatment. I also help with maintaining the clinic. If you're
interested, you could ask any physiotherapy clinic to volunteer there. There is no specific high
school class that you need to become a physiotherapist. I think your science classes are important,
especially biology focused on human anatomy/physiology are the most relevant. You can research the
type of bachelors degree that you want to pursue. For instance, a Kinesiology degree is a popular
one that students pursue before applying to physio school. There's no specific degree that you have
to take to become a physiotherapist but make sure you take the required courses in order to apply
(which you can plan for in university). If you want to stay in-province, I believe UBC is the only
physio school in BC. UBC's website has the required courses you will need to take. You can search up
""UBC physical therapy requirements"". But since you're still in highschool, it is a bit early to
worry about that.Mentor 2021-12-13, 18:21: Hi, I hope you're classes are going well so far! I just

white sugar 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) ½
cup milk ¼ cup white sugar ¼ cup butter 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs, beaten 4 cups all-purpose flour ¾
cup butter ¾ cup brown sugar 1 cup chopped pecans, divided ¾ cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground
cinnamon ¼ cup melted butter I did this recipe because I love cinnamon buns and I always make them
when I have time too. a written description of a place that feels lonely to me is being in a huge
field and not being able to see any people, animals, and houses. I feel like that would be lonely
because you are all by yourself and have no one to talk to or anything.Mentor 2021-11-16, 16:48: Hi
Kaitlyn, I love cinnamon buns. I'll definitely give your recipe a try. As for a place that feels
lonely, I also view a remote place to be lonely. I've seen videos of farmland in the southwest of
the states and I could never imagine living somewhere so barren of people. Kind of like Kansas like
in The Wizards of Oz. Something to think about, it can also be lonely when you're surrounded by many
people. I think we're ready to start on ""Working through this program""!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-11, 03:08: Happy new year! I hope you had a great break. How you are doing on the

Physiotherapist is a great career, but don't worry too much about choosing a job right now. You have
a lot of time to explore and decide. Many university students are in the same boat, changing their
minds about what they like or have no idea what to do after they graduate. At my workplace, besides
a physiotherapist there are also Register Massage Therapists, Acupuncturists, Reflexologists, so
many different types of careers people aren't as familiar with.Mentee 2022-01-12, 16:50: yes, I have
thought about lots of those careers and I think I for sure want to do something within that area. I

house-keeping content for the program. I went ahead and opened this conversation for us :) There's
some nice resources and quizzes you can take to learn more about what different types of careers
look like (I believe the best way to understand though is to talk to folks who are doing what you're
interested in). Once you've checked it all out, maybe let me know in a bit more detail what your
thoughts are on options after high school. You've mentioned a few things and it'd be great to know
more about what's important to you. My path to where I am today was non-traditional, to say the
least ;) So I think I might be able to give some perspective on things like university and taking a
job that doesn't require a degree. I don't want to dump a mountain of info on you before giving you
a chance to direct the conversation, so I'll wait for you to point me out in the direction you want
to go - and we'll pick it up from there Looking forward to reading your thoughts!Mentee 2021-11-26,
11:53: My top 3 choices were: Construction millwrights, and industrial mechanics, as well as
aircraft mechanics. All of these are most needed in the Mainland/Southwest and are always in high
demand. All three of the salaries for these jobs vary between 50-80 thousand. Those were my results
however, I am most interested in a simple red seal trade. For example, welding, or becoming a
mechanic.Mentor 2021-11-30, 03:54: Hey Jeremy, cool that you had a go with these quizzes. I think
they're probably mostly good as a way to get ideas and expand the list of professions you already
have in mind. I don't have personal experience with training for trades in BC, but I think maybe the
best thing we can do here is talk about the different things that are good to think about relating
to the question of what kind of career you want to work towards after you graduate high school.
Maybe I can start with saying a bit about my story and how I went about decisions like this. I grew
up in Israel, and there everyone has to serve in the military for 3 years after high school, so at
your age, deciding what I wanted to work in wasn't even on my radar ;) I decided to do a gap year
working with younger youth a counselor and program lead, before going into the military. This was a
really cool year, which gave me lots of experience organizing big events, working with people at
different capacities and dealing with challenging situations. Even though it isn't in the line of
work that I eventually chose as my career, it gave me really good tools for things I had done after
that. My military service as almost 5 years, since I ended up becoming an officer and committed to
more time on contract. I'm not sure how much I can say about the military that would be relevant
here :) but like my work with youth, it was a meaningful life experience that helped me develop lots
of my habits and capabilities. I guess the main point in telling about these experiences is to
highlight that there are lots of ways to grow and develop in multiple directions. If you know
exactly what you want to do and how you're going to do it - that's awesome. If not (that was me) -
it's also really good to find something that you're excited to do, albeit not forever, and give it
some time. In many ways, the experiences you gain doing one thing, end up being helpful in other
things you do later. I know for sure that my experience and perspective from being a youth worker
and a soldier - have made me a better, more well-rounded student and engineer. So there's value in
having a diverse, broad set of skills and experiences. Once I got out of the military, I moved to
Canada and decided I wanted to work in tech. I knew I was interested either in electrical
engineering or computer science, but I wasn't quite sure. I ended up choosing electrical engineering
because it's the more versatile option - it enabled me to keep both the software and hardware worlds
open to me. The big factors for my choice of this career were: I was interested in it professionally
technology has a big influence on people. I want to do good and I think technology is a powerful
tool for that I enjoyed living rurally, and also had meaningful ties in 2 countries, so I was hoping
to find a job that is easily transferable to different places. Software engineering is the same
everywhere (unlike medicine or plumbing which have different standards/ training/ regulations in
different countries. Plus, it's often possible to work remotely in tech. I knew this kind of job
will provide decent financial security Throughout my degree, different thoughts came and went about
where I'd like my career to go, and I think it's fine to keep re-assessing as you go and adapt your
goals to what's important to you. So I dumped a lot of stuff here to think about ;) I guess what I'm
hoping is that it can help you think about what's important to you, what you're looking to have in
your life - right after you graduate, in a year, and in say, 5 years... What kind of work do you
enjoy - with people/ alone? On a computer/ with your hands? Indoor/ outdoor? Creative/ procedural?
How do you feel about working for a company vs. being self-employed? Would you want to have
opportunities for promotion and advancement as you go (i.e. manage people) - or keep specializing in
a profession? Where do you want to live, and what are the possibilities there for the kind of work
you want? How long are you willing to be in training? What kind of training do you think will be
good for you? Lots of questions here. I'm sure not all of them are relevant to you right now, and
that's totally fine. I just wanted to throw ideas at you to give you something to work with, and
these have been helpful points in my journey towards choosing a career. I'm looking forward to
hearing what you have to say about this and hope all the stuff I put here would be of help :)Mentee
2021-11-30, 14:52: Hey Shay, I do have an interest in the coast guard, so if you are comfortable,
some stories on what kind of work you had to do during your time would be intriguing. Furthermore, I
would lean more to the company side of things, where I do work for a company, but still get to make
some of my own decisions in the workplace, as far as time management etc etc. After high school, I
want to take a year off to think about what I fully want to do, and consider my genuine values and
interests at that time. With my year, I want to become a member of a patrol team at my local ski
mountain, as my close friend has a house twenty minutes out from this mountain. I get my first aid
training, multiple condition courses, backcountry courses, as well as staying in shape and livable
pay rates for rent, necessities, and fun during the year. Back to your questions, I'm not picky
about if I work indoors or outdoors, but a healthy mix would be great! I love working with my hands,
and am happy to work with others too. If I take a trade, I would too get my red seal which you could
call a promotion in theory, Im willing to spend up to 4 years in training. If all goes perfect, I
would want to live on the outskirts of my current city. Thanks, JeremyMentor 2021-12-13, 00:21: Hey
Jeremy, sorry for being out for a while - I was away in the Fraser Valley helping with flood relief
work. Long days there so I didn't have a lot of gas for other things. To our business - seems that
you have really good leads on what you want to work towards. I can't say I think doing ski patrol
for a year is a bad idea - it'll give you a chance to work and earn money, be independent, be around
others who are more experienced, hopefully in a mixture of professions (I assume you'll meet at the
ski hill mechanics, carpenters, engineers, all kinds). You'll hopefully get to see more of what
different kinds of work are actually like. Plus, you'll be able to form relationships with older
folks who can advise you and share their experiences to help you make choices. You answered to
yourself some of the questions that I think are important in figuring out which career you want -
the next step in my mind is to think about how the options that you mentioned embody those
preferences. I think a good thing to do is to try to speak directly with folks who are doing those
things you're interested in. With the experiences I've had, I can give you lots of intel on
university, working with youth, working in small-scale construction, and military service (which
aside from the military, are sadly not what you're shooting for). So I think it's worthwhile to find
ways to connect with people who are actually in the careers you're interested in, ask them what
their days look like, what are the challenges in their work, what are the fun parts, how their work
lends itself to the things you said that are important to you... Doing some google research is a
good way to start, but the best way is probably to work with your network of connections through
friends, family, counselors, people at school or work etc.. I've found that people are more than
happy to share their experiences, especially with younger folks, even when you're ""cold calling""
them out of the blue. This is a skill I highly vouch for, generally for your career - to learn how
to find people with insight on something you consider doing and developing a
semi-mentorship-consulting relationship. As for what you asked about the military - I'll be happy to
write a little about it. I think I'll do it in another message, just to keep this to a reasonable
length. Let me know what you think about all I've put here so far :)Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:48: Hey
Shay, No worries, good on you man! I woulsd bet those were long days. I believe ski patrol would be
a great experience as well. Free skiing of course and like you touched on, I can gain word of mouth
experience about different potential jobs in my interests. Small scale construction would be cool to
hear about, as any word on any trade would intruige me at this point haha. Further, at the back of
my head I have an interest in serving in some branch to gain the discipline you cant get anywhere
else! Thanks, JeremyMentee 2021-12-15, 12:12: Jeremy again, just letting ya know after this coming

appreciate the info you shared, good getting to know ya, Jeremy.Mentor 2022-01-31, 19:12: Hey! Yeah
I figure you're moving on to other things, I hope you get a great year of ski patrol and figuring
out next steps after that. Before we go, let's do the wrapping up stuff on here, I'll open it up for
you :) I'm glad to have e-known you and hope a bit of my experience has been helpful for you in
looking at the future. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-08, 23:54: Hi Jeremy, nice to meet you! I'm Shay (pronounced like 'shy') and I'm
excited about starting this mentorship with you. I think you can see my profile for some more
details about me, but the quick version is I'm 29, I just moved from the Kootenays to Vancouver, and
I just graduated from UBC, where I studied Electrical Engineering. Looks like we both like skiing
and being outdoors! What kind of skiing do you do? I mostly go in the backcountry because I like
backpacking in summer and ski touring feels like the winter substitute for that, and I love it. I
took a quick look at your profile and saw that you're into mechanical work. That's really awesome
and I think it can be useful and valuable for so many different things in life and career paths. I
also love crafts and working with my hands. Never been much of a mechanic, but I do love building
things in a carpentry sort of setting (worked in it for a little bit too). I went to university for
a relatively scientific degree, so that's naturally something I'd be more than happy to tell you
about - even if your go-to interests are more in mechanical/physical stuff rather than coding and
math. I also took a very unusual path to university, so I'm sure there will be plenty in my set of
experiences that can be helpful for you to hear about. I'm sure we'll find even more things that we
have in common, and for now, we can start with the quick task here (the categories of things to
share above). Here's a link to a picture I took last year at Mt Assiniboine while I was running a
57k ultra-marathon there. It's one of the most beautiful places I've been to, and it wraps up many
of the things that are dear to me - nature, taking physical challenges and being active, and
beautiful things. I also like this picture because it reminds me of this challenge that I decided to
go after (doing this long run) and how I worked hard planning and training for it and during the
actual run. It's something I'm really proud of. What's an interesting nugget about you? Pick
something from the list above to show me something cool about you :) Last, let me know if you have
any questions about the program. Our next thing up is a quick module on how the program works so
it's okay if you're not sure about everything yet, but if there's something you want to ask or say -
I'm always happy to hear it. Hope to hear from you soon!Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:06: Hey Shay, Yes, I
love skiing! I freestyle, and backcountry ski, it's quite peaceful. I would like to explore my
options in, field jobs, or trade jobs. I have a strong interest in vehicles/ metalwork, as well as
construction. However, sciences also intrigue me, such as biology, chemistry, astronomy. Overall I
would like to get a general understanding of the kind of schooling I would need for these options.
Thanks, Jeremy.Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:15: If possible, Id like to start with career
consideration.Mentor 2021-11-21, 03:41: Hey Jeremy, sorry for missing your response! Awesome that
you're also a backcountry skier. Nothing beats that, just stay safe though! I'm game for starting
with the career considerations convo, so I'll open that one for us. Before that though, it's
important that you go over the stuff through the link 'Working Through this Program' (bottom of the
written content on this page). Once we get that out of the way, we can freely choose the
conversations that you want to have. So how about I open this up tomorrow, and you try to complete
that small module before we dive into the careers conversation? Let me know if you have any
questions or problems, and I'm looking forward to starting our first conversation :) ShayMentee
2021-11-23, 17:01: Thank you Shay, ya I have taken a couple of safety courses at my local mountain.
I will go through that link here, thanks Jeremy",,"Mentor 2022-01-31, 19:26: Hey Jeremy! Just to wrap up the mentorship - I hope this has been helpful
to you. Even though it wasn't a very long mentorship, I hope you took some info and insight for the
things you have on your mind. I think you have a great, grounded sense of what you're interested in
doing and the steps (at least initial ones) you have to take to get there. I kind of wish my
experiences were more relevant to the careers options you're thinking about, but even so, I hope the
general things I said here would be helpful in evaluating options and making decisions. I wish you
and yours good health and you specifically - a fun and exciting transition out of high school and
into your next chapter! Shay by the way - I loved this poem up here, hope you do too :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

classes should I be taking these next 2 years?Mentee 2021-11-29, 16:53: Mentee 2021-11-29, 16:53:
Mentee 2021-11-29, 16:53: Mentor 2021-12-01, 19:42: So for my particular program you need English
12, Pre-calculus 12, Chemistry 11, Physics 11, and two out of Biology 12, Chemistry 12, Geogolgy 12,
Geography 12, or Physics 12. Here is the link to the selkirk page that gives you more details on the
prerequesites for the program.

great thank you, Can we move on to career considerations next?Mentor 2021-12-04, 15:34: Yes for
sure! So I think the first thing to consider are your interests, strengths and passions. And if you
have already considered programs you would like to attend post secondary to study, also look into
what types of careers you could have. One more thing, is that there are thousands more jobs out
there than what you think; it takes a lot of research, and eventually you may find one that is truly
fascinating.Mentee 2021-12-07, 14:29: Ok How can I figure out what course to take for the careers im
going for?Mentor 2021-12-13, 18:45: A lot of that you will find within the institution's website
under that specific degree or carreer. Also, a google search is a good idea. You can find a lot of
information like what type of schooling you need, and what courses that consists ofMentee
2021-12-14, 13:02: ok cool, what should I expect in post-secondary, and how is it different from
Highschool?Mentor 2021-12-17, 16:02: I think the most drastic difference I have found is the amount
of time you will have to spend outside of class preparing and studying. I did not study much in high
school so that was quite the adjustment for me. Also, the content goes a lot quicker, since the
semesters are shorter. Another thing is there are not many assignment so your tests will be weighted
a lot more heavily. One thing that is great though is that your instructors are super passionate,
genuine people that want to see you succeed and learn as much as you can, don't be afraid to ask
then questions or ask for help. Their office hours are there to help you solidify anything you're
unsure about. It is a lot more independent, but I think it is also really fun.Mentee 2022-01-10,
13:23: I don't think I have ever studied out of school before so that would be a lot different for
me as well. Are the assignments bigger or worth more if there aren't as many?Mentor 2022-01-10,
17:43: Yeah I was the same way, I didn't start studying outside out class until probably grade 12,
so it was quite the adjustment coming here and studying many hours per day. Yes, the assignments are
longer and take more time, as they are typically more difficult. Some classed will give weekly
assignments, usually worth between 1-3% and other classes have 2-4 assignments per semester worth
anywhere between 5-20%.",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-08, 19:18: Hi Hayley! My name is Amy, and I am going to be your mentor. I am very
excited to get to know you a little bit better and hopefully for you to get to know the same. I am
currnetly in a Rural Pre-Medicine Program. I am very open to answering any quesitons you may have
and am very willing to help you out with any informaiton you may need. I love playing sports and
being outdoor. Looking forward to hearing back from you!Mentee 2021-11-15, 13:55: Hey Amy, I am
currently in grade 10 at Norkam Secondary, I am interested in medicine and law at the moment. I play
rep A hockey and enjoy camping and riding my horses in my free time. A quote I try to live by is
""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" -Wayne Gretsky. I try to take every opportunity
possible to increase my knowledge in some areas. I really like the song Buy Dirt but Jordan Davis
and Luke Bryan because it is about a future that I would like to have later on. But right now I
really jam to christmas music haha Hope to here from you soon!Mentor 2021-11-15, 20:31: Hey Hayley,
Thank you so much for sharing. I also love that somg so much, the massage in that song is very
powerful. I love listening to country music, even though my feelings are not shared by many! It's
crazy how fast this year has gone by and it's almost Christmas already. Christmas songs help get me
through my study sessions. I am excited to get into deeper conversations about post sencondary as
the semster goes by!Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:20: Hey, I was told I have to choose something t talk
about first so let's go with Post secondary considerations. Also it snowed for the first time
today.Mentor 2021-11-18, 14:53: Hi Hayley! I think that is a great place to start. So to start, have
you thought about what kind of program you would like to attend? That is always the first place that
I like to start. Then you will want to consider how far away from home you would be comfortbale
being. Then it's all about the research. It also just snowed for the first time today! Let me know
what you know so far about you post secondary considerations, and we will start from there. Talk to
you soon!!Mentee 2021-11-22, 11:49: I have been looking into Selkirk College recently, so I found it
cool that I got matched with someone who attends there. I have also looked a little into UVIC and
even TRU since it is in my hometown, but Selkirk is my biggest point of interest. I would like to
stay in B.C, but if there is another school somewhere I am interested in I will definitely consider
it.Mentor 2021-11-22, 13:00: That is so cool that you are interested in Selkirk College! If it is
the Rual Pre-Medicine Program you are intersted I can fill you in on anything you would like to
know, I am really enjoying the program so far. That is very good that you have started considering
your options, I definetly did not have much of a plan when I was in your position. Looking into
recreational activities in your area is also important, if you plan on continuing to play hockey,
and if that is important for you to keep up, then I would suggest looking into that as part of your
consideration. One more thing to note is about application, I would suggest making a list of the
volunteer and work oportunities you are engaging in as they happen. This makes the application
process much easier as almost all applications ask for your volunteer experience.Mentee 2022-01-11,
12:04: I guess we can talk about studying now that we have already moved into that. Are you mostly
studying for the tests or just the class in general?Mentor 2022-01-11, 20:57: I definately study for
tests, but just for class in general, your instructors expect you to underdstand what they are
talking about before you show up to lecture. usually that means reading the textbook and
farmiliarizing yourself with the content. And then after the lecture, going back and solidifying
anything you didn't understand and taking notes or completing any homework assinged. In college,
your lectures (the time your instructor tecahes) is less of them teaching the entire course, but
more pointing out the main points and expectring you to fill in the gaps. It is much more work to
prepare for college lecures than high school.Mentee 2022-01-12, 16:45: That is definitely different
than high school where they tell you everything. How do you find the motivation to study for hours
at a time? I do not think I would be able to do that.Mentor 2022-01-16, 14:38: I didn't think I
would be able to either at first. I definetly still procratinate every now and then but I try to
stay on top of things because I know that it will all pile up if I don't do at least a little every
day. My main motivation comes from looking ahead at my future and the grades that need for that to
happen. Once you get into a rhythm, I at least find it fun to sit at home and study. I enjoy
learning new things and having lectures make sense because I studued ahead of time. It is all about
finding what drives you when you aren't feeling motivated.Mentor 2022-01-22, 22:56: Hi Hayley! I
know that your semester is coming to an end and you are probably preparing for exams, but I just
wanted to say that it was lovely getting to know you. If you would like to contiune to communicate
on this platform, I would love to continue talking with you! Let me know if that is something that
would interest or if you ever have anymore questions for me, just send me a message. I hope your
exams go well and you have a great next semester if I don't hear from you. Take care!Mentee

I'm happy to hear back from you I've unlocked the Wellbeing and Self Care topic so we can get
started. I'm also really glad that you picked this conversation topic - it's so important and I wish
I had focused more on self care during my last years of high school and into the beginning of
University. I really like to bullet journal or do yoga/exercise when I notice that I'm getting
stressed or burnt out. What does your self care look like right now - do you have any self care
activites that you really enjoy?Mentee 2021-12-01, 12:52: I think it's very important to have
self-care and make sure to not be so stressed. I like listening to music and hanging out with
friends makes e feel better and I don't need to stress. I have been really focused on school
lately.Mentor 2021-12-05, 15:08: Those sound like great ways to de-stress. I know it's really easy
to forget about self care especially when school gets busier. It's finals season at my school right
now and I have to keep reminding myself to get enough sleep and to try to eat nutritious food. Do
you have any self care goals or things you think that you'd like to improve?Mentee 2021-12-07,
14:35: I want to improve on my sleep and I want to focus on doing homework. I have some overdue
work, but It's just stressful t get to it because I have so many other things to do. During
Christmas break is when I'll get time to do it. I don't really have self care goals I just need to
improve on some things.Mentor 2021-12-13, 19:03: Those sound like some good goals. If you're
interested, I'd love to share my favourite self care tool. I started bullet journalling a few years
ago and it has been really useful for staying on top of homework and self care but you can also get
really creative with it. There are some really good youtube videos where people talk about it or
show how they set up their journal if you wanted to try it out over the holiday break!

meet you! I'm Meghan, I’m 23 years old and in law school at the University of British Columbia. It
looks like they want us to pick two things from that list above to share with each other. Here's a
two-in-one ""cultural knowledge"" and ""food for thought"". I am Italian so I love making handmade pasta
with my parents and grandparents. In that photo we were making butternut squash ravioli. I don't
exactly know how to make it myself but I contribute however I can. It's always a great time because
we end up with at least 3 or 4 people in the kitchen at once, all working and listening to music
together. My favourite quote: ""You're standing on a bridge watching yourself go by"" - Ram Dass. It
reminds me that every moment will pass and it always helps me remove myself a little bit from
stressful situations to put things into perspective.Mentor 2021-11-16, 17:12: Can't wait to see
which two you pick to tell me aboutMentee 2021-11-17, 14:09: I'm Elizabeth people call me Liz. I
love listening to music and learning about crime or watching documentaries. That ravioli looks so
good. I also love cooking I usually just wing it most of the time but it turns out okay most of the
time. The most important thing I want to talk about is probably school stuff and like how to pay for
school things and what I should go into after high school and what classes I should focus on. I do
want to go to UBC but it will probably change.Mentor 2021-11-18, 15:13: Great to meet you Liz. I
also love watching true crime documentaries, especially Bailey Sarian's videos on Youtube. I'd be
happy to talk more about choosing a program, paying for school. etc. I had a hard time deciding what

contrast between between Mina and Roch, where Mina is saying that everything needs to start with a
plan, while Roch adds that creation is always an accident. Neither one is wrong; you can always
start with a plan, work really hard at it, but sometimes something unexpected happens that leads to
a whole new different plan or way of doing things. For me, choosing a career was kind of like that!
I had a plan throughout university, worked hard towards a goal, but ultimately fell short. Instead I
ended up in Pharmacy- which I'm really enjoying- and I think I'm enjoying it more than what I
originally thought I wanted to do. Maybe not as creative of an example, but unfortunately I'm not
much of an artist... What about you? Did you agree/disagree with what was said in the video? Did

read through the article and anchor text, remember to think about different activities or
experiences you've had that can demonstrate your communication skills, responsibility, quick
learning, or team work. As a high school student, it's definitely important to look outside of
school for anything transferrable- my first resume included things like being on the volleyball team
(which shows teamwork), being able to type at a certain word per minute rate, and babysitting a
neighbour's child (which shows responsibility). I also included hobbies that I'd kept at for a long
period of time, like playing an instrument for &gt; 5 years- in order to show dedication and
commitment. I think it's also important to mention here that employers are not necessarily expecting
a sparkling resume filled with work experience for someone straight out of high school- what they
care more about is will you show up to work on time every shift? If you're running late, will you
communicate with the manager to let them know? Will you be able to work well with the existing
employees? So, try and think of any hobbies or things like that that would convey this to a hiring
manager. Let me know if you have any questions about finding transferrable skills, and I'm
definitely happy to look over your resume, if you want to complete that extension activity!Mentee

to live by, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, symoblic strength, cultural knowledge, lonely
landscape, food for thought, public persona... Look forward to hearing from you soon :)Mentee
2021-11-17, 16:51: my favorite subject in science is physics and my words to live by is persistence
fuels the path and don't give upMentor 2021-11-19, 12:43: Those are awesome words to live by! Let's
start on the ""Working through this program"" part- we will both have to read the text and watch the
video; let me know when you're done, and as always, feel free to ask me any questions you might have
about how this program works!",,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-04, 13:17: Hello Dakota! So what did you think of the anchor video? The most recent
one I did was actually a complete flop! I wasn't expecting the type of questions they asked, and it
was done through Zoom, which meant awkward silences as they waited for me to respond. My usual
interview style is also to throw in a few jokes here and there, but this time it was definitely not
appreciated! So it was no surprise when I did not get the position. I think something important to
mention here though- the interview is also an opportunity for you to get to know your future
employer. So yes, it sucks that I didn't get the position, but do I really want to work with people
who take themselves super seriously all the time? The answer might be different for everyone, but
for me, it's a definite no. In fact, at my current job, I was asked two really easy questions, then
we spent the rest of the ""interview"" just chatting and joking around- my boss even mentioned during
the interview that it was mostly to see if I would fit in with their team; a few weeks later, I
definitely really enjoy my job and get along great with all my coworkers and my boss! Just keep in
mind that in most cases, the interview is for you and the employer to get to know each other- they
should already know what you've accomplished and what skills you have from your resume. If they ask
any bizarre questions that you aren't prepared for, don't worry! They're usually just a way to gauge
your personality. Similarly, if you find yourself not getting along with the employer, then it's
also okay to take a step back and decline should you be offered a position. As always, let me know
if you have any further questions, or if you'd like to complete an extension activity first!Mentee
2021-12-07, 14:40: I think the tips are great in the videoMentor 2021-12-08, 00:52: The video is
definitely a great starting point for doing well in interviews :) Did you want to complete the
resume or the job interview practice extension activities? I think the resume one could be fun, we
can go over some example templates and whatnot, if you don't have enough time to come up with your
own resume. The job interview practice one has less involvement from me, but of course I'd be happy
to help if you have any questions. Let me know which one you want to start with!Mentee 2021-12-08,

results were directed towards data analysis and things like that.Mentee 2021-11-30, 14:54: Hey, yeah
I've been interested in business for at least 3 years now and hopefully I get to go to UBC because
there's the economics classes. They also have economics classes in Kamloops at TRU so I'm not sure
where I want to go but, Vancouver is way nicer so I'd most likely want to go there. I also want to
do a trades course just so I have another career choice to fall back on. I just got a job in the
meat department at a grocery store so maybe I'll take a class to get a butcher certifcate or study
civil engineering in the future, but right now I like learning about business. That's cool that you
got to see a real trial happen, I went on a field trip to Victoria once and I got to see everything
inside of the Victoria Parliament Building. Also do you have any plans for what you're going to do
once you finish your courses at UBC?Mentee 2021-12-01, 13:08: Hey, that program sounds interesting.

just looking at it right now.Mentee 2021-12-13, 14:55: Hey, I justed watched the videos and the
percentages of what everything costs was pretty much what I thought it would be. I thought groceries
would cost more though. I've been thinking about where I should live if I stay where I am for
University because living at home would be more cost efficient but if I go to UBC then I would
probably have to live in the dorms because Vancouver is super expensive but I also have friends in
Vancouver I could live with. What do you do for housing? also do you know how much the dorms are at
UBC?Mentor 2021-12-13, 15:23: Hey Cole, personally I am living at home and commuting to UBC.
Fortunately I am quite close to campus (10 minute drive and 30 minute bus), but I know people who
commute from much further away and takes them up to 3 hours every day to get to and from campus.
Housing can definitely be pretty expensive, most likely in the 10k range. The food situation is not
great to be honest. I know that a lot of people complain that the food at the residences are below
average but the residence food is the cheapest option. The restaurants and fast food options on
campus are decent but very expensive. I usually try to eat at home before or after classes because
of the price.Mentee 2021-12-14, 13:20: Hey, 3 hours is a long way for sure. Is the 10k for housing
for the whole year? Also what's residence food? I'd just cook and make my own food because grocery
stores are cheaper compared to fast food. Isin't it super hard to get into UBC dorms too?Mentor
2021-12-15, 17:05: Hey Cole, Im not 100% sure but I think that the 10k is for the whole year. Dont
quote me on that :). What I meant by residence food is the cafeteria food the some of the residences
have. At some residences they have meal plans where they get money they can spend at these
cafeterias (and select few restaurants on campus), and others there is no meal plan as you get a
kitchen in your dorm. Im not that familiar with the whole process as Im living at home so all of
this info is what Ive heard from friends that live on campus. For first year students I think that
almost everyone gets a room. Its only for second year students that it is really hard to get a dorm.
If I wanted to get a dorm for second year I would have had to get in the waitlist in september to
even have a chance. The waitlists are thousands of students long so that might be what you are
hinting at by saying htey are hard to get into. If you choose to live on campus you shouldn't have a
problem getting a dorm room. Which residence you get is a different topic that you can look at later
bc some are high in demand for various reasons.Mentee 2021-12-16, 16:43: Hey, ok that makes sense.
It seems like food costs a lot more in a year compared to housing and tuitiion. How do you pay for
everything? Do you have saved money or is there another way to do things like getting a school loan?
Because I'm not sure how I'm supposed to pay for everything during University. I want to get a
degree in economics hopefully, but what kind of jobs require a degree because some entrepreneurs
ended up dropping out and just self learned business. Also my christmas break starts this weekend so
I'll talk to you in the new year, cheers.Mentor 2021-12-17, 01:37: Hey Cole, the way that you pay
for your tuition and housing is different depending on your situation. If you are paying yourself,
using your saved money or taking out a student loan are both options. There are also tons of
different scholarships that you can apply for which can be helpful in paying for tuition. A lot of
times the degree you get is just a name that goes on your transcript. The skills that you learn and
the people that you make connections with in your degree and at Uni are really important as well.
It's all up to you what you decide yo do! Have a great break, relax, distress and we will talk
later.Mentee 2022-01-10, 13:08: Hey KostaMentor 2022-01-12, 18:01: Hey Cole, I hope you enjoyed your
break! How is everything going with school for you? Are you online? How is your career connections
course going to work from here on out? Let me know if there are any changes to the way that we have
approached it thus far! Cheers, KostaMentee 2022-01-13, 15:03: Hey, my break was great thanks for
asking. We aren't online yet so we are still in class for now but I think I'm ready to move on to

I thank you for that. I'm ready to move on to the wrapping up section",,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 17:33: Hi Cole, I am going to be your mentor throughout this program! I noticed
that you are interested in stocks and potentially creating your own business. That awesome as I am
also interested in business and stocks. A few of my close friends have actually started their own
businesses. I am currently studying in a program at UBC that covers many aspects of business. I also
find it interesting to follow the stock market. I just wanted to reach out and connect before the
program officially starts. Feel free to ask me any questions that you may have. Cheers, KostaMentee
2021-11-15, 13:59: Hey, we just started the program today. That's super cool that your friends own
businesses, I want to start a business when I'm older and get into real estate. I've thought about
going to UBC because I know my way around Vancouver very well. But I haven't looked into the courses
yet. I'm supposed to share a quote I like and a picture I think is cool. I like the quote ""I'd
rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right"" because I'm a big dreamer but I'm also
willing to work for my dream because good things don't always come so easy. New York I think this
picture is cool because I love New York and want to visit there one day. I like rain too and mixed
with New York City is amazing to look at I think.",,"Mentor 2022-01-24, 19:41: Hey Cole, sounds good I just opened up the wrapping up tab!",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-29, 19:18: Hey Cole, those are some pretty interesting potential professions. In
terms of lawyers and the law, I took a Law 12 course in high school which was pretty informative. We
got to go on a field trip to the BC law courts to watch real trials happen. Engineering is a career
that alot of people strive to get into. I personally think its really interesting learning about how
things work and how to build them. My dad has a bachellors degree in Civil engineering. He later
moved into hydroelectrical engineering which is what he got his masters in. I dont know if I
mentioned to you yet but I am currently studying international economics at UBC. It involves
business, commerce, economics, and data analysis. I find it really interesting and by the time I
graduate I will have learned about a broad range of subject areas. I think that its great that you
already are looking at potential careers that might interest you. Those careers all seem like great
options. Have you considered looking at universities that have programs tailored to what you are
looking for in a career? Check out BIE at UBC if you want to be an economist. UBC has a great
engineering program but the only downside is the first year is general admission so everyone studies
the same courses. The second year is where you get to choose what type of engineering you want to go
into but what you want is not guaranteed. People who have the highest GPA's usually get to have
first dibs. Law I am honestly not too sure about it since I never considered studying it in
University. I know this is alot of information so let me know if you have any questions, I would be
happy to clarify anything. CheersMentor 2021-11-30, 17:47: Hey Cole, as of right now, I am
interested in pursuing a career in finance that incorporates economics. I am currently working as an
intern for a company where they work alongside small businesses and teach them key topics for
starting a business. Next year, I am going to apply to the Co-op program at UBC. This is a program
where you take a term off from your studies and work for a company. This extends your degree but it
allows you to get valuable work experience (and get paid) in return. A lot of people have highly
recommended Co-op to me. I cannot speak to it as I have not dot it but it sounds like an interesting
opportunity. So to answer your question, not completely. I don't have an exact idea of what I want
to do after my bachellors degree. I think that its great that you have so many interests and as you
have more experiences, you will refine what your passion truly is. Cheers, KostaMentor 2021-12-01,
14:07: Hey Cole, a popular economics book that might interest you is Freakonomics. I personally
haven't read it but my prof as well as many other people that I know have highly reccomended it. It
might be worth a try!Mentee 2021-12-09, 11:44: Hey, everythings going good. I dont think I have any

jobs including your favourite major For Work Preference, I got ""Manufacturing Managers"" or

you that it's the only quiz that had the result match my major, which is something that related to
""Information System Analysts"" or ""Computer Programmers"". I am quite satisfied with it You know what,
those quizzes just help you refer to many different jobs, which are outside of the major that you

again! ^^ You are doing a great job! And I'm glad you shared your thoughts with me I think this
section is very useful because it will help you to be more certain about your career direction in
the future. And it's good that you went through it :D. Oh! I think you might have seen 2 videos
already, right? Then, What do you think about the two characters in the 2 videos above? Can you
guess why did the speakers in the two videos choose their careers (based on the values they
expressed)? I think you might know that we always have a lot of reasons to help us pursue something.
Like myself, for example. I pursued Computer Science because I enjoyed working with technology and
math. I love the challenges that Computer Science presents and it makes me feel so proud if I can be
able to overcome those challenges. I also want that one day, I can create useful and interesting
technology products for everyone. ^^ How about you? Are those values the same as how you chose to
pursue the Trades and Mechanics industry? Don't hesitate to share with me your story! I'd love to
hear from you! ^^Mentor 2022-01-10, 20:37: Hi Anthony! I hope you had a safe and happy Christmas as
well as New Year! I think you're back to school and I hope you enjoyed it. I know we had a very long
vacation, so how was yours? Personally, I really enjoy that time, especially being with family and
friends. I had a lot of fun spending Christmas and New Year here. Can you share with me your
interesting stories during Christmas and New Year break? I'm sure you had a lot of fun times with
everyone, didn't you? ^^Mentee 2022-01-17, 12:40: uh went and did the normal backcountry

great to go snowmobiling this season, isn't it? I also wish to experience snowmobiling once like
you. However, I think I'll be able to experience it at some point in the future, I'm sure it'll be
fun ^^ How was your first week back at school? I think it's both fun and busy, right? My first week
back at school was fun but also very busy. However, no matter what, remember to take care of your

There's one thing that I think your teacher might have already told you! That is our program will
end after Friday of this week :( That means our work through Mentor City will end. I really feel
sorry for you that I wasn't able to help you finish your assigned work here, but I cherish every
moment I spend time with you. I really appreciate that you still take your time to come here every
week, it's something that makes me very happy. ^^ Actually, You know what? We can still work and
chat through Mentor City even though the time has passed. It's just, Anthony, Would you like to work
with me more? I think this time we can discuss the topics that you want, so think about that and let

I definitely find it helpful as I already do some of the mentioned studying techniques. I always
study at least 2 weeks in advance for any tests, although usually I always try study one month in
advance to give myself ample time to prepare for everything. This also prevents me from cramming and
being stressed last minute. With that said, it’s very important for me to plan out my schedule early
as well, so I know exactly when I need to start studying. Having a calendar either online or written
down has always been helpful to me. Another technique I have is using active recall. Although it’s
important to review notes or write them out, it would benefit you even more if you can remember
things in broader terms, but also be able to recall the details that go along with them. For
example, for each lesson I have, I would write out the notes as review. After having my notes, I
would create a mindmap or a flow chart that summarizes the lesson. I would only broadly summarize
the lesson with these flow charts, and I would try to recall all the other details when I look at
the flow chart. This helps me see the bigger picture and understand concepts better. Lastly, an
advantage of studying early is that you’ll be able to find out what you have questions earlier. This
gives you time to get the help you need. I always take advantage of office hours where I am able to
go to the professor or the teaching assistant to ask them questions. Remember, there are no dumb
questions!It is always better to ask than to assume. Let me know what kind of studying tips you use
and what you think might be helpful! Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers, ChristineMentor
2021-11-28, 16:03: Hi Anna, Hope you are doing well! I missed having conversations with you! I was
wondering if everything is okay? Let me know :) Cheers, ChristineMentee 2021-11-30, 17:33: Hey
Christine, I hope you’re having a good day! I’m sorry, I haven’t replied for a while. I focused a
lot of my class time on a website called Chatter High. I don’t know if you heard of it. Basically,
it asks you a bunch of questions about post-secondary education and you get points for correct
answers. There is currently a competition running and I wanted to do well in it. It worked out and I
won some prizes, but I realized I didn’t balance my time very well, so I will try to do that more
moving forward. I hope you’re not too upset. I watched the video and here are my thoughts on it: I
think planning your time out and not cramming before a test makes a lot of sense. When you want to
be more fit it also doesn't help to just train for 5 hours in one day and then not at all for two
weeks. When you’re less stressed you also have a better feeling about taking the test. Here in
Canada I don’t have to write exams; only little tests. So I’m a bit scared that when I go back to
Germany, where I have to write big exams that count for my graduation grade, I won't be in the habit
anymore. That’s why I decided to gather a lot of information and knowledge on studying and different
methods. That way I can prepare for it. One study tactic that I learned about on YouTube and used a
few times in the past is writing questions for yourself and basically creating your own exam. Then
you let it be for a few days or a week and later try to answer the questions. This way you can see
very well how much you know and it also simulates the situation of taking an exam. I think this also
has to do with tip 5 where you try to recall anything you know about the topic without looking at
any notes. You just have the test in front of you and answer everything from memory. I like your
method for active recall. We’re currently studying WWI in Social Studies and I’m pretty sure we’re
going to write a test on it, so I will try it out. As I said, the test won’t be that big, but it
will be enough to give me a chance to try the method. Can you tell me a bit more about office hours?
I heard of them, but I’m not sure what they are exactly. How often are they? How much time do you
spend there? Is it just one person and the professor or multiple people? Do you do like a lesson
that the professor planned beforehand or do you ask your specific questions? Thank you in advance!
AnnaMentor 2021-12-05, 01:35: Hi Anna, Absolutely no worries! I was also a bit busy myself with
final projects. But I'm really happy to hear that you won some prizes, congratulations! Time
management is definitely hard and I also struggle with it sometimes. I find it helpful when I write
out all my tasks in a planner or on a notepad on my laptop. It's just something visual so that I can
see what kind of tasks I have ahead and what I can do to complete them in advance. It's always a
satisfying feeling when I cross the tasks off ahead of schedule. Yes, your analogy to fitness
training is a very good example of why you shouldn't cram. Your brain also works in a similar way.
You can try to cram all that information in 24 hours, but you won't be able to retain all the
information. A good way for you to prepare for bigger exams is to review your class material
regularly. Sometimes it's easy to forget what you learned after taking small tests/quizzes. It's
important to go back and review what you have learned before, so you won't be as overwhelmed for the
big exam. Your strategy about writing questions for yourself is definitely a good strategy and is
related to the active recall. I think creating a storyline for yourself on WWI might be helpful in
helping you memorize the important events in chronological order. Good luck! Office hours are
usually when a professor or a teaching assistant (TA) allows students to meet with them either in
person or online to ask them any questions about class. Usually, there are held once a week at the
same time, but you are allowed to ask them for an alternative time if your schedule doesn't work
with theirs. Sometimes you can expect many students in office hours when it is close to final or
midterm exams. Other times it is usually just one or two students. It is definitely much easier to
ask questions if there are only a few students, so you don't have to wait around for your turn.
Although, I know some students go without asking questions because they like to listen to other
students' questions. It's definitely valuable to listen to what other students have questions about
because you might not have thought about it yourself yet. Usually, I write down questions on the
side when I am reviewing my lectures and notes. Sometimes I would have 5-6 questions prepared to
ask, other times just 1-2. It really is up to you how you want to ask questions. I just feel more
prepared when I have the questions ready so I don't make the TA or professor wait for me to think of
a question. I try to go regularly so I don't have questions piled up till the end. I also ask them
through email when I can't attend in person. Although it depends on how fast your professor or TA
replies, sometimes it's better to just go in person. Hope that explains how office hours work a bit
more! :) Have a great rest of your weekend! Cheers, ChristineMentee 2021-12-07, 14:49: Hello
Christine, I hope your projects went well. Thank you for your tips on time management and your
answer about office hours. I will keep them in mind. I struggle a bit with trying to decide what to
use as a calendar; a physical one, the one on my phone, google calendar, etc. I also use an App
called Notion a lot and have stuff like birthdays on there. Right now I have different dates across
different calendars. I really need to make my mind up and decide on one, so I can have them all in
the same place. Would you mind telling me what you normally use? Today it was also verified that
there will be a test on WWI before winter break, so I’m going to start preparing for that. Do you
know what we will do next? I never used Mentor City before and I’m not sure. I saw two Extension
Activities at the bottom. Maybe that’s the next step? Or there could be more pages to the Studying
Module? I hope you have more information. Talk to you soon! AnnaMentor 2021-12-12, 14:50: Hi Anna,
Hope you are doing well! Sorry for the delayed response, I am currently in the midst of final exam
season. Great question about how to stay organized! Since everyone has different preferences, I
recommend you test out a few different platforms before settling on one. Google calendar is a great
one if you know the dates to many future assignments, exams, or meetings etc. It's helpful in that
it reminds you to start assignments early. I also use Notion as well, although I mainly use it as a
to-do list and nothing fancy. For instance, you can assign a date to each task. You can then insert
a calendar view below to see those tasks placed on the calendar. There are many templates available
on Notion you can use. Try to search for Notion templates for school online. I find this one pretty
cute: https://janicern.notion.site/janicern/your-student-dashboard-d54c2b26ad814497b072696a650fc54d.
Although to be honest, I sometimes just prefer the notepad app on the laptop because it's simple. I
find that Notion can get a bit too complicated. But to each their own, it's better to find what
works best for you! If you are ready to move on to the next topic, let me know and I will select
""complete conversation"". You will then fill out an anonymous survey afterwards. In the meantime, you
can think about what topic you want to discuss next. After you have decided, let me know and I will
unlock the conversation for that topic! Cheers, ChristineMentee 2021-12-14, 13:40: Hey Christine,
Don’t worry I hope your exams are going well. I have only one week of school left. Then the winter
break begins. I like going to school, but I have to admit I’m happy to have a break for a while. I
wanted to ask you if we will continue the mentoring during the break. For me, it would be ok since
it doesn’t take that much time to work on it once in a while, but I don’t know how much you have
going on right now with your exams. So if you want to take a break to focus on it, that would be
totally fine with me. I saw that there are templates on Notion, but I found them a bit complicated
too and was scared off. I have a lot of pages on there, but most of them are just text and maybe a
bullet or to-do list. I also have a list of all the birthdays of my family and friends. I’ll try the
thing with assigning them a date and having a calendar view when I’m home. The template you send me
is so cute, especially the little animations. I didn’t know there were some online, I only saw the
ones in the app, so I have to search up some of them. I believe we can move on to the next topic.
Maybe Dis- and Misinformation? I wish you a nice day! AnnaMentee 2021-12-16, 12:35: Hello Christine,
I just wanted to tell you that I got an ""Exceeding"" on my test about WWI. Thank you for your help. I
hope your exams are going well too. Have a wonderful day! AnnaMentor 2021-12-18, 00:12: Hi Anna, I'm
so glad to hear that you did well on the test! Excellent work and I'm proud of you! Keep up the good
work :D Yes, I definitely need a break as well after my exams haha. I have a population genetics
final exam tomorrow, wish me luck! My last final exam is on the 22nd, so I might not be able to
reply until after that, I hope that is okay with you but I will try my best. Also, I am totally
happy to continue our conversations throughout the break! I will open up the topic for dis- and
misinformation. Feel free to go over the material first and comment on what you think, I will be
able to look at it after my last exam. And in regards to the notion template, I know it's so cute
right! You can also customize the paw icon. If you just search up any gif and copy the image URL,
you can replace it. Notion definitely allows you to customize a lot of things, but it's easy to get
distracted on there. Anyway, I hope you have a wonderful night and I will talk to you soon! Cheers,
ChristineMentee 2021-12-20, 17:16: Hello Christine, of course, it is ok if you finish your exams
first and I wish you the very best. I see that the Dis- &amp; Misinformation module is open, so I
will get to that soon. I think I’ll also go over my Notion pages and make them a bit more pretty now
that I have more time. Again good luck with your final exam! Anna","Mentor 2022-01-20, 23:49: Hi Anna, The conversation of respecting different ways of knowing and the
risk of getting stuck in only one way of understanding is very relevant for someone who is currently
residing on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Musqueam people. This means
that the land was never given up by the Musqueam people and I am a mere settler on their land. We
often hear the land acknowledgment first thing in presentations, however is not further explored
beyond the statement. In my first and second year of university, my knowledge of the Indigenous
community felt reduced to the short land acknowledgement. I'll admit that I could've taken more
initiative to learn more but I was generally not aware and none of my peers really knew much either.
There is a significant difference between truly acknowledging the land by understanding the values
and struggles of the Indigenous community compared to simply knowing that we are on their land. It's
important to try and broaden our understanding when the information provided to us is limited.
However, it is also crucial to note that we will never be able to fully understand the perspective
of the Indigenous community, as we all come from different backgrounds. This relates to the first
question of the difference between studying the land and living on the land. When we study the land,
we look at things from a third-person perspective and play the role of an observer or a spectator.
However, the Indigenous people that have lived on the land have rich historical, traditional, and
cultural knowledge that has been passed down to them for generations. They possess scientific and
innovative knowledge that we might not fully understand. Nonetheless, this does not give us the
right to determine what is right or wrong and their way of knowing should be respected. This is
exemplified in current Western medicine as they integrate the learning of Indigenous medicine
instead of outright rejecting their traditional practices. There are ways to introduce different
properties of cultural practice to create inclusivity in healthcare. I believe that all cultural
knowledge should be respected equally because they provide comfort to people from different
backgrounds. Let me know what you think and feel free to answer the guiding questions on the top.
Don't hesitate to ask any questions. Cheers, ChristineMentee 2022-01-25, 16:57: Hello Christine, I
heard the saying that we’re on the land of the Secwépemc people multiple times now too, but I
realized I also don’t know much about this group. It was kind of weird because I was preparing for
my year abroad and the organization told me I would go to Kamloops. I never heard of this city
before. Then some time later the news came that the mass grave at the residential school was found
and we saw that it was in Kamloops. That was the first time I heard of the city. And then a while
later I was actually there and saw the old building. While I went to school here I learned about the
general history and struggles of the indigenous community, but I haven’t learned much about the
specific group. There is a map that shows the territory of different native groups around the world:
https://native-land.ca/. On it, you can see very well that basically all of Canada is native land
even though nowadays only a fraction is actually given to them. I think it’s important to take
traditional knowledge into account. Indigenous people have done a way better job of living in
balance with nature. They make sure that they don’t take too much from it and thereby destroy it
like we unfortunately did. Anyway, I wish you a nice day! AnnaMentor 2022-01-27, 02:43: Hi Anna, The
news about the unmarked graves of Indigenous children from residential schools definitely shocked
many and was a dark moment for humanity. However, this was also a moment of reckoning and an
opportunity for all Canadians to reflect on how society has treated indigenous people. As settlers
on their stolen land, we really aren't doing much in their favour. How Indigenous communities are
treated must change and it should start by respecting their knowledge and way of life. I agree with
you that Indigenous people have done a much better job at maintaining and cultivating their land. It
must be devastating to see your homeland being destroyed without having a voice. Given the
opportunity, we should try our best to uplift and support the indigenous community as best as we
can. For instance, a club I am part of raised money for the aboriginal health society here in
Vancouver last year by holding fundraisers. I also heard that school ends next week for you? Please
correct me if I'm wrong. Time really flew by these past few months and it has been a pleasure
talking to you! It surprised me that you only came back to school for a month and then you get to
have a summer break. I have to say I'm quite jealous. I still have a couple of months of school
left. Anyway, let me know if you'd like to move on to the next subject and/or how you'd like to move
forward. Hope you have a great day! ChristineMentee 2022-01-28, 21:30: Hey Christine, I'm very
grateful that I was able to learn about the history and mistreatment of the Indigenous community
because honestly, I didn't know much about it until I came here. I'm glad I took Social Studies.
Some of my friends who are also international students from Germany said Social Studies is kind of
unnecessary because you learn all about Canada and then you back home and the knowledge doesn't
really help you. But I think it's never wrong to learn more about the history of another country
even though it might not be as relevant to your later life. Our semester does end next week. We have
our last day on Monday and then Tuesday is a catch-up day where you only have to go to school if you
have missing work. But we don't have summer break after that. Instead on Wednesday, the second
semester begins. I think it's kind of weird too. Only having school for one month after winter break
and then the second semester starts in the middle of the week. The E-Mentoring is part of my Careers
class which will be over next week, so I think this will also stop. It's kind of a weird ending, but
I really enjoyed talking to you and thank you for your tips and time. I know you're doing this as a
volunteer. Anyway, I hope you're doing great! AnnaMentor 2022-02-01, 00:59: Hi Anna, I agree with
you that even though we come from different backgrounds, what matters is that we are here in Canada
right now and we should be more mindful of the land we are currently on. Hopefully, your friends
will come to appreciate learning about Canada when they look back on the time they were here! Ohh
okay I see. I thought it was quite weird to have summer break this early on when it's still so cold.
That makes more sense that you're starting term 2 afterwards. That's quite interesting, I've never
heard of a school system like yours. I'm sure they have their reasons for dividing up the terms like
this. I'm not sure if we have time to discuss another topic since your class is ending. I have to
say I really enjoyed my time as a mentor and I think you're an amazing mentee to work with! :) This
was also my first time mentoring. I'd love to know if you have any feedback for me or things you
think I can improve on as I continue to mentor other students. I am open to anything! I think the
last step will be completing the wrapping up survey, I believe you'll be able to provide your
feedback there. Talk to you soon! Cheers, Christine",,"Mentor 2021-12-27, 05:43: Hi Anna, Sorry for taking a while to get back to you, but I hope you had a
wonderful Christmas break! The topic of misinformation and disinformation is very relevant in this
day and age because of how rampant things can spread on social media. To answer the guiding
questions: How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on
social media? Emotions play a large role in what we look at and that is also how media outlets
target their audience. They would usually use very exaggerated language that heightens the situation
that is untrue only to garner attention. However, I usually look out for news that have bold claims
without citing any sources. When news do not cite their sources, it is highly likely that it is fake
news. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by
misinformation? I'd say I am a careful consumer of media content because I always try to fact-check
as much as I can. Not long ago one of my friends shared a post and it stated that North Korea banned
laughing for 11 days to mourn the death anniversary of Kim Jun Un's father. I was intrigued by this
statement and I clicked into the post to learn more. However, upon reading the comments I realized
that it was fake news. If I didn't click into the post to learn more, I would've believed it and
might've told my friends about it, causing misinformation. If you do a google search about this
story, there are countless media outlets that covered the same thing without citing any credible
source. It is truly scary not knowing the amount of fake news that circulates around us. We must
always be careful about what we see on social media. What are your experiences of pointing out
misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false
information? Personally, I think I may have corrected people about misinformation but in a casual
conversation that is non-confrontational. For instance, if my friend told me about a story that I
knew was false, I would simply tell them that what they're saying is not true. It is much more
simple to correct your friends or family about misinformation, although it is harder to influence
other media outlets to take down fake news because they thrive on people's reactions. How important
do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student? These
critical thinking skills about digital media are crucial as a student because they can influence how
we view certain things that can negatively impact us. For instance, at the beginning of the
pandemic, there were numerous outlets skeptical of the vaccine and claimed that it caused numerous
health defects without citing any scientific sources to prove them. These media outlets were simply
spreading fear and feeding on the public fear of the uncertainty of the new vaccines. There were
also many other media news that downplayed the severity of covid-19. Therefore, it is crucial for us
to do our own research and fact-check, instead of completely trusting what we see on social media.
Without thinking critically, fake news regarding the coronavirus and the pandemic can jeopardize our
health and the people around us. Let me know what you think after answering these guiding questions
and if you have ever encountered any fake news before and how you dealt with them. Cheers,
ChristineMentee 2022-01-11, 13:39: Hello Christine, the winter break ended and yesterday was my
first day back at school. Over the winter break, my work ethic went down horribly and I got almost
nothing done, even though I planned for a lot. To make sure I don’t continue like this I made a page
on Notion where I can organize my classes and see when things are due. I set myself the goal to
reply to you in a maximum of 2 days going forward. I hope I can keep it and I’m sorry that I left
you waiting. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the questions: How much of a role do your emotions play
in what you choose to click on and share on social media? I agree with you that emotions play an
important role in the content we consume. In the video, they also said to be skeptical if an article
makes you angry because that is an often-used tactic. I also heard of the term “confirmation bias”.
It describes when you already have an opinion about something and don’t want to see information that
disagrees with that, so you only search for evidence supporting your beliefs and ignore any sources
that say otherwise. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been
drawn in by misinformation? I would say I’m pretty careful, but I have to admit I don't check
everything. After all, it gets exhausting looking up and verifying every piece of information you
encounter every day. Especially with things like Covid which changes all the time. I think a good
way is to find people, news channels, magazines, etc that you trust to be credible and get most of
your information from them. This way you can be pretty sure what you’re reading is correct and other
people do the fact-checking for you. What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to
others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false information? In April
2021 I worked in a doctor’s office for two weeks. They also did vaccinations. A lot of people
refused to be vaccinated with AstraZeneca despite it being incredibly hard to get an appointment.
Sometimes they got a phone call, were happy they got an appointment, heard it was with AstraZeneca
and then immediately hung up. How important do you think these critical thinking skills about
digital media are for you as a student? I think it is very important because students are younger
and not as experienced in the world, therefore we are more likely to believe something, especially
when someone older than us that we look up to says it. But even an authority figure can sometimes be
wrong and we shouldn’t believe everything without a question. You also need critical thinking skills
when you do projects and have to research the information on your own. Thankfully my school website
has a list of databases and websites with scientific articles. When you search through them, the
chance is high that the information is trustworthy. Something I heard about recently and that I
found interesting is a social media “bubble”. On social media apps like Instagram and TikTok, there
are algorithms that analyze what videos you look at and what kind you give a like. This way they
find out your interests and then show you more and more content that is similar to that. This is
great because then you don’t see irrelevant content, but it also means that you exist in a bubble
and sometimes only see a thing from one perspective because the algorithm knows you like that side.
Anyway, I wish you a nice day! AnnaMentor 2022-01-13, 23:49: Hi Anna, Great to hear back from you
and I hope you had a great winter break! I can really relate to you on the decreased work ethic
during break, but sometimes a break is really what we need to get us back on track! Although I can't
say I followed this strategy that much during break, but one thing I planned was to do at least one
hour of work each day. This sounds like nothing compared to the amount of work we do during school,
but I have to say that was still hard when my brain was on break mode. I applaud you for taking
action and creating the Notion sheet to stay organized though! It looks like you'll be able to
clearly track your assignments, great work! You definitely have a good grasp of understanding of the
potential harm of mis/disinformation. Finding a credible source you can follow is definitely a great
way to leave the fact-checking to them, but it's also good practice to take all information with a
grain of salt as you still have the best judgment for choosing where to get information. I see that
you got to experience some AstraZeneca skeptics firsthand. There were definitely lots of rumours
about the negative (potentially deadly) health impacts of the AZ vaccine. People also tend to
amplify the truth, by saying the vaccine will develop complications when in fact they only occurred
in extremely rare cases. The topic of disinformation around vaccines is definitely something that
needs to be dissected and researched more in the future. I really enjoyed reading all your responses
and I couldn't agree more with you. I have confidence in you that you have the critical thinking
skills to spot information that is truthful and ones that are not. Regarding social media bubbles,
the algorithms used are indeed powerful and can be dangerous. There has been a large controversy
where Facebook was accused of inciting violence in different countries not just in America. Notably,
if you remember the insurrection at the Capitol encouraged by Trump due to the election around a
year ago. Aside from Trump encouraging people to fight back, Facebook was used as a platform to
encourage political violence and did nothing to stop people. I have a few sources below if you want
to read more about the impact of Facebook on politics.

know if you have any further questions or anything you want to discuss. You can also pick a new
topic if you'd like. Hope you have a great rest of the week! Cheers, ChristineMentee 2022-01-17,
12:06: Hello Christine, I'm happy to talk to you again. My winter break was really good and I hope
you enjoyed yours too. I like the idea of working an hour every day because it makes you feel
productive and then you can relax the rest of the day without feeling guilty. I’m so happy I made my
Notion page. It’s just good to have everything in one place. About the AstraZeneca misinformation, I
think a lot of people are just scared. When I got my vaccine there was a sheet I had to read through
and sign and it did sound pretty terrible while you read it because it stated every possible
condition the vaccine may cause. In the end, I just had a hurting arm. It’s hard deciding what to
believe in when everyone says something different. Back when there was still a discussion about
whether children can get the vaccine or not, different doctors in the clinic I go to had different
opinions. Thank you for the articles you sent me. We just watched the documentary “Social Dilemma”
in class which talked about similar topics. There is also a problem currently going on on TikTok
where they often take the wrong things off their platform. For example, accounts that spread hate
stay up, but if someone speaks out against them it gets taken down for hate speech. I wish you a
nice day! Talk to you soon! AnnaMentee 2022-01-17, 12:12: I forgot to say if you don't have anything
more that you want to discuss in this module we could do the next one. I think ""Different Ways of
Knowing"" would be interesting.Mentor 2022-01-20, 22:23: Hi Anna, Sounds good! I will open up the
discussion for ""Different Ways of Knowing"". Don't forget to complete the survey for this discussion
and I'll see you in the next one! Cheers, Christine",,,"Mentor 2021-11-12, 14:04: Hi Anna! Nice to meet you! My name is Christine, my preferred gender
pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am super excited to be your new mentor for the year! :) Just for a
short introduction about myself, I am currently a 4th-year biology student at UBC Vancouver and I
moved here from Taiwan to attend university. I love everything about research and I am currently in
the lab waiting for a treatment to be completed for mouse embryonic fibroblasts. I have more details
in my bio, so feel free to check that out! I hope you can tell me about yourself, your hobbies, and
what your favourite classes are. You can also share with me anything you’d like! :) One newly found
favourite quote of mine is from Vincent Van Gogh. It is ""Love many things, for therein lies the true
strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love
is done well."" I think this is such a beautiful quote, especially the last part about what is done
in love is done well. Let me know what you think!Mentee 2021-11-15, 15:51: Hello Christine, I'm very
happy to meet you! I'm Anna and my pronouns are she/her. Your research sounds very exciting. Maybe
you could tell me what a day in your life right now looks like. I was born in Germany and lived
there my entire life. Now I came to Canada for Grade 10. Then I will go back to Germany and
graduate. After this, my dream job would be to become a surgeon. Other careers I'd be interested in
are something in the area of science (like you) or programming. My favourite class right now is Web
Development. We're currently learning how to use a program called Blender to make 3D Models. My
favourite classes overall are Biology and Math (I'm one of the few people who actually enjoy doing
Math). Next semester I will be able to take an Anatomy class which I'm extremely happy about. I also
just started curling here and I'm really like it so far. A quote I like is ""Speak your mind even if
your voice shakes"". I think it is originally from Maggie Kuhn. I like it because at times I find it
hard to stand up for things. I think I don't have the perfect arguments or comebacks or my
vocabulary is not big enough. The quote reminds me that it is important to say something even if
you're scared or afraid that your expression is not perfect. My favourite food is called
""Milchreis"". The literal translation is milk rice. It is especially good in the winter because it
warms your stomach. You can eat it with cinnamon and sugar or with hot cherries. I hope you're
having a good day and I look forward to speaking to you! AnnaMentor 2021-11-16, 19:07: Hi Anna, It's
so cool that you're from Germany! I guess you just moved here very recently then? It's so awesome
that you already know what you want to do and I support that all the way :) Being a surgeon is not
easy, but I am sure you have what it takes to become one! I wish I took a web development course in
high school too. My first introduction to computer science was in university actually and I
absolutely loved it. It made me consider changing my major to computer science, but I didn't end up
doing it. Wow! I wish I also enjoyed math but unfortunately, I don't haha. If you enjoy math and
computer science, that will definitely benefit you in the long run. Thanks for sharing your
favourite food and quote! Milchreis sounds super yummy, I wonder if they have that in Vancouver. I
loved the quote you picked. It's definitely hard to speak up sometimes when you are afraid that you
don't have the evidence you need. However, sometimes it is still important to speak your mind in
order to spark important conversations that could lead to more awareness of the things you believe
in. To answer your question about my day-to-day schedule, currently, these two weeks will be very
tough for me because I have two very big presentations this Thursday and Friday as well as 4 project
papers due next week. Juggling research between coursework is no easy task. Since I am working with
a PhD student for my research, I told her that I am a bit overwhelmed for this week so I cannot go
in every day. For this week, my plan is to go in on the weekend to finish my work in the lab.
Usually, when I am not piled with work, I would finish my lectures and go into the lab for around an
hour. After I finish lab work, I would spend the rest of the day studying and preparing for other
coursework. Hope that gave you a better idea of what I do! I saw that you wanted to work on the
Studying topic, so I will go unlock that for you now :) Thank you and I hope your day is going well
too! Cheers, Christine",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-02, 16:18: Hi Anna, Thank you for being such a great mentee by sharing your

welding. However, I think no matter the job, being respectly, open minded, and hardworking can go a
long way! In addition, having good communication skills could be an asset. As a welder you might be
working alone, but if you're working in a team, consider what sort of skills you might need
(communication, empathy, understanding, etc). In terms of resume examples, I did a bit of a Google
search and you might find this link helpful: https://zety.com/blog/welder-resume-example . Let me

reply! I was caught up with exams and my notifications got very cluttered. Of course this is no
excuse, but I will do my best to reply on time in the future, and if not, I will let you know in
advance if I become very busy. For interviews, I think the first step is researching on the specific
company you are applying for. This gives you a good idea of what sort of skills to use. For example,
if you are applying for a job as a teacher, it might be good to do research on which school, their
curriculum, the courses they offer, and then mention the key skills they might be looking for! :) An
interview story I have involves my first group interview! It was super nerve wracking and because
all of us were interviewed at the same time, I couldn't help but compare myself and think I was
lacking compared to the other applicants. The group intervew was game based, so it tested skills
like teamwork, communication, and leadership through team games. But surprisingly, I got the job! I
was pleasantly surprised, and that was probably the most memorable group interview I'd had. Looking
forward to hearing from you, Rebecca.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

two paths I will very likely follow! In the two videos we watched, the speakers chose carrers based
on some of their values. What were they're values and why did they match with the carrer they
chose?Mentee 2021-11-23, 21:33: In the videos there core values were helping peaple in there

job: I am pasionate about selflessness, and love to interact with people. I like science and enjoy
learning about how the human body works, as well as how to fix it when it stops working. So a
science career suits me well, and more specifically carrers like physiotherapy and medicine are
really apealing. Even more than that my values and strengths in science and willingness to help,

plan is a must. My mum always tells me that if you want to do something, you will find a way to do
it and I really do beleive that. So stick to your motorcross goals, but always know that a plan b is
ready just in case something happens. Just to tie everything together: More than just your love for
helicopters and motorcross, what are some values and stregnths that you have that would make those
carrers good for you. Like for example: are you good under pressure, both of those jobs hold a lot
of stress and quick decision making. Being a professional athelete in particular, takes a lot of

my last year of highschool. Comparative cultures is my favourite class because we have a lots of
interesting class discussions, and we just finished learning about ancient India. I love history,
and I watch a lot of historical movies and documentaires. I aslo love singing, and I go to singing
lessons every saturday. As a biology major do you learn more about humans or animals? What is life
like as a universty student?Mentor 2021-11-18, 00:44: Omg that’s so cool that you sing, I wish I
could but I’m not very musical (basically tone deaf lol). Also, I’m actually taking a class on
ancient India right now and it’s super interesting. As for a bio major, I learn more about
plants/animals which I find a lot of people don’t know a lot about so it’s often my go-to facts when
I’m talking to people. For me, I find University to be a lot like high school except it’s less
structured (so a lot of independent learning). There is also a lot more freedom to do what you want
and a lot of different things to do on campus like joining clubs. Are you excited about graduating
soon and possibly starting University?Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:14: I'm very nervous, and excited to
graduate, I can't believe I'm finally old enough to graduate lol. I'm not going to universty yet, I
want to take a gap year to figure out what I want to do with my life. Although unviersity life
sounds like fun, and I really want to go, I just want to figure out my career path first. I'm pretty
sure I want to work in the hospital, I've thought about being an obstercian, heart surgeon, or
nurse. I took biology 11 last year, and it was my favourite class becasue we learned about marine
animals. Now octopus, and starfish are my favourite animals, out of all the animals you've learned
about so far what is your favourite, and why?Mentor 2021-11-23, 19:16: My favorite animal that I've
learned about so far would be the sea cucumber. In my marine class, we got to dissect some and it
was very cool. Also, it's such a coincidence that you want to work in the hospital and one of your
potential career paths is a heart surgeon. I'm going to medical school next year to become a heart
surgeon lol. As for taking a gap year, a lot of my friends from high school did that and found it
really useful and it gave them a chance to gain some work experience and cash. Do you have any plans
for your gap year (e.g. working, traveling, etc.?Mentee 2021-11-24, 15:27: Sea cucumbers look really
cool, and a little gross, I don't know a lot about them. That's so cool that your going to become a
heart surgeon, I think the human heart is so fascinating. I like being able to help people, and
being a surgeon would be an amazing way to help people. In my gap year I want to work to safe money
for universty, but I also kind of want to safe money to go on a trip in the summer. I'm not sure
where I would go, it woud depend on how much I saved. But eventually I'd like to go to Europe, New
York, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Have you travelled anywhere? If you have what was it
like there? If you haven't travelled what place would you want to see?Mentor 2021-11-26, 17:27: I've
traveled to a lot of the different states like California, Florida, The Big Island, Maui, and
Waikiki. I've also been to Italy, England, and Scotland. Italy was a lot of fun especially the food,
and Scotland is really peaceful and quiet. But my favorite place I've traveled to is Australia and
New Zealand. The beaches and the wildlife there are amazing and it's so sunny and warm, it is
definitely somewhere I would recommend visiting. However, New York is somewhere that I really want
to travel to as well. Also, Tahiti/Bora Bora. Since you mentioned you want to work during your gap
year, do you have a job in mind or are you currently working?Mentee 2021-12-02, 13:38: Wow that
sounds amazing I wish could see all those places! I'd also love to go to Bora Bora too one day, the
pictures I've seen of it are gorgeous. I don't have a job right now I find it to stressful doing
school, and work at the same time. Do you have a job? If so how do you maintain doing your school
work, and job at the same time? I'm going to apply really anywhere like walmart, local libraries
(cause I love to read), Mc Donalds, or any other resturants.Mentor 2021-12-04, 16:59: I was the same
way in high school, I found it difficult juggling everything especially since I already had
extracurriculars. I do currently work as a lab technician at LifeLabs and I do various volunteer
work as well. I find that scheduling things using a calendar is really helpful. I tend to write
everything I have going on for the month out including homework, work, and volunteering and I make
sure that I communicate with all my different managers so they know what's going on. I think that as
long as you communicate and express when you are busy or feeling overwhelmed or just need a break
you will do fine. A couple of my friends worked at Mc Donalds and said that they were able to take a
lot of time off for school so maybe that would be a good place to start since there is
flexibility.Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:06: Thank you for the advice, it was super helpful. What do you do
working as a lab technician?Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:14: Sorry I sent the first message by accident
when I was still trying to type more lol. Do you have a good wage, and lots of work hours working as
a lab technician? How did you deicide that you were going to become a heart surgeon?Mentor
2021-12-09, 05:49: I help with COVID sampling/analyzing as well as virtual sampling for people who
are coming into or out of Canada. It's a pretty fun job and I make around $21 an hour and get to
choose my own hours which is really helpful with school. As for how I decided to become a heart
surgeon, it was actually my younger brother who kinda pushed me in that direction since he was born
with a VSD (ventricular septal defect), so I grew up learning a lot about it. What about you, what
are some reasons why you want to work in the hospital and in specific areas like obstetrics,
nursing, or heart surgery?Mentee 2021-12-09, 13:28: That's sounds like a really cool job, and thats
awesome that it's flexible for you. I'm so sorry about your brother, that is awful. I think it's
amazing that you want to become a heart surgeon because of that. When I was fifteen I shadowed my
grandma for the day, she was a pre-surgical daycare nurse, and I loved watching her help others,
like giving IV's, and asking them questions before going into surgery. I realized that I want to be
able to take care people the way my grandma did, so its a major reason why I want to go into the
medical field. I also find the human body, and how to fix it really interesting. I have considered
being an obstetrician because I love babies they are adorable, and helping bring life into the world
would be such an amazing thing to do.Mentor 2021-12-12, 22:39: I think it's really great that your
grandma played such a big role in why you chose healthcare and I absolutely agree babies are
definitely super cute lol. Have you thought about what schools you would want to apply to after your
gap year and what majors/minors you would do?Mentee 2021-12-13, 12:11: I've thought applying to
Selkirk college because I'd be able to live at home with my family rent free and I would be able to
see my family by going to college that's close to home. Another place I am thinking of is UBC in
kelowna because I want to be as close to home as possible, I also really like Kelowna so going to
school there would be great. As for my major, and minors I haven't really thought about what I would
do. What were your post secondary school options, and how did you decide you wanted to go to UBC?
Also do you go to UBC in Vancover or Kelowna?Mentor 2021-12-16, 15:11: Those sound like some good
options. I applied to UBC, U of T, McGill, and SFU. Originally I was going to go to McGill but when
it came to accepting the offer I didn't think I was ready to live on my own so at the last minute I
chose UBC Vancouver so I could be close to my family and just live at home. Also, if you're thinking
of going into medicine, I would recommend thinking about majoring in Arts and minoring in life
science. Although I'm a Bio major, I would have gotten a higher GPA if I was in Arts.Mentor
2022-01-06, 06:47: Also, I heard that this is no longer mandatory for you, so let me know if you
would like to continue talking :)Mentee 2022-01-10, 12:10: Hi, sorry it's been so long since I last
replied, I wasn't checking my emails during winter break so I never saw what you wrote. Thank for
the advice about what majors I should take. I'd like to keep talking with you as long as that's ok
with you. I hope you had a good winter break, and a happy new.Mentor 2022-01-12, 17:16: That's
awesome that you still want to continue talking!! How was your winter break?Mentee 2022-01-25,
14:05: Sorry it's been so long since I last replied. My winter break was really good, I did lots of
baking, and reading. I also went skiing a couple times with some friends. How was your winter
break?Mentor 2022-01-26, 13:52: No worries, you're probably really busy with school. I've always
wanted to try skiing or snowboarding but I never found time to go out and actually learn. Is it
hard? My winter break was good, I basically got caught up on my sleep and hung out with my friends
and family.Mentee 2022-01-26, 22:57: Skiing is so much fun. I'm not the greatest at skiing but it's
not that hard to ski. It's definitely worth trying especially because it's not only fun, the view is
gorgeous. That sounds like a good break, I honestly caught up on a lot of sleep too lol.Mentor
2022-01-29, 16:57: Now that school has started up I was wondering how this semester is going since I
think finals are coming up.Mentee 2022-02-09, 20:36: Sorry I haven't responded in so long I've been
busy with the semester change. I have anatomy, and physiology, precalculus, English, and a spare
block where I spend most of my time doing homework for my other classes. Do you still want to keep
talking? If not that's ok.Mentor 2022-02-10, 14:32: No worries it sounds like you have tough classes
this semester. And we can keep talking!!Mentee 2022-02-15, 10:48: Ok awesome. Yeah my classes are
pretty hard right now. My math teacher was sick, and so it was really confusing trying to understand
what the subs were trying to teach us. What classes do you have right now?Mentor 2022-02-16, 23:20:
Oh, that's too bad that your math teacher was sick. I always found learning from a sub difficult
since the teaching style is different than what I'm used to. I have 2 biology lab courses, an algae
lab course, an education course for helping kids with disabilities, and a medical terminology
course.",,"Mentor 2022-04-08, 16:58: It was really great talking to you! Hope you have a great future!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your studies and work. Now that you were connected with me as my mentee, I thought to mail you and
introduce myself. I am Arvind Tirkey. I was born and raised in India. I did my schooling, college,
and university studies (3 Masters courses) from three different Indian Universities. I have taught
as a high school teacher in different countries: India, Indonesia, South Korea, and now in Canada. I
have also taught at the University level as Lecturer in Geography in India, and Learning support
course at the University of Victoria (UVic) in Canada. Currently, I am a full time student at the
UVic and I moved to Canada only in June 2021. My wife, and two daughter (9yrs and 4yrs) are here
with me. I also have a Maltese dog who is only about 10 pounds. I am trying different jobs as a
part-timer so that I could continue with them in the future. I am loving the new environment and new
community here and it is great to be in this great country: Canada. I am looking forward to hear
from you and read about your life experiences and your future plans. I hope to hear from you soon.
Take care, ArvindMentor 2021-11-24, 17:38: Hello Morgan, I hope you are doing well. I sent you an

conversation about life, career, etc. I hope to hear from you soon. Take care, ArvindMentee
2021-12-07, 16:42: Hello Arvind, I am doing great thanks! I am sorry for not getting to you sooner,
I lost my password and just now found my login information. To introduce myself, I was born and
raised in the kootenay colombia area, I am currently attending JLcrowe highschool. In the future, I
would like to travel to different countries around the world like you have, I am also interested in
being an electriction through the trades program that selkirk offers and I am looking forward to our
discussions about future career options and any advice you have to offer. Best Regards, MorganMentor
2021-12-08, 13:51: Hello Morgan, It is great to hear from you. It is better late than never. Right?
It is nice to read the short introduction about yourself that you were born in Kootenay Columbia
area and currently studying at JLCrow High School. I am sure you must be getting awesome learning
opportunities at your school while interacting with your peers and wonderful teachers. I appreciate
you sharing with me your wishes of travelling around the world. Probably we should discuss this more
so you can plan something out for your future goals. What do you think? You are thinking about
becoming an Electrician. Of course, this is a good career option. But since you also want to travel
around the world using your professional skills, have you thought about getting some additional
skills/certifications/degrees that would supplement or complement the electrician skills you have
planned? I am sure you must be knowing that having multiple skills will help you have the edge over
other candidates, which would help you move to other countries where your skills will be needed and
welcomed. Let me know what do you think or have already planned something out, and we will go ahead
from there with our discussion. Thank you again for reaching out and starting the conversation.

Science. Let's have a lot of fun together chatting about life! A little more about me – I like
playing video games, writing, drawing, and watching Twitch, YouTube, and anime! It’s my dream to
make my own game and also write/draw my own webcomic. Here's a favorite motivational pic of mine (I
first saw it on Reddit): This turtle always makes me feel better when I compare myself to others.
It's a competitive world, but I think it's important to not be so hard on ourselves, and be proud
when we make any progress, even if it's not a lot. Finally - a favorite recipe! I only made it once
and it turned out great, even for someone like me who sucks at cooking hahaMentee 2021-11-22, 12:27:
Hi Maggie, Sorry for not getting back to you earlier, I had written a bunch of stuff, but
accidentally refreshed the page and all of it ended up getting deleted, oops. I am a highschool
student in grade 11, though I am still taking some grade 10 courses this year. The school I attend
is called SEEC, Saturna Ecological Education Center. It is located on the gulf island of saturna. My
fellow students and I (11 of us in total across grades 10 &amp; 11) take a ferry over to Saturna on
Sunday night, and return home on Wednesday afternoon. Some of my favorite things to do are play
games; board, card or video games. My favorite things to do in my spare time is, be out-doors, watch
Youtube, Twitch, and read manga. Here is my quote: This was a quote that was auto generated by an AI
called inspirobot: https://inspirobot.me/. Most quotes generated by it dont make any sense, some are
funny and very few are actually good. I like this one because it talks about how you can change
someone's world by spending time with them. Here is a photo that I took of the flowers on a small
heather bush on the top of a mountain.Mentor 2021-11-24, 00:35: Hey Finn! No worries about reply

and are able to watch the video! The video definitely has a lot of information packed into it but I
actually think it's really good. I already knew about some of those techniques and I still use them
literally every day for my school, but the video guy mentioned a few techniques I had never thought
of as well which I thought was pretty cool! Did he point out any techniques you already use? Did he
mention any that you think you'd be willing to try? I'm really excited about this module because
I've obviously done a ton of studying in my life and definitely have a lot more of it ahead of me as
well so I think its super cool to hear about some strategies I never even thought of before. I can't
wait to hear what you think!Mentor 2022-02-11, 16:27: Hey Asha I'm just checking in to make sure you
can see the studying module and see if you've had a chance to read through it yet! If you're busy
with other things it's no problem just let me know :)Mentee 2022-02-16, 16:29: Hi Maddy, sorry I
haven't messaged for a while. I hope your doing well. To study is to advance your knowledge, whether
it be by looking over information you have already learned or learning new information. The ways I
study are looking over my notes, re-writing them and using Cornell notes (word or concept and
definition). These are the ways I've been taught to study along with making flashcards. I haven't
used any of the skills in the video fully but I've used parts of them. I think they would all be
really good to try to see which ones work best for me. I think the writing and visual would be the
most useful for me because it gives you more than one way to look at a certain concept. I don't know
which ones wouldn't work well because I haven't really tried studying many different ways, but I'm
very open to trying in the future.Mentor 2022-02-16, 16:55: Hey Asha, no worries! My favourite study
method is to rewrite my notes as well! I find it helps make things a lot neater and easier to read
than the notes I take on the spot in class and I can organize it however I want which I also think
makes memorization easier. My other study tool I use which has been really successful for me is
trying to explain the concepts I'm studying to someone else in as much detail as possible. Doing
this really helps me find any holes in my understanding or areas that I thought I understood really
well but are actually still a little unclear to me. As well, it also helps me get an idea of how I
would prove my knowledge of a concept on a test with a written questions because sometimes I tend to
write too much and my answer isn't very clear, so practicing highlighting all the important points
when I'm explaining it to someone else really helps me with that. So if you haven't had a chance to
try that strategy I would definiely recommend it, especially if your teacher likes to have tests
with written questions because those are often a lot harder to answer than multiple choice questions
even if you feel like you know the answer.Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:23: Hi Maddy, your technique seems
like it would work really well! I'll give it a try next time I have to study for a test. I will work
on the activities for this unit over the next week or so and send you an email when I am done.Mentor

if I don't hear from you I'll assume you're taking some much needed time off for the week and

tenth grade at SEEC (Saturna Island Ecological Education Center). My favorite school subject is
science, because I really want to help the environment. I really love horses and horseback riding,
and also love playing ultimate frisbee but can not find a good team for high schoolers near where I
live. Here is a quote ""One must always be careful of book said Tessa, and what is inside of them,
for words have the power to change us."" -Cassandra Clare, Clockwork Angel. I really like this quote
because im a really big book person. I feel like this is very true books can really change you. I
have definitely read books that have changed they way I looked at life. Something I really like to
eat is any kind of quinoa salad. Its really good with anything in it, like mexican style, asian,
greek, or any other kind thing into it.Mentor 2021-11-09, 21:45: Hi Asha! It sounds like we have a
ton in common, I'm so glad! I obviously also love science but I also enjoy horseback riding too!
I've taken some lessons before and have been to a few horseback riding camps in montreal and it's
always been so much fun. I'm also really glad to hear you like to read because that is one of my all
time favourite things to do, and fantasy books like Clockwork Angel are my favourite kinds of books!
Have you read any other fantasy books like clockwork angel, or any of the other books in the
infernal devices series? My favourite series right now is a court of thorns and roses by sarah j
maas, have you read it?Mentor 2021-11-17, 20:33: Hey Asha :) Just checking in because I haven't

actually next up on my list of series to read! But I've read all the other sarah j maas books and i

I might have to give her books a try too.Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:05: hi, how are you doing? if you

massive cork farms. You are very knowledgeable about lots of stuff! That's super cool. I don't know
many younger students that are interested in history and spend their time looking into that stuff on
their own time. So I think that's super cool! What is Saturna Island like? I have never heard of it.
How many kids are in your school? Talk soon! TarynMentee 2022-02-07, 15:43: saturna island is
probably the nicest place on earth (in the summer), the are packs of wild goats that live on the
southern slopes of the island and leave very nice well packed trails that are amazing hikes if you
are not afraid of heights, there is not much infrastructure on the island only a general store and a
few roads one of witch is the 9th most deadly in BC, i would recommend visiting saturna island if
your into foraging wild berries, i love salmon berries and spent hours walking along the roads
eating them to my heart's delight, the school i go to is very unique from 9-5 we are in class but
from 5-12 we are basically on are own, i've been studying edible plants of the west coast for the
last year and can't wait for this spring/summer. Saturna island is probably the nicest place on the
coast and if you ever have the opportunity you should visit even just for the dayMentor 2022-02-09,
09:44: Wow that makes me want to get over to Saturna Island right away!!!!! I haven't even heard
anything about it so it seems to be a little bit of a hidden gem. You sound like a very mature
person for your age, I would really urge you to continue to read and be fascinated by life! I'm not
really sure which conversations to unlock because I haven't heard from your teacher. Do you
know?Mentee 2022-02-09, 16:37: i dont knowMentor 2022-02-24, 13:11: I think you just let me know
which topics interest you :) Which ones would you like to chat about? Paying for school? Ways of
knowing? Whatever you want, just let me know!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How's it been, shifting from homeschooling to going to high school in Vancouver? I'm in my third
year at UBC now, but I've been studying online from home for so long I still feel super new to Van.
Also - I love that you listed being a TV show writer as a possible career, it's something I really
want to do too. And I've just started reading Dune, so it's nice to know you liked it. Please tell
me more about yourself! What grade are you in? Also let me know if you have any questions. It's my
first time being a Mentor so I'm not too clear on all this myself, but we can figure it out
together. I'm looking forward to getting to know you! KetakiMentee 2021-11-09, 18:00: Hi Ketaki, I'm
doing great! How are you? It has been odd switch from homeschooling to S.E.E.C. which is a little
different from the other public schools I've seen. We sleep overnight in cabins here three days a
week, the school work is not really what I'm used to, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I'm
sorry to hear about the online schooling, I hope it's not to tiring. I'm also curious how you're
liking UBC? As well as a late welcome to Vancouver! (Even if it's three years late.) I hope you like
it here. I'm very glad we share a general interest in television, and it's great to meet a fellow
Dune lover. What's your favourite part so far? I read your profile and I'd really like to hear about
what was it like growing up in Mumbai? I would also like to hear about some of your strategies for
collecting information, like taking notes effectively without falling behind in what someones saying
etc. I have a really hard time with this in person things because I feel like I'm always missing
something someones said. Some more about me is I'm in grade 10, I have a younger brother, and I am
definetetly new to this mentoring thing as well. You should also know I'm going to Mexico for about
a week, I'm going to a family wedding so I won't be able to communicate until at least the 17th.
Feel free to respond and I'll send you a message when I get back. I'm looking forway to getting to
know you too!Mentee 2021-11-09, 18:23: Hi Ketaki, The two things I'll share for the website are,
Little Red Bird by Dave Matthews, I thought this was a really interesting song and I thought it was
quite impactful. Someone who is a ""Public Persona"". Arron Sorkin, he wrote some of my favourite
shows like Newsroom, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, West Wing, and News Night. He also wrote the
Social Network, it was a movie that came out a while ago about how facebook was made. it had Jesse
Eisenburg in it. I just include this because I figured this show is known better and just to give a
bit of context. I appologize for the long messages, I didn't realize how much I've written until
now. -LiamMentor 2021-11-12, 18:28: Hi Liam, SEEC sounds really interesting. Sleeping in cabins
sounds fun, what's it like? And how is the schoolwork different exactly? Tho it's nice to hear that
you're getting the hang of it. Nope, online school isn't so bad, it's just a little boring compared
to regular university. I miss campus. I love UBC so much -- are you considering it for yourself? And
thank you so much, I really like Vancouver :). I've pretty much just started reading Dune so I'm not
sure yet, I'm still at the part where Paul and all are on their first trip in Arrakis. I've not been
reading much of anything lately since my midterms just finished, but I'm gonna get back to it. -
KetakiMentor 2021-11-16, 13:47: Hi Liam, Sorry for the delay, back to replying to you, I guess
growing up in Mumbai was pretty nice cuz I love my friends here, and there are a ton of places to
eat/shop/etc. But's super super loud and crowded; people from all over India come here for work so
it's packed. I've just started learning how to drive (very late, I know) and it's given me a whole
new idea of how chaotic Mumbai is. It's also super hot except during the monsoon. I prefer Vancouver
in a lot of ways lol. But another nicer consequence of having so many people from so many parts of
India here is how great and varied the food here is, and how so many languages are spoken here, and
so many holidays celebrated. Okay so, about taking notes effectively -- I really struggle with this
too. Typing makes a massive difference for me, are you allowed to type notes at your school? But
when I have to take written notes, I usually rely really heavily on acronyms or I just shorten
words, like 'develop' becomes 'dev'., 'Britain' becomes 'Br', etc. But also I've realised that if a
teacher is just talking way too fast, it's better to just not worry so much about writing down every
single thing that's being said, and instead just try and pay a lot of attention. Then you can write
really really basic notes whenever they pause, and it usually makes sense when you read it later
since you'd been paying so much attention. And if the lecture is just pure info not an explanation
(like maybe in a history class?), it can sometimes be easier to note down keywords and important
dates, figures, etc. and google them again later. I hope that's helpful. Are you a really focused
student then? These are the strategies I use for note-taking now in uni, I kind of slept through my
classes during tenth grade, I'd just study the textbook later. How old is your brother? I have a
younger brother too, he's 18. I listened to Little Red Bird after reading your message, it is really
nice. And yeah, I've heard of Aaron Sorkin, he's supposed to be really good. I haven't watched
anything of his yet though, but I'll definitely try Newsroom now that you've recommended, and the
Social Network has been on my list for a while. I hope you're having fun in Mexico! And don't worry,
your message isn't too long at all. Mine actually is crazy long, I'm sorry! - KetakiMentee
2021-11-22, 12:31: Hi Ketaki, I'm glad to hear that online school isn't too bad, I haven't really
thought too much about which university I want to go to, I was thinking something like UBC or CapU
but I don't know that much about them. Any imput you have would be terrific. It's pretty fun
sleeping over night here. It's been a little quite the last little bit because usually we have four
people sleeping in our cabin but two of them haven't been here the last two weeks because they were
sick. The school work is just different because it's a little more work than I'm used to, plus the
school I'm at does a lot of outdoor/hands on kind of learning, a few weeks ago our teacher taught us
how to use a compass, and had us find an airplane crash in the middle of the forest area on the
island. Mumbai does seem like a really cool place to visit for all the reasons you said, but I can
see how that might be hectic living there all the time. Thanks for the advice on note taking I will
definetly give it a try in the next few days. I wouldn't say I'm a focused student, I just want to
be able to remember things that I find interesting, and make sure I have a good understanding of
whats going on. I also don't know what textbook my teacher uses and some of the stuff I'm learning
doesn't seem like it's out of a text book. I think I have to go for today so I will finish the rest
of the message tomorrow if I can.Mentor 2021-11-24, 15:02: Hi Liam, I love UBC and I think you'd
like it here, pretty much everyone I know here settled in easily, and have been doing well. I'll do
some actual research on it and CapU for you though. Your school sounds so cool, I love it. That's
such a nice way to learn, I would have loved high school if we'd done stuff like that. Cool, I hope
my note taking advice ends up being helpful. Oh, okay. What kind of stuff are you learning then? If
it sounds like it's not out of a textbook. Yep, talk to you soon! And I guess after I reply to you
once more we can move on to the first module thingy.Mentee 2022-01-19, 18:29: Hi Ketaki, Sorry for
not getting back to you quickly, my class just started again after winter break. Also about the
universities, I really do appreshiate any imput you have, I'm not settled on anything and I really
don't even know what I want to go to university for. Your note taking advice helped quite a bit,
especially with regard to biology. I'de be glad to start the first module. And I appologize again
for being offline for so long. Talk to you soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didn't allow weapons of any sort, even plastic ones because they were scared lol. I'll have to give
Good Omens a shot, seems like an interesting show! I've also only heard good things about it. When I
have time I'd love to try out the Tiffany Aching series too. If I'm being honest it's been a while
since I touched a book series loll. Last I can recall is reading the Percy Jackson series a couple
years back, which was really enjoyable! Also I knew I recognized David Tennant from somewhere haha.
He's in Doctor Who! I personally have never seen the show but it must be popular for a reason. Have
you watched it?Mentee 2022-02-28, 13:17: Doctor who is really good!!! I didn't love the earlier
seasons but I got into it after the ninth season! I would definitely recommend watching it. Yea we
didn't go to school with the weapons so it was ok! Just looked cool. Do you have a favourite
Halloween costume you've done?Mentor 2022-03-01, 23:37: I'll have to watch it someday! One year I
went as a skeleton witch with this super elaborate hat, which I got a lot of compliments on so it
was lots of fun that Halloween :) What was your most interesting Halloween costume? Also, you might
have noticed that I opened up the ""Finding Inspiration"" conversation. Your teacher gave us mentors
an update so we can get into the activities now! Does this topic seem interesting or did you want to
do another topic? We can do approximately 6 topics with the time we have :)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-08, 19:51: Hi Sitka, I'm Jennifer and I'm gonna be ur mentor this year :) I think
it's great that you seem to know exactly what your plans for the future are, I definitely couldn't
(still can't really) relate lol, I'm just going with the flow rn. I'm glad my mentee is also someone
who appreciates the arts, I love drawing on my iPad in my free time, and have been contemplating
getting a tattoo for quite a while. How was ur Halloween? Did u have a costume? I personally went
out as no-face from the movie Spirited Away. Looking forward to keeping in touch!Mentee 2021-11-09,
17:15: Hey Jennifer! That is such a cool costume! I love Studio Ghibli and spritited away! My
favourite SG movie is Howl's Moving Castle. This year I went as the joker with my friend, who was
Harley Quinn. It was super fun and our costumes went pretty well :). What kind of tattoo were you
thinking of getting? I'm also not quite sure what we're using this program for lol, so maybe if you
could explain it a little more that would be awesome. Is it just to have someone to talk to?
Cheers!Mentor 2021-11-11, 16:43: Omg Howl's Moving Castle is definitely my favourite SG movie too! I
love how you went with matching costumes this year, and I'm glad u had fun! I was planning on
getting a black and white flower tattoo but my pain tolerance isn't great and I sort of have a
needle phobia lol. Yea for sure, from what I know your teacher might assign topics/anchor texts from
the green wheel, or leave it up to the students. In the latter case, you'd check off all of the
conversations you wanna talk about at the bottom of this page and I can unlock them for you. We'll
be discussing each topic you choose throughout the term, and if certain topics really interest you,
you can complete the extension activities (though these aren't mandatory unless ur teacher assigns
them). Although our conversations don't have to be limited to the anchor texts, I'll always be happy
to chat about other things! If you click the ""Working Through this Program"" link it goes into a bit
more detail :)Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:05: Ok awesome thank you! That's helpful. Sorry I didn""t get
back to you sooner we were very busy last week in school, we had some scientests come visit and we
set up a light trap in the ocean to catch critters it was super cool. Yea Howl's Moving castle is
defiently a gem.That tattoo sounds super cool too! It would for sure hurt because of the white but I
would say its worth it. I don't have a high pain tolerance but I love getting tattoos. I just find
it hurts less when I give them to myself. Have you been up to anything fun lately, and how did you
fair in the rain? Everything still standing? Saturna Islalnd, where we go to school, has taken a
large hit lol.Mentor 2021-11-23, 15:10: No worries! We mentors got a heads up that your school is
still figuring out what to do with this program, so we were told that our mentees might be
unresponsive during that time. Light traps? That sounds so cool! I could spend hours a day watching
trapping videos like that tbh. One of my favourite shows when I was younger was this one called
River Monsters, where the host would catch huge fish and try to get people to understand why they
attack humans before releasing them back into the wild. What kind of critters did you guys manage to
catch? Also I really admire how you tattoo yourself, I definitely don't have the skills to do that
lol. I haven't been doing much other than volunteering and doing school work, though the rain and
wind did add some spice to my week. I'm thankful that my electricity didn't go out like it always
does when there's heavy wind tho. Oh man, I hope everything is ok over there. I can imagine that
being surrounded by water during that hectic storm would cause some damage. Hopefully not too much
tho!Mentee 2022-01-19, 18:20: Hey! Sorry over winter break I totally forgot about everything and our
teacher just reminded us of our mentors. Yea the light traps were super cool! I had to leave school
early and didn't have time too see the results but I saw some cool creatures. I love tattooing
myself I've decided to leave my arms for bigger pieces for professionals but I'm tatting my legs
myself, patchwork style, for each horror movie I've watched. I hope you had fun this holiday!
-SitkaMentor 2022-01-22, 02:13: Hi Sitka! Hope you had a great winter break as well! Yeah no worries
it happens lol it helps that we don't really have a set syllabus yet so it's easy to overlook. It's
too bad you didn't get to see the results but it must've been cool anyways! I love horror movies!
Although I haven't watched many of the recent ones that have been coming out unfortunately. I heard
many things about Midsommer from a friend and I don't know if I'd want to watch it tbh. Which ones
do you have on your legs so far?Mentee 2022-02-01, 18:18: Hey! I love midsommer, but mostly I just
love Florence Pugh. It's definitely better if you watch it more then once, because you start to love
the plot and get past the gore. So far I only have scream (ghost face) tattooed but I've designed a
lot more, just got to have free time to do them. Do you have a favourite horror movie???Mentor
2022-02-04, 01:38: Oh nice! I'll probably watch it someday, I love it when horror movies balance
horror and plot. That's probably why one of my favourites is Hereditary. Although I'd have to say my
absolute favourite so far is Ringu, since I watched it as a kid and it traumatized me for 2 weeks
lol. It also has that nostalgia factor to it for me. Oo classic, I was obsessed with going as Scream
or the Grim Reaper for Halloween when I was younger. What other ones did you have in mind? If you
watched and enjoyed The Babadook, I feel like the storybook version of him would be an interesting
tattoo!Mentee 2022-02-07, 14:51: I have never seen babadook, but it sounds cool! Yea I first watched
hereditary a few summers ago outside in a tent with my friend, at night. It was dark and terrifying
but watching it again it is pretty good. I have also never seen Ringu, sorry to disappoint lol. My
friend went as the grim reaper once!! It was cool. But the grim reaper from the terry pratchet
novels. Have you ever read his work? It's amazing.Mentor 2022-02-09, 23:29: If you like
psychological horror I'd def recommend it! Watching a horror movie in the dark inside of a tent
sounds really ideal honestly, I'm glad you enjoyed the movie :) Yeah rewatching Ringu, it does show
its age a bit. I think I was just really scared of pale girls with long black hair loll I bet your
friend's costume was a lot better than mine, I didn't have a scythe so I was just in a black robe
with a skeleton mask ^-^'. I sadly haven't read any of Terry Pratchett's novels, but his Discworld
series seems pretty bizarre, but interesting! Which was your favourite book of his?Mentee
2022-02-15, 19:01: Yea I'll try to watch it soon! Yea it was super fun to watch it in a tent but
also definitely made it a lot scarier. Her costume was really good but it was awhile ago so I can't
remember it clearly, it wasn't a proper scythe I think she attached a few gardening tools together
but it definitely passed as one. I haven't read many of his books, but good omens (also a good show)
is incredible, and I like the Tiffany aching series. You should try the show Atleast! If you don't
like reading much but if you do either is great. David Tennant is in the show tho and I love him so
it's a plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

university experience and what i means to study Land and water systems. I myself have been starting
to to think about where and what id like to do post secondary, so I hope you'l be up ffor answering
my questions. I'm currently in grade 11 attending the SEEC program on Saturna island. It's outdoor
school that focuses on environmental and place based learning. E-mentoring gave me some prompts im
meant to share with you, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - Share a picture of something you
think is beautiful Early this summer two of my friends and I went on out first independant hiking
trip in Calahan provincial park. Here are some photos.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Q5edjn44-RFbvdpXSc4qm6qmpIj6sxS/view?usp=sharing We definetly made
alot of mistakes and we all learn't alot along the way. But it was by far some of the most
increadible scenery that iv'e ever had the chance to travel through. We aimed to reach Cirque lake
which was about 45 minutes canoe ride accross the lake and a 3-4 hour hike up, (given the
conditions). What we found however when we crossed the lake was that we were about a month too early
for the conditions we expected. Nevertheless we found our way up, mostly Hiking on a mix of snow and
mud. Once we reached the lake we were astonished to find it completely snowed over. It was by far
the most beutiful landscape that iv'e seen in rescent memory. The sun and heat were intense as the
snow around us magnified it increadibly. Nevertheless it was an increadible experience for me. I was
excited to hear that you play football! It's something iv'e dabled with but never really have played
competitively. How'd you get into it and why would you say you like it? ZachMentor 2021-11-23,
21:17: Hi Zach! I'm excited to connect with you finally and I hope you've been having a great time
at your SEEC program. Getting to your questions, about my university experience. I had my
undergraduate background in Agricultural Engineering as I am currently in a graduate program at
University of British Columbia (UBC). My university days during undergraduate were one of the best
days as far as I remember because the course opened me up to a lot of thinking and exploration about
the environment. I had both classroom knowledge and field experience analysing different soil
condtions, working on community water supply projects as well. This undergraduate program also gave
me the option to think of environmental preservation and sanitation. Currently at UBC, the Land and
Water Systems program have been nothing short of amazing! I've been blown away by the amount of
resources I am opened to working with as an environmental professional. To simply put, the Land and
Water program prepares you to be an expert in the two major resources (Land and Water) that affect
agriculture or food production. A graduate from this program could go on to work in different
positions such as environmental facility technician, soil consultant, land and water researcher, and
sometimes a climate change professional. Thinking about your current program, I think post secondary
degree related to environmental sciences, environmental resources sustainability, aquaculture or
marine science may be good programs you could possibly go explore - just my little opinion. Zach,
concerning the files you shared with me, I see that's a link which probably contains some photos.
So, when I tried to access the link, it says ""ACCESS DENIED"" and I have to request access from you
through my personal email in order to view the files. Realizing that personal information such as
our personal emails ARE NOT TO BE SHARED ON THIS PLATFORM, I'd suggest that you post the pictures
directly to this message chat. Also, read the section under ""INSTRUCTIONS"" on how to share photos
and the section titled ""REMEMBER TO SHARE LINKS ETHICALLY"" so that we can both comply with the
guidelines of this platform with in view of the photos you may want to share with me. Considering
the information you shared after the links that contains these files, I'm really looking forward to
seeing these beautiful photos! Lastly, talking about my footballing experience, this was a habit I
casually picked up while growing up in my early life years. Whenever I returned from school, I would
go to a sport field miles away from my home just to be part of a football game. Till date, I still
love playing football but I have not been a part of a major competitive tournament in a while due to
the time demands from my graduate program. I truly hope I have exhausted your questions and if not,
kindly point my attention to it/them. I'm glad to answer further questions before we move on from
this current anchor text. I look forward to hearing from you soon MichaelMentee 2022-01-19, 18:33:
Hi Micheal. Apologies for my absence over the past month. Iv'e been a bit all over the place with
myself. Thankyou for your response about your university experience. Curently I've been talking to
some other students about their experiences and it has been very helpefull. Next year I'll be
appplying for universities so its definnetly something thats been on my mind. If theres any work
that stick out to you in particular id love to hear about it. I'm sorry to hear that you werent able
to continue with your football, that sounds quite frustrating. Rescenntly this year I had to quite
playing volleyball due to the my choice of school. Athletics had become a very important part of my
routine and was a great way for me to blow off steam. So losing it was very frustrating.. Was the
transition out oof football smooth for you? Did you have any struggles? I'd love to hear anything
that helped you if it was challenging. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Zach:)Mentor
2022-01-21, 05:03: Hello Zach! I'm excited to hear from you again! I completely understand that you
were away for good reasons as I was informed by the eMentoring staff about your absence. As I have
said earlier on, I think a degree related to environmental sciences, environmental resources
sustainability may be a good fit for you considering your current educational background. Just my
little opinion. For the football thing, actually, it wasn't much of a big deal for me at all. Hence,
I can't consider it challenging so to say. As a matter of fact, looking back, I can't remember
having any struggles because I replaced it with phone games and indoor games like Table tennis,
Monopoly... Let me know if you have any final questions about our introduction before we proceed
through other conversations. Cheers MichaelMentee 2022-02-07, 14:53: Hi micheal, Iv'e got no other

checked below. Can you confirm that these are the Conversation Choices you are interested in taking?
Also, if your answer to the above question is ""YES"", which conversation would you like to do first
out of these for, so that we can begin immediately? Hoping to hear from you soon. MichaelMentee
2022-03-15, 19:04: Hi Micheal, Yes I'd love to start talking about some new duscussions. Id like to

hiking semi recently, so that (in addition to lots of painting and loud music) is how I spend most
of my weekend. In terms of books: A Man Called Ove and To Kill A Mockingbird are currently fighting
it out as my favourite (what about you? I love book recommendations :) and in the future, fine arts,
history, and English all interest me. What's UBC like? Are there any tips or suggestions in you have
terms of classes to take in grade 12? What are you interested in?Mentor 2021-11-09, 22:29: That's
awesome! Can you tell me a little bit about how the nature-based program works? It sounds really
interesting. What classes do you take and what classes have you taken in the past? In terms of
books, I haven't actually read A Man Called Ove but I'll definitely give it a go! I love Jane Eyre
and The Great Gatsby, or from more contemporary authors I always recommend A Song of Achilles or
Night Sky with Exit Wounds. UBC is great — are you interested in applying? Are you currently in
grade 11? Since your interests lie in the humanities, I would definitely encourage you to keep
taking literature/history/etc. courses in grade 12, but don't be afraid to branch out and try some

consists of 11 grade ten/eleven students (I'm grade 11). The great gatsby is currently on my to-read
list, so I'll definitely give it a go soon (the song of Achilles sounds fantastic too). UBC
definitely sounds interesting for the future, but Im still very split between art vs academics, and
have definitely considered universities on the east coast too. That being said, I'd love to hear
more about ubcMentor 2021-11-23, 12:25: Great to hear from you again; no worries if you can't
respond immediately! Wow, SEEC sounds really cool! It seems like a great program. In terms of east
coast universities, I've applied to and received admissions offers with scholarships from UofT and
UWaterloo, so feel free to let me know if you have any questions about the admissions process and
I'll try my best to answer them. Additionally, are there any two prompts from above (e.g., words to
live by, beauty in the eye of the beholder, etc.) that you would like to answer?Mentor 2022-03-14,

It's great to meet you! :) A little bit about me: I'm 21 years old and currently in my 4th year
studying Biology at UBC. I'm very passionate about the field of biology and I've taken all sorts of
interesting biology courses over the course of my studies! Once I graduate, my plan is to attend
graduate school to become an epidemiologist (a scientist that studies health problems and diseases
in populations). Fun fact: when I was in grade 10, I also wanted to become a marine biologist! Could
you tell me a bit about yourself? What are your interests and hobbies? What would you like to do
after high school? Or anything else you'd like to share with me. If you have any questions, let me
know and I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge!Mentor 2021-11-13, 22:04: Hi Hannah -
just double checking if you received my message since I haven't heard from you yet! I'd love to
start going through the conversations with you. :)Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:20: Hi Maggie! Sorry I
haven't replied yet. My class had a very busy week between the flooding from the rains and working
with some guests from the Hakai Institue doing citizen science work. I've also never used eMentoring
before, so I'm still getting used to how the program works :) Your work sounds so cool! When you
were choosing epidemiology as a career, was there a particular person or event that inspired you to
pursue it? It's so nice to meet you!Mentor 2021-11-23, 00:29: Hi Hannah, No problem at all! You can
take all the time you need for responding since you are probably very busy with school as well (the
citizen science work with the Hakai Institute sounds super interesting!). I hope you and your family
are safe and doing alright after the flooding. In regards to your question: Yes! When I first
started working as a pharmacy assistant, I was considering attending pharmacy school to become a
pharmacist after I graduated from university. However, working at a pharmacy opened my eyes to the
sheer amount of people that are living with incurable chronic diseases who need to take daily,
life-long medicine in order to live a normal life. I realized that instead of becoming a healthcare
provider who could only treat these patients individually, I wanted a career that could instead
improve the health of populations on a much larger scale, which led me to chronic disease
epidemiology! :) I'd also love to know more about you and your future goals and aspirations if you'd
like to share them here! After that, we can begin to work through this program by clicking on the
blue link titled ""Working Through this Program"" at the bottom right of the page. Please make sure to
read the text and watch the video on that page, and comment your thoughts on the quote by Dr. Evan
Adams in the section below!Mentee 2022-02-07, 15:16: Hi Maggie! My class is trying to find a better
structure to keep in contact with our mentors, so hopefully from now on our conversations won't be
so few and far between! That sounds so cool! Your work in chronic disease epidemiology sound super
interesting. Did you choose to pursue it before or after you started university? I've always been
interested in sudying marine mammals, particularily whales, dolphins, and porpoises ever since I was
kid wandering through the Vancouver Aquarium. In grade six I moved away from supporting animal
captivity, especially wih cetaceans, and became interested in the species that live along the coast
of British Columbia. I have worked with a few different organizations to try and do my part to
protect these animals, and I know that it is something I want to continue into post-secondary. Of
course, marine biology is a pretty broad subject, but I think I've narrowed it down to bioacoustics
and behavioural studies of killer whales. Learning more about how such intelligent creatures use and
react to sound is one of the bigger questions I have about them. Going to school on Saturna was a
long-time dream of mine partly just to be in such close proximity of these animals and the rest of
the natural world :)Mentor 2022-02-07, 22:53: Hi Hannah, Great to hear! It's so fascinating to hear
about how your interest in marine biology and conservation has developed; I'd love to learn more
about the work you do with these organizations in our future conversations! It's great that you've
already narrowed down your research interests so early, it'll make it much easier for you to decide
on your courses and major/minors when you enter post-secondary education. Regarding your question -
I always knew I wanted to pursue research, but narrowing it down to epidemiology and public health
was something that I realized a bit later towards the end of my university degree when I took a few
SPPH courses at UBC as an elective. In the meantime, would you like to start on a conversation
topic? You can pick one you'd like to start with and I'll open it up. :)Mentee 2022-02-27, 15:05: Hi
Maggie, I'd be happy to start with post-secondary considerations. I'm in the middle of course

that stood out to me sometime tomorrow or Saturday. I'm just a little busy with school right now,
but will get back to you soon!Mentee 2022-04-09, 19:56: Your understanding of the idea by putting it
into your own word In this documentray, they tried to display the idea of being inspired by your
experience and life, as it is the most authentic and genuine way. All of these photographers pulled
from what they have experienced to show images in a new light, and give to images feeling and life.
The idea is to find what you are the most passionate or interested in, and finding a personal level
to the career. Your thoughts and feelings that come up in response to the idea I think that a lot of
people work jobs that they don't like for the sake of possible failure or instability, and it's
important for people to find careers that inspire them and make them want to wake up and work
everyday. Otherwise, they will have a career that doesn't make them happy and makes them dread going
to everyday. You only live once, and I personally wouldn't want a career that I don't have a reason
to wake up for. How this idea might apply to your thoughts about your future. This will of course
apply to my future, as I need to make money and think about my education in correlation to career
choices. This generally makes me think more about taking a gap year to do internships or try
different career paths, before paying a lot of money to study something I am not that into. I also
understand that you don't need to go to university for every career, and I don't want to go to
university for the sake of doing it, I want to have a reason or an inspiration.Mentor 2022-04-11,
03:26: Hi Kaya! It's great to chat with you again :) Thanks for sharing what stood out to you. I
think it is definately valuable to spend time considering what you want to do before jumping in to
university. I think that is one of my biggest regrets from one I applied to schools back in grade
12. I wasn't 100% sure about what I wanted to do, even though I had a broad idea about what I wanted
to do. I think it's that you're taking time to consider trying lots of different internships to get
a sense of what interests you. But, I think it's also normal and natural to be interested by lots of
different things and want to change your mind later on as well. I am very late into my degree but I
have been considering careers completely unrelated to the subject matter I learned. While I loved
what my degree focussed on, I am interested in a variety of different careers and I think I have
invested time into developing transferrable skills and soft skills and gaining experiences that
would be applicable to a variety of careers. So there doesn't necessarily have to be any fear
attached to the idea of not loving or being 100% attached to a career propsect when you're entering
university. However, you do bring up valid concerns about wages, and the costs associated with a
post-secondary education and it is a good thing to consider those before starting a degree. I think
one idea in the video that stood out to me was: ""I think to even parktake in creation, you start
with an intention.. You have a want...a desire that needs to be filled"" . I think this stood out to
me in a broader sense, not neccesarily related to simply creativity, but making decisions. When you
choose to do something ,there is an intention behind it. When I chose to pursue a post-secondary
education, my intentions were broad but there was intent behind my decisions. I wanted to pursue a
career that required a post-secondary education, I didn't feel ready to enter the workforce without
further specialized education, and I wanted to be a part of an environment and community that
challenged me and pushed me to grow and learn constantly. My intention matched my desire. I think
it's interesting to reflect on how our intentions, desire, and wants influence our decisions.Mentee
2022-04-21, 17:20: Thanks Jasleen for your insight! :) Can we open the well being &amp; self care
conversation? Thank you!!","Mentor 2021-11-24, 01:11: Hi Kaya! The Career Compass website helps you explore career options. I
remember using this website in high school, and having the opportunity to explore new career
prospects. It's a great opportunity to take some time to explore careers options. If you really
don't like the suggestions based on your responses, do not worry about it, they are just
suggestions. I would suggest you try to explore at least 1 option that you might not have previously
considered as career options. Just recently, while volunteering at the hospital, I met a cardiac
perfusionist. I have always wanted to pursue a career in healthcare, and have mainly researched
careers in nursing or as a physician. I did not know what cardiac perfusionists do, and so I went
home and researched about the position and cardiac perfusion programs. I found that it is a role
that closely aligns with my career interests, and I may not have otherwise discovered this career
prospect had I not decided to do some research out of curiosity after meeting with the cardiac
perfusionist. Sometimes we do not know if what a potential career prospect entails until we do more
research about it, and I'm glad I decided to do some research in this case. Did you discover any
programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? If the
career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option?

what I want to do for post-secondary schooling and career. I noticed that majority of my results
were some sort of doctor, dentist or scientist. Although I think most of these jobs are interesting,
they all have quite a lot of schooling and responsiblity (which scares me). I wish I had one thing
that I was truly passionate about. How did you come to your decision for post-secondary?Mentor
2022-01-25, 02:03: Great questions! It can be really hard trying to navigate this whole process and
trying to decide what to do. I remember feeling like I was unprepared to make such a big decision
when I was in your shoes and also feeling like I was particularly passionate about one thing. But I
knew I enjoyed Biology very much, particularly learning about human physiology and that passion has
led me to pursue a career in Medicine (hopefully) or a related area in healthcare. I was always
intrigued by the idea of being involved in patient care and using knowledge and deduction to figure
out and treat health related concerns. One thing that scared me about Medicine was also the amount
of schooling! Someone once told me though that I shouldn't be afraid of the amount of years
something is going to take, and that lesson really stuck. I was always worried that I wouldn't
finish school by the time I'm 30 if I went into medicine, especially if I didn't get into med school
on my first try. But this person told me I was going to turn 30 anyways, and in the grand scheme of
life whether I finished school at 27 or 30 or 32 it wouldn't really matter. What would matter would
be that I was enjoying what I was doing, my quality of life, my physical and mental health, and my
relationships with those I cared about. That really got me to think about the pressures I put on
myself and these arbitrary deadlines we seem to set for ourselves. I thought about the number of
times I have reached a goal I have been pushing myself to reach and once I reach it, I'm not very
satisfied because I forgot to enjoy myself along the way. So I decided not to worry about the amount
of time that this process might take because I know that this is career I want to pursue. I can
appreciate the difficulty of not knowing what path to go down as well! Medicine in all honesty in
super competitive to get into, and as an undergrad I have no idea if I will be accepted into any MD
program when I apply. I've learned over the years that I can't be afraid of the future and that
changing paths and your plans as you go through life is something that almost everyone has to do.
I've had to change and adjust my education path since I've come into university many times due to
obstacles and unprecedented events and even though change is scary, learning how to adapt to new and
ever changing situations is an important aspect of life. You can always go into university thinking
you will pursue one career and switch your major along the way. I know people who went from Sciences
to Arts or the other way around. I also met someone who finished law school and is now in medical
school! Even now, I am currently working in a research position related to healthcare and I enjoy it
so much that I feel that I have even more options to choose from in terms or career paths. Exploring
new things and taking chances has led me here. I decided to take an extra year to do co-op which led
me to this research opportunity. Had I not decieded to do co-op, I would be graduating one year
sooner but I wouldn't have gotten this research experience that has opened doors for me. That is not
to say that the amount of time and the financial prospects of careers in not important. The concerns
you bring up are very valid! Sometimes that careers you pursue don't have to be your passions! A job
can just be a job, and you are always free to explore your passions outside of work. I have peers,
who for instance, are in Computer Science and IT. While some of them are not super passionate about
their jobs, they enjoy them enough. In exchange, they have high salaries and benefits that afford
them lifestyles and work-life balance that allows them to explore their passions outside of work in
the form of hobbies. I hope this helps in some way. I know that making these decisions can be very
stressful, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions Would like to further discuss
and break down how you could potentially choose an area of study when you apply to university (even
if you are unsure of what you would like to pursue career wise)? Or would you like to discuss
potential careers in more detail? Let me know if there is anything you want to talk about in
particular and we can steer our conversation in that direction :)Mentee 2022-01-26, 15:32: Thanks
for your insight on this topic. I would like to further learn about a potential study area for
university/ post-secondary. Can we start that topic next please? And then the finding inspriation
and studying converstations?Mentor 2022-01-27, 23:01: Sounds good Kaya! I have just opened up the
post-secondary considerations module. The module largely focusses on choosing schools based on your
career aspirations, so we can discuss more about choosing a potential area of study here if you woud
like. If you are struggling to choose an area of study, maybe you could try the following things: 1.
Go on a university's website and scroll through the list of faculties they have. And they go into
the faculties and see what programs they offer. I wish I had done this before I went to university!
I did not know about so many of the programs offered at my university until I was well into my first
year, and some of those topics were really interesting to me. I would suggest spending a
considerable amount of time just explorign the different programs available and noting down the ones
that you found intruiging. For instance, I did not know UBC had a Land and Food Systems Faculty, and
within that faculty exist programs such as Global Resource Systems and Dietetics which I thought
were really interesting, but I did not know existed. 2. Make a list of subjects you don't like. This
is a strategy I used in high school. I knew I loved my Biology courses and learning about physiology
and anatomy. I also liked most of my other courses in high school, which made it difficult to choose
what I wanted to study. tI was good in most of my courses (am I don't mean to brag about that haha),
so I sometimes didn't know if I liked a subject or if I was just doing well in the class. So I
thought really hard about it. I liked my English and Social Studies / History courses enough, but I
knew that I didn't enjoy spending most of my time writing essays. Many English and History courses
use essays and similar assignments as their primary form of assessment, which I did not really
enjoy. This steered me away from Humanities based programs and more towards STEM based subjects. 3.
Sometimes your interests may overlap in certain subject areas. Using strategy #1 can help find
programs that merge your interests. In university your primary area of study is your ""Major"". Some
people do ""double majors"", where they study two subjects as their primary focus of study at the same
time (this either means you spend a little longer in school, or that you end up with less elective
course space in your degree). For instance, you can study Chemical Biology at UBC. Sometimes you can
do double majors in two different faculties (i.e. one major in Science and one in Arts).
Furthermore, if you are particularly interested in one subject, but discover another area of
interest as well, you can sometimes minor in the second subject. A minor is another area of study in
which you usually take a pre-determined number of upper-year courses, but isn't necessarily your
primary area of study (and a minor again can be in a program that falls within in the faculty you
study or in another faculty). So there is always some flexibility to pursue multiple areas of study.",,"Mentee 2022-02-09, 16:58: Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What
sparked your interest in these programs? Some programs that I had never really thought of until
recently have been Botany, Urban Planning, Immology, Midwifery, Environmental Science and
Engineering, and Sciences, Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science. I have mostly been focusing on
universities in the EU, as I have an EU passport and some schools offer discounted or even free
schooling. Some schools I have been look at are Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland and Lund
University in Lund, Sweden. - Botany interests me because I have always have had an interest in how
plants and animals all work together in argiculture and the environment. Although botany is not to
similar to eclogical farming and permaculture, I definitely see the value in this program, and the
knowledge I could gain from it. - Immology has never really interest me, but is a really fascinating
topic to study and research. I do think this is something I should explore more about. - Midwifery
is another career that has never really interested me in the past, but I do feel could be something
that I could really be interested in. I should also research more about midwifery. - Urban Planning
is something that has more recently interested me, but has always been in the back of my mind. The
reason I think I would really enjoy urban planning is because it is very similar to architecture in
a way, but is more focused on the sustainablity in cities and infrastructure. - Environemental
Science and Engineering, is something that has always been one of my interests, and is completely
different to environmental engineering (which deals with waste and poop). This program focuses on
using environmental science to solve problems with engineering (which is 100% up my alley). -
Sciences, Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science is interests me, because of the same reasons that
botany interests me. This course focuses on the ecological systems that can be very useful in my
dream of having a permacutlure farm. How important is the expected salary to the career path you
choose? I don't want salary to influence my decision too much, but money is really somthing that
opens doors in life. I think that money will mostly be a factor in my decision if I choose a career
path that is more needed in city environments (meaning higher housing prices) How important is it to
be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle
with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Ask your
mentor to share their experience with how to handle difficult school subjects. I'm not really too
worried about grades, because my grades have been pretty high since starting high school. The only
grades that I have been concerned about are Physics11 (since I'm doing it online and it SUCKS!) Do
grades really matter for university, I do know that UBC is very, very competitive, but what was your
experience with other schools you applied to?Mentor 2022-02-14, 12:19: Hi Kaya! I think all of your
interests are really cool, and I love that your interests are very related to the environment and
solving environmental problems. Some programs at UBC that might interest you may be: Global resource
systems: https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/undergraduate/global-resource-systems/ Food and Resource
Economics: https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/undergraduate/food-and-resource-economics/ UBC’s joint
environmental engineering program with UNBC
https://www2.unbc.ca/engineering/environmental-engineering-unbc-ubc I don’t know if this program has
the specific focus on environmental science you are looking for, but I thought it might be of
interest to you because it has a rural focus, and aims to address problems specifically impacting
Northern and remote communities. To address your last question, while UBC is competitive to some
extent, they do look at both grades and your extracurricular activities during your admissions
application. You mentioned that your grades have overall been pretty high, which is good! I don’t
think having one outlier grade will drastically reduce your chances of getting in. I can’t speak to
the admissions process itself, as it tends to be a bit of a mystery. I think it is important to
demonstrate you’re a well-rounded person in your application (which I am sure you are through all
the hobbies and interests you have shared with me!) as extracurriculars are considered alongside
grades. When I applied, we were required to write about up to 5 extracurricular activities (3
minimum, 5 maximum), and answer 3 short answer questions. But the application may have changed since
then.Mentor 2022-03-09, 02:07: Hi Kaya! I haven't heard from you in a while and just wanted to check

Saturna Ecological Education Center on Saturna Island. We live in off-the-grid cabins in the
backyard of one of the islander's farms. We are always learning new things about the environment,
sustainability, biology and history. I came to this program because I love learning new things and I
have an interest in sustainability, the environment and history. I also have very similar hobbies as
you, haha! The admin really followed through on my request for someone with the same interests as
me. I love to crochet, pottery, play soccer, cross country ski, garden, cook, bake, hike, and watch
movies and documentaries. I’ve always loved school, I enjoy woodwork, science, math, english and
history. The Assignment Food For Thought- Here is a recipe that I have been making for school at
SEEC, that’s really yummy. I started making these noodles because they are really easy to make once
you have the ingredients, they taste DELious, and they have a good fridge life for school. They are
so good because they are spicy, tasty and crunchy from the peanut butter. Ahh, they are just so
good! If you do make them, make sure to use wheat flour noodles, like udon noodles or soba. Cultural
Knowledge- I am half Polish and half Chinese, I have always had a stronger connection to my Chinese
heritage, over my Polish heritage, because of the physical closeness of family members. One way that
I bonded with my grandparents and my heritage was eating dim sum together. Eating dim sum with my
grandparents, I spent so much important time with them, I learnt new Cantonese words, I got to eat
delicious food, and I overall learned more about my identity. Even when my grandparents are gone,
dim sum will always be something for me to connect with them.Mentor 2021-11-13, 01:15: Hi Kaya!
Thank you for sharing the recipe! It looks absolutely delicious. I will have to try my hand at it

you for sharing about your cultural background! I am sure the bond that you sure with your
grandparents is fairly special and I am glad that you have something that makes your connection to
your grandparents even more special! I am Punjabi and I learned a lot about my culture and langauge
by spending time with my grandparents as well. I am always grateful for the opportunity to listen to
the wisdom and knowledge that they have to share. Your school on Saturna Island sounds so cool and
it seems like a truly unique experience, and a wonderful way to learn more about ecology and the
environment. I am glad that we share similar hobbies, and am sure they will come up fairly often in

balance of both culutres and races, and find a way to make them co-exist. I didn't have too many
issues with my identity as a kid, because I went to predominantly Asian schools. But last year I
went to the Trek program, which is known for their lack of diversity, as they hardly have any POC.
It was a big culture shock for me, as I was used to being the white kid, but now I was the Asian
kid. There were a few POC, that I tried to talk to about the white kids' ignorance, but a lot of
them were ""white-washed"" and did associate with their cultures at all. Just from this year and last
year at more white schools, I have found it is harder to navigate identity and where you fit as a
mixed person, when you are only surrounded by white people. Can we discuss ""finding inspiration""
next please?Mentor 2022-03-25, 02:07: Hi Kaya! I'm sorry to hear that you didn't have a great time
at the Trek program and have found difficulty finding a balance between two cultures. I understand
your feeling of culture shock. I am a second generation Canadian, but I grew up in a community in
the Lower Mainland that had a large South-Asian diaspora, and so in elementary school and in my high
school there were a significant number of peers of a similar background as me. So while I am a
visible minority, I never really felt like I was a ""minority"" growing up. But when I got to UBC, it
was a big culture shock for me as for the first time, I actually was the visible minority. I found
community in groups centered around equity and diversity (of which there are many at UBC), and have
felt very safe and included in those spaces. And I know there are plenty of clubs at UBC to meet
people of similar cultural backgrounds. Most people on campus are super inclusive and welcoming. I
know you are interested in Trinity College in Dublin and said that you don't think there are many
cultural support groups, which is unfortunate. I found here that they have an equality office, so
maybe you might be able to email or call them to inquire whether they have any students groups that
focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion: https://www.tcd.ie/equality/contact/ Take care! Jasleen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-02-16, 16:52: Thanks for the program links! I'll definitely look into them. How do you
feel about some of these changes? What are you excited about, and what are you feeling nervous
about? Majority of the 20 differences listed are not anything new or crazy to me, since as a kid I
went to the Geering Up camps at UBC and sort of got the gist of the school environment. University
seems exciting and like an indpendant learning space for like-minded people. But it also seems
stressful, self directed and like a lot of time-mangement. Already high school stresses me out, so I
can't imagine what I'll need to do for anxiety mitigation in University. I also get really bad
migraines sometimes, and I feel like if I got one of those in school and I was out for a few days, I
would significantly get behind. Which of the strategies described in the article will you try? Which
can you implement in your life now? The program that I am currently in, I have a 4 day weekend to do
homework and get ready for the next week. Currently I have not been manging my time as efficently as
I could. Something that I could work on is making a sustainable routine to follow, because most of
my Thursdays consist of doing nothing, when I could do so much work, freeing up space to hangout
with friends or free less stressed. What academic success tips work for you? Ask your mentor to
share and explain a syllabus from one of their courses.Mentor 2022-02-20, 00:51: Hi Kaya, It's great
that you've had exposure to the unviersity environment. You are right that there is a lot of
independence, and so many opportunities to learn about so many new things. You will meet professors
who are leaders in their fields of research, and so many like-minded peers. It is a wonderful time
to meet and work with new people. But it can be stressful as there can be a lot of academic
pressure. I used to stress out in high school too, so I didn't know if I could handle the pressure
of university. But you learn to adapt and you learn and grow from the challenges that you face. Some
things you can do to help manage academic stress in univeristy are: Take a lighter course load.
Although this may mean it takes you longer to graduate, taking a lighter course load may benefit
your academic performance, as well as your mental health. Some people feel pressure to take a full
course load to ""keep up"" with their peers in first year (myself included). But I've learned that
university isn't really a race and most people will be finishing at different times anyways (due to
various things like internships, co-op terms, study abroad, etc.). I totally empathize with your
concern about migraines, and understand your concerns about falling behind in school. One thing you
could try when you go to university is try and make arrangements with the univeristy's accesibilty
support centre (For instance, at UBC this resource is know as the UBC Centre for Accesibility).
Through such resources, some academic concessions are sometimes provided for students on a case by
case basis. You could reach at to the Centre for Accesibilty to determine if you may be eligible for
some academic concessions due to your migraines (i.e. things like having notes provided by someone
in the class if you miss a day). Again, concessions may be provided on a case by case basis. If you
are ineligible for concessions through formal resources, you may be able to make friends in your
classes and ask them to sure their notes if you miss a class. You could review their notes and
arrange a time to meet with your professor to go over concepts you may not understand (for instance,
in office hours. Office hours are times often offered by professors where you can drop in and get
help with concepts you do not understand on a 1-on-1 basis with your prof). I think academic success
comes in different ways for everyone. In my first year of university, I realized that my high school
study habits would not bring me academic success as they did not work in the new learning
environment for me, so I really had to take thing to review my approach to studying. Some things
that have worked for me include: Staying caught up with material. It can be really easy to tell
yourself that you will review something later and not really get to it. I try to review material for
the upcoming lecture (i.e. if slides are provided, or if a pre-reading has been assigned) before the
lecture as it helps provide a foundation of knowledge to work with in lecture. As a result, I can
focus on really understanding that details provided by the professor, rather than simply trying to
understand the broad concepts they are talking about I realized that taking detailed notes based on
textbooks or readings doesn't really work for me (although I understand this is what works for
others, and may be course dependent). I prefer to annotate slides that professor's provide. This
allows me to have sufficient information to study and have all of the material I need to review in
one document / area. I utilize office hours as much as possible. Office hours are a great way to
interact with your professor in a more personal level, and a great way to get 1-on-1 help. Office
hours are times often offered by professors where you can drop in and get help with concepts you do
not understand. This is great for classes that have large class sizes. Even if I don't need help
myself, I enjoy dropping into office hours and listening to the questions some of my peers have to
ask. Sometimes just listening to questions they have is a great learning opportunity as it can help
you look at a concept in a different lens, and it also allows you to recognize gaps in your own
knowledge. For instance, in second year I went to my OChem office hours quite frequently. Sometimes
I would think I fully understand a concept. But when I would listen to the questions of my peers I
would realize that I might have misunderstood something, or realized that I didn't understand
something as well as I thought I did. One odd tip I have is to sit in the front of the classroom. I
find that when I sit in the middle or back rows, I get really distracted by what my peers are doing
(i.e. watching a video on their laptop, having a conversation unrelated to the lecture, etc.).
Whereas, sitting in the front of the classroom forces me to focus as I know that the professor can
see what I am doing and because there are less distractions in my view. Do as many practice problems
as you can. Passive review (i.e. reading notes) is important to get learn material, but active
review (such as doing practice questions) is where you really learn whether you actually understand
a concept I'll copy and paste a syllabus from one of my courses in another text box! Best,
JasleenMentor 2022-02-20, 01:00: I cannot figure out how to insert a PDF into a text box, so here is
the link to a syllabus for a course I took. The link leads to an older syllabus as it is from a
couple years prior to when I took the course, but the overall structure and content of the course is
similar to when I took it. The course is FNH 355 and it was about International Nutrition. I thought
it was a super interesting course, and the professor was fantastic. She gave us to opportunity to
choose how we were graded (with some stipulations), and so we could choose to go exam heavy,
assignement heavy, or choose a balance between exams and assignments in our marking scheme. Most
profesors will NOT give you such flexibility, but it was awesome to be able to make that choice as
it allows people to choose a grading scheme that works best with their learning abilities and allows
to choose a scheme that allows them to best demonstrate their learning. It is one of my most
favourite courses I have taken, and so I wanted to share the syallbus of this class with you. The
course design, content, and delivery were amazing! Link to the syallabus

I am 20 years old (soon to be 21!) and I am studying nutrition at UBC. Now you might think I eat
really healthy, but I am actually a huge foodie and I love trying out all kinds of dishes and
snacks;) How about you? What are you studying and what do you do in your free time? Feel free to ask
me anything and I will do my best to answer them!Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:36: hi heidi! sorry it took
so long for me to get back to you. i'm kind of a picky eater, but as of recently i've been wanting
to give new and different foods a try. what's you favourite dish/snack currently? any you recommend?
i'm studying wwii in history currently and have a test on wwi coming up. in my free time i like to
play this gacha game called genshin impact and watch true crime videos on youtube. i wanted to take
bio 12 this year, but sadly was put into science 11, which is more like earth sciences and some
human sciences. i've always been fascinated by the human body and how it functions and human
anatomy. do you think it would be worth it to take chemistry? the chemistry teacher at my school is
known for being strict about due dates and he isn't afraid to brag about how difficult the course
is. i've done a little bit of chemistry in some past science courses and was able to get by, but it
was quite challenging at times.Mentor 2021-11-24, 04:19: Hi Malena, I was kind of worried about you
but I am glad that you got back to me:) It is almost the end of the term in college and finals are
right around the corner, so I tend to go for sweets - crepes and donuts paired with latte to keep me
focused! Good luck with your exam, I hope it is not too difficult! I also like to watch true crime
videos like Buzzfeed unsolved, you probably have heard of that already;) I can tell that you’re
really into human anatomy from your profile, and I would encourage you to take chemistry alongside
because biology and chemistry are very closely-related! It is almost impossible to learn about the
human body without mentioning chemistry concepts, so it would help a lot if you have a solid base of
chemistry to start with. Since you mentioned you want to take bio 12 but got put into science 11, I
would assume that you are a grade 11? Do you have any idea of what college and field of study you
wanted to go for? I will try my best to help!Mentee 2021-11-26, 14:03: hi heidi, yes i'm in grade 11
and i have been thinking a little about colleges. my problem is i'm still not sure what i want to do
or study. i've bounced around a lot from wanting to be an artist to photographer to pharmacy
technician to a mortician. i even denbated going to med school, but decided against it since i think
it would stress me out too much. i luckily knocked out mortician since there were some health risks
that i don't want to take. did you also struggle with figuring out what you wanted to study? how did
you know you wanted to be a dietician? were you intimidated by the idea of going to college? was it
challenging to get accepted into ubc? how do you even apply to a college? sorry that there's so many
questions.Mentor 2021-12-01, 01:37: Hi Malena, I’m glad to see the variety of ideas you’ve come up
with! I hope you are not stressing yourself out because you still have plenty of time to figure that
out. I sure struggled a lot with figuring out what I want to study, and to be very honest with you I
settled with dietician/nutritionist AFTER I got into nutrition major, something I haven’t thought of
in high school. Back in grade 12, I ranked the Faculty of Science as my first priority and the
Faculty of Land and Food System as second only because the content of study is closest to science
compared to the others. Well, now you know I did not get accepted to my first choice and ended up in
nutrition! The message I want you to know is that people don’t always know what they want, and as
long as you keep going, that’s okay. I have a lot of friends who switched majors within 4 years of
study or even dropped out because they want to go for something else, so there is really no stress
because it only adds to your knowledge and experience. I was kind of anxious over the uncertainties
I might encounter in post-secondary because I don’t feel like I am ready for all the challenges, but
one thing I learned is that no one can be 100% ready for everything that's ahead of you. So don’t be
nervous with the idea of going to college, we’re all here to learn and grow!Mentor 2021-12-01,
01:59: In my case, I think my grade 12 average was around 90 excluding English 12. Acceptance
depends on faculty, for example Science/Sauder requires higher grades whereas Arts require the
lowest. Undergrad applications differ for each college so you will have to look into each on their
websites. For now, I would suggest asking yourself why you are interested in those occupations.
Artists and photographers and pharmacy technicians are very different options, so you might wanna
think about your situation and see what you value the most in your future job. Some people value how
much money they can earn while some other people value their passion over other factors, so thinking
about that might help eliminate some of the occupations or even add new ones!Mentee 2021-12-06,
15:44: hi heidi, don't worry i haven't been stressing myself out with this for too long. it's just
as of recently i have been hearing more of my friends discuss post-secondary and it's got me
thinking of it more. i've been a little afraid of the idea of going into college course and then
spending all this time on it and not putting it to use or having to worry about a lot of student
loan debt. i'm guessing you probably have/had a similar fear. i've also been concerned about going
into a field i'm passionate about and not making enough money or take care of myself because most of
my passions aren't really easy jobs to make a good living from. did you struggle with worrying about
money and making a good income? or fear of doing something that you aren't passionate about?Mentor
2021-12-12, 19:05: Hi Malena, sorry for the late reply! It is finals week in college now so I have
been busy studying:( Although I am privileged to not have to stress too much about finance right
now, it is inevitable to be concerned about whether the amount I will be earning in future jobs is
sufficient to support me and my family. For sure salary is an aspect you have to take into account
when you are considering post-secondary paths, so that’s why researching is important because you
can sort things out easier. I also suggest looking for a part-time job with the premise that the
work schedule fits into your current schedule and does not interfere too much with your study.
Although salary from a part-time job might not help a lot with finance, it is also an opportunity to
meet new people which means you can learn from their experiences and perspectives too. Since you are
still in grade 11, make good use of the time you have to explore more about yourself. It is only
when you get to know yourself more that you discover what you are actually passionate about, and if
what you are passionate about does not turn out to be one that meets what you’re looking for in a
future job (eg. cannot support you financially), make it into a hobby so you have something to fall
back into whenever you are stressed/need a break from other duties!Mentee 2021-12-14, 12:03: no need
to worry and good luck on your finals, i hope your studying is going well. i have never really been
good at studying, i've tried so many different methods and none of them seemed to really stick with
me. how do you like to study? or any general studying advice for someone who is trying to get into
the habit of studying. the closest i've come is quickly reading my notes and then i sort of just
wing it which i know isn't great. it has worked for me for the most part, but i know i should
probably get into the habit of studying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any of them that you like, they don't have to be the same! My favourite quote is: ""Not all those who
wander are lost"" by J.R.R. Tolkein. The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite series, so it is
special to me because it is from one of those books but also because I feel like it has given me
hope and encouragement throughout my time in university. When I feel like I haven't made the right
choices with courses or even with my program, this quote reminds me that I may not be lost when a
path doesn't seem obvious. There are opportunities to learn and new paths that arise unexpectedly
that remind me that I haven't wasted time or made bad decisions. For ""Food for Thought"" I'll attach
a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is special to me because it was the first recipe that I mastered
after moving away from home to go to university! When I moved away, I had no idea how to cook
anything and that was really challenging because I LOVE good food. I have come a long way from

one will also help you reflect on what you want to do in post secondary! I remember you said you are
interested in law and engineering in your scholarship application. I looked at the WorkBC website
and both categories have high median salaries. How important is the median salary to the career path
you chose? Did you consider salary at all or was it purely interest? From my own experience when I
was in high school, I placed salary well above my personal interest, as at the time, I didn't really
know specifically what I was interested in. After a few years in university, I realized what I am
interested in (health sciences, pharmacy/doctor perhaps) and my considerations for my career
consisted of 65% interest and 35% salary. Perhaps that spending time in university will also shift
what is important when you are considering your career path! I am also interested to hear if your
interest in law/engineering stemmed from you academically doing well in the subjects! Specifically
that engineering requires a strong understanding in physics, did you have a strong foundation in
physics which your interest in engineering sprung from, or was it somewhere different. Looking
forward to hearing back! If you have any questions about how I considered my career path, feel free
to reach out! David :)Mentee 2022-01-19, 11:41: Hi David, salary is definitely a consideration when
looking for careers. But I did not pick these two careers because of the salary,they are truly
things I am interested in. My first year of university I am planning on taking general studies to
expose myself to other career options. One of my biggest fears is that I won't be happy with the
career I choose, so I want to make sure I really like it before I go into it. I did not chose these
careers because of my grades in these classes either. I am pretty good at physics and math but
engineering is just something I have also found interesting. I am yet to take law in school but I am
taking a criminology course. Law and engineering are definitely something I would have to dive
deeper into to be able to actually go into these careers.Mentor 2022-01-21, 16:51: Hi Emma! That is
great to hear! I think its a good strategy to take a lot of courses to expose yourself, that is why
universities give you a lot of elective options for your degree. I am also curious if you discovered
any other career options in WorkBC that also caught your eye, or perhaps if there is any specific
careers in the engineering/law categories that peaked your interest! David :)","Mentee 2021-12-08, 13:41: When it comes to finance in post-secondary, I have many questions. My
biggest concern is how to have time to get good grades, play sports and have social time all while
having a job. I want to have enough money to be able to go out with friends and have fun, but I
don't understand how I'm supposed to fit in the time to work. I am also curious about what your
biggest challenge was when it came to budgeting in your first year?Mentor 2021-12-08, 15:31: Hi
Emma! :) Thanks for asking! Honesty, my biggest challenge is somewhat like yours. I wanted to have
fun outside of school, but realized that most of my money should be allocated towards my education.
I had to quickly learn how to allocate my money and how much of it should be for fun and for
necessities. At the end, I did have less times for fun in 1st year due to me saving money. I did
recieve a scholarship for the first year that did mitigate a little bit of the money troubles, so I
suggest you apply for several! After first year, I started to get used to the university workload,
and now I am working part-time in a research lab and a tutorial center. Now that I think about it,
in reality the biggest challenge for my budgeting stemmed from me trying to get used to the
university lifestyle, before I learned how to balance work with academics. At the end, I ended up
having more money for going out! I think once you get used to the university workload at 1st year
and applied for a few scholarships, I think you can find the fine balance between work, play and
school! Do you think you will be going out of province for school? If so, money balancing plays a
larger role due to living costs etc. If you have any questions, let me know! David :)Mentee
2021-12-14, 11:38: Hello, I don't think I will be going out of the province for school. The furthest
I would go would probably be Calgary. In a perfect world I would go to UVic for university. I do
have some money already put away for university because I know the costs aren't cheap.Mentor
2021-12-15, 16:32: Hi Emma! :) UVic sounds like a excellent choice! I know they offer a lot of
scholarships so I recommend you apply to those in your last year of high school! Also, if you feel
that we finished the Well-being &amp; Self-care module, please let me know so I can wrap that
section up. If you still want to discuss about that topic feel free to message me anything within
that module! Looking forward to hearing from you :) David",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-28, 16:13: Hi Emma! :) I decided to start us off with the ""Well-Being and Self-care""
conversation as I feel that is a very important topic, especially with the transition to university.
Personally for me, the transition to university was not easy, as I had to live away from home and to
get used to the university workload. I found that I didn't appreciate the strategies of self-care as
much as in high school when compared to uni, and when I did, it benefited me immensely. The biggest
thing I learned about self-care is that is that it is related to your responsibility to take care of
yourself. I didn't fully grasp that until I was in university and as a result, my term 1 grades in
year 1 suffered a bit. That was a sign that I needed to practice self-care, and now my routine not
only involves studying, but also taking regular breaks from work either to relax or to hang with
friends. Now i value self-care as much as my education. How easy it is for you to think of self-care
as something important? What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need
to be taking better care of yourself? Hope to hear from you :) DavidMentee 2021-11-30, 17:22: Hello
David, I beleive that self-care is very important and should never be taken for granted. I we
consider myself to have pretty decent self-cae but I am always looking for ways to improve. There
are certainly areas in my life where I need to better look after my self-care. I often overload
myself with work because I like to keep busy, but this can sometimes get stressful. I am fully aware
this needs to be changed and it would be benificial to take breaks. That being said, I have a
healthy diet and I exercise often. My realtionshipswith my peers are great so I always have people
to communicate with! In my life I don't really have a figure that models self-care. This can
sometimes be difficult because it is hard to do something you have no idea how to do the ""right""
way. However, I don't necessarilly think there is a ""right"" way to demonstrate self-care. I beleive
it is different for everyone. The transition to university will be difficult because it will be very
different from what I know. I have no idea what the life away from home is like. The schooling will
be so much different from highschool, living in a different city away from my family and friends. I
will have to adopt new and more self-care habits. Self-care practices I would like to adopt are
setting aside more time for myself and setting a screen time limit on my phone. I feel like whenever
I do get spare time it is just spent on social media, it is wasted time. I hope to adopt more
self-care practices throughout this course and learn more about this subject!Mentor 2021-12-03,
02:50: Hi Emma! :) I appreciate hearing back from you and your thoughts! I think it is already great
hearing that you already have a balanced lifestyle, which is great for self-care! I also definietly
agree with you that there is no ""right"" method to self care. Our self-care methods are probably
totally different! However, I would like to touch on your point on being on social media as wasted
time. Why do you think that is, considering your point on no ""right"" method for self care. There
could be someone who browses on social media as part of their breaks, which accounts for their
self-care routine. Do you think social media detracts time away for yourself or is there another
reason? I personally think social media is damaging if used in excess. I feel the number of
influencer posts on there can seriously warp the views of other people of what the ""ideal lifestyle""
should be, which can be detrimental to people using it as part of their self-care action plan. This
is leading to be an interesting discussion! Looking forward to hearing back from you and your
insights! :) David",,"Mentor 2021-11-05, 23:58: Hi Emma! :) How are you? My name is David and I will be your mentor for

not sure if your class already started the EMentor program! Let me know if you have any questions
about it as well! David :)Mentee 2021-11-22, 11:55: Hi David! We just started the course as we were
supposed to last week but our school had been cancelled. Due to the crazy weather and flooding, we
had a bunch of people stuck in our town. I live in Hope and all the highways were closed causing us
locals and many others to be stuck here. Everything is starting to open up again and go back to
normal! During this crazy week ouyr power was out for 2 days and my house flooded. Once I got my
house under control, I volunteered at the highschool where 500 people were staying. I work at a
grocery store and it was crazy to see how scarce the food supply was. How was your week? Were you
effected by this weather?Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:18: Hi David, I am well and it is nice to meet you! I
am currently in grade 10 in a small highschool in Hope, B.C. I love challenging myself to get ahead.
I am currently taking three classes in school and two online. In school I am taking pre-calc 12,
science 10 and careers 10. Online classes I am taking are computer science 11 and buisness computer
applications 12. I want to take as many courses that I can in highschool to get as much knowledge as
I can. I also play soccer and basketball for our school teams. I have always enjoyed doing sports
and pushing myself to my limits. The person I look up to most in life is my dad. He is the hardest
working person I know and does anything he has to for our family. A quote I really like is by Albert
Einstein, and it is ""Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep going.""Mentor
2021-11-22, 23:12: Hi Emma! So sorry to hear about the flooding and crazy weather! Your school
notified me so I was made aware of the situation. I hope you and your family are all good now! I
hope your town has been doing okay. The crazy weather did affect my house a little bit! There was a
bit of minor flooding in my basement, but other than that, I am doing well. The week is a little
hectic due to my university workload, but other than that its been fun. I'm excited to finally hear
from you back though! :) I am very impressed when you said you were already taking pre-calculus 12
at grade 10 and business computer applications 12! I only took precalculus at grade 11 so I guess
you are already one step ahead of me. Computer science sounds very important right now considering
everything is becoming automated already, so it sounds great that you are already preparing for the
future. What got you interested into computer science if I may ask? Its great that you look up to
your dad because I do too! My dad has always valued hard work and emphasized to me that you must try
your best in everything you do. His results speak of the success of those actions, as he is now
self-employed as a pharmacist after years of busy study at UBC after immigrating from China to
obtain a pharmacist's degree. A quote that I stood by is ""The way to get started is to quit talking
and begin doing"" by Walt Disney. It motivates me to stop procrastnating by saying I'm going to do
something, and actually begin to do it. After when you gotten this message, please read the text and
watch the video. Also please select the conversations you want to complete based on what your
teacher wants you to. Let me know which conversation you want to start with. Thank you so much for
replying and I hope we get to be good friends this term :) :) DavidMentee 2021-11-26, 13:40: Hello,
I'm sorry to hear that the weather has affected you. My family and I are doing well now and
everything is starting to get back to normal. I got interested in computer science because data
engineering has recently been something I am considering taking in school. I thought it might be
helpful to have. So far the course has been moderately difficult but I am starting to grasp the
information now. The conversation I would like to start with is well being and self-care. I am
always looking for ways to better take care of both my mental and physical health. I am very excited
to get started on this course!",,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-14, 11:49: Hello David, Like I said in the previous conversation, I do have some
money put away in an education account. That being said, I don't have nearly enough to cover the
costs of university. Bursaries seem like a great way to help cover the costs, and I am now curious
if I would be eligible to obtain one. I am tempted to contact my counsellor and find out more about
the subject. I know a bit on information on scholarships and I would love to get one but I am not
sure if I would be able to. Compared to other students at my school, I can think of many others who
are way more deserving. I am not interested in applying fora student loan but I know it may be
necessary. Same goes for work study, I would like to have a job outside the university.Mentor
2021-12-15, 16:47: Hi Emma! It seems to me that you are already well-researched in terms of paying
for school! You are a lot more ahead than what I was when I was in Grade 10. Informations on
bursaries can be found in the links above in the module. There are also university specific
bursaries that can be found on their registration websites when you appy to their university. Asking
your counsellor can also be helpful as well! Working in your first year is definetely possible, that
being said it may be a little tough for first years to get used to the rigorous academic workload.
However, from reading your self-care plan and activities, I defintely think you have the right
mindset and responsibility in planning your work, academic and relaxation balance! From my
experience in UBC, there are many part-time jobs offered to students on campus, which is very
beneficial to students that are living in residence, as they don't have to transit far to get to
work. The university which you are applying to will also have these same opportunities, so feel free
to look around when you start uni! You mentioned that you are not interested in student loans, but
you may feel it is necessary to apply. Out of curiosity, why aren't you interested in applying for
student loans? Looking forward to hearing back :) DavidMentee 2022-01-11, 15:14: Hello, Honestly I
can't say if I am interested in a student lone or not because I don't know much about them. I have
heard people say they are still trying to pay off there student loans while they are far out of
university. Let me rephrase when I said I don't want soapily for a student loan, I don't want to be
in debt!Mentor 2022-01-11, 22:31: Hi Emma! :) You are exactly right, student loans do come with debt
and many have trouble paying them off. This is pretty much an unavoidable problem, but there are
many ways to reduce the problem by living frugally and making sure not to spend too much money.
Part-time work is also great which you suggested earlier. University websites should have a section
dedicated to loans and burseries and may vary for each university. I suggest you go check them out,
especially on the section about loans! Personally for me, I have taken student loans out before, and
now I am carefully keeping an eye on my bank account and my spendings, and try to reduce the amount
of money on leisure activities. That way, when I graduate and work, I would have an easier time
paying off my loans (as I didn't need to pay back as much because I spent more on tuiton and less on
leisure activities).",,,"Mentee 2021-12-03, 01:10: Hello David, I am a little bit confused on how to save this assignment to

works next time they have to pay bills. -Doing household repairs/ calling for repair services Not
yet I can’t do any of these repairs myself. But I am very capable of calling someone and asking them
to fix or look at a problem for me. -Banking Not yet I know some things about banking, like how to
transfer money between accounts, how to send e-transfers, and how to manage my money. I already have
my own bank account, so I have to go to bank appointments sometimes. But I'm positive there are
still many things I have to learn. -Taxes No I have absolutely no idea how to do taxes. This is

at least get $2000 off my first year. -EmmaMentor 2021-12-15, 18:29: Hi Emma! Yeah that is a lot of

:) Long time no talk! I hope winter break was relaxing and you were able to take some time off for
yourself. This is a great start to your scholarship application! I see that you did a lot of
activities that makes you a well-rounded student, and I'm sure this is a competitive application for
any scholarship! A few things to keep in mind, quality is better than quantity, so I would advise on
talking about 2 of your experiences in greater detail, such as the ""why"" and the ""how"".
Specifically, how did participating in ""experience X"" or role ""Y"" change you as a person, and how it
affected you. The ""why"" would be answering why you participated in this event/acted in this role. By
answering these questions, the scholarship committee would have a better idea of who you are!
Normally, scholarship applications have a strict word limit, so words are better spent on
elaborating, rather than making a list. Maybe you can elaborate on why you volunteered, or how does
a high achievement in sports makes you deserving of a scholarship? Spelling and grammar is very
important too (although I don't see many errors in yours). I advise to always double and triple
check before submitting, and ask a family member or a close friend to read it over as well. Overall
this is a great personal statement and I am excited for you and your future scholarship
applications! :) DavidMentee 2022-01-13, 13:22: My name is Emma Miller and I am currently attending

learning about criminal offenses and the criminology course I am currently taking is quite
enjoyable. Volunteering has changed the way I think in many different ways. Volunteering is a way I
can give back to my community for the great opportunities it has offered myself. A big eye opening
volunteering experience I recently have had was when the tragic disasters and flooding occurred all
over the province of B.C. In my hometown we had many people stranded here for days with nowhere to
stay and nothing to eat. I volunteered at our local highschool which was used as a safety shelter
for some of the people stranded. The gratitude that these people expressed for my help was an
amazing experience. I am always looking for more opportunities like this one to help individuals and
groups. Sports have been a large part of my life for as long as I can remember. It has always been
something that makes me feel as if I belong. I did competitive figure skating for many years and it
felt amazing to be part of a community like this one. Everyone was like one big family and they were
people I could always count on. I no longer participate in figure skating myself but I feel that I
am still a part of that community. I am now focused on basketball and soccer. Sports have always
been something that just came naturally to me which made me very connected to the sports community.

considerations, and entering the job market. :D I hope are having a great week so far! JanakiMentee
2021-11-22, 12:30: hi Janaki:) how are you doing? sorry for the late response, with the flooding we
didn't have school because people had to sleep here. But now the power is mostly back on, and only a
few peoples houses were affected in Hope. I want a squirrel but i can never catch one. do you know
how to catch one and how to make it nice to me? Or maybe you're not allowed to tell me because this
is a school thing... but if you have any tips on how to catch one please share. I also want to do
something that includes phycology, at first i was thinking a phycologist, but now i'm looking into
becoming a profiler, or a criminal phycologist. My back-up job or second choice would be a tattoo
artist. My hobbies are drawing, painting, and playing with my bird and cats, and friends.Mentor
2021-11-24, 18:31: Hi Evita! It's great to hear from you :D I hope you are safe and doing well
(don't worry at all about the late response!!) Hmm..I'm not quite sure about any tips on catching
squirrels lol but I'm sure they make great pets once you bond with them. I also really like drawing
and painting! Is there a specific thing you really like to paint? It's awesome that you want to go
into psychology (I'm sure you'll love how many different topics it has)! I think a great starting
point would be talking about your interests in psychology: would you like to start off with the
career considerations module first? JanakiMentee 2021-11-30, 16:57: hello, today i tried to make a
deal with my english teacher to get a squirrel...didn't work out. anyways yeah i'd love to talk
about career considerations, in terms of phycology i find body language/non verbals interesting,
that as well as social groups, like how they operate a certain way. esides phycology i'm interested
in being a tattoo artist.Mentee 2021-11-30, 17:04: oh and i caught a rat in my house and named it
marven corola. but i wasn't aloud to keep it, my mom freaked out and said i had to get rid of it.",,"Mentor 2022-01-27, 17:03: Hello Evita! I have opened up the Wrapping Up module for us to take the
survey! (feel free to ask any lingering questions here if you'd like!) It was a pleasure getting to
know you this semester as a mentor and I hope you have a wonderful rest of the year :D Very best of
luck, Janaki",,,,"Mentor 2021-12-09, 21:24: Hi Evita!! As long as you had a chance to view the statistics about each
of the three jobs, you don't have to send them to me if you dont want to! Also, feel free to ask if
you have any questions regarding the results of your quizzes :D Is there a career the quizzes
recommended that you feel most interested in or have a strong passion for? I would love to discuss
certain skills and qualifications you may need for either of those three careers (or even a career
as a psychologist). It is important to consider factors such as where you will have to live, job
security, and financial security when considering a career. And it can sometimes get super
overwhelming figuring all this out, so please let me know of any questions you have!! JanakiMentee
2021-12-14, 11:52: I like the artisans and craftspersons option, because that one steers more
towards being a tattoo artist. In terms of the choreographer, producers, directors option it seems
alright. I might like to direct or produce things, but I don't know what I would be directing or
producing. I don't know where I would be living though, that part along with money for food etc.. is
overwhelming for me. but I think I just need o have a steady income thats all, and save a bit of it
into a saving account.Mentor 2021-12-18, 03:26: Hi Evita! You are totally on the right track about
thinking about a career with steady income and saving up! I totally agree with you about how
overwhelming it can be thinking about where you will live in the future...One of the ways I check
how popular my career will be in the future and where it is most needed is by this Work BC website
(feel free to check it out!):
https://www.workbc.ca/Labour-Market-Industry/High-Opportunity-Occupations.aspx The second anchor
text video reminded me of how important it is for me plan out how much education and money is needed
to apply for certain job...and sometimes knowing this can change whether you want to pursue that
career or not. For example, for a psychologist, at least 8yrs of schooling is needed after high
school, so I debated for a long time whether it is something I wanted to do! Have you thought about
what sort of education/experience you may need to be a tattoo artist? JanakiMentee 2022-01-11,
15:22: In terms of education nothing is required. Although i would enjoy going to art school at
Emily Carr for the experience, and because i want to learn more about colour theory and how colours
work with undertones. like if someone asks me for a blue tattoo but they have yellow undertones,
would it still look good? also that would give me enough time to gain experience. i will also make
sure to check out that website.Mentee 2022-01-11, 15:28: i tried the work bc website, but I'm not
sure if i should just consider tattoo artist as artist, or find statistics for tattoo artists
specifically. because when i search it up it just pulls up ""artist""Mentor 2022-01-12, 22:00: Hi
Evita! I hope you had a great winter break :D I think including ""artist"" on the WorkBC website will
show you more results than a specifc search such as ""tattoo artist"". It's a great that you've
thought about art school (I've hear Emily Carr is awesome!) as a step toward your career. I think
that doing the ""Post-secondary Considerations"" module next will be a great segway into talking more
about university and beyond! What do you think? (As a friendly reminder, the assigned modules on
your list were: Well being and self care, career considerations, post secondary considerations, and
entering the job market. :D...so let me know if you would like to pick a different module!)
JanakiMentee 2022-01-21, 15:32: Thank you, I took the abilities quiz under 'post secondary
considerations' and got aircraft mechanics and aircraft inspectors. I wrote down all the information
listed, and looking at the BC average and the average of this occupation it does't seem like it pays
super great. But maybe BC has an unusually low average wage?the average is $5300 and this
occupations average is $3100. What do you think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

topic ""Career considerations."" Does that sound okay with you? I noticed that you mentioned you
wanted to be a family doctor (that's great to hear - Canada definitely has a shortage of doctors
that specialize in family medicine)! Why don't you try and complete any one of those quizzes from
the Work BC site and let me know how it goes? If you have any questions (related to this topic or
not) pleaseee let me know, I would be more than happy to help you! Have a great day :)Mentee
2021-12-02, 11:46: Hey I did the abilities quiz Air pilots, flight engineers and flying instructors
(NOC 2271) Drafting technologists and technicians (NOC 2253) Veterinarians (NOC 3114) Chiropractors
(NOC 3122) Other professional occupations in health diagnosing and treating (NOC 3125) Specialist
physicians (NOC 3111) General practitioners and family physicians (NOC 3112) Chemists (NOC 2112)
Dentists (NOC 3113) Technical occupations in geomatics and meteorology (NOC 2255) These are the
results.Mentor 2021-12-02, 20:49: Hey Markus, Those are some definitely great jobs that you matched
up with. I think it's interesting (and pretty cool) that you matched up with many healthcare jobs as
I know you mentioned before that you wanted to get into medicine too. Out of the 10+ jobs that
showed up, do you mind selecting just 3 of them and finding more info about it? Like for example
(and you can definitely look more into it), if you were to pursue being a family doctor in Canada, I
know there's definitely a huge shortage of family doctors, especially in the north of Canada. Maybe
you can find more about how much they make and just for fun see how much it costs to become a doctor
too (I was kinda shocked about it )! I hope it's not too much but as always, please message me and
let me know if I can help in anyways at all (related to or outside of this topic)! Hope you keep
staying safe and have a great day!!!Mentee 2021-12-08, 13:37: Hey Ryan So for the average pay for a
family physician it's about 18k a month and around 300k per year in terms of pay. Top earners get
around 25k monthly and 305k a year. chiropractors make around 32-118k a year.Mentor 2021-12-13,
22:51: Hi Markus, Wow - that's a lot of money! I'm really sorry for getting back to you so late, but
I was extremely sick since Thursday and just didn't even have the energy to open my laptop and send
you a message (sorry for that). Hope you're doing okay? Is it almost winter break yet?",,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-05, 15:46: Heyy Markus, How are you ? My name is Ryan and I will be your mentor
during the year. I am currently in a Biology/Microbiology program at my university. I noticed that
you also like biology and want to be a doctor too - that's fantastic! I love baking too - what is
your favorite thing to make, mine was a chocolate biscuit pudding? I remember grade 10 was the first
time I began to actually think about universities and stuff after high school through my career
planning class, so what kind of classes are you taking right now? If there's anything else you'd
like to tell me or have any questions, please send them my way and I will do my best to answer them.
Looking forward to working with you and hope you have a great day! :)Mentee 2021-11-08, 12:03: Hey
Ryan Good to meet you. My favourite thing to bake are macarons, it's quite relaxing to bake cookies
and these cookies are my favourite and easiest cookies I enjoy baking. I'm currently doing English,
Science/Astronomy and French class. Looking forward to working with you.Mentor 2021-11-08, 14:47:
Hey Markus, That's fantastic you love to bake macarons - I absolutely love to eat them hahah!
Actually, I was in France a couple of years ago, and honestly, I have not tasted a macaroon as good
as the one from there. I always thought they were extremely difficult to make, but maybe you have an
easy recipe you would be willing to share? I've never taken astronomy but it's fascinating to think
about giant balls of gas (i.e. stars) just millions of times bigger than our Sun - just seems pretty
unreal​​​​​. I hope the rest of your classes are going well, I remember French being slightly more
difficult for me (I wasn't great at learning a second language). But whenever I encounter a
difficult class I always think of this quote ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.""
(Unknown) I know it sounds like a pretty cheesy quote, but it's definitely motivated me to work hard
and finish a class? Do you have a favourite quote? Hope you have a great dayMentor 2021-11-15,
22:07: Hey Markus, Just wanted to check in and see how you were doing? This crazy weather has been
pretty bad around where I live but I've heard and seen it's worse up in the Interior. Hope you and
your friends and family are doing okay and staying safe?Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:05: hi, yeah im ok.
The power came back on a few days ago but the wifi was a bit iffy, and my power went out. School
opened up again so school is back at last, but the connection and power isnt the best yet.Mentee

are starting to get back to somewhat normal (hopefully the rain stays away this week)! And pleaseeee
let me know if there's anything at all I can do to help, I honestly cannot imagine what it must be
like over there right now. If you have time (and if you haven't already done so) would you mind
clicking on the little blue text at the bottom that said ""Working through the program."" When you've
finished reading and watched the video let me know and if you had any questions or anything that
came up you were confused about let me know too. Hope you have a great week ahead!Mentee 2021-11-26,

this type of work? I'd like to help people and try and relieve people of any medical problems that
they have. Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? I mostly want to focus
on either, meaning I don't want either side of my life to collide and I feel as though it'd be very
rare for the job to collide Will this career offer me financial security? Financially this job
should secure me for a pretty comfortable life if I fully put myself into my work. Where will I need
to live to pursue this career path? Nearer to the city or downtown of any cityMentor 2021-12-17,
22:43: Hey Markus, That's great that you're interested in medicine but particularly family medicine.
The pandemic has really highlighted the fact that Canada has a huge shortage of family medicine but
it's such an important job and is often the first contact for anyone with medical-related
questions/issues. I noticed that you said that you would have to live near a city/downtown area to
be a family doctor. It's true for the education part, but actually, the greatest need for family
doctors is in rural communities!Mentor 2021-12-17, 22:45: Also Markus, just wanted to confirm that
this activity that you just completed, you ""saved it to your portfolio?""Mentor 2022-01-19, 14:15: Hi

little video for us to watch that touches on how different people can get inspred and then
afterwards we can chat about and each share some ideas from the clip. Right when i started watching
the video (maybe it stood out becuase it was so close to the begining haha) but I thought it was
super interesting when the first women said ""everyone wants something and because of that there's
always going to be conflict"", i just thought that that was an interesing, kinda dark view on what
fuels us but I liked it! I for sure think that a lot of much actions are probably driven by wanting.
Another thing she said (the first quote written above) is that you always have intention for what
youre doing, so if you're sitting down to paint something, there's a reason why you're there trying
to paint something - i thought that was interesting too because, as i said before, i comepltely
agree that there's usually a want or desire behind why we do. Its cool to think back on decsions
I've made and try and figure out exactly why i made them but it's usually because i wanted something
thats for sure - let me know if you relate to this at all or not! Anything you found interesting in
the video or which filmmaker you agree with the most when it comes to being inspired?Mentor

myself to get us started off! I'm in my fourth year of studying biochemistry at the University of
Victoria but I moved to Victoria from a small town in the Kootenays so its cool to here that you're
from a small town too. I'm hoping to go into med school after I graduate uni but that's a little
stressful so I try not to think about it too much. When I do get some free time during school, I
like grabbing food with friends, working out and trying new things (learning to skateboard
currently). I hope you're enjoying grade ten so far, have any favourite classes yet (or least
favourite)? Going into heavy duty mechanics sounds like a great idea (RCMP also sounds cool too
ngl), and you still have a lot of time to think about it so don't worry yet, but do you know where
you'd want to study that after high school? If you have any questions right off the bat just let me
know, I’d love to try and answer them! Other than that, I'm excited to hopefully help you start
thinking aboutl life after highschoolMentee 2021-11-22, 12:14: Hey Isabella, I'm Eric nice to meet

protect your health, okay? I am really excited when I knew that you also like to pursue Software
Engineer or Computer Science. And, I am always happy to share with you about that major as well.
However, I have a suggestion that why don't we try to finish our main work first, then when we still
have time, I will share more and more about that major with you. Or, I think somewhere in the topics
that we are going to work on, there might be a place where I can tell you about this major for
example. So, as soon as we start our work, we can have more time for our other topics, for example,

a lot of effort coming here and answering my messages. We did not have many discussions, but I still
appreciated every moment when I received your reply because I know that you were trying your best to
come here! I also know that you have a passion for Computer Science, right? It is not a hard major,

thought this would be a great topic to start with. To me, self-care is something I value very much,
I believe we all deserve self-care as a responsibility we have to ourselves, not something we need
to do as a treat or reward. What are your thoughts on self-care? I would love to share some of the
activities or acts of self-care I do. My favourite way to cheer up after a bad day is an evening
filled with self-care, it gives me a sense of confidence and some peace at the end of the day. I

to practice self-care with your self.Mentor 2021-12-14, 14:12: Hi Levi! I'm so glad you have similar
thoughts about self-care! It is so easy to forget to take care of ourselves when we are busy with
school or other things. I know when I first started post-secondary, my first semester was so
overwhelming and I had no self-care or time-management plan, realizing this really helped me in the
semesters after because I made sure to have a routine and make sure I made time for self-care. I was
hoping you could complete the extension activities included in this conversation, they are very
helpful and a good start to creating a self-care action plan! :) Talk soon, Jessica",,"Mentor 2021-11-09, 19:11: Hi Levi! How are you? My name is Jessica and it is so nice to “meet” you!

hard now and enjoy later."" which my family members always say to me. If you have any questions,
please send them to me and I will try my best to answer them. I am so excited to be your mentor
during the year. JessicaMentor 2021-11-21, 17:49: Hi Levi, Just checking in to see how you're doing?
This is a stressful time for everyone affected by the floods. I hope you're doing okay. I am here to
support you and if you need to talk! Best, JessicaMentee 2021-11-22, 12:28: Hi Jessica I'm Levi and
I'm in grade 10 at Hope Secondary School. A quote I would like to share is ""time is money "" which is
something that my dad always says because if you waste most of your life doing nothing, it's pretty
difficult to become successful. I also love to bake pretty much anything, but I especially love to
bake any type of cake. My favorite sports are badminton, soccer, running, swimming, floor hockey,
and dodge ball. I also love photography. For example going down to Vancouver with my dad to take
pictures of the beautiful city and Stanley Park. Thanks for being my mentor for this year.Mentor
2021-11-29, 16:39: Hi Levi! I'm so sorry about my late reply, I have been so caught up in final
exams at school. However, I completely agree with ""time is money"". That's definitely a popular quote
in my family too. Wow, those are a lot of favourite sports, you must be super active. that's
amazing! I'm not very good at soccer haha I usually miss the ball when I'm about to kick it but I
enjoy swimming, running, and dodgeball very much too! I'm glad we have so much in common :) Stanley
Park is one of my favourite parks, especially during the summer. Have you ever biked the seawall? If
not, I definitely recommend it. Is there anything in particular you wanted to ask me about or
discuss? Do you have any thoughts/concerns towards school currently, post-secondary, or careers?
It's my complete pleasure being your mentor this year! JessicaMentee 2021-11-30, 16:56: Hi Jessica
Im good for now on every related to my post-secondary or carrers. My dad is from Vancouver so we
like to get out of the quiet town and drive into the city every so often. Stanley Park is actually
my favorite park out of anywhere and I've biked the seawall multiple times, its very fun and I enjoy
it alot!. Everytime we get to play dodge ball in P.E I get very excited.",,"Mentor 2022-01-22, 14:17: Hi Levi! Unfortunately, the semester is coming to an end :( I have had an
amazing time getting to know you as a mentor. I hope our conversations have helped you in some way.
However, if you would like to continue working together or have any questions/thoughts, for as long
as you would like, we can! :) If you do not wish to continue, I have unlocked ""Wrapping Up"" for you!
Please complete the survey as well. I have very much enjoyed working with you and wish you the best
in your future endeavours in your academic and career path. Thank you for being a wonderful Mentee,

action plan (video) and Mind Power: 10 Tips for Student Mental Health (article). Afterwards, please
answer the following questions: How easy is it for you to think about self care as something
important? What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? No need to have
elaborate answers, just an engagement with the texts is all I ask! In the next little while I'll
message back with some of my personal experiences associated with well-being and self care,

really excited to get to know you throughout the term. I'm 23 years old and studying creative
writing and english at UBC. I'm super curious and intrigued by your art. What kinds of characters do
you draw and why? Are they video game inspired? I'm a terrible drawer myself, but I can appreciate
anyone with a creative soul. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to tell me about yourself,

reply. Things have calmed down here in hope and i am back in school so i can message you :D. I
usually draw characters i have created in my own imagination, i usually have inspirations for said
characters however, i dont typically draw humans i find them too complicated, but i do draw stickmen

Wow, anthro-sharks, very cool. Are we talking like Sidon from Legend of Zelda? Also, I think it's
super cool you have inspirations for your own characters, I have a similar impulse I think, but with
fiction. Shall we move on to ""Working Through this Program"" section""? All you gotta do here is read

care, career considerations, post secondary considerations, and entering the job market, however,
after we've finished them, I'd totally be down to have discussions in regard to any of the other
modules that you wish, or any questions/concerns that might come up. Just something to consider; I'm
here to help in more ways than one! So, for now, let's move onto the first conversation module your
teacher has told us to go over: Well Being and Self Care, and if you'd like, when we're finished
those, you're welcome to watch the second one as well. I'll leave further instructions on the other

physical wellbeing. How would you assess your ability to take care of the basics of self care
(getting good sleep, eating healthy/mindfully, taking breaks from work as needed, exercising,
keeping up with hobbies, etc)? Personally, this is something I've struggled with at times but I can
tell you that since making more of an effort to balance my sleep, eating, exercise, hobbies and even
drinking water, I always feel more ready to do the work I need to do and start my day off on the
right foot. It can be tough sometimes when you're overloaded with work or just not in the best mood
for whatever reason, and sometimes exercising or ""eating healthy"" is the last thing you want to do,
which is absolutely fine. Even something like having a glass of water and dedicating some time to
your hobbies like baking can constitute self care and can make you feel better overall and more
ready and energized to do work in a way that keeps you happy and focused.Mentee 2021-12-02, 12:03:
To be honest I have a lot of troubles with my emotions latley but when I get upset or angry I
usually put my earbuds in and dance to the music. Sometimes I just take deep breaths until I feel
ready to go on with my day. I haven't tried anything else to calm myself yet but maybe I'll see how
working out does for me.Mentor 2021-12-02, 14:23: That sounds like a great way to destress and
reconnect with yourself! Music always helps me too. There are so many things that you can do to help
with your wellbeing. Working out is a great idea, allocating time specifically for your hobbies,
trying out new ones (like painting or learning a new language), meditation, etc Do you have people
in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things they do to take care of
themselves? How might you incorporate these into your own life? I know I get a lot of my
encouragement to keep up my self care from my parents and my close friends and sometimes when I feel
like I need the extra support, I talk to them and even that in itself helps with my wellbeing and
self care.Mentee 2021-12-06, 15:32: When I'm having a hard time I usually deal with it myself, i
don't really like people knowing my business I don't know why though. My sister is getting good with
her self care she usually talks about it with our parents or me. I could start to try to talk with
people and see if that helps.Mentor 2021-12-06, 22:00: Yes, thats completely understandable, I tend
to be like that too. I don't like people knowing when I'm struggling because it makes me feel more
vulnerable. But I find it is really helpful even if I don't go into detail about it, to just let my
close friends or family know that I am having a hard time. And they're always very receptive and
after all everyone goes through tough times. It's great that your sister models good self care,
maybe you could talk to her when you go through hard times.Mentor 2021-12-06, 22:03: Do you have any
concerns or questions about how self care might be affected by the transition to post secondary
education/moving out of your family home? I know it was something I was kind of concerned about but
also excited by because it was all in my own control. That of course means more responsibility and
self accountability but it also means you can plan your own time and schedule/routine and figure out
what works for you.Mentee 2021-12-08, 13:36: I'm excited yet nervous to move out of my childhood
home, excited because I can finally make my own dessions and I can have my own place. But I'm
nervous because I'm not sure how it will go out in the real world, I'm not sure if I will get
nervous and my mental health gets bad because of that. Was it hard at first moving out of your
childhood home? Do you think I would be okay out there?Mentor 2021-12-08, 15:09: It's completely
natural to feel that way and I went through the same feelings too. It was hard at first moving away
from home, especially because I went to university on a different continent than where my family was
living. But growing and becoming independent, making new friends and adjusting to a new chapter in
life (whether thats university, or a job, or a gap year etc) is a lot of fun. It definitely requires
more attention to self care because it can be overwhelming but most people around you will be going
through the same thing and I'm sure you will be okay. Moving out of your childhood home is a really
unique and nerve wracking experience but its also something most people go through and are able to
successfully get through - and I'm sure you will too! Do you currently feel like you have a good
support network? Maintaining your current support network or establishing a new one once you move
out can be really helpful in practicing good self care and taking care of your mental
welbeing.Mentor 2022-01-12, 15:30: Hi Alice, I hope you had a good break and that you're doing well!
Just wanted to check in and see how you're doing.Mentor 2022-01-23, 14:57: Hi Alice, I've received
notice that your semester is ending and that with that you're no longer required to be in the
mentorship program, but I would be happy to continue working with you beyond the end of the semester
if you'd like. Of course, no pressure though at all, I understand that you're busy and whatnot.
Alternatively, if you're ready to end the program we can proceed with the wrap up survey. Hope you
are doing well.",,"Mentor 2021-11-06, 15:06: Hi Alice! How are you? My name is Estelle and I’m going to be your mentor

you taking, which ones are your favorite? What are your hobbies? I really like baking, cooking and
working out! Feel free to let me know if there is anything about yourself you would like to tell me.
If you have any questions, let me know too and I’ll do my best to answer them!Mentee 2021-11-08,
11:50: Hi Estelle, I'm pretty good , how are you? That's really cool that you are studying law, I'm
actually debating whether I should study law or business. Right now I am taking careers, science,
math and foods. Foods is probably my favorite class at the moment. I like to dance, cook/bake, read
and sometimes workout. How is law?Mentor 2021-11-08, 21:15: Hi Alice, I'm glad to hear that you are
doing well. I'm pretty good as well. That's really great, law and business are both very interesting
fields which are useful for any number of different careers so it keeps a lot of doors open. I am
enjoying studying law, it's something I've always wanted to do and while it is a lot of work, it is
very interesting and it teaches you a new way of thinking. I always recommend studying law to anyone
who is interested in it so long as they're up for the workload. Foods sounds like a class I would
love! What is your favorite thing to bake or cook? Personally, I've been really into cheesecake
lately.Mentee 2021-11-08, 21:54: Hi Estelle, I really love making bagels and brownies. That's good
that you're good. I've been wanting to do law for about 2 years now I even bought a book about old
case's, it was very interesting to me.Mentor 2021-11-09, 00:03: Oh I love bagels! That's really
great that you've taken the initiative to learn more about law. If its something that interests you
then definitely keep it in mind for the future! Do you have any ideas about what you might want to
study in undergrad?Mentee 2021-11-09, 11:44: I'm not really sure, I haven't really thought about
that.Mentor 2021-11-09, 13:53: That's alright and totally normal! I switched my major and minor a
few times even once I got into university.",,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-14, 11:41: I'm not really sure if I have a good support network. I am working on
opening up to people because I think it would be good for me, I think once I learn how to open up my
mental health will be better.Mentor 2021-12-14, 21:27: Well a support network can come in various
forms and depends on what works best for you and what you're comfortable with, whether that is
mainly leaning on family (like your sister, or a parent, etc) or a few close friends, or another
trusted adult (teacher, counselor, therapist etc) or even a buddy outside of school maybe from an
extracurricular who you share certain mental health struggles with. I think wanting to open up more
is a positive goal to have. The more you open up, the more you create space and opportunity to build
meaningful relationships that can not only be a source of fun and comfort but also - as you said -
helpful for your mental wellbeing overall. Do you have any ideas as to what kind of changes or
things you want to implement to work towards the goal of opening up more to people?Mentee
2021-12-16, 15:40: The diffrent ways I thought would help me become more open and not always hide
what I am feeling inside are, trying to not overthink everything such as if I tell them whys going
on and they make fun of me, I feel like I should work on that because deep down I know they care
about me and isn't here to make fun of the way I feel. The other way is stating a journal and write
how I am feeling in there because I do think that a sort of way of opening up, and maybe I will
someday tell someone how I am feeling. So those are some of the things I have been brainstorming to
help me open up.Mentor 2021-12-17, 14:15: Those sound like really good ideas that will help you open
up in a way thats comfortable for you. And I completely agree that friends are there to support you
and listen to you when you need. Everyone goes through struggles and good friends are a great source
of support. Journaling is also something I've been trying to do lately too. I think it is helpful to
verbalize how you're feeling and why you're feeling the way you do and that's conducive to feeling
better and more comfortable with the fact that you might be struggling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kindness, cooperation, courage, encouragement, helpfulness, positivity and problem solving.Mentor
2022-01-17, 20:14: Hey Cameron, The skills you mentioned are great! A few of them are seeked after a
lot by many employers, especially cooperation, problem solving, respect and positivity. If you don't
mind me asking, have you had a job(s) already? if so, what sort of skills and characteristics did
you put on your resume or feel you've already obtained from prior/present job experience.
Personally, I've worked in many places that require handling, organizing and counting money. So a
common transferable skill that put on my resume is that I am good with cash and account management.
Also, all of my jobs have involved customer service to some degree and putting on my resume that I
have strong communication and customer service skills seems to look great to possible
employers.Mentee 2022-01-19, 11:32: Hey Eric, No I don't and never had a job. Also I'm ready to

next? Career considerations or post-secondary considerations?Mentor 2022-01-22, 21:13: and sorry for
taking so long to answer lately, me and everyone I live with got covid so ive been busy trying to
take care of everyone. But I should be faster as responding now! :)Mentee 2022-01-25, 12:52: Hey
Eric Sucks that you &amp; the people got covid, but I hope you &amp; them get better soon. Also I
would like to start the post-secondary considerations.","Mentor 2022-01-27, 00:52: Hey, Thanks for the well wishes, everything is much better now! So as far
as post-secondary considerations go, I can really only ask if you've thought about what you want to
do after high school? Whether you want to go straight into post secondary, take some time off of
school then go, or if you feel you want to skip college or university all-together? The above
information given on this website is pretty much everything you need to know if you do decide to go
to post-secondary. I would love if you answered some of the questions given at the end and Please
ask me any questions you have as some of this can get pretty complicated! For me, I went straight
into college after high school but only did like 2 classes at first to ease into it and worked part
time. School is hella boring if you arent learning something you find interesting so I eased into it
until I figured out what field of study I wanted to get into. Once I figured out that, I started
going to school full-time and have been enjoying it ever since! BUT... dont be afraid to take some
time off to just chill and maybe travel, and maybe explore what careers interest you and ease into
it like I did. Also there are tons of careers and hobbies that make money that dont require school
too like professional gaming, social media manager, etc. So lots to think about!Mentee 2022-01-27,
16:31: Hey Eric, So when it comes to post-secondary I have no idea what I'm going to do after High
School so maybe or maybe not I would do any post-secondary education.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-07, 13:58: Hey! So I've opened this ""well being and self-care"" convo first just
because I want to get through the required conversations that your teacher wants first. But, after
we finish the required ones I can open convo's like ""finding inspiration"" or any others that
interest you :) I look forward to hearing what you have to say!Mentee 2021-12-08, 13:42: Hey Eric
Finished reading through the article for well-being &amp; self care as well as finished watching the
video so I'm ready for the questions.Mentor 2021-12-10, 11:05: Hey, Wasn't expecting that dude from
tiktok to be in the video lol Anyways, self-care is huuuuuge! I learned that the hard way honestly.
The video and article talk about being aware of the ""warning signs"" and trying mangage your mental
and physical health before it gets bad, and I think that is very important. I remember being crushed
by full-time school, full-time work, and volunteering all at the same time and I always felt like I
could never take a break unless I was sleeping or sleep (or i'd feel guilty cause I should be doing
course work). However, later on when I realized its totally okay to take as many breaks as you need
as long as you practice !!*time managment*!!. I cannot stress how much learning to manage my time
helped me mentally. When I started implementing time managment, I was even able to put aside time
for gaming (something I love), hanging out with friends, and working out which I never could do
before without feeling bad that I wasn't doing homework. And because I was able to now do things
that made me happy, sitting down to do school work was much easier because I had a better mindset.
So, after reading the article and watching the video, did anything jump out at you as especially
important to you? Also, how are your time management skills right now? if good, what sort of methods
do you use that make you successful at it? and if bad, what steps can you take to get better?
Lastly, how are you with the self-care basic (mentioned above)? are their any that you are
struggling with that I can maybe help you figure out? the basics are the most important!Mentee
2021-12-14, 11:44: Hey Eric, For the first question not really, for the second my time management
skills are average but I do get nights with not much sleep, for the third the method I use for my
time management are alarms that go off on my phone so I know what to do, for the fourth I'm pretty
decent with the self-care basics, and for the last question I don't really struggle with my
self-care.Mentor 2021-12-18, 06:07: Hey! I'm glad to hear that you seem to have this self-care thing
in the bag :) Everyone has trouble sleeping every once in a while, but if it gets worse one way that
helps me sleep better is not looking at screens right before bed and/or putting on white noise in
the background (ex: rain sounds). If you have anything else that you want to touch on in this topic,
please let me know at any time, even if its during a future conversation. But for now, it looks like
we can move on from this to the next conversation. ""Entering the job market"" conversation has been
opened already but we can also start ""post-secondary considerations"" or ""career considerations""
first if you like. let me know!Mentee 2022-01-11, 15:39: Hey Eric! Thanks for the offer but I'll

I will be your mentor. I am 28 years old and study psychology and sports science. I would love to
start off with you telling me a bit about yourself such as, what classes you are in? What are some
of your favorite things to do in your free time? And anything else you would like to share! You may
have learned a little about me from my bio but if not, or you have any other questions about my
experiences, feel free to ask 😊. I would say my favourite quote is by James Cameron. He said ""if you
set your goals rediculously high and you fail, you will fail above everyone else's success."" I think
these are great words to live by as long as you dont get down on yourself for failing. James Cameron
is also a public persona that I could look up to being a successful canadian entrepenuer. His
perspective and mentality is something that I can only aspire to achieve. Anyways, I’m hoping we can
really get to know each other throughout this program and if you have questions about anything at
all during our time together, please send them my way and I will help you the best I can!Mentee
2021-11-22, 12:10: Hey Eric, As you already know my name is Cameron, I'm 16 &amp; turning 17 in like
3 months, I'm also a student at HSS (aka, Hope Secondary School) in grade 11 &amp; will be in grade
12 next year. So the classes I'm in right now is CLE (Careers Learning Education) 11, Chemistry 11,
Workplace Math 11, and Foods 10-12. The things I like to do in my free time is play video games,
listen to music, watch youtube &amp; hangout with friends and family. I have semi big trust issues
because like almost everyone I tell a secret to and tell them to keep it a secret no matter what
they like betray me like 30mins to a hour later so plz don't betray my trust. We also had a few
landslides and floods in my area which took out the power till tuesday and took out all internet
sources &amp; land phone lines that the people who use Shaw all over town including my place.Mentor
2021-11-25, 01:24: Hey again! wow! I'm glad to hear you're okay after all the flooding and damage. I
don't know what I would do without internet Your hobbies sound exactly the same as mine when I was
16/17, but I defintely skipped chemistry as far as science electives go.. too hard lol Also, what
sort of videogames do you play? I can totally understand having some trust issues after experiencing
betrayal but you dont have to worry about me! The good thing about this program is that we are
basically strangers, so I have no one to tell anything you say to me but still, I hope you can
believe that I will be trustworthy throughout the program. So I know that you probably have a lot
going on right now, but whenever you are ready we can begin the ""working through the program""

currently being motivated by my fear of failure which, isn’t the best source of motivation but it’s
making me do things so I’ll take it haha. I’ve also found that study groups are really helpful cuz
it’s like.. company without the slow drain of social energy. Plus, since school is online at the
moment, campus is pretty deserted and it’s been really fun wandering around without having to weave
around people. My roommate and I (consensually) kidnapped one of our friends into getting hot
chocolate (and sushi hehe) with us and we were not disappointed! The sushi restaurant we went to
also had the cutest little tea cups!! (Theoretically, pictures should be attached but lemme know if
you can’t see/open them!) OOOO what manga have you been reading? I got into anime/manga kinda by
accident about a year ago haha. My favourite is probably Jujutsu Kaisen, or Gakuen Babysitters if
I’m looking for some feel-good content. I also just started reading Cells at Work and I’m just a
smidge in love with it. But WOW, 50GB is like... 3 years worth of my school work haha (don’t ask why
I know this, blame Apple storage limits). That sounds like a good idea! I can’t speak on the career
path front but having a good mind-set and knowing how to take care of yourself is definitely a good
thing to have before you launch yourself into a new, unfamiliar, unnecessarily stressful
post-secondary environment! Speaking of career paths though, did you get a chance to do any of the
quizzes linked above? According to Career Compass, my self-assessed abilities would make me a good
baker! I’ve never considered baking to be my forte at all but maybe I should give it a try haha 🤔
oOo congrats on getting through the semester! How long of a break do you get? Anything exciting
planned?Mentee 2022-02-04, 22:29: I'm sorry about your fall-out with that friend, losing a friend
and realizing how toxic they were is one of the worst feelings :( I'm glad you felt the need to cut
them out though, you don't need that negativity. I hope it doesn't ruin your chances at making new,
better friends. I used to go to an after-school homework group a few years ago but slowly left
because it's a family-friendly group with a bunch of young kids running around a lot and I have too
much of a foul mouth and lack of patience. lol Those cups are so cute! And I always love sunset
pictures, they're so relaxing :) I actually got into Anime in seventh grade and started going
through a phase haha, my favourite has to be InuYasha, which will always be in my #1 spot or
Beastars. I just finished reading The Case Study of Vanitas, which was pretty interesting. Now I'm
reading The Promised Neverland since my friend gifted me the first 9 books. The Anime is really
good, I totally recommend it if you need something to binge. The quizes recommend that I would make
a good hairstylist, which is pretty cool lol. I never really thought about that since I can't even
keep my own hair healthy, it's been dyed too many times. haha Sadly, I didn't get a break after my
semester. I have a bunch of subjects that pile work so I'm praying I don't fall behind. How are you
doing with your semester? I hope the burnout isn't affecting you too bad",,"Mentor 2022-01-20, 14:44: Hey Keith, Happy New Year! How’ve you been? It’s been a while since I’ve
heard from you. I imagine you’re busy settling into school again. I’ve just started uni again too
and with everything being online, it doesn’t quite feel real yet haha. I’m sure once the assignments
start piling up it’ll hit me though. How’s school been for you? Did you enjoy your break? You
mentioned wanting to go into the film industry but not being certain of which specific
specialisation, perhaps taking a look at the websites in the anchor texts will help narrow it down.
Does it rule out any prospective jobs? Do you have a better understanding of your education options,
how you might get there and how they may open doors to your prospective career paths? As always,
feel free to send any questions my way and I'll do my best to answer them!Mentee 2022-01-21, 13:43:
Hey Kay, Happy New Year. :) I hope you're doing alright with Uni starting again, and that it isn't
too much too fast. My break was decent, I got to rest a lot and I finally moved off of the couch. I
hope yours was good as well. I've actually been pretty stressed out. Not for any partictular reason
like school or anything, I think I'm just nervous about turning eighteen in a couple days; even
though it shouldn't be such a big deal. I'm actually doing pretty good in catching up when I fall
behind in school, but I think I'm starting to burn-out. I haven't been able to get past this
'artist's block' for about two weeks now and it's really discouraging. I just stare at my paper in
my art classes and try to brainstom but nothing works. I got my room cleaned up and spend my time in
there now instead of the couch, but it didn't make me feel as better as I wanted it to. I've
actually been taking hospital visits due to my mental health, so staying motivated in this time is
pretty difficult. There are a couple of things keeping me in a good state-of-mind, I've been reading
a bit lately and playing old video games that I used to spend hours on when I was younger. At this
point-in-time, I think I'll be taking a gap year because I still have no idea what I want to do
after I graduate, and I should probably take some time to improve my health, both physically and
mentally. Maybe we could start discussing the 'Career Considerations' and 'Finding Insporation'
sections, as I should probably get back into the swing of things. Again, I hope you had a great
break and are doing okay with Uni. :)Mentor 2022-01-23, 02:23: Heyy, happy (possibly early, possibly
belated) birthday! I’m sorry to hear you’re stressed out though. That’s never a good feeling,
especially when you can’t pinpoint the cause. Have you tried talking to someone, or writing your
feelings down? I find that that tends to help me sort out my thoughts a little. And regarding
burn-out, man, I wish I had some solid advice for you but I’m still trying to work out how to
avoid/recover from burn-out myself :/ I’m doing alright, all things considered. And my break was
very much needed and appreciated haha. Motivation has gone out the window a little with everything
being back online but I’m trying to stay positive and keep in touch with my friends to avoid
isolating myself. There’s actually a hot chocolate festival (https://hotchocolatefest.com/) right
now where a bunch of cafes are making speciality hot chocolates! There’s a couple that are only a
short walk away from my place so my roommate and I are thinking of checking some out tomorrow! I’m
glad to hear you’re getting some help for your mental health, and that you've moved off the couch!
And it’s nice to hear you know what activities make you happy. I hadn’t realised just how
therapeutic cooking had become for me until I went to Toronto and didn’t have the chance to cook.
What have you been reading/playing? A gap year sounds like a fantastic idea! Society puts a lot of
emphasis on getting higher education but there’s absolutely no rush. Putting your health first
should always be a priority. Do you have any ideas on what you might do during that time? You
absolutely don’t have to know, I’m just curious since a gap year wasn’t really an option for me
haha. Sure thing, I’ll go ahead and unlock those for you! Although, I’ve been told that the semester
ends for you next week and so does the eMentoring program (or at least, the scheduled class time).
However, I’m here and happy to keep working with you for as long as you’d like! (Although, I totally
understand if you don’t want to. No hard feelings!) Hope you have/had a good birthday!Mentee
2022-01-28, 22:23: Hiii, thank you for the birthday wishes! I still can't believe that I'm a legal
adult now, I honestly never thought that I would make it this far. And I want to thank you a lot for
being there for me :) I know we only met because of this mentor program, but I've had a lot of joy
talking to you. Just having someone to chat to with similar interests when I was at my lowest has
made me feel less alone. I hope that you can get over your burnout soon. I've been taking a lot of
time to myself lately, reading the Finding Inspiration section and have actually been able to get
more work done. I'm personally an introvert so having time to myself really puts me at ease.
Hopefully you can see your friends during the hot chocolate festival, I really wish my town did
that! I've been obsessed with chai lattes lately, it's basically all I drink lol. I've just been
reading a bit of manga lately because my friend bought me a whole bunch for my birthday. I haven't
read the comics or watched any anime in a while but my friend had some good recommendations. :) Do
you watch/read anime/manga? Video-game-wise, I've been absolutely obsessed with the new Five Nights
At Freddy's: Security Breach that came out last December, I can't stop playing it. It's such a big
game that it took up 50 GB of space on my ps4, but I think it's worth it, haha. For the gap year, I
think I'm just going to keep taking time to find myself and a good job. I want to be able to have a
good mind-set before stepping back into school or starting a career path. I'd love to continue
working with you! My first semester just ended yesterday and I'm hoping I can get a fresh start with
the new one, and I'm here to talk to if you need to as well :) Don't push yourself too hard, and
have a good weekend!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-16, 14:25: That's great to hear! I'm the second youngest in my family so my
experience with baby cousins is very limited haha. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself though! My trip's
been going pretty good so far. I get to meet my friend's boyfriend in person for the first time in a
couple of days so that'll be fun hehe. Oh noo! I'm so sorry about the gerbils :( There's absolutely
no rush to process the grief. Everyone will take a different amount of time to deal with. So, you
take as long as you need. I've never lost a pet before but if you wanna talk about it, i'm here 🥺
That's okay, cooking isn't for everybody and sometimes, you lose interest in things 🤷‍♀️ My roommate
pretty much lives off frozen meals until she has to cook for me haha. I'm not really sure what got
me into cooking but I think watching cooking shows during the pandemic really piqued my interest.
Maybe browsing for recipes or watching some cooking shows would turn you back into a foodie again
lol Oof, yea I see how that can be confusing. I know you mentioned not being sure about
post-secondary. Is getting out there and working something that appeals to you more? If not, there
are also online courses and things you could take while still being at home. Or if you would like to
be enrolled in an institution, I know UBC has the option of being a part-time student (smaller
minimum course load) and they offer distance education courses that can be completed entirely
off-campus. Other schools may offer similar things too so that's something you could also consider!
It may not be the same as the in-person school experience but it is an ever-present option, and you
can still stay with your mother :) I think that's a good approach to take! I'm still working on the
whole 'look on the bright side' thing myself but it's definitely less mentally draining than
dwelling on the bad stuff. Plus we could all use a little more positivity right now. Hehe, well as
long as it works, it doesn't really matter what the coping mechanism is, right? I think my coping
mechanism is music and/or writing lol. My poor roommate gets to suffer through me singing sad songs
at 10 pm on a regular-ish basis. That's a good question... hmm, it's definitely harder to stay in
routine. Partly because there's less of a routine since school isn't a standard 8am - 3pm kind of
thing anymore. But I think generally I've been pretty good about taking care of myself. I try to get
at least 7 hours of sleep and eat balanced meals. And if it isn't raining like I've personally upset
the universe, I take the long way home and do a quick walk around my neighbourhood to get some time
to myself hehe. I can always kinda tell I need to take a self care hour/day cause I'll be irritable
and/or space out a lot. What about you? Have you noticed any what your indicators are that you need
to take a self-care hour/day/week? Are there any self-care things you've seen others do that you'd
like to try? I hope the meds help you out! As also, feel free to reach out if you want to vent or
just need someone to talk to :) Happy holidays!",,"Mentor 2021-11-07, 15:07: Hello there Keith! I’m Kae-Rene (or Kay for short), I’ll be your mentor
for the next few months 😊 I'm 19 years old and go by she/her pronouns. I’m currently studying
cognitive systems (it’s basically computer science with some psychology, philosophy and linguistics
thrown into the mix hehe) at UBC! I'm not sure if you're into musical theatre at all but one of my
favourite songs is You Will Be Found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSfH2AuhXfw) from Dear Evan
Hansen. It's my go-to pick-me-up song for when I've had a rough day! The entire musical is a work of
art so if you've got an hour or so to spare, I highly recommend listening to the Broadway Cast
Recording (or the movie version if that's more your vibe. Both albums are available on YouTube!) But
if you ever just need a little spark of hope in the form of music the You Will Be Found is my
solution! My favourite meal that I've ever made is probably this tom yum pasta
(thatspicychick.com/creamy-tom-yum-pasta/). In my opinion, it's the perfect blend of Asian flavours
with western cooking styles. I haven't been able to find tom yum paste in Vancouver yet though so I
haven't had the chance to make it since I've moved here :/ but I'm still optimistic! I've only been
to 2 Asian grocery stores so far and there's plenty more for me to try. I see you're also a fellow
coffee lover! Do you have any warm drink recommendations? I pretty much exclusively drink cold brews
but I imagine it's going to get too cold for that in the coming months... 😬😂 I’m excited to get to
know you better! Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer them 😁 Sources:

Accessed 6 Nov. 2021.Mentee 2021-11-30, 17:36: Hi Kay! I hope you are staying safe and fed in these
times; the past couple of weeks have been completely hectic. I'm so sad to hear that Castle Fun Park
in Abbotsford is destroyed, my love for arcade and video games originated there. I apologize for my
late response, wifi has been scarce but I should be able to contact better soon. As you already
know, my name is Keith. :) I use he/him pronouns and am interested in attending film school some
time in my future. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do when I get there, though; there are so
many options. I want to write, produce, animate, voice-act, conduct music, and film, I can't
pin-point it to just one career. I sadly never got into muscials but had a lot of friends that would
play them outloud, lol. When I was younger, I listened to a lot of edm and dubstep music but now I
enjoy pretty much every genre including country. My current favourite song is ""ACHE"" by emawk
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ne7tLBvNaw), it reminds me a lot of Billie Eilish's style of
music; but my all-time favourite is ""Reckless"" by Healy
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSW8fEQleY). It's the perfect summer-weather song and it's helped
me calm down many times. Music has always been an important thing to me, and I've considered making
my own, but I still haven't decided. I'm not sure if you're into animation or not, but my favourite
television show is 'Bojack Horseman"". It's pretty raunchey but I think it has beautiful character
development and messages about growing up, depression, confusing relationships, important topics,
etc. All six seasons are available on Netflix so if you're interested I recommend checking it out.
:) I absolutely love all different types of coffee but personally prefer mine iced with extra steps
when I go to Starbucks, lol. I'm currently obsessed with their iced London Fog (just an earl gray
teabag with milk) with a single espresso shot, vanilla syrup, and honey blend. They always know when
it's me pulling in the driveway. I look forward to working with you and getting to know you better.
:) Is there a certain career path you want to take after UBC? Again, I hope you are feeling
well.Mentor 2021-12-02, 19:17: Hey Keith, it's lovely to hear from you! No worries about the delayed
response, I know the past couple of weeks have been insane. I hope you and your family are doing
okay! I don't know a whole lot about film school unfortunately but all those sound really fun! I
don't think you need to have it all figured it yet though. I mean, we see actors go into directing
all the time right? So, keeping your career scope open may be a good thing. You never know what
opportunities will come along! Ah yes, musicals are best played at full volume while dramatically
doing your best re-enactment lol. I’ll have to give your recs a listen though. The term’s coming to
an end so it’s been a little crazy trying to meet all my deadlines. I could use some new comfort
songs to get me through the next week, thanks! I am into animation! My mum teases me all the time
about it but I think she's missing out on some quality entertainment XD I've heard a lot of great
things about Bojack Horseman actually! I haven't gotten around to watching it yet but I'll
definitely add it to the list of shows to binge during christmas break. It sounds like the kind of
show I'd enjoy hehe. oOo that sounds good! I'll have to get my barista friend to make it for me when
I go to her place for christmas! I'm still trying to get my regular-ish baristas to recognise me
haha. I'd love to be able to just rock up to a store and be known as a regular though. Hmm, I'm not
entirely sure what I want to do after university. I've been looking into the human-computer
interactions and user interface design fields but it's nothing concrete at the moment. I get to take
a class on human-computer interactions next year though so I'm really excited to see how that goes!
Are there any classes you're enjoying at the moment, or look forward to taking? Again, I hope the
recent floods haven't caused too much of a disruption to you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if
you need someone to talk to! :) I'm gonna go ahead and start us on the 'Working through this
program' stuff. I believe that'll orientate us on how this whole thing works but do let me know if
you have any questions!Mentee 2021-12-06, 15:46: Alright, that sounds good. :) I'll be honest, I was
kind of thrown into this program without much explanation but reading through the website has
helped. I actually quite enjoy all of my first-semester classes! I'm currently in Careers 10 to get
my final credits, Art 12 where we do basic painting/sculpting, English 12 where we're currently
looking at the novel ""The Kite Runner""; it's quite a sad but intriguing read, and Visual Arts 12
where I'm learning to make digital drawings on a computer. I'll admit, I recently crawled my way out
of a burn-out so I have to catch up on quite a bit of work but I should get it all sorted out by the
end of this week. Next semester is when I really have to sit down and study though, I pretty much
got all of the laid-back classes this current semester. Next I take Life Sciences 11, Food Studies
12, Careers 12, and Socials 11, so we'll see how it goes haha. Have you been struggling much this
year? Cognitive Systems sounds pretty fancy and futuristic, lol. What made you want to pursue it in
post-secondary?",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-08, 15:48: Hey! So sorry for the late response. My account got deactivated on
accident when your new term started 😅 Yea, it took a while to accept that and I still feel a little
guilty just leaving them without saying anything, but I think it was the right move. I hope so too
though! We just had our first day back to in-person classes yesterday, so I got to meet all the
friends I’ve made on class servers and things in person for the first time. It’s kinda funny how
some people were exactly how I pictured them and others were the complete opposite haha. HAHA fair
enough! I just submitted my first coding assignment and my poor roommate was treated to some very
creative language as I tried to figure out why things were throwing errors 😂 I’m very glad past me
had the foresight to not debug my code in public lol. Mannn I need a friend who’ll gift me the first
9 books of a manga series!! Properly getting into manga is not something I can financially support
right now :( thankfully though, the Vancouver library has a relatively decent manga collection hehe.
(I just looked it up and they have the entirety of the promise neverland omg 👀 I guess I’ve found
what I’ll be reading after Cells at Work!) Haha speaking of hairstylists! My mother found a new
hairstylist recently and she was telling me that as he was trimming her hair, he noticed that her
previous hairstylist made it uneven and asked if she wanted to even it out. When my mother said yes,
he started measuring the ends with a ruler to make sure they all lined up haha! I’m hoping to get my
hair dyed at some point though, so maybe my mother will take me with her when I go back to visit
lol. What colours have your hair been dyed? I’m thinking blue or red for mine but idk yet... Oh
nOoOo! Keeping up with class content requires so much effort it’s kinda insane. You’ve got this
though! I believe in youu! My semester's been going good! Last week was a bit chaotic but I got
through it haha. Most of my classes this term have a regular homework schedule so settling into a
routine was relatively smooth sailing. I got accepted into the co-op program too so they’re
currently teaching me how to adult™️ :) The above videos are kinda cool though. I think I’ve been so
surrounded by the ‘get a job for the money/experience, enjoyment is secondary’ mentality recently
that it was really refreshing to see that there are people who enjoy their jobs and also have a
balanced lifestyle! I don’t really know how this would play out in reality but I think I would like
to move countries every few years or so. I don’t like staying in one place for long haha. What about
you? Any loose ideas on what may influence your career choices? Good luck with your classes! Idk how
useful I'll be but give me a shout if there's anything I can help with!Mentee 2022-02-14, 16:16:
Don't worry about it, my responces aren't exactly spot on anyways. Lol I've actually been thinking
about cutting out a lot of toxic people in my life when I graduate, as I'll probably never see them
again anyways. That's really nice though! I remember meeting some online friends a few years ago
that only lived a town-over and they were exactly how I pictured them. I have a bad habit of
swearing almost every 7th sentence, so I really need to double-back on that. ^^; I never fully got
into Cells at Work but I remember having a crush on the Cancer cell character. XD 14-year-old me was
very entertaining, to say the least. Have you seen The Promised Neverland Anime at all? There's only
12 episodes in the first season on Netflix and it caused me to cry so hard, lol I've had sooo many
hair colours it's hard to keep track now, haha. I first dyed my ends half-pink half-blue when I was
13, going through a Suicide Squad-Harley Quinn phase. I chopped it all off and dyed it a bright pink
when I was 15, in honour of Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time then tried split red-and-black
after I started going through an old-school-Harley Quinn phase. After that, quarentine hit and I
just tried different colours to see how I liked it; fully black, green, blonde, blue, purple, brown,
back to black, split red-and-black again and let it fade before dying the red side blonde for a
split black-and-blonde look, fully black again, did pink again but dyed it black because it stood
out too much at my job, shaved the sides of my head and dyed it red while keeping the top
mohawk-part black and now my hair is a dark red while I keep shaving the sides. I want to eventually
grow the top out to but it into a man-bun. I would completely recommend dying your whole head at
least once in your life for a change, even if you realize it isn't your thing. It's a cool
experiance and the process can be really fun! Thank you :) My classes kinda have a homework schedule
too. I've been able to stay caught up and reletively okay mentally, so I'm semi-proud of myself.
That's good, I'm glad classes are going okay, and that you got through your first week, lol. I would
love to travel as well, I've actaully never been outside of British Columbia. I'd love to go to
Sweden or Ireland, and see all the giant stone buildings or celebrate a Mid-Summer festival. I
really have no idea what I'm going to do, I feel all this pressue to go to post-secondary after I
graduate but I don't even know if I want to go to film school anymore. It's all so confusing, I'm
hoping something will inspire me soon. Good luck wth your classes too! I definitely will. :)Mentor
2022-02-15, 04:47: Haha no worries at all! Life gets busy, especially now that you aren’t getting
class time for this anymore. I’m supposed to respond within 3 days but there’s absolutely no
deadline for you so take your time! Oo yea, I get that. I think one of the things I like about uni
friendships (especially in a big school like ubc) is that once you stop sharing classes with people,
you literally never see them unless you’re actively trying to. And the friendships where you make an
effort for are the ones worth keeping y’know? HAHAHAH the cancer cell makes a come back a couple
volumes in!! I haven’t watched The Promised Neverland either though 😅 My network (??) of anime is
very very limited at the moment haha. I think I’ve only watched like.. 5 or 6? I just watched the
trailer for The Promised Neverland though and I’m so gonna binge it over my break next week. The
soundtrack alone has me hooked, it’s so pretty! Damnnn, I never get invested in things long enough
to actually commit to something like dyeing my hair or getting a tattoo :(( I admire your passion!
I’m pretty sure my mum was still making my hair-styling decisions for me when I was 13 though haha.
See, internally, I want to be like you and dye my hair an array of colours cuz its fun, right? But
externally, I like being in the background too much and coloured hair makes that a little difficult
hahah. I do wanna dye my hair a funky colour at least once though. Maybe I’ll even take your advice
and do my dye my whole head hehe! Ahh that’s good to hear, I’m proud of you too! Today was fun
though, it being valentines day and everything. There was a poster thing on campus that said
‘single? taken? taken 4 granted?’ that made me giggle as I hauled ass across campus to make it to
class on time haha. ooo, I haven’t been to either but one of my high school teachers (in Sinagpore)
was Irish. He used to turn the AC down to like 19 degrees cuz he ‘missed the cold’. Mind you,
Singapore doesn’t have seasons and the average temperature is like 30 degrees so none of us were
prepared to walk into his classroom and freeze for an hour haha. Hmm that’s valid. There’s
absolutely no rush! Going to film school may help you figure out what you want to do, but it may
leave you more confused :/ Maybe you could look for internships or summer programs at film schools
to get a feel for it without it being a huge commitment? Also also, I’m in the process of marking
the topics we’ve already discussed as complete. I’m not sure what that will change for you but I
thought I’d give you a heads up :) Hope you have a good rest of the week!Mentor 2022-02-22, 18:34:
Hiya! Absolutely no rush to respond but I'm just checking in to make sure everything's okay? I got
my booster on Friday so that was.. an experience lol. I got to be awkward while surrounded by a
bunch of old ladies waiting to pick up their prescriptions from the pharmacy haha. How's your week
been? Anything exciting happen?Mentee 2022-02-24, 21:54: Yummy Bento Box Hi Kay! I'm am sooo so
sorry for my late reply, I have been feeling very detached from reality for a while, to say the
least. I feel very lost, but have been feeling this spark of hope to get better in the past couple
of days. I finally got some shifts from my first job, that hadn't given me any since November. My
coworkers and managers invited me to a sushi dinner last weekend and I had the best milk bubble tea
I've ever had! I sadly did not get a picture of the boba, but I did take a picture of the bento box
I ordered. I'm not a big fan of sushi but the potstickers and beef teriyaki were delicious, haha.
Let me know if you get the images :) (figuring out how to attach them were a struggle and I still
don't even know if I did it right). I have started writing again, actually. Feelings, plots to
stories that pop up in my mind, and re-writing old works from when I was 14. This is completely
embarrassing but I've had a Wattpad account for five years now, lmao. I have fan fictions back from
2017 that take three hours to read. Reading them makes me feel ooold and cringed-out but makes me
want to better my writing skills and find that passion again. I've been trying to focus more on my
mental health than my career path, but I am hoping this writing phase with continue and pull me out
of this slump. I'm thinking before I decide on taking a gap year I will spend a lot of time this
semester deciding what I really want my life to become. I don't want to go into too much detail if I
make you uncomfortable, so I'll just say that I want to focus on keeping myself alive and stable so
that I will be ready to step into the harder word. I hope you are doing well :) I've been waiting
for a response for when I get my third vaccine. Hopefully it will be soon and not awkward and full
of old ladies, lolMentor 2022-02-26, 19:31: Hey! No worries at all, I totally understand. It was
midterm break this week and with school temporarily being less of a thing, the concept of time and
responsibility kinda disappeared from my general awareness too 😅 I’m glad you’re feeling hopeful
recently though! Did you notice what triggered this spark of hope? le gasp! You don’t like sushi??
🥲😭 I'm glad you liked the beef teriyaki and potstickers though. Honestly, in my eyes, very little
can go wrong with Japanese cuisine. Ahah, trying to send pictures on here should be a module in
itself omg. I don’t have access to your picture rn :( and there’s a policy about not giving out
personal information and stuff so I’m gonna err on the side of caution and not request access with
my personal email haha. But, I’ll send you the instructions that they sent us about how to attach
pictures on here! “to attach an item to your message (for example: an image, document, audio file,
etc.), click on “save to your portfolio” and navigate to that item on your computer. Then click
“send message”. If it works, you’ll see your message below, with an icon that you can click on to
download the item you attached. You’ll also be able to see all portfolio items on the right hand
side of the page, under where it says “portfolio”.” (I'm not sure how this platform looks on your
end but you should be able to find these instructions too if you go to Resources in the navigation
bar and then the Troubleshooting Common Issues and FAQ document. They have some troubleshooting tips
too if the above instructions don't work! Lemme know if you need more help :) ) HAHAHAHA there’s
absolutely no shame in writing fanfic! As a fanfic reader myself, I thank you for your
contributions. There’s never enough fic out there, even when there are like several hundred thousand
already 😂 That’s really good to hear though! I’ve been rereading some of my short prose/‘write your
feelings out but make it ✨poetry✨’ stuff and it’s so weird cause it feels like such a distant
version of myself and yet, also feels like I haven't changed much at all. Idk if that makes sense
haha. That’s valid, and honestly really wise. Give me a shout if I can be of any help or potentially
offer any advice! Although, I do hope that one day, you won’t need to focus on staying alive because
you’ll have a reason to be alive. I hope that for us both :) I haven’t quite found a sustainable,
long term reason yet but for now, I think exploring coffee shops and trying different bubble tea
flavours is pretty fun. Also, for what it’s worth, having uncomfortable conversations is what I’m
here for! Don’t feel like you have to censor yourself on my behalf. If you’re comfortable and want
to talk about something, go for it! Also also, are there any other modules/topics you'd like to look
at next? Hopefully, you'll hear back about your third vaccine soon! Good luck with your shifts at
work!Mentor 2022-03-07, 04:15: Heyo! It's been a while. How's it going? I just got my math midterm
back and I didn't fail hehe! I also tested out a bunch of Thai recipes this week so that was fun.
Wbu? Anything new/exciting?Mentor 2022-03-21, 15:33: Hey Keith, happy spring break! Haven't heard
from you in a while, is everything okay? The cherry blossoms on campus are starting to bloom again.
I'll snap some pictures one day when the suns out :) Miss talking to you!Mentee 2022-03-22, 13:19:
Hi Kay!! I am so so so so so so incredibly sorry that I haven't responded. I was in the hospital a
little while ago and have been recovering. A lot has happened, I can't remember if I've told you
that I've wanted to work at Starbucks ever since I was 16, but I finally got the job. I was just
starting my training when my old job, that pays really really good and some of my friends work
there, contacted me asking if I wanted some weekend shifts. I was extremely short on money so I
accepted the shifts since my training was on weekdays. For a second I thought maybe I could balance
both jobs because the shifts worked out for a bit, I'd work weekdays at Starbucks and the other job
on the weekends; but I knew eventually the shifts would collide, and I was becoming burnt-out, so I
had to drop one. I had no idea which one I wanted the most, since I'm really used to my first job
and I've made so many friends there, but I've wanted to work at Starbucks for so long and finally
got my chance after years of trying. After a couple weeks of working both jobs, Starbucks told me
that I'd have to start working weekends too, and my original one asked me if I wanted to work
full-time during the spring break. I felt so stuck that I was having really bad breakdowns every
day, and I eventually went back to the hospital. I dropped Starbucks in the process. The doctor gave
me some antidepressants and I've been slowly feeling better since then. Now that it's officially
Spring, I'm hoping the better weather will encourage me to go outside some more, I'll see if I can
find any flowers blooming and send them to you :) Again, I'm really sorry for my absence. Now that
it's Spring break and I'm only really focused on working I'll be able to respond faster and sooner.
I missed talking to you too &lt;3Mentor 2022-03-25, 02:26: Hey, that’s okay, don’t apologise! I’m
just glad to hear from you :) I’m really sorry to hear you’ve been struggling though :( It sounds
like you’ve been through a lot over the last month and it’s totally understandable that you were
overwhelmed and burnt out. You had some really tough decisions to make! But I’m glad to hear you got
help and are feeling a little better now, and I’m proud of you for knowing your limits and putting
your health first :) Starbucks seems like a really cool place to work at. I’m sorry you didn’t get
to work there for long :/ But since you’ve already been trained, hopefully, you’ll be able to be
re-hired in the future! Funny story about the flowers/spring actually. I forgot to take my
antihistamines a few days ago and I had just returned from a walk so I was sniffling more than
usual, so much so that my poor roommate (bless her for her attentiveness 🥺) came to check on me to
make sure I wasn’t crying haha. Anyway, it’s supposed to be sunny out sometime next week so I should
be able to get some pictures of the flowers that are plotting my downfall! Maybe I'll even go to the
beach and get some nice sunset shots hehe. Take care of yourself! p.s. are there any other modules
you’d be interested in looking at?Mentor 2022-04-03, 00:24: Heyo! How've you been? Life's been
hectic for me recently between the term ending soon, trying to figure out my summer plans and
working through some emotional stuff that has come up recently. But, we finally got some sunny days
so I got some (albeit not amazing) pictures of the cherry blossoms! Vancouver has a lot more cherry
blossoms than I originally thought haha. My friend and I have been picking flowers at every
opportunity just cause they're so pretty! How's work been? Any interesting stories to share? 👀Mentor
2022-04-11, 13:46: Hey Keith! How've you been? Hope everything's going well with work, and general
life things! It's finals season again so it may take me a little longer to rely than usual. I'll be
done by next friday though! Have a good week!Mentor 2022-04-18, 15:17: Hey Keith, it's been a while
since I've heard from you. Just wanted to make sure everything's okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to be talking about potential career choices. I noticed that you added the Finding Inspiration topic
earlier, and while this isn't a topic that your teacher has indicated for you to complete, I'm happy
to work through it after we've completed the assigned Conversations. Inspiration is also pretty
relevant for figuring out career options, so I think we can probably find a way to weave it into our
discussions here :) Please read through the anchor text above, do the quizzes, and report back to me
with some career options you got in your results that you might be interested in pursuing. The
website will tell you a bit about the careers as well. I did the quizzes myself and the results that
most appealed to me were a career working with people with disabilities and a career as a
psychologist--which actually fit really well with what I'm hoping to pursue in the future!Mentee
2021-12-08, 13:36: Hi Sophie! i completed all three quizzes and unfortunately none of them
interested me. I first got jobs regarding making jewelry, it has an ok salary but its not
interesting to me at all. next i got industrial design, which i wouldn't mind, i enjoy decorating
and making a place look nice. The last was administrative assistant which i would never do even if i
was offered all the money in the world, i hate school with a passion sometimes.Mentor 2021-12-09,
14:18: Hi! Sorry to hear that none of the quizzes worked out for you. Based on what you said about
enjoying making spaces look nice, I'm wondering if you might be interested in something more along
the lines of interior design. Here's a link to the page on interior design and interior decoration
on WorkBC: https://www.workbc.ca/CareerCompass/5242, where you can read about the statistics of
those careers in BC. I was curious about the difference between interior design and interior
decoration, and through a bit of research I learned that interior design is about understanding why
people think certain spaces are aesthetically pleasing and then putting that into practice when
creating new ones. In contrast, interior decoration is more about adding the finishing touches to a
designer's work. So, interior decorators don't design the spaces, but they're really good at
enhancing them through decoration. I hope that's interesting to you! Let me know if you have any
follow-up thoughts about it :)",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-09, 14:32: Hello :) This Conversation is about self-care! This might feel a bit
divorced from what we've been talking about with careers, but it's critical to making sure that
you're taking care of yourself so that you can maintain strong motivation and performance. It also
looks different for everyone! For instance, I'm in exam season right now, and I have to make sure
that I'm getting outside daily and also relaxing at the end of the day so that I can recharge and
perform better when I'm studying. Do you have any ideas about what self-care looks like for you? Has
anyone ever talked with you about it? I feel like it's often something that isn't really discussed
openly, which is why I think this module is really important.Mentee 2021-12-14, 11:53: Selfcare has
never really been a priority for me because I'm usually concerned about other people, i put other
peoples health above mine, always. Recently I've been working quite a lot and its making me have
severe burn out from school and work, so I've been trying to take a break from going out with
friends in my spare time and trying to relax at home, by reading or writing, Ive actually recently
started a new book, its called the unlikely hero of room 13B.Mentor 2021-12-15, 13:04: I love the
title of your book! It sounds so mysterious and interesting. I consider writing and creativity to be
an important aspect of self-care as well. I know what burnout feels like and I'm really sorry you're
experiencing that right now. When Covid hit in 2020, all my schooling went online and I started
feeling really stressed and eventually burnt out. It helped me realize that I needed to take better
care of myself, so I'm really glad you're taking some extra time for yourself right now! It sounds
like your work is really tough. Other things that can contribute to our wellbeing are good
nutrition, enough sleep, and regular physical activity. Sometimes these can be difficult, especially
when we might be feeling burnt out, but this is usually when they can be the most beneficial. These
don't have to be huge considerations either; even short daily walks can have a big impact. Do you
have any self-care aspects that you want to incorporate more into your daily life?Mentor 2022-01-11,
20:23: Hi Payton! I hope you had a wonderful holiday, and I can't wait to hear from you again :)
Send me a message when you're ready to keep progressing through our modules. Also let me know if you
have any more thoughts pertaining to wellbeing and self-care (I hope you had some well-deserved rest
over the break!)Mentor 2022-01-21, 19:27: Hey Payton! I haven't heard from you in a while. I've
missed talking to you and I hope you're doing well. I'm leaving this message to let you know that
the eMentoring program officially ends next Friday, January 28th. If you want to keep going after
that date, you're allowed to do so, and I'd be happy to continue working with you! But don't feel
pressured if you don't want to :) Let me know what you decide, and I'd love to keep working through
our modules in the meantime. Hope to hear from you soon!",,"Mentor 2021-11-06, 00:18: Hi Payton! My name is Sophie and I'll be your mentor for the next few
months :) I'm 21 and I study psychology at university. I noticed on your profile that you enjoy
writing, and I'd be super curious to know more because I love writing too! If you feel comfortable
sharing, I'd love to hear about what kinds of things you like to write about. Personally, I struggle
quite a bit with writer's block, but I've always enjoyed crafting characters and dialogue. If you'd
rather not share, that's totally fine, but feel free to tell me anything else you'd like me to know
about you! Also, if you have any questions, send them my way and I'll do my best to answer them
&lt;3Mentee 2021-11-08, 12:13: Hi Sophie! I'm so glad I got matched with you! I was also interested
when reading your profile and seeing that you enjoy writing. Lately with school, I haven't been able
to write as much, and writers block has also been an extremely difficult thing to get rid of. But in
the past I liked to write adventure stories I guess. I enjoy making tense moments to keep someone on
the edge of their seat and wanting to read more, id often show my stories to my classmates and they
would ask if I had written any new chapters yet, but that was nearly 3 years ago. I prefer poetry
now, or really just making words flow together nicely, it's satisfying to me in some sort of way.
I'd love to hear more about you and your life! I'd love to have someone to talk to with more life
experience. My life is absolutely nuts sometimes and I having someone to talk to about it would be
cool 😌Mentor 2021-11-08, 20:38: I'm glad to have been matched with you as well! &lt;3 I know what
you mean about making words flow together, and I think that's a good description of what most of my
writing is now. I mostly just write for my own sanity, and I try to put feelings into words that
make some sense to me. I used to share some of my stories with classmates in school too! I don't
remember ever getting people that excited about them though lol Of course, that's what I'm here for!
If you ever have any questions or concerns, feel free to add them into a message. I know life can
feel really overwhelming sometimes, but I'll always be happy to listen and share my own experiences
:) Lastly, a bit of housekeeping as we begin the program: Everything you send me will remain
entirely confidential, unless the safety of you or others is at stake. Please let me know if you
have a general idea of when you'll be able to send messages each week. If not, don't worry (I'm
pretty flexible in terms of my availability right now), but it can sometimes be helpful to have a
loose schedule to stick to! If you would like, you can choose some of the icebreaker activities in
the anchor text above the message box (words to live by, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, etc.)
to discuss, or you can start proceeding through the program instead. Let me know what you
decide!Mentor 2021-11-15, 23:07: Hi Payton! You haven't sent a message in a little while. I know
that life gets busy, so please don't feel pressured to always respond quickly, but I'm looking
forward to talking more with you! I hope everything is okay, and let me know if there's anything I
can help with :)Mentor 2021-11-18, 12:52: Hi Payton, I heard about the flooding and I really hope
you're doing okay. I can't imagine how scary it must feel. I just wanted to let you know to take all
the time you need, and I'm here to support you if you need it as well :) Sending you lots of good
thoughts and well wishes &lt;3Mentee 2021-11-26, 14:03: Hi Sophie, sorry for not getting back to you
for quite awhile, as ive been working long shifts since the floods started. We had our entire
parking lot full of water at work, full enough for a dumptruck to be fully submerged under water, i
worked a total of 24 hours in a little under 2 days, and my boyfriend worked 60 hours, as he was one
of the only ones in charge of getting rid of flooding at our restaurant. Is there any flooding going
on near you? I also havent been messaging due the huge ammount of stress ive been under in my life
recently. Work is always difficult, my dad is the kitchen manager so theres higher expectations for
me, and i often deal with way too much work drama, but i do create a great deal of it myself. My
boyfriend, Daniel is the sweetest, kindest most amazing man ive ever met. In my life i havent felt
as loved as he makes me feel, and for some reason my dad hates him. Im allowed to date, dont get me
wrong, but its just Daniel he has an issue with. Ive been forbidden from even seeing him, but
obviously i still do behind my dads back, because in all honesty, Daniel makes me feel happier and
safer. My dad isnt even my real dad, im adopted but not officailly, ive been staying with him since
my mom got too into drugs, but hes not the greatest father figure. he often calls me names when hes
upset and throws things around, but thankfully never at me. Ive pleaded and begged for him to even
let us be friends and he keeps saying no. He also has no reasoning for this, Daniel has gone and
tried to talk to him, and he ignores him, like hes not even there. He blocked him on Facebook,
Instagram and anything hes tried to talk to him on, along with blocking him on my phone too. I get
hes been protective, but am I wrong in thinking its overkill and still seeing him behind his
back?Mentor 2021-11-27, 13:40: Hi! It's great to hear from you and I'm really glad you're safe! I
hope you get some well-deserved time to rest after working that much, and don't worry if your
replies are late, take care of yourself first! My brother works in a restaurant and he tells me
about how overwhelming it can be sometimes, so I think you're very strong and resilient! There isn't
any serious flooding happening where I am, just a LOT of rain, and a bit of a panic because of the
highway closures. I'm really sorry to hear about your dad; that's a very tough situation to be put
in. Sometimes it can be hard to understand why parents act the way they do. With time it makes more
sense, but it can still feel really confusing. It sounds like Daniel means a lot to you, and I'm
sorry your dad can't see that right now. Do you think there is anyone you could talk to, who could
then speak to your dad to help him understand better? Finally, you're under a lot of stress right
now, so please don't worry too much about replying super quickly! Remember that you're a really
strong person and that you'll get through this &lt;3 If you feel ready to start the modules for the
program, let me know in your message and we can start going through them. I'll be here to support
you, and we will always take them at a pace that works for you :)",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-04, 13:21: Hello again! This is the next section of our topic. Please read the text
and watch the videos. They're quite focused on careers in medicine, but I think they're applicable
to any career choice because they talk about how your career can enhance the values you hold or the
interests you have. Personally, I have always felt drawn to psychology because I feel like it brings
together a lot of the things I think are important. For instance, I think my interest in writing
impacted my choice to pursue psychology, because I've always used writing to try to make sense of
myself, other people, and the world around me. Psychology is basically that but as a scientific
field! I get a lot of chances to pick out things I don't understand about the world and study them
more closely, the way I do when I write. I've always wanted things to make sense, and I feel like
psychology helps me decipher a sometimes confusing world. Do you have any values or interests that
you think could influence your career choices? If you'd like, you can connect your values to some of
the results from your career quizzes on the first page of the Conversation. I also noticed on your
profile that you're interested in going to culinary school, and I'd love to hear more about that
because it sounds like a really cool thing to do! I hope you're doing well and I'm looking forward
to hearing from you &lt;3Mentee 2021-12-08, 13:43: Hi! I've been thinking a lot lately about
culinary school, and I'm not too sure id like to go anymore.I already work in a restaurant and it
honestly has made me hate cooking. Its just stressful and annoying now and everyday I'm in pain or
tired. But i don't know if culinary school will be any different, over heard from a friend of mine
that the culinary course at UFV isn't the greatest and its really my only option financially.Mentee
2021-12-08, 13:56: my teacher has expressed to me that you need to have two modules open at a time.
Ive completed the first one, can you open another one for me.Mentor 2021-12-09, 14:21: Hi Payton,
yes of course I can open another module for you. Just before we move on, I've left some information
about a career you might be interested on the page where we did the career quizzes. Feel free to
read it and respond if you'd like, and then meet me on the next module!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

be working with aircrafts, I personally don't like planes. Although i do like choreographing and i
love dancing, I've done it since I was a kid. unfortunately though, I haven't danced in years, but I
want to in the following year.Mentor 2021-12-16, 18:40: Hi Adisan! No problem if the quizzes don't
match with what you visualize your career to be ! I think the quizzes here is kind of limited in
context of the career choices. Its really great seeing you like dancing! That's okay if you haven't
danced in years, you can get back into it on breaks! Are you planning to follow dancing classes in
the future maybe? Also, i want to ask about your 3 career options! Is it aircraft and dancing? Be
sure to note down the demand for the job, expected salary and regions where the job is needed for
the 3 career options as we will be discussing this in the next conversation! (You don't have to
include aircraft in the conversation after this if its not something you like :)) so we can just
talk about 2 of your career options! Looking forward to talk with you 😊 - Clara",,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-06, 15:41: I think I don't really check on my mental health, I always try to push it
off in conversations and try to mask myself so people don't worry about me. People think I'm this
shy, happy girl all the time that people don't take me seriously. I guess Its because I don't like
opening up to people because I'm afraid that people will use that power against me or turn on
me.Mentor 2021-12-10, 11:52: Hi adisan! I totally understand why it is hard sometimes to talk about
mental health and ended up hiding what we really feel. There are chances that people might judge us
or use that ""power"" against something else. However, if you are willing to tell me, how do you
really feel now? Are you okay now, or are you feeling some stress due to school, or exams, etc? You
don't have to tell me if you don't want to, that's totally fine too as its something personal ! 😊
however, i just want to know if you're doing well lately 😊 ~ClaraMentee 2021-12-14, 11:45: Hi! I
could be doing better, but I still feel on edge at school. It's really tough but I am doing better
then normal. I think It's because i have a test coming up and It's in science and science is not my
strong suit.Mentor 2021-12-16, 18:13: Hi Adisan ! I'm glad you're doing better at school! Test can
be really tough sometimes especially when its not in the area that you like/master. However, i know
you're doing your best at school so what ever the result is, you're doing great ! 😊 As an artist, it
is really hard not to be creative:"") like school work related to science maybe, or maths can
sometimes make people feel burn out. PS: i hope you don't feel burn out with school! But if you do,
the video gives really good insight on how to take care yourself when you feel burn out. For
example, if you're feeling stressed out, you can take time for yourself to chill a little by
drawing, listening to music, reading books or even do some metal working :) All in all, if you also
need a friend to talk to about school, or if you have any questions don't hesistate to tell me:) i
would gladly talk to you!",,"Mentor 2021-11-05, 23:42: Hi Adisan! My name is Clara, nice to meet you. I am a first-year student

an email from your teacher that we will be having 4 conversations, it is well being and safe care,

nice to connect with you! I'm doing great this morning, and you? How do you like Vancouver Island
University? I'm a super social person and spend most of my time with family and friends. I love
being a part of the school, I'm in leadership and plan to join Graduating Council. My favourite
class is Pre Calculus, because of how much of a challenge it is! I also love languages and am fluent

to talk with you, I look forward to hearing from you! Lillian:)Mentor 2021-11-06, 11:09: So great to
hear from you! Leadership, pre calc, fluent in 2 languages - you rock!! Sounds like you may be
taking on a big role with graduating council :) How did you learn French? Are you planning to take
calculus too, if your school offers it? VIU has been unique for sure. Academically, I love it! I
have the opportunity to get to know my professors because it's such a small campus. It's one of
those things I didn't totally understand/appreciate at first. But, I definitely missed out on the
first year experience of living in residence... All the social opportunities and chance to really
become you! Seeing that you are a social person, I think it's important to highlight that university
is not just about academics but all kinds of social things too! Hmm, I enjoy walks and coffee with
friends, hiking, and Grey's Anatomy in my limited free time these days, haha!Mentee 2021-11-08,

don't know any of the traditional stories about the land. If you know any traditional stories about
where you live I would love to hear them. I don't know if i agree but scientific and traditional
ways go well with each other and they could learn from each other. I haven't heard any traditional

to be presented with some lectures that featured Syilx storytellers. The Syilx are the First Nations
peoples on whose traditional territory I live. This is one of the first Syilx stories that I read
that was in a book that was gifted to us through the program (I'm going to try to remember how to
send a picture). I have since learned that there are many more stories about Coyote and that he can
be very powerful but also foolish, arrogant, and greedy. In your message you said ""I don't know if I

finished watching this video and reading the article about dis and mis-information and I had a
couple thoughts I wanted to get your opintion on and share with you. I think that using the terms
dis-information and mis-information instead of ""fake news"" makes sense, because the saying ""fake
news"" seems to have been overused and people don't really know what it means any more. I know that
when I hear it, I mostly just think of Trump, and that's not really what dis and mis - information
are about. What are your thoughts? I also thought about how the video talked about people sharing
mis and dis-information that bring up negative emotions like anger and frustration. I wonder why
that is? Why does society seem so eager to be negative? Do you think we are sometimes ""lazy
thinkers"" (in the video at the 3:15 mark). I thought the written article had some really good
information about how to decide if something is dis or mis-information, like a reverse Google image
search. I am thinking I might bookmark that article so that if I ever want to check information I
will have all the tools and information to be able to do it. If you look back, do you think you have
ever spread disinformation? I think I probably have, but not purposely. Now that I am more aware of
how it happens and how to spot it, I think I can check myself before sharing. This is a lot of
information so take your time and don't worry if you don't resond to everything I said, I just want
to hear your thoughts... bye for now!!!! CoralMentor 2021-12-02, 19:38: Your question was ""how scary
it is to walk around at night. Do you feel like you're gonna get robbed or beat up"" I think
sometimes it can feel less scary in a big city because there are generally more people around, and
more lights.. as long as you are smart about sticking to those places and not going down some dark
alley. But definitely it makes sense to make smart choices about where you are walking and when, and
of course nighttime always feels scarier no matter where you are (in my opinion)",,,"Mentor 2021-10-30, 13:20: Hi Zachaery! My name is Coral (my pronouns are she, her, hers) and I'm

live? Share one of these stories with your mentor In Fort Nelson the weather has been some of the
coldest I have ever experienced. It has been constantly -30 or worse which is not normal, in the
summer we had a heat wave. It was so bad I had to sleep in my camper because it had air conditioning
to keep me cold. During that heat wave the town was in chaos. All of the fans in town were sold out
and any form of air conditioning was nowhere to be found. It was something that I had never
experienced before and it was interesting to see how people reacted to all of the fans being sold
out. Logan Penney What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the
land? The difference is when you live on the land you know what’s really going on, you know the
hardships of living on the land and you have first hand experience with it. When you study it all
the information that you see might not be accurate and you can't really understand what happens
because you don’t have first hand experience. I look forward to hearing your opinion on these
topics, until next time, LoganMentor 2022-01-11, 01:25: Hey Logan! It is great to hear from you!
This summer was certainly a hot one! I remember I did not have air conditioning where I lived so I
took a lot of cold showers. We also recently had a large amount of snow which is not normal for our
region. With our environment constantly changing, I ask people who have lived in my community for a
long time what the weather used to be like. They tell me back in the day it rained a lot more and
that the forests were an essential way of living. Some questions I have for you would be 1) What was
your community climate/environment like back in the day? 2) With this wild weather we have been
experiencing, what do you think some of the challenges will be for your community?Mentee 2022-01-13,
11:36: To answer your first question I researched what the weather was like in the 1990’s, the
weather was both very cold and very warm depending on the month. In January the temperature averaged
roughly in the high -20’s and the low-30’s but towards the end we got hit with a rough few days
where it was -40 or worse. In February temperatures started to rise averaging the same weather as
January for the first bit but towards the end it got up to above 0 and snow started to melt. March
is when the first signs of summer were shown, it began to get above +10 and there was very little
snow after March. April was the exact same as March in the +10’s no higher no lower but the snow
melted. In May however temperatures started to sky rocket for the better, reaching over+30 around
the middle of the month and maintaining nice warm weather for the whole month. June and July werw
both the samw weather, both having +20’s to +30’s weather throughout the month and nothing too
special. August is when the weather spiked, it was the highest all year at over +40 for the majority
of the month. In September and Ocotber the weather started to go way down, going from over + 40 to +
10 by the end of October. In November and Decmber is when it becomes sub zero again getting to
around -10 in November and - 30 in December. Thank you for the question it was very fun to learn
more of the background of my community I look forward to hearing from you again Sincerly,

very surprised to learn some of the materials he mentioned that were invented by Indigenous people
are still used today in society. Personally for me, of the 7 teachings mentioned in the video, the
hardest for me would be humility. The reason why I say humulity is that sometimes it is diffuclt for
me to acknowledge that I cannot do everything on my own and have to reach out to others for help
Some questions I am interested to hear your thoughts on: Do you use or know of any indigenous

you think you are the best at or have the most trouble following and why?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047548854,1047549414,10/29/2021 19:16,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-01, 13:06: What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? What do recommend
for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? What was the most surprising thing you
learned about yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary education? How did
you keep track of all the money and all the payment dates?Mentor 2021-12-01, 18:32: Hey Shianne, 1.
I think the most challenging budgeting issue I had was figuring out the best way to pay for my
university education and housing. I had to choose between student loans, relying on my family to
help, trying to save my own money, or trying to get enough scholarships to cover everything. It can
be hard to know what the best financial options are for you, and it can change from year to year
when you're in school. 2. It can be really challenging to manage work and school, but it is totally
manageable. I didn't work for my first year at univeristy because I wanted to get used to the
workload and make sure I'd be able to balance everything. In my second year, I took four courses (a
full course load is usually five) and worked two to three days a week. The most important thing for
me was having a transparent relationship with my employer. I explained to him at the beginning that
I was a student with a heavy workload and I might need him to be flexible with my schedule around
exams and assignments. I made sure to take an extra day or two off during midterms or if I had a big
project, and if I had a week where my workload was really minor, I tried to pick up extra shifts. 3.
The most important thing I learned about money management during first year was that it's important
to budget money each month to have fun! Its easy to think that you just need enough money for food,
housing, tuition, and books, but there are always extra expenses. Budgeting a few hundred dollars a
month (or less, or more, depending on your needs) in order to go thrifting or get dinner with
friends or get that starbucks in the morning is a really good way to be kind to yourself wihtout
blowing your budget. Also, textbooks cost SO MUCH money. If you can get them secondhand or rent them
for th semester online, its a great way to save money. 4. To keep track of all the dates, I set
reminders in my calendar on my phone. Most universities will send out emails about fee reminders as
well so it's really important to check your email regularly. The best way I found to keep track of
the money I earned, and this year the student loans I took out, is to have a chequing account that
you transfer money into when you need to pay rent or tuition, and a savings account not linked to
your debit card that you keep almost all the money in. Its also really helpful to organise a meeting
with your bank when you're getting ready to go to school, because they will usually give you a
student deal so you don't need to pay fees, and they can provide excellent financial advice about
how to manage everything and open the right kinds of bank accounts for you. I hope that's not too
much info about everything, and that it's helpful!Mentor 2021-12-01, 18:43: Hey Shianne, I also
wanted to mention, I have exams and final papers coming up over the next two weeks. I should still
be able to respond to messages reliably, but it might take me an extra day or two to get back to you

which sucks because there's a lot of drama. I also don’t like how there’s nothing to do here. There
are 3,370 people living here so there isn’t much opportunity to do anything. I guess I do like some
things though, I like how my friends are always free to hang out. I like how it would only take 10
minutes to walk across my entire town. I've done it before and it’s quite convenient. I really can’t
think of anything else I like about here because It genuinely sucks. I have always wondered when you
move to a big city how you know where everything is, because I would get lost.Mentee 2021-11-30,
15:15: Hi Kira! We watched a video in my class but the link didn't show up but these are the
questions and my response will be below: What do you think the director of the film was trying to
communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? What, if
anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? How did you feel while watching the
video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? In what ways does
your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving
to the city for post-secondary schooling? I think the director of this video was trying to
communicate how different living in the country is than living in a city. It's more independent
while the city is more clustered with people. They are both very similar in terms of the hard work
it keeps to manage them. I didn’t relate to anything really besides the fact I've made a drum like
they did in the beginning of the video and I didn’t really feel anything from the video. I didn’t
really have an emotional response either.Mentor 2021-12-01, 18:40: Hey Shianne, I totally get what
you're saying about not liking living in a small town. I had the same experience in highschool, and
while it was sometimes nice to know everyone, it was really hard to deal with never having any
privacy and how much drama everyone created. I find when everyone knows you they're more likely to
think its okay to get involved in your life in ways that aren't acceptable in the big city unless
someone is actually your friend. I loved certain aspects of growing up in a small town, but I've
definitely been happier and healthier since moving to the city. It was a big adjustment, but there's
always fun things to do here, and you get to choose friends with the same interests as you that are
healthy instead of just the people who are nearby. My mental health definitely improved when I came
to the city and could surround myself with genuine kind people. As to getting lost, I know it seems
like it would happen a lot, but now that we have phones its almost impossible. It can be really
scary trying to navigate, but google maps has never steered me wrong. I don't have a car, but public
transit is usually way better in big cities than in small towns, and there are transit apps for bus
times that are really useful. If I'm ever anxious in a new part of the city or while transiting, I
always make sure I have $20-30 extra dollars in case I get really lost and need to call a cab or an
Uber. In a big city you're never alone and can always ask for help from the people around you if you
do get lost or overwhelmed, people are usually happy to help. Hope this helps! Let me know if you
have more questions about city living (buying groceries, eating out, etc)",,"Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:51: Q1: Do you agree that “scientific” knowledge is usually viewed as better
or more advanced than “traditional” knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what
impact do you think this change could have? Scientific knowledge is usually viewed as something that
is better than Traditional knowledge,Which isn’t entirely true.Traditional Knowledge is very useful
and can be very advanced because it has been passed down from many generations and verified by many
elders. In my culture, (I’m Dene first nations) any traditional knowledge of the land is only passed
down by elders, so it’s more factual. I think the view of scientific knowledge being better is
changing as archeologists and scientists are realizing that the people who once lived on the land
know all of the secrets and things about the land. If people started to listen to the stories about
the land they would have a lot of help doing whatever investigation they’re trying to do. Q2: Do you
know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your
mentor Where I live, It gets extremely cold. Last week it was -50. There are many stories about
people casually walking across the town in this cold and simply just dying on the sidewalk. I’m sure
this is not the type of story you were expecting but I was in a panic and this is all I could think
of haha. Apparently it happens every year or two, there's actually a grave down the street from my
house from where someone literally just dropped dead from walking to the store in -45.Mentor
2022-01-10, 22:13: Hey Shianne, Super interesting observations about scientific and traditional
knowledge. I definitely see the shift that you bring up happening in the sciences here at UBC. There
is a very prominent focus on Indigenous stewardship of the land and discussions of the usage of
unceded territories, especially in the forestry and Land and Food Systems programs here on the
coast. In the intro biology and environmental biology classes I've taken, there are modules where we
discuss the traditional names and Indigenous uses of the various coastal plants that grow in this
area, and there is also a focus on how land has been used and how Indigenous perspectives can teach
us to better care for and steward the land that is so impacted by climate change. I think that a
balance between the two forms of knowledge can only be beneficial for everyone. Here where I live in
Vancouver, I'm living on traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm
(Musqueam) People, and am adjacent to unceded ancestral Coast Salish and Tsleil-Waututh territory as
well. Acknowledging and understanding that the land I live on has a history separate from and much
older than ""Canada"" as it is defined is very important, in my opinion, and I'm looking forward to
learning more about the peoples who originally lived and continue to live here. That story about
people freezing to death is intense, that must be somewhat scary conditions to live in, especially
considering how cold it has been lately. I don't know any good stories about my area, scary or
otherwise, but I hope everyone where you live is doing their best to stay warm and safe. And if
you'd like to share any specific experiences about what its like being Dene first nations, I'd be
really interested to talk more about how that has impacted you growing up and your identity, but no
pressure at all!Mentee 2022-01-14, 11:23: Hi Kira, Growing up Dene has had some impact on me, but
not too much. I grew up off reservation with my grandparents but I’ve always practiced our
traditional ways of the land and our spirituality. Unfortunately when I was young I was very
embarrassed of who I was because my group of friends from kindergarten to grade 7 were not people of
colour and the thought they was I did things was weird. Now I am very proud of where I come from,
and I take a lot of pride in my culture. I raise a lot of awareness about MMIW (Missing and Murdered
Indiginous women) and about residential school because I have close family that were survivors. Let
me know if you have any questions :) Looking forward to hearing from you.Mentor 2022-01-18, 18:33:
Hey Shianne, that is so amazing. Thank you for sharing that with me! It can definitely be super
challenging to know how to embrace different parts fo your identity, especially if they carry any
kind of trauma or discrimination. I am white so I don't have that kind of shared experience and
can't speak to the struggles it must create, but my grandparents are both Yiddish Holocaust
survivors and I have the option to identify as and think of myself as Jewish. I don't, mostly
because I'm personally not religious, but integrating and exploring that cultural heritage, trauma,
and the risk of antisemetism (hatred of Jewish people) has been a central theme in my own identity.
I think its so important to embrace those cultural roots and explore traditions that you have a
blood connection to, and the fact that you've taken it a step further to raise awareness about MMIW
is something I think you should be very proud of. It can be hard to stand strong in your beliefs in
the face of discrimination from peers, but I hope that the attitudes of the people around you have
changed and that you can embody the pride for your ancestry. Best, KiraMentee 2022-01-28, 14:36: Hi
Kira! Unfortunately today is the last day of the sumester and my last day in this class so I guess
this is a goodbye. I wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to mentor me during the
time I had to use this program. It has been lovely talking to you! Best wishes, Shianne. :)
&lt;3Mentor 2022-01-28, 14:42: I'm sad to see you go Shianne but it has been my pleasure to chat
with you and get to know a bit about you. You seem like a very self-possessed and mature person, and
I am sure that you'll do really well with whatever path you choose for the future. All the best to
you, KiraMentee 2022-02-01, 15:14: Hello, Wondering if you can please complete the module wrapping
up? Thanks Management",,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 13:32: Hey Shianne, thanks for checking off the conversations we're gonna work
with! I've gone ahead and unlocked Dis- and Misinformation for you, I'll let you work through it and
start the discussion if you have any questions or wanna talk about specific aspects of it (fake
news, conspiracy theories, politics, I'm here for it all) I look forward to it!Mentee 2021-11-18,
12:13: Response to: How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and
share on social media? Personally I think that emotions play a huge role in things that get clicked
on, posted or shared on social media. A lot of the time people who advertise things are trying to
strike emotions in people like empathy, anger, sadness etc. They rely on an emotional response to
increase the popularity rather than the advertisements actual content. People are most likely to
click on posts that trigger strong emotions and they will share it with people. People tend to share
things that make them feel validated, or things that make them feel like their point is right and
most times posts are tailored to other posts you've interacted with. I won’t try to act all modest
and say that I don’t fall for this as well. A lot of posts I share and click on are things that I
have an emotion towards, social media is a constant loop of emotions being triggered to improve
their own post value and unfortunately everyone falls for it.Mentor 2021-11-20, 19:31: Hey Shianne,
those are excellent observations, very well articulated! Yes, the dangers of ""clickbait"" headlines
are definitely the way they manipulate your emotions. I think the best way to tackle any online
media is just to engage critically with it and do your best to use your common sense, making efforts
to do extra research or looking for reliable sources. That said, there's nothing wrong with sharing
posts or stories that play on your emotions, and so long as you're checking to make sure whatever
you're sharing isn't false info, its fine to click on things that evoke strong emotion. Side note,
I've unlocked the other two convos that your teacher wants you to complete next week, so I look
forward to chatting with you about those.Mentee 2021-11-22, 16:20: Hi kira! I totally agree with
you, as long as the things you're sharing isn't hurting anyone its okay. Also thank you for
unlocking the other conversations. :)",,,"Mentor 2021-10-31, 17:41: Hi Shianne, My name is Kira, and I'm your ementor, it's really nice to
e-meet you! I'm a 22 year old student at UBC in Vancouver, but I also grew up in a small town, so
I'm familiar with the struggles of rural communities. (Highschool sucks, generally, and you know
everyone, which is a blessing and a curse). Just to start us off, is there anything specific that
you're hoping to get out of this program? Any conversations other than the ones that the teacher
assigned that you'd like to discuss? And, did you do anything fun for Halloween? I'm here to help in
any way that I can; I know this program is part of your class, but I hope it can be fun and
rewarding as well. Let me know if you have any questions:)Mentee 2021-11-08, 16:55: Hi Kira, It is
nice to e-meet you too! I didn’t really do anything for Halloween, I just hung out with my
boyfriend. Halloween is my favourite time of the year, I keep my house (specifically my basement
since I have the whole thing) deccorated for Halloween all year long, it matches my style haha.
There isn’t anything too specific I would like to talk about, but I would like to share a recipe
with you. I really like brownies and this is quite a good recipe :). ½ cup butter 1 cup white sugar
2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder ½ cup all-purpose flour ¼ teaspoon
salt ¼ teaspoon baking powder Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour an 8-inch square
pan.In a large saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar, eggs, and 1
teaspoon vanilla. Beat in 1/3 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup flour, salt, and baking powder. Spread batter into
prepared pan.Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. To Make Frosting, combine 3 tablespoons
softened butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa, honey, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 cup confectioners'
sugar. Stir until smooth. Frost brownies while they are still warm. Brownies have always been my
favorite, my grandma always used to make them for me and maybe you will like the recipe. I’m looking
forward to speaking to you! My teacher has asked us to begin with the disinformation conversation.
Sincerely, Shianne :)Mentor 2021-11-08, 18:03: Hey Shianne, its great to hear from you! That's what
I did for Halloween too, I dressed up and my boyfriend and I handed out candy to all the kids in his
complex. I'm the same way, Halloween is absolutely my fave holiday! Its funny, in my second year of
university my roommate bought a whole bunch of Halloween decorations and we left them up until we
moved out in July. There were little ghost figurines and pumpkins dangling from the ceiling at
Christmas and it was awesome. I love brownies, I'll have to try that recipe and I'll let you know
how it goes! I'm lactose intolerant though so I'll have to adapt it to be dairy free, but I do a lot
of baking so it won't be hard. Thanks for sharing it with me! I will unlock the disinformation
conversation first then, but I think we have to do the working through this program portion first,
so I'm gonna go ahead and move forward to that, and then once we're done we can do the conversation
choices and get started!Mentee 2021-11-10, 13:17: Hi Kira, That is so fun! I am also lactose
intolerant so thats understandable.I also really like baking, I bake a lot with my friends. My

for you, I'm very sorry! I really enjoyed getting to know you and learn more about you, and I wish
you the best of luck in all your future adventures. I hope you got some helpful advice from this

keeping traditions while moving from rural to urban areas away from your family. My family and I
have a tradition of waking up early on Christmas morning then going to my grandmas for breakfast and
after that we spend the day outside doing activities. How would I do this tradition if I lived in
the city? What kind of traditions do you and your family do? Best Wishes, RoyMentor 2021-12-17,
03:06: Hey Roy! Great to hear from you! Yes I definitely agree. Taking part in your traditions is
very important and something you should strive to do. If you will be in a different city then I
assume it might be a bit difficult to go and see your grandma on Christmas, however, you can still
help keep the tradition alive by giving her a FaceTime call or another method of communication.
Also, I am sure you will make some friends in your new area and you can perhaps spend the day
outside doing activities with them! I also take part in a number of traditions as well such as Eid
and Ramadan and doing so makes me feel very happy :)Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:30: Hello Aziz, Hope your

are well, We are back in school now and that means we are back on the mentor program. I know quite a
few stories about the land where I live. Where I live it gets very cold in the winter and also
pretty hot in the summer.It is usually partly cloudy or pure sunny days which is super nice. A big
event that happened just north of us was the flooding of the Mackenzie River. This flood happened
because during the spring the ice on the rivers begins to break up and starts flowing down the
river, if the flowing ice meets ice that is still solid it can cause a jam. As more and more ice
jams up the water levels at the jam rises greatly, But once the jam let's go and starts flowing it
is very catastrophic. Water levels at the village of Fort Simpson NWT went up past the 20 foot high
banks and still so much farther than that flooding the town- Not to mention the giant ice chunks
that cause destruction as they float through the water and get pushed up on the land. My family's
tugboat and barge business suffered many damages to our equipment that costs lots of money to
repair. What is a story that comes from the area you live that involve the landscape? Thanks,
RoyMentor 2022-02-02, 11:46: Hi Roy, Great to hear from you! Thats very interesting to hear about
the flooding that your area has experienced. I currently live in Abbotsford and in November 2021,
the entire Fraser Vallry endured a historic flooding that destroyed many farmland and houses. We had
a tremendous amount of rain that occurred which caused rivers to overflow, and we had a river from
the US, which is called the Nooksack River, overflow across the border into the Fraser Valley. It
was a really scary experience as roads were closed off, houses were under water, and the highway was
closed. You can read about it if you do a quick Google search. Thanks Aziz",,"Mentor 2021-11-22, 01:39: Hi Roy, Please let me know if you're able to access the Misinformation

this class so I find myself on another topic before we got to finish our last conversation. This one
is about self care. I believe self care is important. Some ways I take care of myself is getting
good sleep, eating nutritious foods and drinking plenty of water. What are your thoughts on self
care and how do you practice it? Thanks, Roy",,"Mentee 2021-11-08, 16:58: Hello Aziz I hope you are doing well. Do you get snow where you live? Up
here at Fort Nelson we have gotten a good amount of snow in the past week. I am getting excited for
skidooing. Have you ever riddden a skidoo? My teacher has asked us to begin with the disinformation
conversation. RoyMentor 2021-11-10, 05:10: Hi Roy, Great to hear from you! Yes, it snows a lot in
Abbotsford. It typically starts around January-February, so it’s super cool to hear that it’s
already snowing in Fort Nelson. Wow! I actually haven’t heard of a skidoo before, maybe you can tell
me about it. Disinformation is a great topic to start with, especially since it is so prevalent in
todays society. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dangers of misinformation as evidence by a
proportion of the population opposing health measures &amp; guidelines put in place by health
officials. I believe that tackling misinformation requires a multidimensional approach that should
be done using education, collaborating with members of the community, and fostering trust within the
community. It’s also important to teach others how to critically assess information for its validity
as there is a ton of information out there on the internet but not everything is based on
evidence-based research. What do you think about disinformation?Mentee 2021-11-10, 13:30: Hello Aziz
I read that you don't know what a skidoo is, It is a machine or an expensive toy essentially. They
have engines in all different sizes from 50cc to 900cc. They have a track and 2 skis for traversing
the snow. Some places that you would know such as Revelstoke and Golden are very popular for
snowmobling. As for the mis and disinformation subject I am not too educated on that. Could you
please unlock the Mis and Disinformation link on the conversation wheel please RoyMentor 2021-11-22,

with a flood and so I was currently dealing with some emergencies because of that. I hope you have
been doing well! I have now unlocked the Misinformation conversation. I look forward to discussing
it further with you :) Please feel free to ask any questions. Thanks, Aziz",,,,"Mentee 2021-11-30, 15:26: Hello Aziz, I hope you are doing well amid the flooding down in your area.
I was ill last week and I decided just to rest and not focus on homework so I will be ignoring the
mis and disinformation topic right now. I will be talking to you about it soon for homework. We will
be talking about moving from rural areas to urban areas. I love being away from a big population
because you get to know everyone, I also like being rural because I can go skidooing and camping and
drive around in the wilderness. The scenery here is incredible because there is no pollution or huge
buildings. There are a couple things that are not good such as having to travel far for medical
emergencies and basic tests because our hospital doesn’t have enough workers so our testing
facilities have been shut down. Schooling here is also not good. We have to travel far for
university and any higher education than little college courses and grade 12. I was wondering how I
could adjust to having not near as much privacy in the city as I would in a small town. Thanks,
RoyMentor 2021-12-03, 06:00: Hi Roy, Great to hear from you! Hope you have recovered well from your
illness :) I certainly understand the big jump it would be from a rural city to an urban city. I
used to live in a small town myself and when I moved to a bigger city it definitely was a huge
change in my life that took time to adjust to. The great thing is that there are so many resources
available in urban cities to help make you comfortable at your own pace. Universities offer free
mentors for 1st year students so that they can have guidance and support all year with any help they
need. Have you thought about what university you would like to go to and what program you want to
study? Thanks, Aziz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when everything in post secondary education costs money. You need to pay for tuition, and on top of
that, books, lecture packages, perhaps even specific apps or devices for in class discussions! Over
time I learned that there were some tricks to save money (which most people won't openly tell you)
and I wish I knew them back when I started. To start, how do you currently manage your finances? Do
you do any budgeting? I did not think about any budgeting in my first year of university and the
stress was not very fun...Mentee 2021-12-01, 13:32: Personally I don't really have any finances to
manage, And I don't do any budgeting. After having read and watched all the Anchor text videos and
articles provided I don't really have any oustanding questions to ask about paying for school and
such, But it is still quite interesting to learn any other ways people have payed for school and
managed their money over time. So how did you keep track of all the money and payment dates for
things?, And what was the most surprising thing you learned about yourself and money management in
your first year of you post-secondary education?.Mentor 2021-12-04, 17:46: Honestly I still haven't
had everything figured out. I usually write down everything on sticky notes on my laptop, perhaps 1
sticky note for finances, 1 stick note for assignments, 1 sticky note for exams, and synchronize
them across my devices. I remember back in highschool, lecture materials and books are mostly free,
but in university, there are many books required especially in first year when you need to take a
wide range of courses on general topics. I bought them all in first year thinking that they are
compulsory, but later on realized that many professors are required by university to have a booklist
(for commercial purposes) and they don't actually require them! Actually most of them can even be
found online for free! Another would be managing food expenses. Even if you eat out only once in a
while, food places on campus are usually super overpriced and the quality is mediocre at best.
Bringing your food is the only way to go if you ask me.",,,"Mentee 2022-01-11, 14:32: After reading through the anchor text and watching the provided video I
must say that there is a heavy difference between simply studying the land and living on it. Living
on the land let’s you experience the things that happen on and in the lands while simply studying it
can give you some misleading information depending on what and how you're studying stuff. Also,
knowing the stories of the lands you live on can drastically change how you live on them, knowing
stories about locations people died or traditional grounds can make people avoid them or draw people
closer to them. Personally I don’t know any stories about the land I live on at all, i’ve never
really payed any attention to them, and if I did I no longer remember them. Now, Scientific
knowledge being seen as superior to Traditional knowledge is extremely untrue where I live as around
every corner you can always hear about someone who doesn’t believe in these new vaccines for
covid-19 and it’s variants, some don’t even believe that the virus exists at all!, though slowly
there is a change happening that probably won’t make a huge impact on anything around here, but will
most certainly make things just a bit better Finally to end this off i’ll say that Scientific
knowledge and Traditional knowledge are probably seen as in conflict most of the time as they really
do seem quite opposing, the biggest thing I know of this are the native creation stories, such as
the sky woman who fell down from the sky islands through a hole and started a new life on the back
of a turtle… From scientific knowledge that should be absolutely impossible, but other than the
video on the Hauyat, I haven’t seen any time where Scientific and Traditional knowledge worked
together.Mentor 2022-01-12, 15:59: I do agree with you that living on the land allows you to
experience the things that happen on the land. I guess that creates an emotional connection that
force you to view things from a more personal perspective. When studying the land, you are most
likely getting information from other people and viewing the land from a more objective, outside
perspective, so it is very important to decide whether the source is credible such that we won't be
misled. But does that mean if you live on the land, every piece of knowledge you gain from your own
experience must be more trustworthy? For example, there are many things we can't really experience
ourselves, and must rely on other people like scientists to tell us, just like the existence of
bacteria or the virus. We know there is something that can make us sick when we actually get sick,
but to know that the thing that makes us sick is a new virus, we are relying on other people's
discovery.Mentor 2022-01-12, 16:10: On the other hand, my experience with traditional knowledge vs
scientific knowledge is a bit different from yours. While there are some people who disregard
scientific knowledge like the antivaxxers, the majority believes in scientific knowledge more than
traditional knowledge. Interestingly, since I am studying subjects related to biology and medicine,
I actually learned that a lot of medicine developed in the last century are actually inspired by
traditional medicinal knowledge! For example, cinchona has been used to treat malaria for centuries
and their usage is spread across the globe. Even though there are no formal experiments testing it,
people still use it without fully understanding what chemicals are in cinchona. Turns out it is a
chemical called quinine that cures malaria, and the traditional medicine is not just a placebo!
While traditional knowledge is not properly proven in a laboratory, I think we can still take them
as inspirations for future experimental ideas.Mentee 2022-01-13, 11:25: That's actually a very
interesting thing to know, I had no idea Cinchona was even a thing before this. Also I do agree that
not every bit of knowledge learned from personal experiences are 100% true as there is always the
possibility to misinterpret something learned from said experiences that could lead you to believe
in false information accidentally formed by your own self, So I guess in total both Scientific
knowledge and Traditional knowledge are pretty equal in their ways.Mentor 2022-01-16, 16:20: Ya I
think personal experience or second hand information, scientific knowledge or traditional knowledge
can all be fake. I guess instead of setting a dogma about who to believe or what particular fact to
believe, the more important thing we should focus on is our attitude towards any kind of information
in general.Mentor 2022-01-22, 01:52: Hello Riley, it was nice knowing you this semester! I know that

interesting to learn that so many people can be so easily fooled by such an easy to see through lie.
Personally i'm very glad I haven't been mislead by fake information like this before, from what I
can remember at least. And to answer at least one of those questions near the end of the anchor
text, I believe that your emotions play a huge role in what you click on and watch while your
online. Quite often people clicking on certain things are only doing so because their vision is
clouded by some heavy emotion such as anger or sadness. I myself have pointed out some
misinformation to my parents while they go through facebook, but it often doesn't change their
thoughts as I don't make the misinformation clear enough for them to believe me.Mentor 2021-11-21,
02:32: Yes you are absolutely right! I realized that your emotions would make you mroe inclined to
click particular links and read into certain topics. It also does not help that we are constantly
bombarded with information, and that social media has become one of the major sources of information
which uses computer algorithms to further tilt the balance towards displaying topics we already have
an opinion for. And for people like our parents, they are not used to countering these algorithms by
filtering what they receive on social media. However, it is also important for us to remember that
perhaps one day we might become just like them, though we would continue to think that we are seeing
through the lies on social media. What do you think we should do to stay away from misinformation or
disinformation? A simple google search might show you articles with information supporting both
sides. How would you know which side is real?Mentor 2021-11-30, 01:29: Hey Riley! Just wondering if
everything is okay?","Mentee 2021-12-13, 16:34: After having read through the anchor text and provided article and video,
I don't really have any response to the topic or any questions about it, But to complete my
assignment I will say that In Self care having good time management skills is very important as it
helps to provide set times for working and taking the proper time for breaks so that you don't
overwork yourself resulting in burnout.Mentor 2021-12-16, 02:09: You are totally right! As a student
juggling between school and work and other extracurricular activities, it is very easy to overlook
the importance of breaks. I have come to realize that sometimes being unproductive is good for
recharging. Also never compromise on sleep! Whenever I need to stay up for an assignment, I
immediately feel the effect since the whole following week I would feel groggy and would not be able
to follow what my professors say as much.Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:25: I rarely ever compromise on sleep
hours, but when I do it doesn' ever really have any noticeable effects on me as it's usually only an
extra hour to finish up a conversation with someone or finish a game. Now that this conversation has
been completed could you please unlock the different ways of knowing conversation please.",,"Mentor 2021-11-01, 01:15: Hello Riley, nice to meet you! 😊 I am Horton and I will be your mentor.

called Stardew Valley in the summer 😉 So what are you studying? What do you do during your free
time? Ask me anything and I will do my best to answer them.Mentor 2021-11-07, 18:19: Hey Riley! Is

replying to you earlier. There seems to have been some issues with my mentorcity website and some
confusion. Let me reply to your messages that you sent me earlier: See my reply in Italics and
underlined, after your reply to mis/dis information: mis/dis information How much of a role do your
emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? My emotions play apart
because I click funny things not sad I think you are doing a very good thing by ignoring other
topics on social media and only checking out funny topics. That keeps you happy and lighter in
emotions. Good that you are ignoring any rumours or other news on social media as social media is
surely not a spot from where anyone must get the information. It is always better to check out the
proper news channels or read 'editorial' sections from any daily news papers. Do you think you are a
careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? Not that i know of
Yes. You are taking up a right approach. You can always listen to or watch any kind of content, but
always verify it from credible sourcs like news papers, proper news channels and programs. What are
your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you
for sharing misleading false information? no This again proves that you are on the right direction.
Ignore the wrong content and follow credible sources only for news. How important do you think these
critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student? important You are right
again. It is always good to verify any news, ideas, and information from news channels, news papers,
credible journals, etc., and then think about different views/perspectives, and make your own
perspectives about them. Thank you Riley for sending these information. I am looking forward to the
discussion that we will do from now on. Let me know if you have any questions or ideas that you need
help with. Have a good one! ArvindMentor 2021-12-06, 22:44: Hello Riley, Those are some good
information to know about you and your likings and dislikes. I would also like to know what other
things do you like about Fort Nelson. Liking snowmobile and quad trail to ride and fun places to
camp is good. But what about people around you? What about your school, teachers, and your peers?
Could you tell me something that is so good and special about them? I understand that you miss
McDonald, Walmart, and Canatian Tire nearby that gives more shopping options. But you can also be
happy that you get to use and purchase locally made items. What do you think? Eager to know your

one, still in high school at the moment. What do recommend for trying to balance part-time work with
school workload? Work at restaurant as a host or server by night after school than in the day go to
school. Also homework u could wake up earlier or at lunch. What was the most surprising thing you
learned about yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary education? Ive
learned that money comes and goes but one the key things is to save. How did you keep track of all
the money and all the payment dates? Yeah for the little i have in high school.Mentor 2021-12-07,
21:31: This is such an important topic! What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? The
most challenging budgeting issue for me was the fact that I had to take out a loan for my schooling.
It was hard to know how to save money and when I was going to pay it back after school. What do
recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? I recommend trying to find a
job that lets you study while you are working. For example, I had a job in the mail room at my
university which had a lot of down time where I could study. I would also suggest looking into time
management skills so that you can balance having a job and work. What was the most surprising thing
you learned about yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary education? That
I spent a lot of money on pointless things!!! Save your money and only buy something if you can
afford it and if you REALLY want it!!! How did you keep track of all the money and all the payment
dates? Have a savings account and a spreadsheet that helps you know what you can afford and what you
can spend money on. These spreadsheets can be found online of you can do it with your parents or
councillor!Mentee 2022-01-13, 11:25: What do you think the difference is between studying the land
and living on the land? The person on the land living there has more experience as someone studying
about the land. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of
these stories with your mentor No, i havent heard any stories about the land. How might knowing the
stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? Do you agree that “scientific”
knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than “traditional” knowledge? Is this a view
that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? Science is viewed as
better than traditional knowledge. Why do you think “scientific” knowledge and “traditional”
knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this
story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show “scientific” and “traditional” knowledges
working together? There in conflicted Because people usually ignore traditional knowledge and only
learn scientific knowledge.Mentor 2022-01-18, 21:08: What do you think the difference is between
studying the land and living on the land? Studying the land looks at the complexities within the
land and how everything on the land works together. Living on the land is doing one's part to work
with and protect the land. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share
one of these stories with your mentor Hmmmmm, not that I know of. How might knowing the stories of
the land we live on change how we treat the land? Knowing stories will teach us what works and what
doesn't work while taking care of the land. Knowledge about the land comes from traditional stories,
and they will help us understand how to best take care of the land. Do you agree that “scientific”
knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than “traditional” knowledge? Is this a view
that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I do think ""scientific""
knowledge is viewed as better or more advanced because it uses technology that people trust more
than oral stories. It also is seen as having more facts or truth because science is able to provide
evidence for why it is a certain way. This view may be changing, especially in the scope of the
climate emergency because ""traditional"" knowledge of the land is what is needed to reverse the
climate emergency. Furthermore, there was no climate emergency when the knowledge was only
""traditional"" many years ago. Why do you think “scientific” knowledge and “traditional” knowledge
are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories - other than this story of the
archeological project in Hauyat - that show “scientific” and “traditional” knowledges working
together? Mostly answered in the previous question, but mostly because scientific knowledge is seen
as being more factual because it has evidence. Traditional knowledge is based more on trust because
its mostly oral stories, so some people may choose not the believe it, though this also happens with
scientific knowledge too.....Mentee 2022-01-25, 15:38: What does it mean to study something? To
learn about a topic and learn about new things What do you do when you study? Take notes to read
over and understand the topic more What have you been previously taught about how to study? Find
different ways to take notes and which way that works for you, also how being taught(hands on,
Computer, paper and pencil)works best for you. Another thing is that taking time to study the topic
is affective, when your rushing and trying to learn fast. Its most likey you won’t succeed. Have you
ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those
skills? Not really but what works best for me is key notes, also explaining with a couple sentences
on what am researching. Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. Joding
down little topics about the thing am studying, and putting a couple sentences on what little topic
each is. It works best for me because its little things that tie into the big subject that am
studying and explains a little bit on what each thing is. Which strategy do you think would be most
challenging for you? Why would this be the case? Cramming, the case is that when to much words are
crammed into 1 page, its too much and its not effective for my learning. Thats what i’ve learned
using that stratege. Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would
make this additional strategy effective? Not really, all the strategies that were listed were pretty
decent and helps most people to study. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these
strategies? If am struggling with a topic I’m studying than I would try another way to learn and see
if it works or not in the long run. Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you
trying these strategies? Not reallyMentor 2022-01-26, 16:53: What does it mean to study something?
To study means to learn an understanding of how something works. It involves gathering information
about a certain topic and using that information to understand how and why something is the way that
it is. What do you do when you study? I like to actively read when I study, which means I like to
highlight, underline, and take notes while reading. I also like to listen to classical music and put
my phone away, because those things help me focus. What have you been previously taught about how to
study? When I was in high school, everyone was taught the same ways to study. As I got older, there
was more teaching about the different ways we can study and how it is different for everyone. For
example, I am a visual learner so I understand the most when I see the words and write my own notes
rather than when I am listening to someone talk. I was also taught to minimize distractions and to
study in a room where you do not sleep in or hang out much in, so that you can think of it as your
study room (this increases productivity I have heard!). Once in a while though I used to study in my
bed.... dont tell my teachers! Lol Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the
video? What was your experience with those skills? Unfortunately, the video is telling us not to
cram, but I have done a lot of cramming in my day. It makes total sense why it is not the most
effective, but I found it hard not to cram when there was little time in between learning something
and the time of my exam. I definitely ask a lot of questions which like the video said, is a really
good thing! The word association has helped me a lot too. More in the sense of I like when my notes
aren't just full of words so I try and draw pictures that relate to the words too. Which strategy
seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. Recalling what I know and reinforcing my
knowledge seems like it would be the most useful thing. Often when I read something, I think I will
remember it forever but then I quickly learn that this is not the case and that I need to reflect on
my learnings more often so that they stick better in my brain! Which strategy do you think would be
most challenging for you? Why would this be the case? Cramming seems almost impossible not to do
with how the school system is layed out.... Often times in university I wouldn't have time to space
out my studying rather than cramming it all in a day or two. Are there any strategies you would add
to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? Have minimal
distractions. Putting your phone in a different room, telling your mom or siblings not to bother
you, walk your dog before so that he or she isn't distracting you.... etc. When you have
distractions around you, it's really hard for your brain to tune into what you are actually trying
to focus on. How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? I will definitely
try these strategies for whatever I need to study next! Can you think of anything that might get in
the way of you trying these strategies? I think it would take some energy and learning what works
best for me but incorporating these strategies would be for my benefit, so no I dont think there is
anything stopping me!","Mentor 2021-12-01, 20:28: Hey Lenora! This is a really great topic. I have lived both in a city and
a rural area so I know what they are both like :) Three things I like about living in a rural area.
Living in a rural area usually means it is more quiet and that there is more privacy! I think this
is nice because sometimes a city can be too loud and everyone knows what you are up to. It is a way
better life for my dogs because there is so much space to free roam! Do you have a dog? I do! She is
a Mexican mutt named Honey. There is more room to have a vegetable garden so you can grow your own
food :) Two things I don’t like. I don't like that it takes longer to drive to get groceries or see
friends and family. I don't like this because it takes up a lot of time and money to pay for gas. It
does get lonely some times because there isn't the hustle bustle of the city at your fingertips!
This can be hard sometimes because being lonely isn't fun at all!!!!Mentee 2021-12-03, 11:11: What
do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between
living in the country and living in a city? That living in the country is calm and living in a city
is busy, everyone is in a rush in the city but in the country you can learn and understand culture
in the bush. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? Yeah, because
i live in Fort Nelson which is in the country but in the summer i usually go to Edmonton which is
city and its totally different from country. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts
of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? It showed two different types of
life styles and how it was like in rural and urban worlds. In what ways does your emotional response
to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for
post-secondary schooling? I would like living in the city because everyday is different and
everything is constantly moving and charging in the city.Mentor 2021-12-05, 21:10: Hey! I think it's
really cool that you get to experience life in the city as well as the country. Not many people get
to have both!! You make such a good point about how everything is changing and moving around in the
city... I totally agree but wasn't able to think about that point myself. Do you think you will ever
get stressed in the city or too overwhelmed?",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-11, 11:13: Hey Lenora! This is just an important topic. I think it's so key to learn
about this early on because our world revolves around technology and easy access to information, and
we can be fooled so easily if we aren't careful. Here are my thoughts on the following questions:
How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? I
feel like my emotions definitely play a big role in what I look at and share on social media. A lot
of the times, the things I click on are things that I feel passionate about or things that I feel
like our world has a problem with (for example, I would click on something about Indigenous groups
being treated unfairly in Canada). Honestly, I feel like a good way to go about trying to see if
something is true or not, is to always believe something that you see on social media to NOT be
true, until you are proven otherwise (AKA, until you do the research yourself on something, assume
what you are seeing is not true). Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you
ever been drawn in by misinformation? I have 100% been drawn in by misinformation. And even worse, I
haven't always done the research to fact check if things are right or wrong, so sometimes I'll bring
it up in conversation and I look so silly for believing it! I think it's really cool to be involved
in current events and what is going on in the world. I find what I see over Instagram, TikTok,
Snapchat or any other social media platforms like those, there is SOOOOO much false information! So
annoying, because it is such an easy way to learn things as opposed to reading the newspaper or
reading longer articles on news applications, like CBC. But in the long run, it's worth it to look
elsewhere for information. What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has
anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false information? I am not always
comfortable pointing out to someone that they shared fake news... it can be awkward!! I find if I
dont point it out, someone else will, but I wouldn't mind being more confident so that I can talk to
someone if they share fake news. Defs something I need to work on! How important do you think these
critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student? I think it is sooo important.
When you are in grade 11 or 12, and especially University, you will learn that you have to cite your
sources, ALWAYS! This means that whatever information you are writing about in your essays, you
always need to say where you found that piece of information. This is really good practice at
learning where to find true information. Like I said before, I think keeping in touch with today's
news is really cool. If you at all interested in that, I would highly recommend taking even 5 or 10
minutes out of your way to look at some REAL news sources, like CBC. Even if it's just reading the
headlines, you will have a way better understanding of what's going on in the world. And if you're
not interested right now, you will be one day! I promise! Anyways, I hope that wasn't too boring for
you. What are your thoughts? I would be happy to answer any questions about this or chat about
anything further :) Hope you're doing well gal! TarynMentee 2021-11-30, 15:14: How much of a role do
your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? It plays a huge role in
social media because what you may believe in, might not be true or the story of the article may have
mis information. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn
in by misinformation? It depends on the topic but for example if i was just scrolling on facebook
and seen a news article add about whats happening in canada. I would probably believe it or if im
interested in it i would do farther research. What are your experiences of pointing out
misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false
information? No i dont really stare information or take other peoples advice on things. How
important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student?

used so frequently. Did you get a chance to watch the video? I use social media daily to talk with
my friends and family, but I’m more careful about the content I consume. I usually try to find
different sources about a specific topic before jumping to conclusions. For example, if a friend
shares false information without even knowing, I’ll alert them and advise the correct information.
Would you do the same? I believe it is super important to develop critical thinking skills
especially for a student because you can express your ideas more confidently and make better
decisions. Do you have some examples of ways that you’ve used critical thinking? Now, I’m curious,
Can you tell me about a time that you believed in fake news? How did you figure out the information

that I can go quading and skidooing from my house and the second thing we can go camping, hunting,
fishing and out to my grandparents cabin within a couple hours from town. And i was wondering what
it is like to move from a small town to a city. Thanks JoshMentee 2021-11-29, 16:57: accadentley

sport, I can tell!! I tried snowboarding while I was living in New Zealand, but I’m not good with
that. Maybe I should keep trying for a bit more here in Canada, right? I’m from a big city in Brazil
called São Paulo, and I moved to a small town, so kind of the other way around. But I think moving
from a small city to a big one would be quite an adventure. So, many things to explore and learn.
Before we move on to the extension activity, can you respond to the question below? 😊 You've

good habits, and I’m glad you’re taking care of yourself. Sometimes we get so busy with our schedule
that we forget to do simple things like drink water. Well done!! I have a busy life, but I always
find some time to do fun things. Like you, I love sports, so I usually go for a run. It can be a
challenge to adjust your life around the university schedule. I use a daily planner that helps me
keep track of my work. I always save time for activities that I enjoy, like going out with friends,
reading books, etc. Have a nice day, MichelleMentee 2022-01-10, 16:27: Bonjour, Michelle Can you plz

for letting me know and reaching out to me. Actually, I already opened the section, ""From rural to
urban."" Can't you still have any access to it? I am thinking to start working on some topics
according to the order of your preferred conversation choices! Here is some food for thought! Feel
free to share whatever you want to tell me. Three things you like about living in a rural area. For
each, please explain why you like it. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain the reasons for
each. One question you have about living in or moving to the city Personally, I came from South
Korea to take a master's program this April, so living in Canada (for me in Vancouver) is a totally
new and exciting experience. Just moving to a different city can be a fascinating eye-opener since
each region and city has different vibes and even unique cultures. If there is anything you are
curious about living in Vancouver or in Korea, I am glad to share it with you, so feel free to ask
me!! By the way, I hope you can access this section.... If it doesn't work, let me know! Take care
:) Best, OliviaMentee 2021-11-18, 20:38: Hi Olivia These are my answers for the rural to urban.
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. One is that
everyone knows everyone here that Is how small of a town I live in. Two is we have great quading and
snowmobiling trails so I can go, hang with the boys and I can let loose. Three is that we love to
play hockey and baseball. We will either host tournaments or go to tournaments. They are fun because
this season of hockey is contact which means that you can check, push and even shove into the
boards. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. I really don't dislike
anything here except for school. Last year we went 2-3 hours for each class and we had two classes a
term. That is why we had 2-3 hours for a class. It was easier last year. I don't know why they
switched it to 1:20 a class. Now the classes have gotten harder than easier and then harder again.
It has been easier in a way because, in grade 8, I had 7 classes in 1 term now in grade 9-10 I had 4
classes a term. One question you have about living or moving to the city What would the rent or
payments on a home be? Could I even move there? Would I even be able to find or afford a place to
live? Sincerely KadMentor 2021-11-19, 18:43: Hello Kad, I really enjoyed reading your reply!
Especially, I also like the vibe of small towns. Unfortunately, I have never been to your town, but
I could feel how tranquil and relaxing your town is. On top of that, I am really down for trying
quadding and snowmobiling trails!! I guess it must be snowy during winter, which must be beautiful!
In Vancouver, snowing is not common since it is rainy all day...I guess you must be good at sports
and outdoor activities. Where do you usually go to play sports? By the way, ""contact"" hockey sounds
interesting! As for things you dislike, I hear you 100% LOL. Waking up early, going to school, and
taking classes that you might not be interested in that much is a really big thing, right? However,
I believe there are certain things that you can do only at that moment. I hope you can have a
special memory in school before you graduate, which makes you have fun and feel confident! About
your great and realistic question, I am living on-campus and my monthly rental fee for a studio is
around $1282, which is quite pricy. However, there are many options to get a place to live in. Some
of my friends lived with a homestay family (around $600-$800) or share a house with others
($500-$1000 depending on the size of a room). If there are residence and accommodation in your
college or university, you can also live there, which costs around $600-$1300 depending on room
type) If you get a job here (even a part-time job), which makes it affordable to pay for a rental
fee every month, then you can definitely live here. Are you ready to jump on the next page? I am
really looking forward to talking more about this topic! Best, OliviaMentee 2021-11-30, 15:19: Hi

stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor With
this wonderful place called Muncho Lake it's a wonderful place where families love to have out. You
can camp and fish. In the winter time, especially at new years, people go to the lounge and they
have dinner, ice skating on pure ice, bonfire and fireworks. In the summer they have a flyin fishing
and a flying tourand it is all done on a pontoon plane. me and my dad would always spend at least
2-3 weeks there in the summertime. Sincerely kadMentor 2022-01-14, 01:46: Hello Kadyn, I hope this
email finds you well. How is your term going? By the way, I really appreciate your getting a ball
rolling! As for your question, to be honest, it was really interesting and outstanding for me to see
people recognize and acknowledge the land where we live. In Korea, we don't have any concepts of
indigenous cultures and history. That's why it is really meaningful to learn more about indigenous
perspectives. For sure, not only learning indigenous perspectives but also listening to just diverse
stories from people coming from different regions can help me understand them and their cultures.
Thus, I really love reading your story which sounds really cozy and exciting! Although I am still
exploring stories about the land where we live, one thing that I know is that UBC Point Grey
(Vancouver) campus, where I live now, sits on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the
xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nation. Considering where I am coming from, I am really curious about
your thought on this question. How might ""knowing the stories of the land we live on"" change ""how we
treat the land""? How do you think? I am waiting for your reply :) Take care. Best, Olivia",,"Mentor 2021-11-19, 18:54: Hello Kad, I was asked to start with this topic first! I thought choosing
a topic was up to mentors but it isn't. It's my bad!!!! I really apologize for giving you more works
:( Although we already began with a different topic, we can manage both topics together, can we? I
think you can handle two topics at a time for sure! This is not normal and usual since we are
supposed to work on one topic at a time, so don't worry! What I want you to do here is just the same
as what you had done sooooo perfectly! Feel free to read and browse through resources, and please
share your thoughts about the following questions. How much of a role do your emotions play in what
you choose to click on and share on social media? Do you think you are a careful consumer of media
content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? What are your experiences of pointing out
misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false
information? How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for
you as a student? You don't need to be in hurry, so take your time! I'm always waiting for your
reply and any messages Take care, Best, Olivia","Mentor 2021-12-06, 14:06: Dear Kad, I hope this message finds you well! It's almost the end of the
year!! Time flies. This week, we are going to look through this topic. If you are ready to jump in,
feel free to browse through this module and leave your thoughts here! I think the topic for this
week is super important because we each have to take care of ourselves physically, mentally, and
emotionally! In our life, there are so many things going on, arent' there? I always believe we
should learn how to manage and take care of ourselves. Throughout this module, we are going to talk
about some strategies and come up with what works the best for you. As mentioned above, choose one
of the questions that you want to share with me! I am always happy to read your thoughts. Here are
some questions: In your conversation with your mentor you might consider the following questions:
How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important? What role does time
management play in taking good care of yourself? Do you have people in your life who encourage or
model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you
incorporate some of what they do into your own life? What are some signs you have noticed in your
own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself? How might the transition to
post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? Your mentor may have some insight into this!
How good are you at taking care of the basics of self care: Getting adequate sleep? Eating healthy
food? Drinking water? Regular physical activity? Taking breaks from work? Have a great week! Take
care. Best, OliviaMentee 2021-12-16, 11:41: Hi Olivia Sorry I have not gotten back to you. I have
been trying to get my assignments in before we go on winter break so that way I can sit back and
relax. because I'm a bit behind on work. But in the meantime this is the answer for self care. How
good are you at taking care of the basics of self care: Getting adequate sleep? I usually get 9-7
hours of sleep but 7 hours at the max Eating healthy food? I cut out any of the surgery candy unless
i'm at the movies Drinking water? I drink water once a day but the thing that I drink now. is
gatorade zero. It has 10 calories, 270mg sodium, 75mg potassium, 1g carbohydrates, 0 g's of sugar
and 0 g's of protein, per 591 mL. Because it is light and airy and it's way better than water in my
opinion. Regular physical activity? I play hockey on monday, wednesday and saturday Taking breaks
from work? My breaks from work are sunday and monday because we are closed those days Sincerely
KadMentor 2022-01-04, 23:55: Dear Kadyn, I hope you had such a deep rest even in harsh weather and a
serious pandemic! First of all, thanks for sharing your ways to achieve well-beingness. I can't
agree with you more! I am pretty sure that you are good at managing yourself and being ""well-being.""
Once you get back to school, we are going to jump on another topic, which I am really looking
forward to! If you want to browse through different topics that we already covered, feel free to

Korean culture, but I am really down for hearing your culture and school life from you. I hope this
short introduction can help you get to know me. If you don't mind, can you tell me a little about

Olivia I have included a line from a movie that I like to watch called GOON The Last Reinforcements.
“I learned the difference between a moment and a career is evolution. Evolution. you will slow down.
you will get old. your body will fail you. so you evolve, you change your game, you do what you need
to do with the time you got. If not, you go extinct. evolve or go extinct. Are you ready to go
extinct? “ I'm not ready to go extinct. So I'm going to evolve. so I can develop more of my
bartending skills. My friends like to call me Kad or Vatchy/vatcher or both. I'm in grade 10 right
now. My classes are robotics, career life education, social studies, and science. My teacher has
asked us to begin with the disinformation conversation Sincerely Kad VatchyMentor 2021-11-09, 12:58:
Hi Kad, Thanks for sharing a meaningful and impressive quote with me! Your quote made me eager to be
evolving again and again, rather than just sticking to our ""comfort zone"" while going extinct.
Honestly, I am really glad that you already found what you are truly interested in and have worked
on it. I am really curious about what made you interested in bartending and what you've done so far
to improve your bartending skills. (I've heard that a bartender should have good memory skills,
right?) Throughout this e-mentoring, I really look forward to talking about this stuff with you
since I am really into learning about different types of liquor, especially how to make a fancy
cocktail! I wish you also enjoy our learning journey throughout this e-mentoring. Again, it's my
pleasure to meet you! Take care! Best, OliviaMentee 2021-11-18, 11:58: Hi olivia Sorry if I haven't

you can choose one of the questions that you would like to share with me after watching the short
video clip. What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the
relationship between living in the country and living in a city? What, if anything, did you relate
to in the images presented in the film? How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of
things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? In what ways does your emotional

Misinformation conversation right now; please take some time to work through the text and video

cautious media consumer? Have you ever encountered information that seems true but found out is not,
either then or later? I know that it can often be difficult to try and parse out what is actually
true and based on facts. Something that I try to do is use multiple sources to do background
research as discussed in the video and use a skeptical mindset to dig into the news and find out
what lies at its heart. I know this can take time and energy to do but is really important, what do
you think about this and the tools and strategies discussed in the video? Would you be able to share

you get very busy with everyday life,you forget to take time for yourself. Is it hard to take care
of your self in university?Mentor 2021-12-14, 18:37: Hi there Dan, It's great to hear from you
again! I appreciate the question. I agree with what you said, self-care is an important thing in
somebody's life. I also liked how you said that it can be challenging to stay on track with your
self-care because everything is moving so quickly around you. In university, it's a bit difficult
than before to stay on track with self-care. However, I find that taking the time to do things like
exercise, eat healthy food and sleep well contribute to success in class. Even if I occasionally
skip out on something, I try to stay on track with my self-care. What are some things that you do to
take care of yourself? What do you think you could do to stay on top of self-care in
post-secondary?Mentee 2021-12-15, 13:29: Dear Rayyan for what I do for my self care is workout
everyday and eat as healthy as I can. Another thing I do is I like the outdoors and go snowmobiling.
I am not quite sure if I am going to university because I might change my mind.Mentor 2021-12-16,
21:49: Hey there Dan, That's great to hear that you enjoy exercising and eating healthy. Make sure
to keep it up! I find that finding a couple of activities/sports that you really like can be
helpful, just like you said with snowmobiling. Are there any other sports that you really enjoy? Or
maybe some hobby? In addition to that, what do you think is also really important to maintain a
healthy life aside from exercise and eating? (If you're stuck, try asking yourself how your sleep
schedule is, or what you do to de-stress) Finally, it's perfectly fine to be unsure of what you want
to do with your life after high school, there's plenty of time to find what you enjoy, whether that
be at university or not. Be sure to let me know if you have any questions that I could possibly
answer.Mentee 2022-01-13, 11:23: Happy new year Rayyan are you interested in any sports for my
hobbies I am interested in hunting, fishing and basically anything in the outdoors. I love being
outside even in the winter except for when it gets up to -45 most times up here in Fort Nelson. I
get a good sleep on the weekends but on school nights I stay up until about 12:30 AM. When I get
stressed I will uasually go outside or I will spend time with me dog he is a Cane Corso and it is a
dog breed that needs a lot of attention a Cane Corso is the italian mastiff breed. Thanks for the

New Year to you as well! It's nice to hear that you're into sports, they're a great way to spend
time! My favourites are badminton and soccer. I have been fishing a couple of times, and I really
enjoy the calming feeling of watching the water one moment and all the action that follows if you
manage to get a bite. It's wonderful that you have found an activity that helps you to de-stress,
it's always great to take breaks. I've personally never had a pet before, but I've always hoped to
one day get a cat. What's your favourite part about having a dog? I'm glad to offer my help, I hope

little while. I am extremely excited to meet you! A little bit more about me: I'm 18 years old and
currently studying engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton and reading books. What
are some activities you enjoy doing? The first thing I'd like to share would be a quote that I like:
""It matters not how strait the gate, / How charged with punishments the scroll, / I am the master of
my fate, / I am the captain of my soul."" (Henley, lines 13-16). This is from the poem ""Invictus"" by
William Ernest Henley, and it's something that reminds me to always have faith in myself, and that I
can overcome hardship if I choose to be brave. These lines help me remember that even if I feel
hopeless and lost, I can turn things around with the effort. Next, there's a song I'd like to share
with you. You may have heard it before, it's known as Nocturne op. 9 no. 2, by Frédéric Chopin.
Here's a link to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg. The reason I enjoy this song is
for various reasons. I find the music very soothing and delicate. It also reminds me of home, as
this was one of the first songs I learned to play on the piano, althought very poorly. Let me know
what you think of the poem and music, Dan! Once again, I really am thrilled to be your mentor and
hope you come to enjoy it too. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my
best to answer!Mentee 2021-11-08, 16:55: Hi Rayyan, I have listened to the song and I don't like
classical music but the poem is good. I like country music the best my favourite, the artist I like
is Eric Church. I go hunting a lot in the fall it is my favourite thing to do and I usually shoot 1
animal on my own every year. My favourite class in school is metal work and I am 16 years old right
now. My teacher has asked us to begin with the disinformation conversation.Mentee 2021-11-10, 13:17:
Can you please unlock the disinformationMentor 2021-11-10, 21:45: Hi Dan, I've unlocked the dis- and
misinformation conversation. Please look through the ""Working Through this Program"" section before
you move on to that first. I wrote some things there that you may want to read before moving on.
Please also make sure you watch the video showing you how to navigate through the program!Mentor
2021-11-28, 14:57: Hi Dan, I was really glad we got off to a good start with our mentoring. However,
I am a little concerned as to how everything has been going with you. Just wanted to do a quick
check-in and see, I hope that everything is all right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

start off with the posed questions. What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? I think
for me, it was creating that budget in the first place. I never had much experience with money
because my parents never taught me that stuff. I didn't even know how credit cards worked when I was
in late high school. I knew that my parents weren't going to be paying for my university education
as well so it was really important for me to learn that stuff before I had to deal with it. I got a
job when I was 16 but I still wasn't good at budgeting so I didn't save much lol. Now, I try to keep
an eye out on how much I spend in between my paychecks. What do recommend for trying to balance
part-time work with school workload? It is very very hard, I admit. A lot of students don't work
while they're at school and that's perfectly fine. You need to find what works for you. If you are
able to get some funding some parents and to get student loans, then you can wholeheartedly focus on
school and take the max. amount of courses. For me, I had to work while attending school so I found
a happy medium. Instead of taking 5 courses a semester, I did 4 but I could also work 2 days a week.
Then in the summer, I made up for the one course I didn't take; however, that also means I didn't
get a summer vacation :( What my friend did was take 4 courses a semester, didn't take summer
school, but extended their schooling for one more year (instead of 4 years of school, she did 5).
Just make sure not to exhaust yourself :) What was the most surprising thing you learned about
yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary education? I did not expect to
spend as much as I did! All that eating out on campus and meeting friends and going out to campus
activities really put a drain on my bank account. I then tried to work more but my grades suffered.
So important to be able to juggle friends, family, work, and school. How did you keep track of all
the money and all the payment dates? I keep a very close eye on my bank account. I used my credit
card as a debit card and avoided using cash. I check my bank account like twice a week to make sure
I'm not spending more than I have. I also put maximum half of my paychecks into a savings account
for emergencies. Since I'm keeping an eye on my account, I'm also always aware of upcoming payment
dates. If keeping track of dates isn't easy for you then you can always set up auto-pay.Mentor
2021-11-21, 03:48: Some tips I wanted to add on, as it says in the article, finding a way to keep
textbook costs low really helps. Their advice was splitting the cost with another student but I've
never seen that plus most of them are strangers! A lot of us wait until school starts before buying
the textbooks because the prof might tell us that it's actually not necessary. When buying
textbooks, you can get them secondhand or check websites like amazon instead of buying from the
school. They might also be online too but make sure you're looking at an updated version. Learning
to cook is important. When I go eat out at cactus club or something, I spend upwards of $80 for just
myself!! That is insane. Credit cards are useful. Just make sure you know about the fine print.
Talking numbers! As daunting as it can be to discuss money with your parents, it's vital that you
know what you got working for you when you finish high school. Let me know if you have any
questions!Mentee 2022-01-06, 14:20: Hello Lisa, here are my answers What was the most challenging
budgeting issue for you? Getting a job to pay. And saving money due to me rarely having money i
usually spend as soon as I get it, I have to work on that. What do you recommend for trying to
balance part-time work with school workload? When I get off school I often see kids immediately
going to work, if you do that you might be late to the job so maybe find a job that is flexible with
hours to accommodate for your school. What was the most surprising thing you learned about yourself
and money management in your first year of post-secondary education? I have difficulty with saving
money, if you put some money on the side and keep some on when you want to buy something How did you
keep track of all the money and all the payment dates? By updating a note you have on your phone or
somewhere about the money you put aside. And add reminders like a day or more before the due date of
your payment to whatever service you wish.Mentor 2022-01-07, 01:28: I also need to work on that. I
think getting a credit card made my spending sky rocket because now, in a sense, I have an increased
access to a high ""total"" amount. So, I kinda use my credit to pay for everything without thinking of
my debit card. That's exactly what I said we should watch out for! However, the Christmas season
really drained my wallet. Did you do anything fun for Christmas? Any traditions you follow? All I
did for Christmas was sleep since I had to work the days before it and the days after :( Working is
so draining.",,,"Mentee 2022-01-10, 17:10: Dear Lisa I hope you had a good winter break. these are my answers to my
questions. What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? One
is for research and the other is for residence but both gather information. Do you know any stories
about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with your mentor No, I do
not. How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? tells us the
past of the land and its people. Do you agree that “scientific” knowledge is usually viewed as
better or more advanced than “traditional” knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is,
what impact do you think this change could have? Yes and no. Why do you think “scientific” knowledge
and “traditional” knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories -
other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show “scientific” and
“traditional” knowledges working together? it could work by comparing the tales of the peole of long
ago with the scientific knowledge.Mentor 2022-01-12, 19:53: Hi Dakota! Thank you for your quick
response!! I accidentally did part 2 first lol so here are my answers for part 1. What do you think
the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? Simply living on the land is
what I think I'm doing right now. For example, I live in the city that I am at but I'm not very
invested in it. It is simply a location that I reside in. On the other hand, studying the land means
I know beyond the external image. I know information that can only be gathered after looking for it.
Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share one of these stories with
your mentor I love folklore and stories; however, I don't have any for where I live. How might
knowing the stories of the land we live on change how we treat the land? I think it would allow us
to respect our surroundings more when we look deeper. Do you agree that “scientific” knowledge is
usually viewed as better or more advanced than “traditional” knowledge? Is this a view that is
changing? If it is, what impact do you think this change could have? I do think so. My mom is super
into traditional medicine and I've always viewed it as dubious when compared to ""scientific""
medicine. I don't know if it's changing or not because I do know it's prevalent amongst some older
generations. Basically, from the traditional medicine I've had, I think it can relieve some light
symptoms but it wouldn't be as potent as ""created"" medicine.Mentor 2022-01-22, 05:08: Hey Dakota!
Seems like the semester is wrapping up so our end is near haha. If you'd like to continue with this
program, I'd be more than happy to go through any other conversations you're interested in. If not,
let me know and I'll give you access to the ""wrapping up"" survey! Thank you for your time. I had
such a blast with you and good luck with your game making! I hope to see something from you in the
future :)) That would be cool.",,"Mentor 2021-11-16, 04:45: Let's discuss the conversations above :) How much of a role do your
emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? Honestly, I never share
things on social media. When I was younger, I did share a lot of those ""share this or you die in a
few days"" posts on Facebook because everyone did it but I soon stopped. Compared to today, I really
didn't have a lot of social media growing up. There was only Facebook for the longest time and I
didn't understand Twitter lol. What about you? Do you share a lot of things nowadays? The only thing
I share would be through a direct message to a friend about some TikTok video of a cool restaurant
in Vancouver or a product of some kind that I want. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media
content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? I think I definitely try. We consume so much
media every day, I honestly don't even remember what I read! I get most of my news from following
people on Instagram too so I don't know how accurate that is. I remember when I was around 10 or so,
there was this article saying some famous actor was moving here. I excitedly showed my friend and
she told me that it was fake news. It was so embarrassing. Has anything like that happened to you?
Or do you make sure to fact-check the stuff that you read? I know I probably should. What are your
experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for
sharing misleading false information? I think that the confusion with information is in the wording.
I find that a lot of people read things but end up misreading it leading to false information. As
pointed out in the video, people do like headlines or information that seems ""spicyyy"" like things
that they can share and be like omg lol. We're all victims of this. What are your thoughts on fake
news? Is that something you've had a lot of experience with? Or do you ever see it becoming a
problem in your life? How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media
are for you as a student? I honestly think it is so so so sooooo important to be able to analyze
where our data is coming from. Especially in University, we have to make sure we are getting
information from credible sources. Imagine if all of us were running around with made up numbers or
facts. What social media do you think has the most unreliable information?Mentor 2021-11-16, 04:47:

conpressed and small How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and
share on social media It plays a small factor since I don't really use the internet for news, I only
really use it for when I have an odd question like how many bananas does it take to kill an average
man with radiation: it is 10 million by the way. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media
content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? No, not often. This is because I often don't
read the news which leaves me with a blind eye to what's happening in the world. Often times though
certain events leak into to entertainment like youtube like with the alec baldwin situation. What
are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge
you for sharing misleading false information? I don't think I can recall needing to do that since
most people know to check things before telling other people. My mother does do this occasionally
but she figures it out. How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital
media are for you as a student? I need to do a lot of research in most of my classes, that includes
going to sites I'm not familiar with. So I check a few others to see if the information is
consistent.Mentor 2021-11-21, 03:22: I didn't even know death by banana radiation was a thing.
Thanks for letting me know lol. I better limit my banana eating to 9 million instead lol. For the

didnt get time to do some mentor city for a while til nowMentor 2021-12-06, 22:09: Hey Dakota! Just
another quick checkup :) How are you finding everything?","Mentor 2021-12-10, 04:05: Self-care is so so sooooo important! Especially once I got to university,
I was so burnt out from transit and schoolwork and work and friends and family and so on. Needing to
balance everything really takes a toll on you. Honestly, when I entered university, I thought it
would be fine. On the surface, it seemed so much easier because classes are shorter. Rather than
spending 7-8 hours at school 5 days a week, I was on campus 3 days a week for 5 hours per day or so.
Yeah, the work level (or brain power lol) was completely different. Long story short, I ended up
skipping school a bunch and I let my grades slip because I wasn't managing it from the start. Now, I
try to put people above work. I learned to kinda make a hierarchy of what's important to me. Some
sacrifices had to be made but it was way better to come to terms with it from the beginning than
having it forced in the moment. Do you have any stories where you realized you really had to start
focusing on yourself? One new thing I've done recently is get a bunch of vitamins lol. Especially
vitamin D. It's finals season so I haven't been going out much. No sunshine for me and vitamin D is
supposed to help with that. I've been trying to drink more water as well! Anything you've been
trying to do? Everyone I've talked to really focuses on how much water they drink lol",,"Mentor 2021-10-30, 09:07: Hi! Nice to finally meet you :) My name is Lisa and I'll be your mentor
for the next few months. I'm a student at UBC studying English Literature and Language. I see on
your profile that you like gaming as well! Do you have a favourite game or a genre that you prefer?
Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be more than happy to answer!! Some other things about
meee - my fav food has to be poke rn which is basically like sushi in a bowl lol. I added a pic of
it. Honestly, I really like raw fish and rice so the poke bowl is like one huge sushi on rice. Ahah
but I understand why most people don't like sushi. The texture can freak people out but I like to
think that I'm a lil more adventurous with food. The other day, I tried beef tartar and,
surprisingly, it was quite good. My friends aren't that open to ""interesting"" foods but how about
you? Weirdest thing you've ever had or want to try? A quote that I really like is from J.K Rowling's
book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow
to be"". I think it's important to remember that our fate is within our hands. As we grow, it's up to
us to make the decisions best for us. Culturally, I was born in a household where emotions were seen
as a weakness and, looking at this quote, I know that I'm not bound by my birth. Or, at least,
that's my take on it. What do you think?Mentee 2021-11-08, 17:01: Hello Lisa, good to meet you. I
like games that have rog elements and openwords, examples includes fallout and elder scrolls. My
favourite game is the borderlands series. What is your favourite game?I recently started a project
which is a openworld rpg game which includes some of my online friends. My favourite food is
fettuccine alfredo. and unfortunely I do not like fish. I taste water for some reason which is odd.
Have you ever tried moose? I have a friend who occasionally drops some off. My favourite wuote is
from infinty war ""Dread it Run from it Destiny Arrives all the same."" In my prespective represents
the inevitablity of our nonstop clock of death and to make the most of the time you have on the
planet earth.. My teacher has asked us to begin with the disinfomation conversationMentor
2021-11-09, 19:11: I love open-world games as well! I have to say that my favourite game would be
Skyrim only because it's the only game I'm able to replay without getting bored. However, my
favourite series would be Dragon age because I like how it feels like my actions really matter and
I'm more of a person with impact compared to skyrim - if that makes sense? I've played borderlands
as well but I haven't touched the newest game in the series. Have you? OOoooo the project sounds
really cool! What will the game be like? I have never tried moose but I would love to. I don't know
where I'd get that here though haha. Maybe one day . . . I really like that quote :) Making the most
of our time on earth is important. I think that's something I need to remind myself of whenever I
get into a slump with school or work. Disinformation it is! Cya in that conversation :)Mentee

you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship between living
in the country and living in a city? There are vast differences between the two of them. What, if
anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? I don't relate to it. How did you
feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in
you? I Didn't feel much, I did feel uneasy about the video. In what ways does your emotional
response to the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city
for post-secondary schooling? uneasy.Mentor 2022-01-07, 01:25: Hey Dakota! Nice to hear from you
again :) How was your winter break? Do anything exciting? For me, I've been working full time :(
wish I got more time to play the new games I bought during the Steam sale. I also felt uneasy in
regard to the video. I think it was largely due to the intense ticking - you know, like in a horror
film and there's a ticking clock and you're holding your breath in anticipation for something.
That's the vibe I got from it. The close-ups and quick cuts throughout the video also made it soooo
intense. I felt like I was being thrown around from place to place lol. There was a ton of emphasis
on movement and the cut from the country shots to the city shots was seamless. To me, it felt like
the short film was saying that, regardless of where you are, there is always a hustle and bustle to
get to a destination. What do you think? I hope you don't feel too uneasy about possibly moving to a
large city for post-secondary! I think being anxious makes it worse. Rather, viewing it as a new
experience really helps. There will always be difficulties no matter where you are but, in my
opinion, the city can offer a lot of interesting experiences.",,,"Mentor 2021-11-21, 04:08: I gave a lot of tips in the previous conversation but I'll add some more
here regarding bursaries and scholarships! I heavily relied on scholarships and bursaries when I
went to school. There's only so much I can work before I run out of money to pay for my classes.
Bursaries are also based on your parents' income. I luckily got bursaries and scholarships that
covered most of my fees and I used the actual loans to cover the rest. When you apply for loans,
they'll add in spending money. For me personally, I tried to keep everything I got for school in a
separate bank account so I don't spend too much of my school money on non-school items. I did buy a
laptop using my bursaries but it was for school. For scholarships, I made sure to apply for a few in
high school but I wish I applied for more. Even if they give like $300 or so, you can win a bunch by
applying for a bunch. The money eventually adds up. I know it sounds soooo stressful (trust me. I
hated applying for scholarships) but I know you can do it! That's also why I'm here - to help in any
way I can. Depending on which school you're thinking of going to (Do you have any in mind right
now?), they also tend to offer a bunch of different bursaries/scholarships as well. If you google
scholarships and whatnot, stuff tends to pop up and there'll be instructions on how to apply. Again,
let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-10, 16:58: What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What
attitudes do you think he is hoping to change or challenge? Is he successful? I believe he is trying
to combat the dismissive attitudes directed towards the indigenous community. As seen in the past
hundreds of years, there is this incorrect belief that the indigenous community lack innovation and
are ""set in the past"" while the western community is at peak advancement. This point of view is also
commonly directed to other countries. It's a dangerous mindset because I believe it can cause us to
see others as ""lessors"" which is not the case. Do you think his Ted talk was successful? Did it
change anything for you? Are there any inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that
surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous
innovations. I was surprised by their invention of lacrosse. I'm not into sports myself and the
topic has never been taught to us in school. Another one that caught my eye was the snow googles.
Some other inventions I have heard of are syringes, mouthwash, and rubber. What do you think of
Jeff’s intention to use The Seven Teachings to guide his business? How important are these values to
how you might like to live your life? Which one seems the most difficult to live by, and why might
that be the case? I like his intentions because they are values that we should all adopt in life so
why not at work? For me, I think the most difficult value is wisdom because I think wisdom is
collected through life experiences. For me, I'm not the type of person to go out and do crazy things
a lot so where would I collect this wisdom? What do you think? If not wisdom, I think truth is an
interesting one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because when I see the people in my town I know who they are for example when I go to the stores or
restaurants. I just don”t really like anything about this town, no jobs there's jobs in town but
nothing I’m interested in and there’s nothing fun to do. I don’t like how small it is here cause it
feels like a loop doing and seeing everything the same gets boring. One question I have about living
or moving to a city? Will it cause good change What do you think the director of the film was trying
to communicate about the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? What’s
different about living in a country or a city. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images
presented in the film? Yes cause I live in a rural area and the images in the film is the stuff
everyone does here How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker
do to create those feelings in you? I felt happy because when I move to a city it’ll be like a new
life almost, no one will know me I can start fresh In what ways does your emotional response to the
film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary
schooling? My response was when I saw the city I felt a little happy or different cause when I go to
city’s for trips I like that there’s a lot of cars and there’s more places to go.Mentor 2021-12-04,
02:41: I completely relate to your answers about living in a rural area. While it is nice to know
everyone in town and have a relationship with your neighbours, it sometimes limits our hobbies and
interests as there can be less resources. It is natural to be unsure about moving to the city,
especially if a small town is all you have ever known. While change can be scary in my experience it
typically results in new positive life experiences and allows us to grow as individuals. Why do you
think you are craving a new identity when you move to the city? What aspects of yourself are you
looking to improve by making this change? It looks like you are making great progress on this
module! Please let me know if I can open another module for you or if you need any further
instructions! Avery",,"Mentor 2022-01-05, 00:54: Hi Connor, I have opened the conversation ""different ways of knowing"" so

did the Diffrent ways of Knowing qeustingsMentee 2022-01-13, 11:22: What do you think the difference
is between studying the land and living on the land? The living relationship between Indigenous
Peoples and the land is prophetic. It points to a livable future for all, in that it displays the
living relationship of all humanity to the larger realm of creation. If humanity can see this, it
has a more hopeful future. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? Share
one of these stories with your mentor My grandma telling me about how to smoke and dry the meat or
how to to moose hide and how to make clothing out of the hide, and how she lived back then and my
mom telling me what it was like back then too How might knowing the stories of the land we live on
change how we treat the land? It doesn’t really change anything because it's a source that's
helpful. Do you agree that “scientific” knowledge is usually viewed as better or more advanced than
“traditional” knowledge? Is this a view that is changing? If it is, what impact do you think this
change could have? Yes it has changed. Science has learned from the traditional and that science is
learning from traditional ways, for example medicines from nature. Why do you think “scientific”
knowledge and “traditional” knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard
stories - other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat - that show “scientific” and
“traditional” knowledges working together? The 6,000-year-old Village by the Hakai Institute
Although Native peoples' traditional knowledge of the land differs from scientific knowledge, both
have strengths that suggest the value of a partnership between them.Mentor 2022-01-16, 08:36: Hi

model a relationship with the Earth that we can all learn from? The story about your grandmother was
so interesting, what useful skills to have passed down to you. I also completely agree that the
worlds of science and nature can learn from one another and both are necessary for humanity.Mentor

seen any dis-information. Whenever I see things that aren't true or don't make sense I usually don't
pay attention to it. As well as not interacting with it. My teacher would like me to ask you these
questions for an assignment. What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? What do you
recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? What was the most surprising
thing you learned about yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary
education? How did you keep track of all the money and all the payment dates? Have a good day! :)
Best wishes, Ava WaughtalMentor 2021-12-03, 00:54: Hi Ava, I feel that I am the same way, where I
usually don't pay attention to things that don't seem to be real. However, sometimes is can be
difficult to recognize if it is true or not. It is always important to make sure to pay attention to
the clue of dis/mis information, especially whenever doing research assignments to make sure that
your information is valid. Also, I can for sure answer those questions for you! 1. I don't think I
had many challenges with budgetting in university. In terms of tuition and books, my mom pays for
everything through a registered education savings plan, so I don't need to worry about that. I also
won some scholarships in highschool, which also help with paying for tuition. I also live at home so
that cuts down the cost of living on campus. I think that one thing that seemed challenging at the
beginning was having to waste gas when driving to school. I dealt with this challenge by opting to
carpool. One of my friend's and I both have the same courses and class schedule, so we usually just
carpool. One week she drives and the next week I drive. This helps to save money spent on gas. On a
side note, other than tuition, books, and commute, I think that I am having a hard time budgetting
my money, where I often find myself opting to buy a coffee at Starbucks. I'm usually on campus in
the afternoon, and need my daily coffee, and when I see a coffee shop I can't resist. However, a way
that I overcame this problem was by taking coffee with me from home in a travel mug. I think it is
helping, and now I only buy coffee as a treat! 2. I think when trying to balance out part time work
with your school workload you really need to be an expert at time management. I currently do not
have a job, but I do volunteer at various places a few days a week, which can definately be time
consuming, just as a part time job would be. I am planning to work part time alongside school
starting in January. When trying to balance out your schedule you really need to try to only have
classes on one or two days. Often when you choose your courses and schedules, there are times where
courses are offered on the same days. If you are done with attending your classes in two days, you
have the rest of the week to go to work and complete assignments and readings. It really frees up
time to do other things. Also, I think you should take into consideration what types of courses you
are taking. For example, if you are taking a course in a subject that you find very difficult, you
probably need to spend more time on that course than you would for other courses. You should keep in
mind how long it will take you to study for a course when choosing a part time job. A big factor to
consider when choosing a part time job is the time commitment. You should make sure that you are
able to manage work and school at the same time. Also, I would advise you to have a monthly calendar
that you keep on your desk that you can see all of the time. At the beginning of the semester when
you receive your syllabus (which is a course outline your professor provides at the beginning of the
course that includes all the due dates and deadlines for the semester), you should write out when
all of your assignments, exams, and readings are due. Also, you should write in which days you will
be going to class and work (and the times). On top of this you should include anything else that you
have planned such as appointments or social gatherings. By doing this you will know what is going on
all month and will stay on top of your school work without falling behind. I also use a daily to-do
list where I can write out everything I need to get done that day. I set aside specific days to work
on different classes. For example, Mondays are for my psychology readings, Tuesdays are for
sociology, and so on. If a course takes more effort, I spread it over two days. My last piece of
advice is to use google sheets to see a weekly view. Fill in all of your class and work hours, and
anything extra. After doing that then you should go in and fill in times where you plan to work on
assignments and readings. That way you know exactly what you have planned for the week. I do this
every Sunday night. You should always start on your assignments well in advance to make sure you
have enough time and don't rush it. Trust me, you will regret leaving it to the last minute. Also,
don't forget to schedule in time for youself! I know it can be hard with a busy schedule, but you
want to make sure that you still take care of your well-being too. 3. The most surprising thing that
I learned about myself in my first year of post-secondary was that I am capable of making
relationships and connections in an online setting. When I started university, I thought I would not
be able to make any friends or meet anyone in online school. I thought I was not very good at
talking to people on my own and sparking a conversation. However, in my first year, I was in a peer
mentorship program where I, alongside other first year students, were mentees and our mentors, who
were older students, helped us navigate our first year. We met once a week, with 20 of us mentees,
and 5 mentors. I was surprised to learn that I can actually form relationships through online. I met
many different people through this program, and have become friends with many of the mentees, and
also keep in touch with some of my mentors. Now, I have become a peer mentor and hope to see other
first year students realize their strengths as I did. I was also surprised that the supervisor for
this program, who was my academic advisor in my first year, thought I have the leadership qualities
to be a successful mentor. I think that this boosted my self confidence where I believe in my
abilities more. The most surprising thing that I learned about money management in my first year is
that there are many ways to save money when it comes to buying books. First, I realize that hard
copies of textbooks are more expensive than online copies. So, it is more beneficial to buy online
copies to save money. Plus, you can also search key words in an online copy! Also, renting online
textbooks are cheaper if you don't need to use the textbook again. Usually, you don't go back and
look at your old textbooks in future courses unless the courses are related, and even then, you will
most likely just look through your notes instead of the textbook. Renting a textbook, or even buying
a used one will save you a lot of money. Also, when buying a textbook, make sure to check multiple
websites to see which one is cheaper. Most of the time, if you find the same book for cheaper
somewhere else, your university bookstore will match the price. You can also sell your books back to
your school bookstore or even online, which can help with money management. These little costs add
up, so try to save wherever you can! 4. As I mentioned before, my mom keeps track of money for my
education. I am very lucky and grateful that I don't have to worry about that. However, I am in
charge on keeping track of the payment dates. I keep track of these dates by writing them down on my
calendar so that they are in front of me and I don't forget. Make sure you write these dates on your
calendar because at most post-secondaries they charge extra if your tuition is late. I hope that
this helps! Also, so sorry for the super long answers, I just wanted to give you all the advice I
can. Hopefully you can learn from my experiences and use them in your post-secondary career. Please
don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. I am always happy to help! :) Best, Japnaam",,,"Mentee 2022-01-10, 17:01: Dear Japnaam, Happy New Year! I hope your break was very wonderful and
full of joy! During these times I hope you and your family are safe and healthy! Here is some
questions my teacher wanted me to answer and send to you. What do you think the difference is
between studying the land and living on the land? The difference between studying the land and
living on it is the information you gather. From studying the land you can learn why things are, how
they have evolved, and how they will evolve. Whereas living on the land gives you some sort of
connection to the land. You can learn all the ins and outs of the land. You can learn first hand how
things could impact the land or the people living on it. It also can change your perspective, when
studying the land you see it as a subject of interest, something you conduct experiments on and
gather information on. When living on the land you feel connected, in-touch, and you see it as
you're home. Somewhere you want to learn about, and want to help. How might knowing the stories of
the land we live on change how we treat the land? Like I had mentioned before, perspective is very
important when it comes to how we treat things. Living on a land I don't know about I don't stop to
appreciate the little things, I don't feel connected, and I do not consider it my home. I might not
take care of the land as one might their home. However, if I had learned about this land I would
feel as if it were my own, I would notice little things and consider them precious. I would do my
best to treat it with dignity and respect, and I would make sure others do as well. I hope you enjoy
my answers and I hope you are able to connect with them. :) Have a good day and I look forward to
hearing from you. Sincerely, Ava WaughtalMentor 2022-01-11, 01:26: Hi Ava, It is so nice to hear
from you. I hope you had a restful break and are healthy and safe. Also, happy new year to you too!
I agree with your answers to the questions. Living on the land gives you a sort of connection to it
and you know it better. It is when the land starts feeling like home, where you begin to develop
love towards the land. As you said, it is when you live on the land you start to appreciate things
more. I'm wondering, do you have an experience where you did not appreciate something as much before
you knew about the connection to the land that you appreciate more now? I look forward to hearing
your response! Best, JapnaamMentee 2022-01-18, 15:05: Mentee 2022-01-18, 15:05: Hello Japnaam, I
hope you are doing well! Thank you for your question! The answer is yes, when I was younger my
grandma used to like to take me on adventures and explore places. When I was younger I didn’t
appreciate the places as much as I do now. Since I have grown up I have learned more about the
places I have visited. One place I particularly remember, there were huge trees, and I remember
thinking when I was young how amazing they were. Now I've learned that those trees were actually
super super old, and my grandma had visited them lots when she was younger. After I had learned that
when I visit them now I feel more connected to them and I often wonder what they have lived through.
To this day I am so thankful I can go visit that ancient forest with my grandma. Warm Regards, Ava
WaughtalMentor 2022-01-22, 00:16: Hi Ava, That is such a wonderful experience. It is always good to
experience things from a different lens where something you didn't appreciate before, you have
gained more appreciation for it now. Thank you for sharing the story about your grandma with me. I
understand that your semester will end on Friday, and I have really enjoyed working with you this
semester and getting to know you! Even though your semester will be finished, you can continue to
work with me beyond the end the of the semester for as long as you would like. Best, Japnaam",,"Mentee 2021-11-24, 13:45: Greetings Japnaam, I went through the page and watched the video with my
class! :) I really enjoyed the poem you shared with me! It really reminds me of my own grandparents
and mom. Currently my favorite poem is actually by my sister. She is also a writer, I like to say I
learned from the best. Red Eyed Brother of Mine Brother your anger mirrors my own. I watch as his
injustice pushes you off the edge. Sister my heart is breaking just as yours, more so as I see your
red eyes glaze over. Our eyes can no longer hide the truth. The absent father, an empty shell that
taunts us. His cold skin and crooked smile. His black eyes that look at us emptily. The last nail in
the coffin in which our family lies, buried in unanswered questions. Red eyed brother I have seen
you fall, fall so far. But I have seen you rise. And when you rise it is your sisters who will be by
your side. Written By Hannah Waughtal Family is very significant to me, so this poem is something I
can really relate to. (Besides the fact it was written by my sister) My family went through lots of
hardships but my siblings and I only grew closer. They are very important to me and I love them very
much. :) When something peaks my interest and gets me excited I share it with others. Oftentimes I
never read news so I mostly send things about show updates or game updates that come from the
creator themselves. I think I am quite a careful consumer of media. Like I mentioned before I don't
really share any news with anyone so I don't think I’ve ever sent any misinformation. How ever I´ve
seen Sincerely, Ava WaughtalMentor 2021-11-24, 23:44: Hi Ava, That is such a touching poem. It
really makes you think about life, and all the hardships we have to face. I feel that to me it shows
a lot of resiliency and strength. Your sister is very talented. Also, it is great to hear that you
are so close to your family, despite all of the struggles you have faced. That truly shows that you
have a strong bond, and are always there for each other. I feel that when you go through a difficult
time, you realize who will really be there for you when you need them. It is important to hold each
other together. I hold my family very close to my heart too, especially my mom...she is my best
friend :) I understand that you have given me some of your thoughts on the question: How much of a
role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? I think that I
can relate to you that I don't really share news with others via social media. I usually do not
re-post anything either. I think when I am looking at posts on social media, sometimes my emotions
come into play as to whether I find something interesting to look at. For example, if I can relate
to something, or if it is something about my university, I am more likely to look into it. However,
I do not usually share anything on my account. I feel that this is relevant for many people because
we all tend to look at things we are interested in more than things that we may find boring or
irrelevant to our personal lives. I was wondering, have you seen any dis or mis information on
social media? If you have, did you see any of the signs discussed in the text or video above? I look
forward to hearing from you. Best, Japnaam","Mentor 2021-12-07, 23:57: Hi Ava, I hope you are doing well, and enjoying the last two weeks of
school before winter break! What are your thoughts on these two questions about self-care: 1. What
role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? 2. How might the transition to
post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? These are my answers: 1. I feel that time
management plays a big role in self care. We all lead such busy lives where we don't have time to
practice self-care. I feel that making sure that you fit in time for self care is really important.
It should be a priority rather than just something you do when you have time. 2. The transition to
post secondary definitely makes self care more difficult. You have so much to do with all of the
time with the assignments, commute to campus, and any volunteering or jobs you are doing, it can be
a lot. I remember in my first year I had no time for self care, I was doing school work all day.
However, you really need to remember to take care of yourself because it can lead you to feeling
burnt out. I understand that it can be hard to make time, but it doesn't have to be something big,
even just taking out twenty minutes to go for a walk, read a book for ten minutes, make sure you
sleep on time, and simply a five minute call to one of your friends can make a big difference.
Towards the end of my first year I started to realize this and I began to workout every evening,
spent more time with my family and friends, and made sure I was sleeping enough. I know that it is
hard to manage everything, but we need to take care of ourselves. Trust me, you will do much better
in school when you are not feeling tired and burnt out due to lack of self care. I look forward to
hearing your insight on these questions! Best, JapnaamMentee 2021-12-13, 16:55: Hello Japnaam, Thank
you for your questions, I hope you are doing well! Here are my answers :) 1. What role does time
management play in taking good care of yourself? Time management definitely plays a big role in self
care. I agree with what you said at the end of your answer. I feel like lots of people only practice
self care when they have time, when in reality you should be treating yourself every day with proper
breaks, proper eating habits and hygiene. Setting some time apart from your day for yourself, even
just an hour, can be really beneficial for your mental health. As someone who practices this
everyday, little breaks actually help me get back to work feeling refreshed, instead of trying to
drag on for as long as I can, I'm able to work quickly, effectively in a shorter amount of time. 2.
How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more difficult? I am definitely
still working on time management, that is actually something I have been struggling with for my
whole life. My mom is a quick paced worker, whereas I take my time doing absolutely everything, even
making a sandwich (haha oops..) so I have been constantly working hard on my time management in
order to prepare for the future. So hopefully in post-secondary I´ll be able to continue to manage
my time better in order to maintain my self care routine. Also thank you for the advice! I'll
definitely look back in the future and remember what you said about time management in
post-secondary! Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy your Christmas break :) Best wishes, Ava
WaughtalMentor 2021-12-15, 19:45: Hi Ava, It was wonderful to read your responses to the questions.
It is really great to hear that you are already practicing self care, which will really help you in
post-secondary. Have an awesome winter break! Best, Japnaam",,"Mentor 2021-10-30, 21:43: Hi Ava! My name is Japnaam and I am your mentor! I am in my second year of
university majoring in sociology and minoring in psychology. I also really enjoy reading, doing arts
and crafts, and binge watching Netflix. My favourite book is ""Educated"" by Tara Westover, because it
is so suspenceful. I am also watching the lastest season of Grey's Anatomy on Netflix...I can't get
enough of that show! One quote that I really like is: ""The only person you should strive to be
better than, is the person you were yesterday"" - Matty Mullins I really like this quote because I
feel that a lot of the time everyone keeps comparing themselves to others in their lives, and they
constantly feel like they have to be better than others. I feel like this quote shows that you
should just focus on improving yourself and growing, rather than keep trying to be better than other
people. Also, a public figure that I think I really look up to is Humble the Poet. He is a poet, but
writes poetry is simple language so that everyone can understand... especially people like me who
can't read poetry! I really admire how he is always writing about how to be happy within yourself in
life, which I think is really important. He is very positive, which is a trait I want in my life. I
am pretty positive most of the time, but sometimes I need an extra push. Humble the Poet's Instagram
posts really help me to be more positive. Enough about me, tell me a bit about you. I am really
looking forward to getting to know you! What are your hobbies and interests? Do you have a favourite
quote? Also, you can message me anytime, if you just want to talk, or have any questions about

to bother you, and I understand that you may not have a lot of time on your hands, but I am really
looking forward to getting to know you. Can you please send me a quick message about yourself if you
have the time? Or just let me know that you are okay and just don't have time right now? I got a
little worried when I didn't hear from you, I think I am just excited to hear from you! Best,
JapnaamMentee 2021-11-08, 16:58: Hello Japnaam, Sorry I didn't answer sooner, I was working this
weekend and I was waiting for the teacher to discuss the first message with us. My favorite movie
since I was little has been Kung Fu panda. I've watched that movie about 100 times with my family so
there are a lot of memories attached to it. My favorite quote is ¨You are too concerned with what
was and what will be. There’s a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a
gift. That is why it is called the present.¨ -Master Oogway That quote happens to be from Kung Fu
Panda! I tend to be a bit of an overthinker so I really like this quote because it reminds me not to
linger on the past and not to worry about the future. I also really love music. I like a variety of
music, from rap music to alternative rock. It's something that I feel I can connect to people
through. What is your favorite song? You also mentioned poetry! Would you mind sending me your
favorite poem? I absolutely love poetry! Maybe when I finish my recent poem I'm writing I'll share
it with you. :) My teacher has asked us to begin with the disinformation conversation. Sincerely,
Ava WaughhtalMentor 2021-11-12, 02:34: Hi Ava, No worries at all, I totally understand it can get
very busy with work and school. The quote you send is very interesting, and made me think about our
lives. I feel that we all need to learn to live in the present...it will really reduce half the
stress in our lives! It's great that you love the movie Kung Fu Panda, I liked watching it as a kid
too :) I don't really listen to music so I don't have a favourite song, but I think it's great that
you feel you can connect to people through music. Being a Sikh, I mostly listen to Sikh religious
prayers that are sung, which I feel that I can really connect to and learn a lot from too. Also, we
already found something that we have in common that we both like poetry! Yay! I would love to read
your poem when you are finished. Please do send it over to me when it's done. My favourite poem is
called ""Broken English"" by Rupi Kaur. I have included it below for you. I feel that it really makes
you think about how so many immigrants face hardships in life, and that everything does not come
easy. ""I think about the way my father pulled the family out of poverty without knowing what a vowel
was. And my mother raised 4 children without being able to construct a perfect sentence in English A
discombobulated couple that landed in the new world with hopes that left the bitter taste of
rejection in their mouth. No family no friends, just man and wife, Two university degrees that meant
nothing, one mother tongue that was broken now, one swollen belly with a baby inside. A father
worried about jobs and rent coz no matter what this baby was coming. And they thought to themselves
for a split second was it worth it to put all of our money into the dream of a country that is
swallowing us whole. And papa looks at his woman's eyes and sees the loneliness living where the
iris was. Wants to give her a home in a country that looks at her with the word visitor wrapped
around their tongue. On their wedding day she left an entire village to be his wife and now she left
an entire country to be a warrior. And when the winter came they had nothing, but the heat of their
own bodies to keep the coldness out. And like 2 brackets they face one another to hold the dearest
parts of them, their children close. They turned a suitcase full of clothes into a life and regular
paychecks to make sure that children of immigrants wouldn't hate them for being the children of
immigrants They worked too hard - you can tell by their hands, their eyes are begging for sleep but
our mouths were begging to be fed and that is the most artistic thing I have ever seen. It is poetry
to these ears that has never heard what passion sounds like and my mouth is full of likes and uhms
when I look at their masterpiece ‘coz there are no words in the English language that can articulate
that kind of beauty. I can't compact their existence into 26 letters and call it a description I
tried once but the adjectives needed to describe them don't even exist so I ended up with pages and
pages full of words followed with commas and more words and more comas only to realize that there
are some things in the world so infinite that they can never use a full stop. So how dare you mock
your mother when she opens her mouth and broken English spills out. Her accent is thick like honey,
hold it with your life, it's the only thing she has left from home. Don't stomp on that richness,
instead hang it up on the walls of museums next to Dali and Van Gogh Her life is brilliant and
tragic. Kiss the side of her tender cheek. She already knows what it sounds like to have an entire
nation laugh when she speaks. She's more than our punctuation and language. We might be able to take
pictures and write stories, but she made an entire world for herself. How's that for art"" What's

better now! I am really enjoying getting to know you better. Thank you for sharing so many
interesting things about yourself, I really appreciate it! I have opened up the rural to urban
module and I look forward to hearing from you soon. AngeleyMentee 2021-11-12, 17:19: 3 things you
like about rural living? 1. I enjoy living in a rural area because theres tons of cool, easy places
to adventure. Need any breaks? Go to the river. its super easy where i live, put your mind at ease
anytime. not to busy, no scary men that often. its just easy and simple here. 2. Two reasons why i
dont like living here is you dont have many options for work here, everyone knows everything about
you and cant go shopping and get what you need all the time. 3. a question about moving to the city
is what would it be like? how would the people be? hoe expensive would living be? how different
would it be?Mentor 2021-11-15, 12:53: Moving to the city can be a little stressful when you come
from a small town. I personally didn't live anywhere rural but it also was not a city. I was taken
aback by how much people rely on public transport and how not everyone drives themselves places.
It's also taken some time for me to realize how far certain things are compared to in small towns
when it only takes 10 minutes or less to get to the grocery store. All of the people I have met have
been very kind and I haven't had any issues dealing with others. If you are wanting to have
roommates you can get a reasonable price but it gets more expensive when you want to live alone or
live in a very specific area. Since moving here for school it can be isolating at times because
everyone is so focused on studying and their classes that making friends was hard for me in the
first year. But once you have a friend or two here it made the biggest difference for me. It makes
me love the city being able to have 2 people I can depend on here instead of just my family and
friends from back home. 1. If you moved to the city would it be to go to school or work full time?
2. Have you had friends or family in the past move to the city, and how was their experience?Mentee
2021-11-29, 13:29: Hey! Sorry I have not had anytime to come on here. We've been super busy in
class. Answer to your questions: If i moved to the city it would mostly be for school and then
slowly start working, but if all else failed i'd be working full time. I've had many friends move to
the city and sadly they all actually really dislike it. they tend to call me crying all the time so
that scares me alot! but other times it's turned out well. So thing is kinda tricky. Hope you're
doing well!Mentee 2021-11-29, 13:54: (Responses to video) I think he was trying to communicate that
living in the country is way different from the city. We obviously have much more experience
outdoors and tend to take things into our own hands. We know was to be off grid and what to do on
our own. In cities many people pay to get thing things done and over with. In the country we just do
it on our own. It is just showing what the differences are. I relate to all the outdoors stuff, I do
it all. Firewood, fishing, hunting, fixing things that have to be done. I felt encouraged to not
stop the things I do. To push through the cold and harsh times. Do what’s best, the film presents
that very well. I believe my emotional response was fairly good, thing makes me want to stay home
even more if I’m to be honest. Being home and in a small town there’s always things that need to be
done. If I’m moving to the city id feel like I’d get lazy! And id be missing out on the good stuff
and the small things that matter to me!",,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-30, 14:26: Hi Maddisyn! How are you? My name is Angeley and I will be your mentor
during the year. I am 21 years old, and currently, I'm studying psychology at university. I was
hoping you tell me a little bit about yourself. What is your favourite class at school right now?
What is something that you enjoy doing outside of school? What is your favourite part about the fall
time? If you have any questions for me don't be afraid to ask and I'll do my best to respond. Words
to live by: A song lyric that means a lot to me is ""we'll be alright"" which comes from Fine Line by
Harry Styles, these lyrics remind me that one day everything will be okay and that I just have to
get through the hard stuff right now. Food for Thought: My favourite food is pasta, specifically
lasagna though. I am vegetarian and enjoy how all of the vegetables and cheese blend together. I
would probably eat it 4/7 days of the week if I could.

Angeley, Sorry i've taken so long to answer! i've been home sick, super cool that i got you for a
mentor. few things about me, i love the outdoors and being around horses, grew up riding but
resently have fallen out of it. iIplay many sports and do fairly well in school. i suffer from a big
anxiety disorder. i love music, its definetly my get away from the world when i need a break. Words
to live by: the words ""Be Alright"" by Dean lewis, i find his music very good on soe occasions. these
words remind me that eventually it will be alright when i need that little reminder. Food of choice:
I enjoy most foods, im not a picky person at all but one of my go to foods thats good and filling
would be like steak,salad, potatos or chicken, greek salad, zuccini. My go to comfort food would
have to be fries with a burger, and somthing i tend to cook fast and easy would be baked mac n
cheese. Thank you, Maddisyn Could you also open up the rural to urban module? thanks!!",,,,"Mentee 2021-12-06, 11:57: (Responses to video) I think he was trying to communicate that living in

respond. Thank you for your insightful response, I really appreciated it. While watching the video I
kept thinking about all of the hard work it takes to make communities functional. For me personally,
that experience, of seeing how hard others work for what they have is always so fascinating and
humbling because it makes me reflect on what I have. The way that I interpreted the film was that
the woman was the little girl who got on the plane and it was a reflection of how different
communities live in different parts of the world. The woman seemed so interested in what was
happening throughout the city, almost like she was experiencing culture shock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and I'm really excited to be working with you this school year. A little about me: I'm 21 years old,
finishing up my final year before I graduate UBC with a Bachelor of Arts Degree with a double major
in English Literature and Psychology. I'm part Chinese and part Filipino, my pronouns are she/her,
and I identify as bisexual. It's a nice little coincidence, but I'm also thinking about going abroad
for a year or so to teach English to others after I graduate as well. However, my passion is less
for English as a language, but for English literature. If you've read any good books (or do in the
future), I'd love any recommendations. I admit that I take guilty pleasure in cheesy romance and
young adult/children's literature. Oh, and I see that we both also enjoy video games! Last summer, I
actually ended up building my own computer so I've been able to run a lot of new titles and have
been having a lot of fun with my new setup. Honestly though, my favourite video game will always be
good old Ace Attorney. What do you play? What console(s) do you use? Would love to hear anything
about you and anything else you'd like to tell me, as well as answer anything you might want to know
about me as well. :)))Mentor 2021-10-30, 22:44: Hello! I haven't heard from you and am just checking
in to make sure that everything is alright. How are things on your end?Mentee 2021-11-03, 22:04: Hey
Michelle! Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you. I am not a big english person when it
comes to school, but I want to teach others english as a language. I'm more of a movie person rather
than a book person, unless its something that I'm very intrested in. With video games, I play on my
laptop, as I do not own any other consoles. I play League of Legends, Valorant, Genshin Impact,
Minecraft, as well as party games with my friends. When I move out, I plan to build my own PC! I'm
applying to UViC, and KPU, I have already applied to UFV. I would apply to UBC, however I am not
good grade wise in school, and don't meet the requirements, so that would be unacheivable. I am
currently living with my aunt and uncle up north in Dawson Creek just for my senior year of high
school, although I do wish I were spending my grad year with my friends back down south. How was
your highschool and graduation experience? I'd love to hear back from you!Mentor 2021-11-04, 15:35:
Hi Mars, no worries! :)) That's really interesting, most people I've met also feel the same way with
regards to English and movies/books. I admit that I'm really, really bad at online competetive
games. The one and only time I played League of Legends I almost cried. My 16 year-old brother plays
Valorant and is ranked diamond 3, which I think is pretty impressive. But I did play Genshin Impact
for a few months (wihtout paying!) until I got tired of grinding every day. Pretty sure I finally
pulled Xiao on hard pity and then noped out a week later. Building your own PC is really rewarding
and fun, and I paid a teeny bit extra just for mine to look pretty so I'm really happy with what I
have. If you ever need any help with parts I'd love to help, but I honestly also got all of my help
from friends/Reddit LOL. It looks like you have a good set of options already for post-secondary! As
another potential option (if you really want to go to UBC) it's also possible to transfer after
studying at any of those other institutions for at least a year. My high school experience was
honestly a bit of a mess: I was in academic programs throughout, and finished with the International
Baccalaureate program. Because of that, I felt super overworked/pressured to succeed in traditional,
academic ways. By the time high school ended I was super happy to just graduate and have my UBC Arts
acceptance, but I had to deal with a lot of burnout. I kind of felt like I was just going through
everything blindly, but in the end things seemed to work out! Looking back though, sometimes I miss
seeing the same people every day and just being in the same building as them. I understand that
you're doing this program on your own time (so cool!). This is honestly my first time doing this as
well, so I might not be completely familiar with how everything in this system works. But I was told
you basically get to pick whatever you'd like to talk about for the programs! Whenever you're ready
to move on from conversations, just let me know and I'll be happy to facilitate the move.Mentor

some of the thing i like to do here in valemount BC. I like down hill mountain biking in a rural
place because it is a fun adrenaline rush and the trails are not as full as they could be in a urban
area. another thing i enjoy doing is fishing, we have a lake a couple kilometeres out of town and we
go there pretty often it is a fun activity and good quality time spent with family. one more thing i
like about living in a small town is that its not very hard to get places and when i wan tto go
somewhere i dont have to go super far. those are my favorite things about living in a rural
placeMentor 2021-10-19, 22:07: Hey Aaron, Thanks for sharing what you enjoy about living in
Valemount. It sounds like a fun place! I can see how having less people around can make the trails
and outdoors quite fun. When I lived in Vancouver there were a lot of trails to check out, but
because there are so many people in the city they were always packed, especially on nice weekends. I
am definitly enjoying living in Kelowna now where it is much, much less busy. You mentioned all the
things you enjoy about Valemount, but is there anything you don't like as much, or anything you wish
you could change? -AmandaMentee 2021-10-21, 13:58: Hey, Amanda Some things I dont like about
valemount is that I know most of the people that live here and conflicts and drama happen way to
easily. I also dont like that since we live in a small town we have less fast food and coffee shops.
One more thing I dont like is the loudness of cars and trains ( we live right accros from the CN
train station). I do like that when i want to go to a freinds place its not to far though and that
the majoraty of my family is here.Mentor 2021-10-22, 19:22: I can understand the pros and cons
between knowing most of the people in your town. It's easy to get around and see people, but I can
relate to sometimes feeling like that's too much. Living in a city you would definitely be able to
try way more cafes and restaurants! That's one of the things I enjoy most about living in a central
area. Do you have any interest in living in a large city? What do you think would be the most
challenging part about moving away from a rural area to a larger urban center? -AmandaMentor

interest in moving to urban areas. I think it will be difficult moving to a city because of the
differance in people, buildings, and cars/trucks. i am deffinetly stressed about the topic of where
i am going to live and how i am going to afford it, but the most challanging thing i think about
moving to acity would be meeting new people that i can trust and understand. my week is okay what

aaronMentor 2021-11-05, 01:29: Hi Aaron, No worries about taking awhile to respond! I have had a
busy week as well. I had the same worries even when I moved from Vancouver to Kelowna. It was
definitely difficult finding a place to live, even though I was already used to an expensive place
like Vancouver! It can also be challenging looking for a place before you move to a new city, but
most people that I spoke with were happy to show me the place over Zoom which helped a lot. Trusting
people is super important. For myself I have found that just being open to people and seeing what
they are all about and trying to develop a casual friendhship first has helped a lot in finding some
people that I can reach out to.Mentee 2021-11-09, 13:36: hello amanda if i decide to move to a

17:06: Hi Aaron, I just watched the film - it's super short at only 3 minutes long! This film was

life. What contrasts or differences did you notice when you watched the film? How about
similarities? Have a good weekend! -AmandaMentee 2021-11-29, 14:18: hello yes i agree the film is
kinda wack but its cool i noticed that it is mainly just funky music and transitions between rural
living and urban living. the difference is that rural living is hard but hard on yourself physicly.
were as urban living is hard but hard on yourself mentally. but i would'nt know lol . hope you had a
good weekendMentor 2021-12-01, 00:43: Hey, I think that is a really good conenction that you made!

are the ones that are so simple like just being able to spend quality time with our family members.
I used to love spending time with my Dad when I was little. We used to go and run errands together
and stop at the mall for what he called a ""Juice Break"" where we would just stop and have a snack
and chat about the day. I miss being young sometimes as it's a little tricky to make time for things
like that now. Is there any way you can think of keeping simple connections going with either
friends or family if oyu decide to move away from your town? -Amanda",,"Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:15: hello amanda i hope you had a fantastic wichristmas break! i know i did. i

my best to get back to you as soon as I can! Good luck!Mentee 2021-11-29, 13:28: hey Alexa, we have
had trouble with internet latly so im sorry for the delay. here is my Rural to Urban write out. :) I
really like living in a small town and here is why… . When ever I look at the mountains it just
reminds me of home, but not the home I live in or the town I live in, but the home where my heart is
. Knowing that I can go everywhere and know exactly where I am . You know everybody, pretty much I
don’t really like living in a small town and here is why… . Bears and Deer are a really common thing
to see and they break our apple trees and flower bed . There is not much to do unless you live on a
farm. I really wish I lived on a farm One question I have is… . I can’t really think of any
questions at the momentMentor 2021-11-30, 16:31: Hi Tobi, No worries! I hope everything is good now.
I think it's really interesting that you mention how you live in a small town and that you like that
everybody knows each other. You'll find that, if you move to an urban area for university, that it's
pretty similar. On university campus, there are a lot of students, but you'll be interacting with
the same people all the time and get to know them. Of course, it won't be the exact same, and you'll
most likely be more like acquaintances to a lot of the people you meet, but it's a little funny how
you'll run into the same people even in a bigger city. I also found it interesting that the view of
the mountains remind you of home. I know it's not entirely the same, but we can see the mountains in
the horizon from here too. I have to tell you, though, growing up, I never realized how rare it was
to have such a view. I'm sure yours is much nicer than mine, but my extended family live in other
parts of the world and they always compliment how you can see the mountains while you're driving.
I'm so happy that you appreciate how lucky we are to have the beautiful scenery and call it home! As
for knowing the area that you live in, if you do end up moving to an urban area for school, you'll
also find that it isn't that different. I can only speak of the greater Vancouver area, of course,
but the good thing about Vancouver is that it's incredibly small relative to other bigger, urban
centres. Another advantage we have is public transit. If you're here, I'm sure you'll be able to
navigate using public transit. The truth is, living in the city can seem daunting because that's how
they portray it in the movies. Cities are big, and busy and I hate getting lost too! But I think the
good thing is that we have great technology and people are really easy to talk to, when getting
directions. Thanks for getting back to me! P.S. have you seen the trailer for the new Spider-Man
movie?Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:13: Good morning Alexa I do love where I live, but I cant wait to move
away. I'm mostly excited to see whats out there beyond my town. I mean, it's so small that i would
consider it more of a village than a town. Thats how small it is lol. I'm really excited to move to
the city because theres more opportunity for a job, career, schooling, and to make new friends. I
have seen the trailar for Spider - Man No Way Home, and I'm really excited to watch the movie when
it comes out. Have you seen it?Mentor 2021-12-07, 14:51: Hey Tobi! I get where you're coming from.
You're right about more opportunities and the only advice I can give you is to go get what you want!
I love your attitude and your excitement and it'd only be right if you applied it to grabbing
opportunities as you see them. That's definitely something I wish I did when I was a little younger.
As for Spider-Man, no, I haven't seen it yet! I think it comes out next week or the week after, and
I'm so upset because I'm so busy during the holiday season and probably won't have time to see it
until January or something. Do you have plans to see it with your friends? Also, don't forget to
head to the next page (Blue button above our messages that says Between Worlds &gt; ) to continue on
with our dialogue. Talk to you soon! - Alexa",,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-14, 16:06: Hello, i looked at your profile, and i would really like to say that you
sound like such an amazing person and i would love to ask you a couple of questions. What is your
favorite movie? Are you a Marvel fan? And what is your favorite book?Mentor 2021-10-14, 18:32: Hi
Tobi! I'm so glad you enjoyed looking over my profile. Yours is pretty impressive too! I've always
wanted to try horseback riding. You must be a big horse lover. Is that why you answered veterinarian
for your first question? As per your first question, I have to be honest, that's a hard one!
However, I recently watched a film called Eastern Promises from the early 2000s with Naomi Watts.
It's about the Russian mafia in London, and it was pretty interesting. And yes! I am a big Marvel
fan! My favourite superhero is Captain America. What about you? Fun (or maybe not that fun) fact: my
mom bought me a Captain America mug, but she dropped it a few weeks ago and I've been severely
heartbroken ever since. Lastly, one of my favourite book series is the Hush, Hush Series by Becca
Fitzpatrick. They're a bit old now, but they're still my favourite. They're a fantasy-romance series
about fallen angels. If that might be your thing, I totally recommend them. I noticed in your
profile that you're also interested in forensic sciences or becoming a firefighter. Those are pretty
different fields! What about them interests you the most?Mentee 2021-10-15, 13:48: Good Morning. I
feel your pain about your mug, I am really tempted to buy a Winter Soldier mug. I love Bucky, but
his back story for me any ways was pretty sad. I am currently in the Fire Deptatment right now, as a
junor or as my Chief calls me ""The Rookie"" lol. Personly, my favorite movie is Venom and i am so
exited to watch Venom Let there be Carnage, i love Tom Hardy, he is such a good actor in my mind
anyways. I really like the Wings Of Fire series. And yes, i now that Firefighter and forensics
Scientists are completly different job areas lol, but i was thinking of it because it would all
depend on where i desided to live. I love that you would want to ride a horse some day, I've been
riding since i was around 2 or 3. Trust me it is the best feeling ever, its just so peaceful and you
feel like your flying. if you have any more questions then feel free to ask :)Mentor 2021-10-17,
15:50: Hi Tobi, Thanks for sympathizing with my mug catastrophe. I hope the same doesn't happen to
you if you decide to get your Winter Soldier mug. Also, I love Tom Hardy too! As for your career
choices, I think it's very mature of you to think realistically about your different options in
regards of where you might live. I also hope you're enjoying your time in the fire department. We
can never have too many first responders! But, equally, I can relate to your interest in forensic
sciences. As grim as it might be, it's just so interesting! Now that I think we've gotten to know
each other, why don't we start with going through the mentoring program? Above these messages,
you'll see a blue link called ""Working Through this Program."" You can go through it and watch the
tutorial. If you've gone through it already, great! You can proceed with the ""Conversation Choices""
and let me know which conversations you're interested in tackling together. Just remember that when
you switch over to the next modules, like ""Working Through this Program"" and ""Conversation Choices"",
that our previous messages won't show up there. You'll have to go back to this page, which is called
""Meeting Your Mentor"" if you want to remind yourself of how awesome your mentor is .",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-30, 16:41: Hey Tobi, So, it's my turn to start the discussion. This video definitely
coincides with what I said on the previous page about how the idea of moving from rural to urban is
often portrayed pretty scarily. The video highlights the really obvious differences, but the themes
are the same. In the beginning, we see the scenes of building the canoe, and then later in the
video, we see scenes of building construction. We also see kids playing in the snow and on
snowmobiles, and then also kids playing on playgrounds and other handheld games. I think the
director was trying to communicate that yes, on the surface, living far from the big city is vastly
different from what it's like in the city, but we're all people and we all go through the same
things: we need infrastructure, we want to have fun, and we shape the world around us to accommodate
for our comfort. What about you? What do you think the film is trying to show us? Are your feelings
about moving from rural to urban reflected in the film?Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:16: Hey Alexa, Honestly
I think agree with you. Although I had to watch the video about seven times because there was too
much going on and i couldnt really focus lol. How was your Christmas and New Years? I hope you had
fun and spent time with family and friends :)Mentor 2022-01-10, 18:14: Happy New Year Tobi! Yeah,
the video was a little busy. I thought it was really interesting once I processed it, but couldn't
really say what was going on at the beginning. And my holidays went great! Not as relaxing as I
would hope, and I feel as if time flew way too quickly, though it was great to see my family after
so long because of the pandemic. Thanks for asking! I hope your holidays went well too! Did you do
anything fun or get any awesome presents?Mentor 2022-01-18, 14:21: Hi Tobi! Just checking up on you.
Have you had a look at the extension activities? If you haven't, you can click one of the two blue
ext. activity links at the bottom of the video above. If you don't want to do these, that's totally
fine too. We can go ahead and complete the conversation to move on.Mentor 2022-01-24, 14:58: Hi
Tobi, I know this week is the end of the semester. Just checking up on you once more. It's up to you
if you'd like to continue with this programme, or if you'd like to end it. Please let me know! -

see that I have opened the conversation you discussed earlier. You can get started whenever- I am
ready when you are!Mentee 2021-11-25, 16:20: 3 things you like about living in a rural, for each
explain why you like it: Not very many people and its not as crowded. There are many places to go
for a walk in nature to have time to yourself. Ever want to go for a long drive, go down the lake.
Everybody lives close together so you can meet up with people and hang out at the park even go for a
small walk. 2 things you don’t like and why: There are not many opportunities for sports or places
to go shopping at. Only have one grocery store and the food it pretty expensive. I really like
playing sorts and wish we had a bigger opportunity to play more sports. It gives me something to do
and learn something new. I would get to play games against other teams and play with my own team
members and get ready for games. Another thing that I don’t like is there are not many different
opportunities for jobs. When it comes to trying to find a job for myself I find it hard to find a
job mostly because the jobs that are here are being a waitress or working at a hotel or the grocery
store and I really don’t wan to do any of those things. One question you have about moving to the
city: What is the average amount of money someone pays a month to rent an apartment?Mentor
2021-11-25, 18:01: Hi Paige, I think when considering the choice between rural or urban you have to
think what is most important to you and your future (I often find that making pro-con lists can help
with these kinds of decisions). You ask a very difficult question. The average cost of an apartment
is different in different cities. In large cities, the cost is more because it is so populated; in
some places the monthly cost is between $1500-2000 or even more. I would suggest that you do some
research based on the location you are interested in and I think Google can work wonders with these
sorts of questions. In a simple answer I will say, it is not cheap to live in a city, sadly I have
found that more access generally means more money.Mentee 2021-11-29, 13:32: Hey Megan, I will
definetly try the pro and con list. I have done a liitle bit of research in the past about living in
cities and stuff. I have looked at Victoria because i have been thinking i could go there for
University. Thank you for letting me know about the cost. I've been thinking that if i do end up
going to Victoria I would want to rent a room or whatever there. Instead of buying a house or
renting a house. Do you know the average cost of rent for a house?Mentor 2021-12-01, 21:33: Hi
Paige, UVIC is a great school! On their website they have information on their on-campus and
off-campus housing options. They even have something called ""Places4Students"" and ""RentSmart""; both
list available apartments and houses for rent that are close to campus. I would suggest you look
there, you can google ""UVIC off-campus housing"" and it should take you to that page. I looked at the
""Places4Students"" site and it will show you a variety of options with prices and housing
details.Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:02: Hey Megan, I will take a look at that and see what I find. Thank
you Would you please open the well being and self care so we can start working on that?",,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-17, 00:00: Hi Paige, I just wanted to send a message to let you know that I have
opened this conversation. Megan",,"Mentee 2021-10-14, 16:13: Hey! I seen on your profile that you like listening to music. I do to,
right now my favourite song would have to be ""If you love her"" by Forest Blak. I don't really know
why i like the song, but i like the background music. I have anxiety and OCD and i feel that i can
turn to music and if helps me think of other things. If that makes any sense. Another thing that was
on your profile was that you love writing and i do to. Is there anything imparticular that you like
writing about? I am exited to get to know you better and learn new things!Mentor 2021-10-14, 17:18:
Hi Paige! I too have anxiety and find music is a great thing to turn to. The main things that help
me with my anxiety are music, writing and reading. I read a lot, like almost too much sometimes. Do
you like to read? I think it's great that we both write, I usually write young adult fiction, but
sometimes I write about fantasy or even romance. What do you like to write about? I looked at your
profile and saw you like riding horses- that's awesome! I used to ride a lot when I was younger and
still love riding when I can. I am super excited to go through this journey with you and I hope that
I can answer any questions you have!Mentee 2021-10-18, 12:21: Megan, I don’t really like reading
it’s not really my thing and I find it hard to find a book that I actually like. I’m glad that music
and writing helps both of us with our anxiety. Another thing that I find helps me with my anxiety is
photography. I don’t ride horses that often anymore, but I feel it use to help me let go of certain
things that were holding me back. In a way I felt like I was free to think and do whatever I want
when I was on a horse. If you have any other things that help you with stress I would love to hear
themMentor 2021-10-19, 00:07: Hi Paige, It's perfectly understandable that you don't like reading,
it can be really hard to find a book that draws you in completly. Photography is another great
outlet! I was into photography for a bit but found it wasn’t allowing me to fully let things go as I
need complete distraction to relax. Another outlet I have tried, and found really helps me, is yoga.
I know it sounds a little cliché as everyone says yoga is a great relaxant. And for a time I didn’t
believe it and found it didn’t work, but then I realized it was because I wasn’t believing in it.
Nowadays, yoga is something I do every day, or every other day, at the end of my day and it really
allows me to get that release of tension and stress. I also used to swimming a lot, before I injured
by shoulder, and found that was another great away to release my stress and anxiety. Also, I don't
know if you have yet but when you are ready we can both go ahead and click into the ""Working Through
this Program"" section. Once you open that page, read the text and watch the video- if you have
questions feel free to ask anything and I will do my best to answer them!Mentee 2021-10-21, 13:36:
Hey, I have tried yoga before and I find that it doesn't help me. Maybe I haven't done it enough for
it to actually help me, but everytime I do yoga I feel not relaxed I feel the opposite of relaxed. I
almost in a way feel stressed if that makes any sense. i use to love going to the city because we
whould stay at a hotel with a pool. so i would get to go swimming. Everytime i get the chance to
swim I take that chance. I love taking pictures it makes me feel like I can do whatever I want, if
you get what im saying. I feel proud to be able to capture special moments or capture cool things in
nature. Even taking pictures with friends I find fun. I can look at them later on and remember those
fun times I had with my friends and of course my family.Mentor 2021-10-21, 14:25: Hi, I totally
understand that feeling with yoga. I was having the same issues, and I will say there is nothing
wrong with it not working for you. Everyone's anixety and stress is different and so the ways we
relax will be different too. I think it's great that you get that happiness and pride when you take
pictures. I always found myself stressed about the perfect picture, so the fun went away for me. But
I get that same prideful feeling when I write- even if no one reads it, I am proud that I wrote it,
that I created something from nothing :) Now that we have introduced ourselves and gotten to know
each other a little more, I would love for us to move into the ""Working Through this Program""
section so that we can really get started! When you are going through this, if you have any
questions- feel free to ask them and I will do my best to answer them!Mentor 2021-10-28, 22:20: Hi

Megan, When I watch this video I picture what it would feel like to live in the city. Living in a
city compared to living in the country is very different. I think the director of the film was
trying to show you that living in the coutry you get more experience in the outdoors, such as
hiking, mountain biking, swimming , cross country skiing and certain things like that. I find that
living in a country you tend to do things yourself rather then paying someone else to do it when you
live in the city. Someday I want to be able to experience what it would feel like to live in the
city and one day I hope to go to a city for Collage or University. PaigeMentor 2021-12-01, 21:56: Hi
Paige, I totally agree! The video is definitely trying to evoke that comparison in your mind. I
found that it mianly shows the aspect of pace; in nature, things, at times, seem slower, but in the
city, everything is always fast-paced. I would agree with your note on doing stuff yourself in the
country, that is clearly seen as the people in the video make their homes, while in the city, the
construction workers do it for everyone. I think it's good that to this video your response was
feelings of hope. I, myself, do not always like living in the city so I connected more to the
natural side of the video. But I do think it's important to see and experience both ways of living,
rural and urban, because then you can better understand things and find the place that makes you
happiest.Mentor 2021-12-12, 00:29: Hi Paige, I just wanted to check in with you since I haven't

do very much as well, right now my favourite song would have to be Helium by Sia. I suffer from
anxiety and depression disorders and music is a huge thing that helps me through life. i connect
with it in a different level, you know? I am interested in social work as well. I think i would
benefit from helping youth and teens even elderly. I love the outdoors and being by the river or at
the lake. Puts my mind at peace. im in grade 10, from Valemount BC. i also play many different

is a tough situation for sure! I find I do much better in school when I keep track of all my due
dates and test dates. I just write them all down in my planner or phone calender and that way I
thankfully don't find myself there too often! I know it sometimes happens to everyone though! I
think that's when its important to stay caught up in class because hopefully you will have learned
the material at least once already. :) How do you usually handle that situation?Mentee 2021-11-08,
15:44: I usually stay up all night and forcing my self to reread every thing so that even though i

Thanks for the advice.Mentee 2021-11-09, 13:41: RURAL TO URBAN Three things you like about living in
a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. You are not scared to go outside or you feel more
comfortable being with people because you know a lot about their personality and their life story.
You are more able to express yourself and be who you are because there aren’t too much people who
will give a crap out of you. There will be less store and less fast foods that are going to tempt
you waste all your cash and make you broke for small amount of stuff Two things you don’t like and,
again, explain your reasons for each. There are less opportunities because you are too far from
cities You get bored so fast because someday you’ll realize that you’ll be doing the exact same
thing all over again but this time it’s not going to be funny anymore One question you have about
living or moving to the city How much expenses wold I have to pay to survive in a big city and be
able to live my life in the fullest?Mentor 2021-11-09, 20:09: Those are great thoughts, Dan! I
definitely agree that I like being more comfortable with people in a rural area because of how well
I know them. What do you mean when you say there are less opportunities compared to cities? Do you
mean for schooling, career options, making friends, etc.? That is a good question about the
financial cost of living in a city compared to a rural area! I have found it is definitely more
expensive to live in a larger city. However, there are some ways to minimize the cost. For example,
you could live with roommates in a city, which usually brings down the cost of rent compared to
living alone! When I moved to Vancouver for a few months I did not bring a vehicle, which saved me
some money, and the public transit system there is very reliable so I was still able to get around
easily. The cost of living varies depending on which city you are looking at too! Do you think you
would ever want to move to a city?Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:00: Sorry for late replies, i wasn't able to
log in for a while but all good now. Yeah me and my family are planning to move to a city after or
before i graduate. But i still don't like the idea of living in one because it is so hard and it is
more dangerous.Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:05: Can you open the next part of rural to urban?Mentee

opportunities and aso not far to any health center It is also benificialto the elderly and to those
who sick good scholorship in education and good work as well.Mentor 2021-12-22, 20:22: Those are

like to do as a career?Mentee 2021-10-19, 17:23: Hi again Kyra, i am thinking about going to a
medical school but i don't know which school is the best and how to start it. do you have any
suggestions? feel free to share lolMentor 2021-10-19, 22:20: Nice! As far as which school is the
best, I don't think there is a right answer! The best school is the one that is right for you. Some
things to consider are where the school is, how many students go there, what programs they offer,
and what the requirements are to apply. I can really only speak to going to post secondary and
medical school in Canada, as that is all I have done, but some people also go to other countries! I
know that's a lot but you definitely don't need to worry about it yet! What are your favourite
subjects? Have you had any ideas for what you'd like to study before medical school?Mentee
2021-10-21, 13:30: Thanks for the idea about the school and for my subject, i really like math some
science and a little bit in english. If your talking about academic subjects LOL. And i am thinking
about being a cardiologist but i dont know where to start. Is it ok to ask for some tips and tricks
in which would help be a cardiologist? Thank you for your time and sorry for asking to many
questionsMentor 2021-10-22, 12:34: No need to apologize for asking questions! That's what I am here
for! I also enjoyed math and science in school! I was never very good at english or social studies,
lol. Wow! Being a cardiologist would be very cool! My only advice would be to study things you love!
Becoming a cardiologist takes many years, so I believe it is important to enjoy whatever it is you
are doing. For example, many people complete an undergraduate degree before going to medical school,
so I always recommend focusing that on something you enjoy because it will make it much easier to
study on the days you really don't feel like studying. I hope that makes sense! What makes you want
to become a cardiologist?Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:33: Thank you for the advice, and i think i want to
become a cardiologist because many people died from heart disease and that includes my granfather in
my moms side. And my grandmother on my dads side have clogged in he heart. It makes me feel
vulnerable specially when i can't help someone in my family in need. So yeah thats it, i wanna
become a cardiologist because i don't wanna see people experiencing the pain that i have been.Mentee
2021-10-25, 12:44: Can you open or unlock the ""From Rural to Urban"" module in the program? Our class
is going to start this module tomorrow. Thank you.",,,,"Mentee 2022-01-10, 16:12: What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about
the relationship between living in the country and living in a city? That living in a country is way
different in living at a city. And it is more dangerous living on a city and way too crowded than
country. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? Yes, I feel like
right now living here is way better life style than living in a city because I feel like it is
harder living in a crowded places specially when there are more store that can trigger you to buy
something. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to
create those feelings in you? I felt calm inside but at the same time opened. Well when the creator
of the film showed how different it is living in a country and in a city, when he/she tried to show
the ups and downs of living in either country or city. In what ways does your emotional response to
the film match – or not match - how you are feeling about possibly moving to the city for
post-secondary schooling? I can’t really tell how my emotions responded to the film. I feel like it
is going to be ruff moving from country to city because of the lifestyle and air that I got used to
but it’s going to be interesting because I can’t wait to go on a new chapter of my life.Mentor
2022-01-13, 10:15: Glad you had a nice break!! Thanks for your thoughtful responses Dan! I think you
are very right about living in the country and city being very different but I'm glad you recognized
there are ups and downs to both! It sounds like you are a bit nervous about your move to the city
but it's good to hear you are open to experiencing this new chapter in life! I think the video

file"" for when you might need to decompress. I personally find that I have to work actively to
prevent burnout while in school, and practicing self care is a great way to do so. Are you good at
practicing basic self care activities such as drink enough water, eating enough healthy food, and
engaging in regular physical activity? What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that

That is a good song. I have heard it on the radio I think! One of my favourite songs in ""Drops of
Jupiter"" by Train. I like it because it feels quite upbeat and fun, but it also reminds me of the
vastness of space and, in a way, feels inspiring to me. I also just think that the melody is really
pretty, and it's fun to sing along to! That does sound like quite a loney landscape! For me, a
tundra comes to mind. I think the feeling of being able to see far into the distance with little
vegetation or wildlife would feel very lonely. I heard that your teacher assigned five conversations

the top and i checked out the song its awesome .Mentor 2021-10-29, 13:53: Hi Asacia, sorry it's
taken me a few days to get back to you. I wanted to get in contact with my supervisor to check if I
am allowed to unlock all of the conversations at once. Typically, us mentors are told to only unlock
one at a time so we can work through them together and chat about the topics as we move through the
program. Normally you would let me know which one you wanted to do first and then we would get
started on it together. I have not heard back from my supervisor yet, so for now I will just unlock
one of the conversations and we can start working through it. I will unlock the ""well being and self
care"" conversation, so click on it at the top of this webpage and we can continue our conversation
there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

things I like about living in a rural area. - How we can all connect and become close family
friends. -Fairs and holiday fundraisers we have multiple a year. - Lastly the mountains and stars
are the best at night. 2. What I don't like about living in a rural area. -The wild fires we have
every year is what I dont like about living by the mountains. - I was a city girl always close with
big groups of strangers and kindness, here is smaller groups and I feel alone even with my peers at
school and outsdie of school. 3. knowing from growing up in a city, is very big and lots of tall
bulidings and more activites to do and is more expansive with all the shoppipng spree in the Mall
and stores and gas. City was my home eveing though a rural area is more for me because im alone even
though it's sad but i like to be able to walk at night watching the stars without worrying about
soemone skecthy to pop up, The village is very kind and trusting well some. That's the end of my
questions.Mentor 2021-11-29, 16:08: Right?! the stars are so beautiful in the country, and I always
feel so welcome visiting small towns. It is quite a difference from the city where sometimes it can
be difficult to run into people you know or randomly start conversations. That is definitely
something to appreciate about rural areas. In the city, a lot of people can be rushed, but as you
said, there are many activities to meet people with similar interests, so its possible to make lots
of friends but by putting yourself out there into activities. Do you find that in your town you find
it hard to find people like you? Or do you feel like there are not a lot of opportunities or people
in general? I have a good friend who came from a very small town who had met a lot of people
virtually with similar passions for art because he found it hard to find people who got along with
in his area.Mentee 2021-12-02, 18:36: Yeah! The stars are beautiful. Yes I do find it hard finding
people with the same interests and actually I'm the only deaf student in school and outside of
school. so it is hard finding people like me here, but in a city I can find way more people like me.
Yes I do feel like there are not a lot of opportunities and people in general. I don't get along
with my peers so It's hard for me to make friends outside of school after what i've been through
with my peers.Mentor 2021-12-04, 16:04: There are definitely lots more people here. For example,
growing up in a city, I often also felt like I didn't get along with the peers at my school in my
area because we had different hobbies and interests, but through sports and dance I was able to meet
friends that I got along with better. There will always be some difficulty finding people who are
similar to you but it is easier to make more of an effort in a city where you can either find groups
online or in activities to meet people. what do you like to do in your free time? or what are some
of your hobbies?Mentee 2021-12-06, 17:25: Yeah I agree. In my freetime I work on homeschool can't
fall behind, listen to music or write my own music, visit grandparents and cousins, late night walks
and lastly Baking goods or cooking meals. My hobbies by favorites: 1. Basketball 2. Volleyball 3.
Writing songs 4. Photography These are my favorite hobbies I do everyday. What about you what are
you're hobbies and what is your favorite Holiday, mine is Christmas Eve because we get to decorate
the tree which is coming home today! and chrismas brings family back home which i love to see my
families.Mentor 2021-12-06, 20:40: Awesome! My hobbies are dancing (flamenco), reading, and hiking
:) I love the outdoors, and I also love what I'm studying in the school which is psychology. are you
on any teams where you live for volleyball and basketball? it's always more fun to share hobbies
with others, it was difficult for me to quit soccer when I did but I got so busy. I love Christmas
as well because I have a break from work/school and get to see my friends who come back from across
the country from abroad universities. I used to love photography as well, there are some great film
and art schools in the cities and many opportunities to do that if you wish as a career. any other
interests you have in after graduating from high school for work or for anything?Mentee 2021-12-08,
14:48: That's cool! I looked into Flamenco dancing and I really like the dancing it's really good. I
love outdoors as-well. I can't wait to start psychology counselling when I graduate! Yes, I am on a
basketball team our team name is Timberwolves! I just started baskeball season last week and we have
a tournament coming after Christmas break, I'm to excited. Yeah I love Photography and i will look
into film and art schools. Yes i have other interests after graduating highschool, I want to help
with foster kids/teens and work with them, i would like to start a photography bussiness and lastly
working with Ocean species or wildlife animals like lions, Tigers, Elephants, Girrafes!Mentor
2021-12-08, 21:51: Wow those are some great interests you have, I love animals too so it makes me
happy to hear that you want to work with those animals! in the city, I thought I wanted to be. a
marine biologist so I volunteered at an aquarium and discovered that I didn't like it as much as I
thought. I still love animals, but having experiences volunteering or working in different jobs
kinda shows you what you do and don't like to do every day of your. life. If you have any cool
photos to show from your photography passion id love to see it! and good luck with your tournament,
do you play against people from other towns? do you get to travel?? i miss having tournaments in
soccer and being able to travel with that. :)Mentor 2022-01-09, 22:41: School is back in session

you get the chance!Mentee 2022-01-13, 16:27: Hey! Yeah school is in session but i havent been at
school because I am currently sick, getting better though. My winter break was fun but really cold
and had a great Christmas and New Years Eve. How was you're winter break? And also we were on
lockdown till the 10th so we started school this monday. Glad to be back and talking with you
again.Mentor 2022-01-14, 18:31: Oh no! hope you get better soon. i was also sick for a few days but
I took lots of vitamins to get better omg, it was so scary though I thought I had covid. My winter

:DMentee 2021-10-15, 12:09: Hey, I looked onto your profile and read through some things you’ve been
through and communicated with some things like the eating disorder till this day still struggling. I
know we will get along well and be good partners. This quote I’ll be sharing with you connects with
most of the time here is the quote “Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire.” By
Jennifer Lee. I connect with this quote because it reminds me to be brave and strong with your
problems and not let anything or anyone let you down the hole or dark space. I try to be strong most
of the time but lately has been hard trying to eat but fake I did eat then I’m in the bathroom
getting rid of the calories. It’s been hard these past two years but doing Career life education is
helping me and making know I can do this and achieve my dreams. The song I’m showing you is a good
song it’s called “Leave a light on” by Tom Walker. I like this song because the song centers mainly
on overcoming addiction and were inspired by a friend of his who had been battling severe drug
addiction. In the song, Walker encourages his friend to get help. People with problems often feel
like there isn’t anywhere safe to go - they feel like they’re alone. Walker, Tom. “Leave a light
on.” TomWalkerVEVO, YouTube,

2021-10-15, 13:36: Hey! I'm a 10th grade student, and I love animals and would love to see pictures
of your kitten:) Couple facts about me: I like writings songs, taking care of animals and learning
about them as-well, I am a basketball fan and have a team called Timberwolves. I have a 3yr old dog
and a 1yr old cat, I will send pictures once i get a good picture of both of them! What's you're
favorite sports? I'm glad to meet you as-well!Mentor 2021-10-15, 18:03: Thank you for sharing that
beautiful song and music video! I’ve never heard of it, I really appreciate learning about new
artists and songs because I love music, especially those who write meaningful and inspiring lyrics.
That’s great that you’re a song writer, it’s a great way in general to write about feelings and
emotions throughout all of life’s ups and downs. I played a bit of basketball in high school, I also
played soccer and volleyball, but I don’t play sports anymore. I am a dancer! I dance flamenco, it’s
a spanish type of dance, so I perform quite a bit. I would love to see some pictures of your pets I
will definitely show you the most CUTEST and “awww” worthy pictures when I can. I also really
appreciate you opening up about your eating difficulties, I know talking about / admitting those
kinds of things are very hard. I began having those types of issues around grade 10-12, the biggest
help for me to get out of that was transitioning to university and being able to talk about it with
friends and family. If you ever need support, just know that I am here to listen and connect with
you. Let me know if you want to share anything or ask anything, I am proof that it can go away and
we can learn other ways of coping with troubles. Always here :) now lemme see if I can send pet pics
...Mentor 2021-10-15, 18:06: Also, I'd like to know what kind of music you like to listen to? That
way if I find some good music I can share it with you :)Mentor 2021-10-15, 19:41: (first day we got
the kitten, PJ. hopefully you can view it)Mentee 2021-10-18, 12:06: Hey, I fell in love with you're
kitten! so adorable. Sadly I havent got pictures of my pets yet, hopefully sometime this week. I
like to listen to Country, blues, hip-hop. I like to dance as-well but don't dance infront of people
much, I just sing for the school. I play basketball and a little bit of Volleyball. I'm really glad
i can talk to you with my problems and know you will be here for me, I promise to not put much on
you. I'm half Spanish and love to speck french! Thank you again.Mentor 2021-10-19, 13:42: Hey! Do
not worry about laying too much on me, thats what im here for to lsiten to whatever you need to get
off your chest. I am half Mexican and half Italian but i only speak english! wish i could speak
other languages, that's GREAT that you do. Ill see if i can find music in those genres, or ill send
more pictures of my kitten when I take some more :) I think well get along super well, Im glad to be
talking to you!Mentee 2021-10-26, 19:55: Hey, sorry it's been 7 days, I've been busy with school and
family problems. I got pictures of my pets, but still trying to figure how to send them to you.
Thanks again for saying to not worry about puting much on you it means alot. I'm glad to be talking
to you as-well and ive found another clean song to show you, I'll put the link at the end of the
text. I have a queston to ask, Have you read any books that helped you develop your career? If do
what books have you read if you remember, because i was told books can help getting into the careers
you're looking for. Lastly, How did you get into your career? Again if you remember I would love to
know how you achive youre careers.Mentor 2021-10-27, 14:45: Nice to hear from you :) Let me know if
you want to share any of those school or family problems! I know how difficult it can be someitmes
to manage school on top of conflcits at home, im also trying to figure out how to manage my
university load!! its very hard. IN terms of books to read, it really depends on what youre
interested in. I read books about psychology once I realized that thats the subject i like the most,
I read stories from professors in that field, and common books related to psycholgoy. Also watch ted
talks! or crash course videos on youtube! it gives you a good sense of of what you like and you can
learn interesting things very quickly. My favourite psycholgoy books were ""the upside of stress"" and
""blink"". I read these in my senior high school year and realzied thats what i wanted to study, they
went into detail about what pscyhologists do. IM sure there are other books like that related to
other fields too, btu i would start with exploring youtube first to find a topic or author you
like!Mentor 2021-10-27, 14:46: if you click the blue button ""working throguh this program"" and read
through that section, and then click ""conversation choices"" we can get to the anchor texts which
will help guide our conversations, ones that your teacher would like to be dsicussed and also

soon!Mentee 2021-10-21, 13:49: Hello Sheetal. I’m really interested in living in a larger area when
I’m older, and I would really like two own a house, I’ve already started saving up, but I know it
will be hard so I was wondering if you have any tips on budgeting?Mentor 2021-10-24, 17:45: Hi
Adalie, You have set some great goals for yourself! You are right, owning and buying a house is
quite expensive, however, you are on the right path by saving some money. Budgeting can be tricky
but a tip I have is having control and being consistent with your money. In other words, let's say
you tell yourself that every week you will put $10 into your savings. Although it may not seem like
a lot of money, by the time the year ends you will have around $520 saved up. Another tip I have is
asking yourself if you actually need something or if you just want it. It is okay to splurge every
once in a while but a lot of times I spend money on things that I do not necessarily need. For
example, last week I bought a phone case just because I liked the design on it and thought it was
cute (it had puppies all over the case). But, I did not need it because my phone case was perfectly
fine! I'm just curious but have you thought about where you would like to own a house? (ex:
Vancouver) If not, that is completely okay! I would also love to know why you want to buy a larger
house? (ex: For school, For the experience? Living with friends?) Last but not least, can you please
tell me 3 things you like about living in a rural area! As well as two things you don't like! Please
explain your answers so I can get a better idea! Please continue to ask me questions, the more
questions the better! :) Talk to you soon!Mentor 2021-11-01, 22:01: Hi Friend! I miss talking to
you! I know life can get quite overwhelming and busy … that’s completely okay! How are you doing? I
would love to hear back from you! Mentee 2021-11-02, 16:42: Hello Sheetal I would love two live in
Kelowna when I grow up, and based off of the currant housing market there, and the constant
incurrence in price, for a good down payment my goal is 50,000 dollars, and every month I’m only
saving about $400 a month, witch isn’t quite enough. I would like to live in a house , because I
want to become a foster mom when I am older, I would like a yard for a dog, I’m loud, I play
interments, I like space, and having a space I can do where I can do what I want to is important to
me. The house doesn’t half to be large, and I would like to live in Kelowna. I don’t really like
anything about living in a rural town, I like my farm but nothing else. I don’t really like the lack
of things to do in the winter, and I don’t like everyone knowing me. Ps. I had this written up,
before, but forgot to send itMentor 2021-11-04, 00:27: Hi Adalie, Glad to see you have a plan!
Also, $400 a month is a great starting point! I did not start saving until I was in grade 12 so
don't be too hard on yourself! If you want to start saving more money maybe try my first suggestion
of setting aside $10 a week, which will drastically increase your savings by $100! I know you may
want to save more money but as time passes, this really does add up and as you have access to more
money you can continue to increase your savings goal! If you don't mind me asking, at what age would
you like to move out? Because if it isn't until later in your life that you want to become a foster
mom (which is AMAZING) and have more space maybe buying a small 1 bedroom apartment to see if you
would like to settle in Kelowna would be a good place to start. Starting off small would give you
the chance to know if you like the environment in Kelowna and if you don't there are tons of other
cities in BC you can settle in! I love dogs! what kind of dog would you like? and what kind of
instruments do you play? Also, do not be afraid to ask me more questions! However, if you do not
have any other questions regarding this topic please let me know and we can move on to our next
topic :)Mentor 2021-11-10, 22:58: Hi Adalie, I hope you are enjoying your week so far! I found a
couple of old instruments that I played when I was in high school and I immediately thought of you
since you play instruments! I miss talking to you! How are you doing, is everything okay?Mentee
2021-11-12, 17:26: I play the piano, and drums. I want to be an emergency foster mom at age 26, and
a foster, foster mom at 29. I would really dislike living in a one bedroom apartment, since I would
have to leave my dog behind, because he would be old and getting to the age where he could die at
any point, and I can rent out half of the house that I buy so I wouldn’t really have to worry about
the mortgage. I’m moving out after I graduate high school to go to collage. I don’t think I have any
more Questions .Mentor 2021-11-15, 20:37: Hi Adalie, Wow, you really are such an inspiration,
becoming a foster mom is such a unique experience! You can absolutely rent out a house and see where
it goes! I used to play the flute when I was in high school! I have always wanted to learn to play
the piano but I never got into it! Maybe you can teach me some tips and tricks! Since you brought up
the topic of college, I am going to change our topic to paying for school! Even though we have
completed this module please feel free to bring up any other questions you may have about this topic
in our other modules! we don't always have to keep discussing the module topic :)",,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-15, 13:57: Hello I’m very existed to talk with you with you. My name is Adalie

mushrooms, pork, fish cakes, kimchi, are a few of my favorite, you can get it really cheap and it
still tastes good, you can cook breakfast raman, tea time ramen, second breakfast raman, brunch

have never had Raman but I have heard it is delicious and would love to try it one day! Maybe you
could recommend some places or types of Raman for me to try! I also never knew you could eat Raman
at all times of the day! That is super cool! A quote I love is “The grass is greener where you water
it."" by Neil Barringham. I think this quote is worth remembering because people always compare
themselves to others and wish they were someone else but it is important to remember that if you
focus on self-love and work on achieving your goals you will learn how great you really are. A song
I love to listen to when I feel unmotivated or down is ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" by Natasha
Bedingfield because it is super upbeat and fun to listen to! It makes me want to get up and dance!
It is worth listening to because it reminds me that no matter the situation I will be okay! This

conversation. You may now start with the anchor texts and respond as directed. Before starting this
module, I would like to share my experience on this topic. I was born in a rural setting, but I
moved with my parents and started schooling in a city. Despite the fact, I didn't have the typical
urban setting experience because I belong to a small town and didn't have many opportunities there.
But, my transition to a large metropolitan city for my University was not as hard as I imagined it
would be! Therefore, the most important advice I can give you for an easy transition is to GO FOR
IT! DON'T HESITATE! Don't avoid things only because you don't have experience with them. You might
make some mistakes initially, get lost, feel alone, but time passes, and learning comes with it. If
you don't know what to do, where to go, ask somebody. You will find a ton of people who are willing
to help you, approach them. You know what, by the end of your school years in an urban city, you'll
be guiding other people ways where you got lost in your first week. So whenever you hesitate or get
nervous during your transition, remember what I am telling you, GO FOR IT! Have a great week!
Looking forward to your reply. Thanks (PS. Let me know if you can't access the anchor texts or face
any other technical issue)Mentee 2021-11-08, 16:08: Hey Khushman I go to school in a small town but
i live in a really rual area and drive about fourty minutes to get there. I enjoy being able to have
space away from other people and just get a break from all the noise and stress of life. I live in a
place surrounded by mountains and forests so i love getting to be in a place with such beatiful
scenery every day. Lastly my highschool only has around eighty students so it is a really nice
enviorment to know all of your teachers well and to know everyone in your school. I have always felt
living in a small town that perhaps I would have more options for my extracurriculer activitys and a
better school if i lived somewhere else. I also feel that having a class of only 12 people I dont
have as many people to challenge my learning. My question about moving to an urban place would be
how is it to move to a city and meet friends when you dont know anyone there? Thanks, MadelynMentor
2021-11-10, 18:49: Hi Madelyn Living in a place where you are surrounded by mountains and forest is
truly a blessing! It must be super soothing to be near the divine nature in its untouched form. I
agree with you, we sometimes need to cut off from the hustle-bustle of life and be in a moment to
self-reflect. And you can, actually must continue doing that even after you move to a school in a
city; you definitely will have opportunities for that. It must be warming to know all the people you
see in your high school! And yes, it offers fewer opportunities to grow and explore. Well,
transitioning to a new place sounds challenging, and it indeed is, but don't worry, you'll easily
cope-up with that. I would advise you to join as many Whatsapp or other social media groups of
incoming classes as possible. Also, join the orientation program that your future school will most
likely organize to welcome the incoming class. Through these, you'll come across many people that
you might become friends with, and it will make the whole transition a lot less intimidating. But,
remember, during the initial days of your school, you will meet and hang out with a ton of people;
but, it's essential to sort and keep only the ones you liked. Drop the friendship that you think can
be harmful to your mental and emotional health right away. It's completely ok to let go off the
people you don't connect to. Everyone you'll meet is on the same boat as you; everyone will be
willing to have conversations with you and become friends with you. Even though almost everyone
moved in in September, I moved to my University campus recently. And, it's comparatively harder to
become friends with people when they already have found their groups. I had good conversations with
some of my fellow students through a Disord server university made for us. So, I could rely on them
during the very initial days of my on-campus experience. Nonetheless, if you'll move in on time, you
will have many resources, events, and gatherings organized by your school. I understand that
socializing this much can be challenging for you as an introvert; therefore, I would say that don't
force any friendships. Don't put in too much effort. Go with the flow. You will meet your people.
Try saying Hi to the people you meet. Trust me, everyone will be amicable and welcoming. Also, have
conversations with your advisors and counselors in the school. Approach them if you struggle with
anything, feel home-sick, or maybe just introduce yourself and ask for their advice. Things will be
very fast going when you transition but, you'll settle down gradually. You will want to do numerous
things but will have less time. Therefore, don't rush and take it all easy and slow. Stay attentive
and distant from those you think are not suitable for your personal and academic growth. Of course,
many friendships will form and end in the initial weeks, and that's ok! Complete the anchor text two

the best!",,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-10, 13:56: Hi Madelyn, I opened the Well Being and Self Care module. You may start

school. I'm waiting to hear from you! All the best for your classes this term!",,"Mentee 2021-10-14, 16:20: Hi Khushman, I agree that teenagers have such an important and interesting
perspective on the world. A quote that resonates with me around that topic would be “Sometimes you
risk everything for a life worth living, even if your not the one that’ll be around to see it”-
Cherie Dimaline. Growing up in a few small towns and being around such amazing groups of people I
feel that this quote really speaks to our fight against things like the climate crisis, and how it
is possible to get through them. I am just very grateful that I don’t feel alone in these problems.
I feel as though there are lots of people around me who really do believe in “[risking] everything
for a life worth living” A place that feels lonely for me would sometimes be around other people. I
enjoy being by myself so being alone in the literal sense is not necessarily lonely for me. Lonely
to me would be sitting in a group of people but feeling like you can’t talk to anyone, or they
wouldn’t understand you. Anyways, hope your day goes well thank you for reading. -MadelynMentor
2021-10-15, 08:51: Hi Madelyn, I hope you are staying safe! Yes, even I agree with this quote. It's
Human nature that we run blindly after a ""dream life,"" but we often end up missing the present
moment, which is worth more than a million dollars. Nature is divine and a true blessing in the
literal sense, but we see it passing off our hands by running after the technologies. Although
technical development is essential, compromising it with the most excellent, most divine, and
life-giving nature can not be justified. You are definitely not alone in this fight against the
climate crisis, water levels falling, pollutions, etc.; in my country as well, we are experiencing a
terrible phase of the climate crisis. Another more painful part is that we are losing humanity along
with nature :( I totally understand the need for me-time. Although I'm an ambivert, as much as I
desire social connection, my longing for staying all by myself is the same. I know right, we have a
whole universe within ourselves, so how can we feel lonely! I assure you, dear Madelyn, that you can
talk about anything you want with me; you can share all your experiences, thoughts, and feelings
without hesitation. I understand you, and I'm here to support you. Anyways, I'm super excited to
have met you and started conversations with you. I'll send you a message regarding our next steps
real soon, and we'll decide on where to start from. Till then, have a great time :) -KhushmanMentor
2021-10-21, 18:02: Hi Madelyn, I hope you are staying safe. I'm writing to inform you that I have my

will contact you as soon as I reach campus. Thank you for understanding. Hope you have good rest of

Anchor text #2 I felt that the director of the film was trying to communicate the relationship
between city and rural living through a few diffrent aspects. In the comparison between building log
homes by hand and building skyscrapers with cranes. They both show a hardworking team. As well i
feel the documentry seems to comunicate a fast paced enviorment in both the city and rurally. The
main diffrence is there is more of a family enviorment in the rural setting. I personally related to
the part of the documentry where the girl was surrounded by the people running around a busy city.
Everything around her seemed to blur and it reminded me of how i feel in social situations with lots
of people. While watching the video i did get a the feeling of the documentrys intensity. I belive
this is mostly due to the directors choice of music and rushed filming style. The way the film shows
the woman walking alone in the middle of a busy city mirrors my thoughts about moving out of a rural
enviorment. Even now anytime I visit a city i get a similar feeling. However I am sure I will get
used to it after a while. -thanks for reading and sorry again for not responding earlier
MadelynMentor 2021-12-04, 16:11: Hi Madelyn, It's okay, I completely understand that maintaining
active participation here along with your studies can get challenging sometimes. You can let me know
whenever you need extra time with any anchor text. Great interpretation! I can also relate to your
emotions and feelings related to this video. As depicted in this video, life in both rural and urban
settings is immensely fast-paced. The only differences between the two situations are the feeling of
family as you mentioned and the sense of oneness. During my first week on campus, I was walking to
the library while listening to some music and I tried observing everything that was happening around
me from a distance as if I'm watching it all from above like a camera. It was a little intimidating-
everyone walking while looking at their phones, doing their work, nobody bothered what the person
standing next to them was doing. Especially for someone like you and me who are habitual of knowing
well the community we lived in and having conversations with everyone, this experience can be
different. But, looking at the positive side, this particular culture of large cities is good, in
the sense that nobody cares what you are doing. Live the way you like, dress the way you feel
comfortable, listen to music while walking, look around at trees, birds, etc. Do whatever makes you
happy. You will gradually start liking it and find your safe place in it. For Initial time, you need
to prepare your mind- tell yourself that your existence among all these people, large buildings,
technology the whole city is important and matters! I totally understand your feeling of relating to
that girl walking alone with everything else blurred. But, that inside is a safe place for you,
right? From our conversations until now, I know that you will enjoy yourself in a metropolitan city
during your school. It is especially hard for those who seek validation and safety from outside,
from social groups, and then feel at home. But, you, on the flip, have your whole world inside you.
You will need friends who you'll easily meet. But, walking alone on your campus, talking to
yourself, with no one watching- you will enjoy it the most! Let me know if you have any questions
about this first conversation topic. Do you want to do any extension activity? If you don't have any
further comments or questions, should we move to our next topic? And, lastly, which topic do you
want me to open next? It's completely okay, take your time. Just inform me once when you need more
time. Good luck!Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:01: Hey, Yes, if we could move onto the well being and self
care unit that would be great. Thank you -Madelyn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

having a wonderful day I just finished watching the videos I definitely have a few thoughts on them.
The one that was probably most helpful to me was the studying one and how you can be more effective
while studying with less stress. I really enjoyed being able to relate to some of the points but
became fascinated by the one's I didn't already do. I think that I have a lot to learn from that
video because I'm absolutely terrible at studying and note taking. whenever I actually buckle down
and try to take good Notes, it almost always after the fact looks like chicken scratch and I can
never recall the information very well, so I end up messing up the simple questions on tests and
quizzes. I think that if I was able to convey my ideas better, with the use of organized notes and
pictures along side them. The correspond pictures would help me recall when it comes to the
test/quiz. My grades would probably improve especially in English since it's not my strongest class.
One thing I sorta want to ask is how you're able to convey the ideas of the presenter to make clear
and consice notes that relate to the topic? Thank you for your time -ChaseMentor 2021-11-18, 21:08:
Hi chase, Very unique and thoughtful summaries! I do believe you have the potential and ability to
study better! As for notes taking, you are not the only who are in trouble. Taking concise and
to-the-point notes is also not easy for me. When the instructor speaks too fast or the slide is a
little vague, I will panic . However, I will follow some steps to take notes as better as possible.
First, take advantage of resources the instructor gives me. In some courses, I might be given the
slides, workbooks, or reading materials from the teacher. I will initially take my notes based on
these materials because they are what the teacher requires me to focus on. If I don't lucky enough
to have them and have to take notes on my own, I will catch keywords in class and supplement them
ASAS after class. You are right, I cannot record everything detailed and well-organized in class,
but I have time to review it after class. Just make sure your notes in class are clear and important
so that you can recall them easily. At least, it is never a bad idea to ask for your classmates'
help. I always borrow my classmate's notebook because of her excellent notes. You know, we cannot be
good at everything. We are students. But we can constantly learn something from our teachers and
classmates. [Here are some articles relevant to study strategies from my university and you are
welcome to read. Hope they are helpful for you]: How to set yourself up for academic success:

https://students.ubc.ca/ubclife/neuroscience-effective-studying?utm_source=post-most-viewed My
question for you at this time is: how do you prepare exams if you have a hectic exam scheme? That's
something I'm gonna face! Have fun and take care. YimingMentee 2021-11-23, 12:42: Hi Yimming, First
off I just want to say that your question is great but I don't know if you going to like my answer
very much. For exams when they come around I often go to my Google classroom and just read over all
the slides that we did in the unit on, then afterwards I'll look over my old tests seeing what I did
wrong and correct them to the best of my abilities. I never really use my notes to study because
they're just so awful and I can't make anything out of them, but as of recently I took some of the
note taking strategies from the videos into affect and cleaned up my notes a little bit but they're
still kinda chicken scratch and illegible so I kinda suck at studying. I do love that you borrow
without returning others notes because I definitely relate to that. I'll take photos of the good
kids notes, then read over them on my hour long bus ride on the test day morning which somewhat
prepares me. One thing I'm kinda curious about is how you set up your notes and provide context to
them that helps you study for tests and exams? Also what strategies are good for the actual
wrighting down aspect, because I know lectures are long with lots of info that the prof will just
breeze through so writing everything down is kinda impossible for me at least.Mentor 2021-11-26,
05:03: Hi chase, Happy Friday! Thanks for your inspiring exam-preparing tips! They might be really
helpful for my next couples of weeks. You asked two ""tricky"" questions for me. Sorry I am not such
an expert in note-taking! First question, I would say ""expanding deeper with your notes"". Maybe your
current notes are not adequate for cramming all knowledge, but you can consider the notes as the
outline, and recall what else are important and shoulde be remember in this course. Then, you
supplement more details in your notes, and they might look more meaningful for study. Next, there
are no doubts that no one can record everything in his notebook, and I personally will focus on the
instructor's guideline and syllabus. I think teacher's emphasis would give your hints for what
aspect is more important for exams and quizzes. In this turn, I gonna bother you about
procrastination, because it is really an issue for me. Sometimes I wanna finish one task on Monday,
but I catch myself not finishing it by Tuesday. The initial reason for that is even for wasting time
on social media! Do you have the procrastination issue and how can you tackle it? Thank you! Cheers,
YimingMentor 2021-12-03, 22:55: Hi chase, Hope this message finds you well. I just want to reconnect
with you as I have lost you for more than 1 week. I know you are busy, but am also very excited to
receive your response. YimingMentee 2021-12-09, 10:23: Good morning Yimming Hope your having a good
day I just want to start by saying I absolutely love your question because... I have a major
procrastination problem. I usually try and get all of my assignments in on time but in high school
we get a lot of practice questions and I always find myself saying "" I'll just do it at home,"" but
that never works out in my favor because I don't exactly have the will power to do so. So I end up
doing all the homework on the bus in the morning before it's due. Today's no different I got a Chem
assignment that due in a day or two, and me being me I procrastinated till the last minute and now
I'm about to do it on the bus, so I swear I don't procrastinate (sarcastic tone). I know this isn't
very related at all but yesterday I went out and bought a car and I probably was supposed to do a
bunch of research on what I sorta liked but I procrastinated and wound up only researching like an
hour before we left to go pick it up. It's nice but I should've done way more research. My main
question for you is do you feel down on yourself when you end up procrastinating when it leads to
sub par results? How does it affect you mentally/physically? Could we also move over to the ""finding
inspiration"" text in the next few conversations because I'm an artist and I'm kinda going through an
artist's block right now and I don't really know how to deal with it. Thank you for you time,
ChaseMentor 2021-12-12, 05:45: Hello chase, Really happy to know someone who can relate to me about
procristination! I do feel frustrated when that happens, because I have to face more pressure and
more hectic schedule in next few days. However, the worst is that I have kinda feeling of failure in
my heart. So I just want to tell you: don't feel that way cos everyone procristinates, but you will
be a winner if you try to conquer it. It's really amazing to know you are an artist! What kind of
field you are in? And what kind of artist's block you are going through? Just wanna learn some brief
background from you, and then we will start ""finding inspiration"" part! YimingMentor 2021-12-20,

Self Care! Please read the anchor text above, and mainly focus on the video A Self-Care Action Plan
from How to Adult and the article Mind Power: 10 Tips for Student Mental Health. Then tell me what
you have learnt and your relevant experiences about well being and self care in your school and
life. I will share my opinions after that .Mentee 2021-11-05, 15:35: Hey Yiming, First off I want to
say sorry for not resaponding sooner my week has kinda been filled with quizzes and tests, it put
the priority for CLC way low on my list and I have been majorly procrasting in school because of it.
my thoughts on the self and mental well being are... If you take care of yourself and do things that
make you happy, you will spread positivity and joy to others around you as well as yourself. If you
always focas on the negitives about yourself you can never see the light at the end of the tunnel so
to speak. If we take care of ourselves both mentally and phisically it will improve our mindsets
dramaticly. my main question/concern is about mental well being and how you juggle you self care
habits into your daily life at post secondary or way off into the future while completly stressed
about deadlines and due dates?Mentor 2021-11-06, 00:00: Hi chase, Happy weekend! Thank you for your
excellent sharing and you definitely ask a good question. As a graduate student, I am always haunted
by intensive coursework. For example, yesterday I finished a quiz, an assessment report and a group
assignment in one day. It is impossible not to feel stressful when you go through it. However, I
have some tips to light up my day. First, set up a schedule for your tasks. Plan when and how long
you will finish your work before due days. I know it is pretty common that you are unable to execute
it on time, but the plan can guide your task priority and time management. Next, treat your self
when you are stressed. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to grab a coffee, eat some snakes or take a
walk on UBC campus! These really make me feel better and escape from the stressful reality for a
while, and you will feel better to face them again. Third, communicate to whoever you want. I am
also prone to speak it out to my classmates, and we will complain about the situation and comfort
each other. Just remember you are not alone to feel stressful, and everyone is. Hope my thoughts
above are kind of helpful for your question, and I want to ask you a question: When you meet the
stress that cannot be ignored, do you prefer to take self-care, or find help from others, and why?
[Notice]: Your teacher emphasize that you are required to finish 4 modules before the end of January
2022. When we are working on each module, the first part is your reflections on the above anchor
text and your first question. Then we take turns to answer the question and ask another. When we
both have a good grasp of the topic and no more questions are needed, we will end the conversation
and move to the next. I know it is too long so that you might get bored, but thank you for your
reading! Have a nice weekend and good luck in your study! YimingMentee 2021-11-09, 13:30: Good
morning/afternoon Yimming hope that you had a relaxing weekend, I just want to comment on few things
that you said that I found very fascinating...I really loved how you talked about taking a break
from stressful activities by perhaps going for a walk or making a cup of coffee to take your mind
off the stressful things in life. I think one thing I'm most likely to input into my life is the
calendar to stop procrastinating because I suffer heavily from that. One question I have is about
how you can get into the habits of doing stressful or challenging tasks without it putting a major
toll on your personal well being and how can you implement those practices into a daily life.Mentor
2021-11-12, 03:58: Hello chase, Happy Friday, and have a nice weekend! About getting into good
habits to deal with stressful tasks, I might be not very good at it. I can relate to you, I am also
a sort of procrastinating person! The tips I gave you before, like taking a break or hanging out
with friends, they seem a little bit ""escaping"" ways, right? So I would say the most direct way for
the problem is to face it. For instance, before due days of my coursework, I would stop being lazy
and try to be focused on my work, because I know I won't be really relaxed until I finish it.
Focusing on what you are doing can make you calm down and efficient. You know, tasks won't be done
until you do them, so why not end them ASAP, and enjoy the sense of achievement? The question I want
to ask you is: are there any services about well-being you hope your school can provide?
YimingMentee 2021-11-12, 17:21: To Yiming in response to services at the school that are avalible
now there are only a few, such as the few counsellers that we have but, personally i dislike them
very much, and the indidgonous support worker who is a absolutly lovely person. i hope that they
eventually hire someone who is a actual good counseler/therapist to treat some kids who need a safe
spot to talk to someone freely aside from their parents who somtimes can't provide the support the
kids need. At the moment the counsellers are mainly just their to guide you into the future they
dont really give you the mental support that you need or desire. If possible could we move on to the
studdying portion of this program because im personally terrible at it and can never sit still for
long enough to actually make progress on the stuff that matters. Also whenever I try to take notes
it just looks like chicken scratch writing in the shapes of childrens drawings and it doesn't
exactly help when it comes to test time.",,"Mentor 2021-10-17, 23:09: Hello Chase, really nice to meet you! I am Yiming, your mentor at this

mentor for this year! I am 21 years old, turning 22 next month and I am currently completing my
Bachelors of Science in Nursing. I am excited to get to know you and hopefully provide you with some
good advice for what life is like after high school! I saw in your profile that you are possibly
interested in a career in Nursing, I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have about
what the process is like. Talk soon! KenadieMentor 2021-10-15, 13:11: Hi Sara, Just checking in
because I have not heard back from you yet. I hope all is well and that school isn't to crazy for
you! I look forward to chatting soon. Happy Friday! :) KenadieMentee 2021-10-15, 22:16: Hi! Sorry I
havent answered I have been pretty busy. I have a few questions for you haha.Mentor 2021-10-16,
14:06: No worries at all Sara, I can understand how busy school gets! I am more than happy to answer
all the questions you have!Mentee 2021-10-21, 13:23: Where did you go to school for nursing? And how
were your grades when you got in? I really want to get in to nursing, but im unsure if my grades are
good enough.Mentor 2021-10-21, 23:55: My grades were relatively good throughout high school. I
struggled with my grade 12 chemistry. I did do 2 years of college before applying to the nursing
program to upgrade some of my courses as well to finish some electives. The electives I did were
Psychology 101 and 102, Statistics, 2 english courses and ethics of nursing. Every university has
different grade requirements. Is there a patricuar university/college you were looking at? I could
help you find the requirements for admission.Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:22: I am looking at Selkirk
college or University of Alberta in Edmonton. Is there a way I could get into nursing without
retaking any high school classes? I average a 60-70 in most of my classes, but a lot of places
online say it's bestto ge great grades.Mentor 2021-10-25, 17:33: This is the grade requirements for
Selkirk College, English Studies 12 or equivalent (73%) Biology 12 (73%) Chemistry 11 (67%)
Foundations of Math 12 or Pre-Calculus 11(67%) This is the requirement for UofA in Edmonton, (it is
recommended to have average grades of 70%+ becasue it is a competitive program) One of the following
courses English Language Arts 30-1 One of the following subjects (click to see courses) Fine Arts
Humanities Languages other than English Physical Education Math/Sciences One of the following
courses Biology 30 One of the following courses Science 30 Chemistry 30 One of the following courses
Mathematics 30-1 Mathematics 31 Mathematics 30-2* Nursing is a very intensive and competitive
program, it can be quite intimidating beginning the nursing program right out of high school. While
it is not impossible to get accepted into the program with lower marks, you will have a much better
chance getting accepted if your grades are on the higher end.Mentor 2021-11-01, 13:55: Hi Sara, I
hope the information I was able to find was helpful, I am just checking in again because I have not
heard back from you in a week! I hope you had a good weekend!Mentor 2021-11-23, 11:21: Hi Sara, Just
wanting to check in with you again! It is almost time for Christmas break so I imagine school is

of my thoughts and examples... So, I put the questions that I asked in bold. I'm also wondering, is
it helpful for you if I add examples or personal experiences? Let me know if there's anything that I
can do to be more helpful for you! :) I noticed that you are wanting to go to culinary school and
obtain your red seal… I know that it’s ways away, but have you had the chance to peep around at some
of them? I find that the WorkBC resource was helpful with this! I typed in “chef” into the search
box and when I scrolled all the way down, I was able to click on “view program options” and found 12
schools that offer over 50 different programs across BC alone! Let me know if you happen to find any
programs that interest you! I did find that the stats that they gave on the main WorkBC page on
“chefs” a little general, since the profession of a chef is super broad, and they gave info that
doesn’t explain whether the stats applied to, say, a red seal chef, like you want to be! I know many
people that work as red seal chefs at ski lodges (like CMH) and the salaries that they post are
significantly higher than what the WorkBC page states, although it is only an average salary that
they post! Do you have any questions about the BC transfer guide resource? It might be hard to
understand if you’ve never used it before, but basically, every school that you’ll ever go to keeps
a copy of your transcript that tracks the courses you’ve taken, and the grades that you got, which
can be transferred to any school that you requests it. For example, once you start looking for
culinary programs to apply to, your high school transcript will be sent to that school with your
application (guidance counsellors at your high school typically help with this process). Another
example is that I went to Okanagan College for 2 years before going to TRU. So, when I applied to
TRU, I had to contact Okanagan College and ask them to send my transcript to TRU for my application.
Feel free to give me your thoughts and maybe browse through some of the reflection questions right

16:54: Hey no worries at all! From my understanding, its a pretty relaxed process where we basically
chit-chat about the conversations that you tracher assigned! So, we've chosen our first conversation
to complete: ""Post-secondary considerations"". I've unlocked this conversation for us on the big
circle on the top on the page (but let me know if you have trouble getting to it). Once you click on
that conversation, there will be information that pops up about it that we go through together. So,
for this conversation, it asks us to go through: Conversation: Post-Secondary Considerations Anchor
Text 1: Choosing a Program, Choosing a School (I just copy/pasted this info from the top of the
conversation) Once you read and go through all the websites and resources that the ""anchor text""
asks you to do, we basically chit-chat about what you've learned, and I ask you some questions about
your learning. I know this program is a tad confusing... So, please let me know if you have anymore
questions or concerns! :)))Mentee 2021-11-09, 16:54: so pretty much i just read it and we discuss
it? im so sorrry im jus really confusedMentor 2021-11-11, 17:13: Yeah that's pretty much it... Once
you're finished looking through the info in this topic, we chat about it a little bit, and then we
move on to the next. No need to be sorry! :)Mentee 2021-11-17, 15:18: i finsished reading it and im
choosing to go to either the okanagan collage in kelowna or selkirk in nelson for cooking!Mentor
2021-11-18, 18:20: Hey Faith, sounds awesome!! Can I ask what makes you interested in those schools
in particular? I'm also wondering what you think will be your favourite subject to study in a chef
program?! I guess it would be split between pastries, sauces, meats, vegtables and butchering,
specialties like those, hey? :)Mentor 2021-11-30, 13:33: Hi Faith, Just checking in this morning
since it's been a few weeks since we last chatted! Hope you're doing well! I just thought that I'd
get us ahead of the game and explain that once you feel ready and don't have anymore questions, we
can move on to the next set of ""conversation"" topics that you can choose. :) Take care!Mentee
2021-12-02, 13:29: sorry for such the late respost, i have had so much going on these past two
weeks! and im intrested in those schools because they have such good programs and not to far from

pastries!Mentor 2021-12-05, 20:48: No worries at all! I'm also currently scrambling to get some
final assignments in this weekend, and then heading to Valemount this week for some hiking and
possibly some ski touring... So, I bet you're just as busy! And sounds like super exciting stuff!
Well, unless you have anymore questions, I'll let you go ahead and pick the next topic for me to

sounds good and that all sounds like so much fun, valemount is sucha beautiful town! and i think the
next one to move on to should be paying for school as im starting the porcces of applying to schools

we'll continue to the next page by clicking ""working through this program"" and watch the video to
gain an understading of how the program works. Have you had the chance to watch the video yet? Once
we complete that it looks like we can start unlocking conversation that interest you. It seems to me

1047547559,1047541083,10/8/2021 16:50,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-16, 18:24: Hey Evan! Welcome to our second conversation: Paying for school. After
completing the reading and viewing the sites from Anchor Text 1: Budgeting and Managing Money, what
are some questions that came up for you? Paying for school is definitely something that I did not
think too much about when I was in high school, but as I got older, it really opened my eyes to the
true value of education and the importance of education.Mentor 2021-11-22, 14:15: Just replying to
your message here! I worked part-time throughout my undergraduate degree, but I definitely put more
time and energy into my schoolwork - my job came second. I guess you could say that I worked part
time moreso for work experience rather than making money. That said, I think it is super important
to learn how to budget and save whatever money you make while going to school. I think that
budgeting is something that should be emphasized more, because life just gets more expensive once
you graduate! Haha. I found that one thing that I spent a lot of money on, unnecessarily, was going
out to buy food. As much as you can, try to bring food from home. You'll save SO much money that
way! I think I was suprised by how quickly costs could add up as a student - supplies (including
technology), textbooks, transportation, tuition, accomodation (if you live away from home) can be
costly for sure. Let me know if you have any questions about anything here :-) If you don't have
any, we can move on to discuss Anchor Text 2: Student Loans, Scholarships, Grants, Bursaries and
Awards.Mentor 2021-12-07, 01:32: Hi Evan - just checking in :-) Were you able to see my previous
message? I know part of the message was in our other thread!Mentee 2021-12-10, 13:17: Hey, sorry I
haven't messaged you in a while. I've been trying to figure out how to see these new messages. But I
got it now! I will most likely be living with my mom still, and not on residence. Some things I'm
curious about would be what were things that you knew you would have to pay for but didn't expect to
be as expensive as it was? Also, what were some foods that you ate a lot that were affordable but
still relatively healthy? I know a lot of college students rely on things like ramen or kraft
dinner, but I want to try to eat a somewhat healthy diet while not spending too much.Mentor
2021-12-10, 14:39: Hi Evan, no worries! It's great to hear back from you - I hope you've been doing
well :-) Staying at home will definitely help save tons of money! While a part of me wishes I got to
experience the dorm experience, I am forever grateful that I was able to stay with my parents
throughout university. I think I was most surprised about the costs of textbooks. I had heard people
complain about them, but I didn't think it'd be that expensive. However, new textbooks definitely
cost a lot. I tried to buy second-hand or find free versions of textbooks online. By the end of your
degree (or whatever program you complete), you could save thousands of dollars by buying second-hand
or finding free versions. Ramen definitely is a cheap and easy meal! I found that wraps and
sandwiches were super easy to make for quite a low cost - same thing with salads. Regardless of what
you end up making at home, most of the time, it will save you tons of money. I definitely spent way
too much money on Tim Horton's..... :-) Let me know if you have any questions come up from Anchor
Text 2: Student Loans, Scholarships, Grants, Bursaries and Awards!Mentee 2021-12-17, 12:11: The
decision to live on residence or at home has been a big dilemma for me. I am in the same boat as you
if wanting to get the experience of living in a dorm, but I also acknowledge that it will make the
bill much higher. I will most likely live at home to save money, but maybe live on residence if I
decide to go past college. Something I've seen online and will most likely invest more time in are
websites where people who are out of college sell their books for an affordable price. I will most
likely follow the path of making sandwiches and wraps and things like that. I think you're
definitely right that those things will make a noticeable difference.Mentor 2021-12-17, 17:28:
That's great, Evan. Sounds like you put a lot of thought into it! Also, my mistake, but you will
need to choose two more topics to discuss. We have already completed Well-being and self care, and
(now), we've finished Paying for school. Please let me know which of the following you'd like to do.
Please choose two: Studying Entering the job market Career considerations Post secondary
considerations I'll unlock the conversations you pick!Mentor 2022-01-05, 12:45: Hey Evan, I hope you
had a great break! I understand that your teacher has made eMentoring optional for the rest of the
semester - I imagine that there's lots to catch up on after haing some time off. That said, do let
me know if you'd like to continue talking. I'm here for you if you'd like! Since the program is no
longer required, we are free to work on any Conversation you like or discuss any topic that you
think would be helpful.Mentee 2022-01-10, 12:10: I definitely do have a lot to catch up on haha. I'd
just like to say thank you so much for the insight and advice regarding post-secondary, and what to
expect from it. Still being in high school it can be difficult to visualize what my life might look
like in a few years so this has been a helpful resource.Mentor 2022-01-10, 13:12: I hope the
workload isn't too heavy! It was great getting to know you throughout the last couple of months -
I'm glad to have helped. All the best to you :-)",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-07, 19:07: Hey Evan, great choice for your first conversation! Self care was
definitely something that I struggled with when I first started university - I found it tough to eat
healthy food and get enough sleep each night. As I progressed throughout my studies, it became clear
to me that I needed to take good care of myself so that I could do my best at school. Is there
anyone in your life that models good self care? Who is it and what do you think you could learn from
them to incorporate into your own self care routine?Mentee 2021-11-10, 15:27: I would say that the
people I look up to for self-care would be my teachers, and also my mom. I am trying to improve my
methods of winding down at the end of the day. It is frustratingly easy to turn to unhealthy coping
mechanisms, such as food, or hours of internet. Some things I could do would be playing music more,
going for walks or bike rides, as it is much healthier and more rewarding.Mentor 2021-11-12, 13:24:
I'm glad to hear that you have people in your life that you can look up to for self-care. What are
some things that you notice that your teachers and mom do to care for thsemelves? I agree - it is
definitely easy to turn to food or our computers/phones to wind down. I like how you're self-aware
that there are other activities that you could do instead that would help you feel better!Mentee
2021-11-16, 17:08: Most things I see my mom do would be going for walks, reading novels, kayaking,
and going for drives. Most of the things I see teachers doing are more about work efficiency. Things
like marking when not doing anything else, getting work done after school is let out so they don't
need to stay up late to complete it. The points of work efficiency to prevent sleep loss and
adapting to better coping mechanisms is something that I am working on. When I take better care of
my mind and body, I can work longer and better during the day.Mentor 2021-11-16, 18:17: I like your
point about work efficiency! Checking things off one's to-do list during down time can really help
make time for self-care. Just yesterday, I decided to go back to a morning fitness routine and I
already feel so much more energized throughout the day - it's awesome that you're aware that taking
care of yourself can help energize you throughout the day :-) Just a head's up, I've unlocked our
next conversation: Paying for school. I'll chat with you there!Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:33: Thanks for
the help with that topic! Paying for school is definitely something I think about a lot. I would
ask, would I need to work a part-time job or two to stay financially stable? What is some general
advice that would be good to remember when it comes to finances? What were some things that you
didn't expect when it comes to paying for things in university?Mentee 2021-12-10, 13:08: Hey, I'm
just trying to figure out how to see the new messages? I saw a notification in my email that there
are new messages from you but I can't seem to figure out how to see them. The message chat seems to
be stuck in the well-being and self-care chat.",,"Mentor 2021-10-11, 17:53: Hey Evan! I'm Kimberly and I'll be your mentor for the next few months.

criminology. What about you - what are some things that you're interested in (school-related or
not)? Outside of school, I love going for hikes with my dog! Feel free to share anything you'd like
me to know about you. Also, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask - I'll do my best to
answer them.Mentee 2021-10-14, 13:45: Hey Kimberly! Thank you for reaching out, I apologize for
taking some time to respond, I've had a lot on my plate recently. I am currently in Grade 12, and I
have Chemistry, Anatomy and Physiology, Psychology, and Career Life Connections. Next semester, I
will be taking English, Philosophy, Statistics, and Food Studies. I chose these courses because I
think that they will be good for preparing me for post-secondary. In terms of career choices, I know
that I want to work in mental health. I am considering Counselling, Therapy, and Nursing. I enjoy
helping and working with people so I think that I would get a lot of fulfillment from any of these.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and hanging out with friends. I am curious to
know about your experience so far! What have been the most difficult things to overcome? what was
something did you not expect? How do you balance your studies and your time with friends? How much
time do you spend studying on average? What are some things that I should be aware of that might
make me struggle? Thank you for the help! :)Mentor 2021-10-17, 16:59: Hi Evan, no worries at all :-)
Sounds like you have a busy final year of high school ahead. It's great that you already know that
you want to work in the field of mental health! I think the most difficult thing when I transitioned
from high school to post-secondary was definitely getting used to the workload and being a proactive
student. In high school, teachers definitely try their best to help you succeed and help you along
the way; in post-secondary, I find that you have to look out for yourself if you need some extra
support. When I was taking a full courseload (so, 4 courses), I say that I spent about 20 to 25
hours a week doing coursework. To balance studying with hanging out with friends and hobbies, I
tried to make sure that I had a routine so that I would have time set aside for fun things :-)
Before we move on to ""Working Through this Program"", please have a look at the options under ""Choose
two of the following"" under the instructions and share!Mentee 2021-10-20, 15:47: Some things I'd be
interested in learning more about would be post-secondary would be self-care, and paying for school.
Like would I need to be working a job or two during school to get by financially? What are some
things that I would need to be ready for in terms of studying and how it could possibly affect my
sleep schedule and overall health? What are some aspects of self-care that many new
college/university students frequently end up falling behind on?Mentor 2021-10-22, 15:18: Hey Evan,

a good one to start with.Mentor 2021-11-07, 19:05: Hey Evan, no worries at all - thanks for getting

work with you. I'm a student in Soil Science at UBC and I work as a consultant in mine reclamation
(fixing the forests after mining finishes). I also love to play hockey. I used to play defense when
I played competitively but now in men's league I just play wherever, depending who shows up. What
position do you play? And, most importantly, I really hope you're not a Flames fan lol. So you're
interested in getting into electrical trades - that's awesome! I have friends who work in trades
(HVAC, plumbing) but none who are electricians. They always used to make fun of me because they were
done school and working and making money while I still had years of school left. I totally get that
you are interested in engineering but have doubts about doing the school for it. When I started
university I was in an engineering program and I left it after the first year because the course
load was so brutal. Trades are a great way to go, you can make a good living and even be your own
boss! Anyway, I'm here to help you out and answer any questions, you can write any time. I see we're
supposed to share some images or music. This picture is of a whitebark pine and I'm sharing it

can grow in. They get blasted by winter and lose their branches but they keep going. So they
symbolize strength and even though they're kind of ugly, they're also beautiful. And for music, I
listen to a lot of different things. It was hard to find something safe for school - I don't want to
get us in trouble lol. When I'm studying and working I listen to a lot of electronic music because
if I listen to music with words I get distracted. Here's a song from one of my favourite producers
in Vancouver, something light and easy and not going to distract me. Link That's a lot of words for
now. Looking forward to hearing back from you. TrevorMentee 2021-10-26, 12:10: Hii sorry I haven’t

Trenton, No problem. Your teacher let us know that you guys are super busy and were slow in getting
started. Good for you for taking Physics 12 even though it's not an easy class. Hopefully you have a
good teacher who helps you get through it and learn a few things along the way. There's at least
some stuff in there on electricity and magnetism, or at least there was when I took it in 2001!
Yes... I am old, lol. I guess next up is for you to go through to the Conversation Choices part and
pick the ones your teacher has decided for you. Just send me a message in there to let me know which
one you want to do first and we'll get this thing started!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mentor for this school year. A bit about myself, I graduated from UBC with a degree in Kinesiology
in Biochemistry and am working as a physician’s assistant right now during my gap year (gotta make
that money). What about you? What are your interests or goals right now? Is there anything you wanna
ask me right off the bat? Can’t wait to hear from you!Mentee 2021-10-29, 13:11: Hi Joanna! It's nice
to meet you as well. Sorry this has taken a while, I am currently super busy with school. A bit
about myself is that I am super into sports/working out and I am also super into the literary
arts/arts in general! My goals right now are working towards getting all A's in my classes,
finishing applying for scholarships and finding what program suits me best and can support me in the
future! Off the bat, I am interested in learning about the application process to university, how
long it takes, how to complete your personal profile efficiently and also a bit more about
scholarships if possible! I would also like to know how the university schedule works compared to
highschool and how you found your program to be in terms of studying/homework, as it might be
somthing I am interested in! Another side goal I have is to make it on a volleyball team or practice
somewhere as it is something I really want to persue but, I am quite late in joining the sport!
Thank you and I can't wait to hear back from you!Mentor 2021-10-30, 19:11: Hey Shanez, thank you so
much for reaching out. You don't ever have to apologize for replying late, high school and your life
should always come first! You sound like a top tier student - let's talk about university and what
your goals are looking like. To get a better idea, are there specific programs or schools you're
looking to attend? Will you be staying in BC or applying out of the province? Once I get a better
idea, I'll send you a picture of my schedule! I did the Kinesiology program at UBC on a scholarship
because I played a lot of sports in high school and was very interested in the human body. Let me
know and let's get you ready for university!Mentee 2021-11-09, 13:26: Hi Joanna, for university I am
leaning towards either business or the arts such as film and creative writing or both because I
would enjoy leanring about the financial aspect of the film industry while combining my passion. I
am unsure of a double major currently and/or if I should choose a major and minor. I have researched
some institutions and so far UBC, SFU and BCIT are my top choices. I am also thinking of starting in
the winter time instead of the fall because, I think it might give me some time to prepare myself
for courses and if needed I could work a bit before starting my semester. If I do take a break as
well, it would give me time to apply but I would like to know if it's still possible to apply for
scholarships then or if I can only apply during early/normal registration. I would also like to know
what direction we should be heading in while writing our personal profile for applications? Should
we focus within, or talk about outside experiences such as sports, work, hobbies etc. How was the
transition between grade 12 and university? Was it a big change? Did you go straight into a full
course load or did you start off slow? I am also curious about when you actually pick your major, I
heard that it is either in your 3rd or 4th year usually, but how do we apply if (say) we are unsure.
I am thinking of staying in BC but in the future I am interested in traveling out of the country to
experience different cultures and learning more about the world in general. Thanks Joanna, can't
wait to hear back from you!!Mentee 2021-11-22, 17:39: Hey Joanna, this weekend I was on a call with
a few Mentors from UBC! It was called the Convergence Mentorship Meeting and it was pretty
interesting. There a person in the Medical field, a realtor, a writer and theater major and someone
in the food comerce industy. It was cool to see the diversity in majors and work! I am doing a
capstone project this year and I need a mentor for it and since I am writing a book, I was thinking
of getting a writing mentor or English major who could help me with my book and the whole process.
Also, I have officially applied to SFU which is exciting! My frist choice was Business and the
second was World Hisotry and Litterature. I hope you are doing well and I hope you can get back to
me soon!! Thank you :)Mentor 2021-11-23, 11:49: Hi Shanez, it is so exciting to see you plan for
your future, Congratulations on your application to SFU!! One of my best friends actually did the
Beaty business program and she loved it! She was considering between UBC and SFU as well. She is now
working for a major financing company in Calagary and I think she plans on moving to Ontario soon.
Please let me know if you have any questions for her and I can forward them to her and I'll get back
to you :) I would LOVE to talk about transition to University! I really wish I had someone to help
me during my transition because I totally underestimated how tough it would be. I fully support the
idea of you starting in the winter, I actually wish I had taken a gap year, to do all the things
that you mentioned such as travelling and preparing for a higher education. I did go in with a full
course load with the mentality that I could handle it. I wouldn't say it was hard but mixed with
being in a new environment, joining new clubs, and meeting new people, it was definitely super
chaotic. As for choosing a major, that usually happens either at the end of first year or second
year so that you can spend third and fourth year completing the required courses for your major. I
honestly wouldn't worry too much about that right now because there are so many things to explore in
university that you never would have thought of. For your other applications, I would take some time
to think about what makes you an optimal candidate for university. What experiences have made you
more mature? What motivations and goals do you have? Also, have you thought about applying outside
of BC? Many of my friends went to Alberta, Ontario, Saskatechewan, and even the East Coast
(Dalhousie!)Mentee 2021-11-23, 18:49: Hi Joanna, I am not sure if you know this but I just have a
super quick question: If we apply in the winter term are scholarships still available? Because I
know UBC has an early entrance scholarship and the deadline is December 1st. Is this only for the
fall term or is it a scholarship you can get at each application period? I was also wondering about
say, I win a scholarship now, do they have deadlines or can I have access to them even if I am
starting in the winter term? I know some have specific requirments but what about the ones that
don't? I know I have a lot of questions, but some deadlines for scholarships are coming up so I want
to make sure that I could still get scholarships during winter term, while applying later.
Thanks!Mentor 2021-11-29, 19:47: Hey Shanez, these are really great questions! I asked my friend who
is involved with UBC Admissions and he says that as long as you apply by the December 1st deadline,
you are able to use those funds in the winter term. You will have to apply for entry for September
2022 to be eligible for this scholarship. After you are accepted, you will have to fill out a
""deferring your admission"" form to start in January! Long story short, if you win the scholarship,
it doesn't matter when you start as long as you meet their basic criteria, I've included their link;
https://you.ubc.ca/financial-planning/scholarships-awards-canadian-students/entrance-award/ You can
also call them to make sure you have all of your questions met! Good luck :))) Let me know how it
goes!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047542659,1047541034,10/1/2021 17:50,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-19, 16:24: Okay onto Rural to Urban! You can kick this one off by telling me about
Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why you like it. Two things
you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. One question you have about living or
moving to the city :)Mentee 2021-11-22, 13:30: I like living in a rural area because it's not as
overwhelming as the city. I feel like I would get lost in the city and not know where I'm going when
I first move there. I also like that there are not as many people in areas that I enjoy being at. If
I were to go to the ski hill where I live there would be way fewer people than at a ski hill near an
urban area. I like that I know most people in my community and have friends because I feel it would
be harder to make friends in a big city. I don't really like that I have to drive most places
because everything is so spread out. I also don't like that I don't have an option in places I do
stuff. There's only one gym in my town and it's not very good so I either have to work out at the
bad gym or drive 20 minutes to a different gym in a different town. My question is was it
overwhelming moving to an urban area and how long did it take to meet new people and get comfortable
living there?Mentor 2021-12-02, 18:35: Hey!!! Idk how I missed your message sorr While I didn't grow
up in a rural area necessarily, I did grow up in a small town so I totally understand where you're
coming from! Moving to a city was an adjustment for sure, but the cool thing is you learn a lot
(like using to learn how to take public transportation/navigate city bus routes.... virtually
unheard of in my town hahah). And I found it increased my independence exponentially. Suddenly, I
could walk everywhere and go where I wanted when I wanted because it was all so accessible. As for
meeting people, don't be afraid to introduce yourself to literallyyyyy everyone you meet. Just a
simple hello :) I will be completely transparent with you and say sometimes I found it harder to
make friends in larger settings, and to that I would tell you to simply get specific with what you
like to do and you will narrow down your group of people. For example, I love sports and my
university had a group that was going to represent our school at the ""Kin Games"" which connected me
with so many people that also love to play sports. Intramurals are great too! When you choose a
university, look for a Facebook group of incoming students. For example, say you'd start at UBC in
September 2022, search Facebook for ""UBC class of 2026"" the summer prior. Living on residence is
also really great for meeting people and 1000% why I think go the traditional dorm-style route first
year!!!!! It's so tempting to want to go straight to an apartment but I really thing the dorm
experience is such a foundational aspect of creating relationships with people throughout your time
at university. It's not always ideal sharing a room, or bathroom, or living spaces, but it's just so
worth it in the end. You'll see that you create a different kind of connection with these people (:
Anything else you're not feeling 100% about??Mentee 2021-12-07, 12:32: Thanks for all those tips! I
defiently want to go the dorm lifestyle for my first year even though I would probably get sick of
my roomate super quick. Making new friends is defiently something I'm nervous about. All my friends
now I've known for a long time so I haven't really had to make new friends in a while. Also I will
defiently try to meet people through sports because that's how I have made friends that arent from
my town through tournaments and such.Mentor 2021-12-07, 14:41: Ya I totally get that!! I grew up
with the same 80 people from junior kindergarten until we graduated in grade 12 and so I'll really
just stress to you to ""get involved."" I hate saying that because you hear it so many times and
you'll hear it many more hahah but I've learned there's definitely a reason for it. It's hard to
make friends in a classroom when everyone's rushing to get to class and then rushing to leave class
after... doesn't exactly leave a whole lotta room for getting to know people unless they're small
class sizes. So if there's anything at all you like doing or are interested in trying, go for it.
Worst case scenario it's not something you like and you try something else. The biggest thing is
just keep trying and you'll find your people (: What conversation topic do you want to move onto
next?Mentor 2022-01-07, 14:29: Hey Will! Hope you had a good christmas and new year:) I'm sure you
know now that your teacher has no longer made mentoring mandatory so it's totally up to you if you
want to continue or not! If you do, feel free to shoot me a message whenever for whatever:) I know
how school gets though so no worries if it's a lot right now! It was great meeting you, wishing you
a happy new year. Good luck in whatever you decide to do going forward. Make sure it's true to you
and you will find a way to succeed no matter what it is :)","Mentor 2021-10-28, 23:49: Alright studying it is!! Do you have any study methods you currently use?
One thing the first video mentioned and something I've learned throughout university is that
studying is more of a marathon than a sprint. So rather than cram studying the night before, it's a
lot more effective to study in scheduled time slots days in advance. I know from experience it's
definitely harder to focus on studying material while you're also trying to ignore the stress of the
test being the next morning. We're all still guilty of it but starting somewhere is good to build
habits! What study techniques from either of the videos are you going to try?Mentee 2021-11-03,
17:03: The study methods I use are dependant on the type of class I'm in. Memorizing stuff is not
something I'm very good at, so I like people to quiz me and talk to me about it because it helps me
remember it better. When I study for math or science and there are questions to do I just do the
questions until they make sense to me. I am very guilty of cramming all of my studying into the
night before the test and it often really stresses me out. I am definitely going to try to study
more spaced out so I am less stressed and have more time to study if I need it. I'm also going to
try the retrieval practice so I know what information I have retained and the information I need to
relearn.Mentor 2021-11-08, 19:04: Nice! Want to work on the extension activity or have you had the
chance to do so already? What do you think about the Pomodoro technique? I've really struggled with
procrastinating which can obviously eat away at time to study and that is one thing I've found that
actually helps!! Everyone's different but you should give it a shot (: The key is to do
everyyyything it says (which is only like three things lol) even though it may seem small and
irrelevant... So for example, one of the tasks is to set a timer. So, set a timer instead of looking
at a clock and saying 'okay I'll stop at 1:00 (in 20 minutes).' I think why it works is because it
eliminates everything else your brain has to keep in mind outside of what you're working on which
allows you to completely focus on whatever the task is. Same thing with writing down any thoughts
that come up, write them down and let it go for the remainder of the time on the timer then you can
switch your focus !Mentee 2021-11-09, 12:16: I actually use the Pomodoro technique a lot! I find it
helps a lot. However some of the time I get carried away with my breaks and take like 10 minutes
instead of 5-minute breaks. Sometimes this totally throws me off because it's hard to get back into
the groove of studying after being on my phone for that long. I usually just set a timer for 45
minutes instead of 25 minutes and then I take a 15-minute long break. I find this works better for
me because I can concentrate and get more work done. I am definitely going to try writing down
anything that comes into my mind because I find my brain wanders a lot.Mentor 2021-11-11, 10:14:
Exactly!! Do what you find works best for you because you're the person that has to write the test,
and it doesn't benefit you to incorporate a study method that (for example) relies on memorizing if
it's not something you think you're good at. I think you've basically answered the questions in the
last extension activity! You seem pretty aware of what works and what doesn't, which is good!! I
think try incorporating the 'write it down' part of the pomodoro technique and see what difference
that makes for you in trying to stay focused. I've also started turning my phone off completely when
I study and I found a ""do not disturb"" function on my laptop, which also help! It definitely made me
notice how many times I mindlessly picked up my phone which was embarassingly a lot lolll Which
""Conversation Choice"" do you want to move onto next? :)Mentee 2021-11-18, 15:39: Awesome! Can we do
from Rural to Urban next?",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-04, 12:12: Hey Will (: I'm Shelby, a kinesiology student at Vancouver Island
University and I’ll be your mentor on here! I grew up playing soccer and one thing someone told me
that I still kinda carry with me today is ""just aim to be 1% better than the athlete you woke up
today."" I think it applies to a lot of things (like being a student... it makes you think how you
can constantly be better). Change doesn't always have to be 0 to 100 and I don't think it should
either ! Lmk if you have a quote you kinda ""live by"" too! Until then I'll probably be listening to
A-O-K by Tai Verdes on repeat until I'm tired of it lol, it's just a good vibe. Who/what music do
you listen to? So many questions lol so I'll leave it at that! shoot me a message when you're around
(:Mentee 2021-10-21, 15:54: Hey Shelby, one of my favourite quotes is ""If you don't like the road
you're walking, start paving another one"". I live by this quote because if you don't like what
you're doing you can always change it, and you shouldn't be stuck doing something you don't enjoy. I
really enjoy listening to rap music as most teenage boys do, but I also like listening to EDM as
well because I like to work out and it hypes me up in the gym. You said you play soccer what
position do you play? I play striker and right-winger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

psychology is great! It is a really fun program, I have taken a couple of psychology courses before.
Have you looked into financial aid? Getting a student loan and scholarships will help a lot with the
school fees. Have you also looked into colleges as your second option? It helps a lot with the fees,
as well as starting in small classes transitioning into a larger class. I felt that I personally got
a lot of support going to my current college Langara. I felt more prepared for UBC now. Another pro
of going to college is that you can transfer the credits. So basically you go to college for the
first two years and transfer for 3rd year with a reset on your GPA. There are a lot of options out

replying earlier, I got busy with my school work. Let's work through this conversation wheel
together :) Disinformation and Misinformation happen all the time, people who advertise their
products, exaggerate the benefits of the product without telling consumers the risks to their
products. This is known as disinformation. Learning new things on the internet can be a great tool
to increase our knowledge and improve our skills. Sometimes this can backfire on us, we take
information from people that do not have credentials or commonly disguise themselves on social
media. For example, the fitness influencers with excellent figures are either photoshopped or put in
props on their bodies such as paddings. How do you know what is the truth and what is false? We ask
ourselves questions, 1) Who is giving this information? Are they professionals in this area? 2) What
is the purpose of spreading this information? Are they trying to sell you something? 3) Why are they
sharing this information? How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on
and share on social media? I believe that it plays a big role in what I choose to click on and share
on social media, depending on how I feel I might share some inspiring quotes. On some days, when I
feel down, I share pictures of myself trying to get likes/attention from my followers. I am guilty
of scrolling on Instagram for a long time, checking the likes of my posts and how many people as
well as who is viewing my stories. This is all normal, but when we spent too much time caring about
how people view us it becomes negative energy that we direct into us. Looking forward to know your
thoughts on this! :)Mentee 2021-11-22, 13:31: Hello Linda:) it is nice to hear from you! we all get
busy with school work from time to time, no worries!! I believe that everyone gets caught up in
social media, checking likes, followers and things like that and it can be very addicting at times.
Social media for sure plays a role in my emotions I know for me at least I will go on and compare my
life to other peoples lives and look at all the things they have that I dont and that can be pretty
damaging to someones self image. I am starting to learn though that people only post the good things
in their lives and no one talks about the bad, so why compare when I cant even see the full picture?
Finding the truth on social media is very hard sometimes impossible depending on what you are trying
to find, there is photoshop and exaggeration all thoughout social media so it very difficult to try
and find the real picture. Looking forward to hearing back Sadie!!Mentor 2021-11-29, 18:51: Mentor

""Finding Inspiration"" conversation for us. This Conversation explores inspiration, and how we might
find, think, and feel about creativity. Though it's always important to address the anchor text, I
would also love to hear about your own experiences with art - Perhaps some passion projects, your
own hobbies, and more? For myself, after watching the video a couple of times, what initially and
especially stuck out to me were the differences in Mina Shum's and Roch Carrier's ideas on creation.
Shum believes that art begins with intention - Why do we find ourselves creating? Whether we think
about it hard or without much thought, we all start with the intention to do. What I got from
Carrier's idea of creation is more so like that ""A-ha!"" moment or an epiphany. We find ourselves
hard at work until we stumble upon the ""essence of creation"". Personally, I relate to Shum's concept
of creativity more, as I don't often find myself with these artistic breakthroughs . I place my
pencil on paper and art (or at least an attempt at art LOL) happens... But it all began because I
thought to put my pencil on that piece of paper. What are your thoughts on the film? Did any of the
quotes from the artists especially stand out to you? Have a great rest of your week! Your mentor,
MaryMentee 2021-10-28, 17:29: Hi Mary, After watching the video what stood out to me the most was
the concepts that Léa Pool and Zacharias Kunuk had. Pool’s statement about how not knowing sometimes
brings the biggest and most important changes in your life really resonates with me because I feel
like you have to go through most of life blindly. I think Kunuk’s statement resonated with me
strongly because it touched allot on the complexity of things and the complications that went into
making them and I that’s something that I wonder about myself. Personally I don’t normally do
conventional art I’m more interested in sewing woodworking and things like that. Have great day!
MargaretMentor 2021-10-31, 19:17: Hi Margaret, Awesome connections that you pulled from Léa Pool's
and Zacharias Kunuk's quotes! I'd have to agree with you in that you can plan for everything like
school, volunteering, vacations, etc., but we won't be prepared for everything. Going into things
uncertain brings out something in all of us though! I believe we've tackled what we needed to tackle
for this Conversation. If you were comfortable and ready to move onto the next, I'd be happy to
complete it! Just let me know. Your mentor, Mary Ps. Happy Halloween!!! I've been marathoning scary
movies all weekend, and I hope your weekend is super fun too!!Mentor 2021-11-08, 03:48: Hi Margaret,
I hope you had an awesome weekend! I know your class has been trying its best with keeping up with
e-mentoring, and I just wanted to shoot you a message to thank you for trying your best too. When
you get the chance to think about it, let me know what Conversation you'd like me to open next, and
I'll get that started for us. Cheers and happy Monday! Your mentor, MaryMentee 2021-11-08, 13:22: Hi
Mary I love to start the from rural to urban conversation with you. Thanks for being patient with
me, Margaret",,,"Mentor 2021-12-17, 02:46: Hi Margaret, Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions in the
last conversation (Dis- &amp; Mis information)! As you'll be researching a lot for papers and
assignments in the future, it's better to have that sense of awareness as a foundation before going
down the rabbit hole of database searches. As requested, I've opened up the Post-Secondary
Considerations conversation - Great choice! I really like the flow of the first section of this
convo, as it breaks it down between: ""What am I looking to get out of school?"" (Certificate,
Diploma, Degree) ""How do I get from one school to another?"" (Transferring schools, programs,
credits) ""How will school get me to where I want to be?"" (Career Compass) Was there any section or
link that you wanted to discuss first? Did you have any questions regarding post-secondary that you
wanted to start with? I'm all ears! Well... Eyes. LOL. (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ Your mentor, MaryMentee 2021-12-26,
22:30: Hi Mary, I have actually have already been accepted to both U of A and Dalhousie and I am
waiting on a response from McGill. I plan on taking applied animal science at university as my
undergraduate degree. I did originally use their recommended websites when looking at schools though
and they helped me to get a good understanding of what my options are. I chose to apply to these
schools because their courses are more hands-on than some of the other options that I looked at.
Also, I have family in both Edmonton and Montreal so that was a benefit I considered while applying.
after I finish my undergraduate degree I plan on applying for veterinary school. Sorry for the odd
response I am starting to think that this may not have been the best conversation topic for me to
pick. Please tell me if there is anything you would like me to elaborate on. Happy Holidays
MargaretMentor 2021-12-31, 01:17: Hi Margaret, First off - Check out all those acceptances!
Congratulations! Applying to university can be such a hectic time with all the deadlines,
requirements, and balancing it all with school. But you got it done, you did it well, and I'm really
proud of you for pursuing your dreams of becoming a veterinarian. You can do it! I guess
Post-Secondary Considerations would've came in handy before you applied, but we can still work with
it! For example, I was looking into the Dalhousie Animal Science Fact Sheet and noticed they
mentioned students could begin applying to veterinary college after their second year. I think
that's something you could consider if you were interested in entering vet school sooner, or using
each application cycle to build a more competitive portfolio, kinda like med school. But of course,
completing your bachelors degree is always a great safety net to have. :) And while I was
researching the DVM programs we had in Canada, I didn't realize some of their requirements were like
the U of C needing an MCAT score?! I didn't give it that much thought, but that makes sense. What
other careers were your considering prior to settling on veterinary medicine? Have you also
considered some potential focuses/specializations you'd be interested in incorporating into your
degree? Since you've already got a plan, we can just have an open topic on post-secondary plans if
you like! I'd also be more than happy to move onto Post-Secondary Considerations part 2, if you were
curious to see what that page is about too. As always, please only answer to what you're comfortable
with sharing. I just haven't looked this deeply into veterinary medicine, so I got really curious
and excited! Lol! Hope the snow isn't too bad over on your side of BC! Your mentor, MaryMentor
2022-01-05, 00:07: Hi Margaret, Us mentors got word that e-mentoring may be optional for the rest of
the semester for our mentees, depending on their school. While that's probably a relief and
something off your plate during these crazy times, I did want to come on here to say that if you
were still interested in mentorship, I'd be more than happy to continue doing so! \(^ヮ^)/ If that
were the case, please let me know what Conversations you'd like to unlock, or even topics about
post-secondary you'd like to discuss deeper. In any case, thank you so much for being my mentee and
actively participating in the ReMBC program. I hope you were able to take away some things to use in
your future and I sincerely wish you all the best in your post-secondary journey! Best of luck in
vet school! (=^･ｪ･^=) Happy Winter break! Your mentor, Mary",,"Mentor 2021-11-11, 16:23: Hi Margaret, I think you also got that short, confidential survey? ReMBC
sends both mentors and mentees to complete them after every finished Conversation for program
improvement purposes - Just as a head's up for this new one we're about to start! So... From Rural
to Urban! From reading the anchor text, it looks like you'll be starting this one off, so I'm all
ears (I guess eyes? LOL). Here are the questions from the text so you don't gotta keep scrolling up
: What are three things you like about living in a rural area? For each, explain why you like it.
What are two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. What is one question
you have about living or moving to the city? Looking forward to reading your answers! Your mentor,
MaryMentee 2021-11-15, 14:14: Hi, here are my answers What are three things you like about living in
a rural area? For each, explain why you like it. One thing I like about living in a rural area is
that you are not surrounded by light and noise constantly like you are, when in a big city because
it helps me to feel calm and uncrowded when falling asleep. Another thing I like is how you can walk
anywhere you want and still feel safe because I feel like I have to be constantly on guard to stay
safe in a bigger city. The final thing I like is how you can always escape into the wilderness
because I enjoy being out in nature. What are two things you don’t like and, again, explain your
reasons for each. The first thing I dislike is how everybody knows everyone and how you have zero
anonymity, making you feel like you have to be on your best behaviour at all times. The other thing
that I dislike is how you can't always access products that you want due to the limited selection of
local stores because this can often limit me in what I can do in some areas of my life. What is one
question you have about living or moving to the city? One question that I have about living in the
city is what is your preferred method of transportation and do you find city lights and noise to be
a problem at night?Mentor 2021-11-18, 01:10: Hi Margaret, I found your answers really fascinating,
so thank you for your honesty! I think it'd be fun to visit a rural town and maybe even experience
living in one one day. :) To answer your questions: Q: What is your preferred method of
transportation? For the post-secondary schools I attended in my city, bus passes were included in
our tuition costs. It wasn't something I could opt-out of, so to make the most out of it, I found
myself busing to and from campus frequently. I find busing is a more tuition-friendly option
compared to driving (as it's included in our tuition), as driving involves the additional costs of
parking by the hour/day and stressors of having to find a spot. You may also notice that many
students bike around campus as well - You'll see students just cycle from building to building,
wherever their class is next! However, if we were talking outside of school, I mainly drive from
place to place, as our landmarks are quite far from each other (for example, I don't think walking
from one mall to the other is a friendly distance!). Q: Do you find city lights and noise to be a
problem at night? I think it really depends on what part of town you live in, as well as your
neighbourhood. For myself, I live in quite a quiet neighbourhood, so I seldom have problems with
noise or lights. But when it comes to things like city lights, noises, and safety, I believe they'd
be more of a concern around more condensed, metropolitan areas like downtown. Just like with every
town, there are quiet areas and loud ones, but these places also have their positives and negatives
of living there. I think you've actually covered the questions I had for you, but did you have
anymore that you wanted to ask me? If not, and if you were comfortable with moving onto the next
section, I'd be happy to continue our convo on the ""Between Worlds"" page! Let's message again soon!
Your mentor, MaryMentee 2021-11-19, 14:00: Hi Mary, I think you did a great job answering my
questions! Thanks! I'm would love to move on to the did and miss information conversation, whenever
you're ready. Thanks, Margaret",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-22, 18:16: Hi Margaret, I haven't actually had the opportunity to unlock this
Conversation before with other mentees, so thank you for your choice! I think we're in for an
interesting one, and I hope you agree. Let's start off with the questions they provided us in the
anchor text, shall we?: How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and
share on social media? I'm definitely guilty of mindlessly scrolling on social media, but I rarely
share content as I mostly just use these apps to browse memes LOL. But instead of navigating social
media with emotion, I tend to follow pages that match my tastes, like certain meme pages, pages for
health/wellness, and fashion. Having a customized timeline means I get exposed to certain news that
I have a higher chance of caring about, and maybe it's the reactions produced by that that's driven
by emotion? Do you think you are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by
misinformation? I think a lot of media content is aimed for that ""shock factor"", and even if it's
misinformation, it can draw a lot of attention if it's delivered in a very digestible way -
Scrolling past a shocking, short, headline can get you to scroll back up real quick. I try not to
believe everything I see at first glance, so whenever I do come across a post like, ""WHOA. SINCE
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?!"", I do a quick fact check on Google. What are your experiences of pointing
out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false
information? With our generation growing up with computers and social media, I believe we're better
equipped with the knowledge of what's cap and what's fact . So my experiences with misinformation is
more like telling my dad not to believe everything that's shared on Facebook LOL. How important do
you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student? Oh, I
definitely used digital media as a student (even now!), and it's always important to make sure your
resources are credible, current, and relevant. Critically analyzing content is a skill you've
already been subconsciously doing as you scroll social media or listen to YouTube videos - If you
take the time to pause and search something up because you're like, ""Really?"", you're already off to
a great start. Have a great Monday! Your mentor, MaryMentee 2021-11-23, 12:51: Hi Mary, I think both
of us being new to this conversation topic should make this pretty interesting How much of a role do
your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? I definitely tend to do
a fair bit of mindless scrolling on social media, but I also don't often share things I find on
social media unless if I know someone who would enjoy it. for the most part I find that my social
media is generally more directed towards my personal interests, rather than just something that just
generally appeals emotively towards a larger audience. Although despite this all the big news that I
hear on social media is generally larger events that tend to be of interest to people all over
because my personal social media doesn't look at world events for the most part. Do you think you
are a careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? I'd have to
agree with you that a lot of media content is aimed for that ""shock factor"", and even if it's
misinformation, it can draw a lot of attention if it's delivered in a very digestible way -
Scrolling past a shocking, short, headline can get you to scroll back up real quick. It's
interesting how easily they can get us to watch and belive this random video from a stranger on the
internet without even knowing if the content is real / accurate.I try to stop and think whenever I
come across a video like this, and ask myself do I trust this source or should I reseach it more
before sharing it on the internet. What are your experiences of pointing out misinformation to
others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing misleading false information? I
personally have never been in a situation where I or somebody else I know has publically shared
major miss information like you said: With our generation growing up with computers and social
media, I believe we're better equipped with the knowledge of what's cap and what's fact. Seems to be
true in my observations of the world aswell. How important do you think these critical thinking
skills about digital media are for you as a student? I think that these critical thinking skills are
super important and just generally anywhere in your life. They help to prevent you from being
misslead on important information, they also can be very useful when your reasearching and have to
look through multiple articles from all over the web. Have a great rest of your week! and please
tell me if you would like me to elaborate on any of my answers.Mentor 2021-11-27, 22:04: Hi
Margaret, Thank you for your in-depth response! As this topic is new to the both of us and a bit on
the shorter side, I guess I'll take some time to probe your answers a little + ask a few questions
of my own! Critical thinking is an essential skill that you'll develop throughout post-secondary and
will use in many of your life's experiences. Say you're given an assignment to write an essay: How
would you go about beginning your research? What can you do to distinguish between less credible vs
more credible sources? What makes a source credible? In what ways can you fact check your resources?
Fun fact: All throughout high school, I exclusively used MLA citation. But come university, every
class required APA! I also had an English professor who accepted Vancouver citation, and an
Anthropology professor who only accepted Chicago style. So when it comes to post-secondary, be ready
to cite in different styles! Your mentor, MaryMentee 2021-12-13, 13:21: Hi Mary, In response to your
first question I would say that I normally start by generally researching the key ideas relating to
my essay topic hoping to find some more in-depth concepts that I can better research. This allows me
to know what to research without having a good prexsisting understanding of the topic. For your
second question the first thing I usually do to see if an acticle is credible I see if it has an
author and date if it doesn't have one of these it's not usually a reliable source. If I want to be
certain that a source is reliable I look for peer reviewed articles on databases. For your last
question I would fact check my resources by comparing it to a couple similar articles to find any
inconsistencies between them. Whenever you're free I'd love to start the post secondary
considerations conversation. Thanks, Margaret",,,"Mentor 2021-10-02, 04:02: Hi Margaret, It's so nice to virtually meet you! My name is Mary, and I've
been matched as your online mentor for this year. To start off, I'd love to do a little ice breaker

your favorite Halloween candy? My favorite Halloween candy are the fun-sized KitKats, and my
favorite memory from this Summer has to be graduating from university and (finally) earning my
Bachelors degree! I'm really looking forward to sharing this learning experience with you, and

and getting to see grizzlies and moose up close. My favourite Halloween candy is wonderbars. What
did you get bachelors degree in?Mentor 2021-10-06, 01:12: Hi Margaret, OMG. I have never seen a
moose in real life - were they as massive as they look on Google? To answer your question, I majored
in Health Information Science! So the whole fancy name for my degree is: Bachelor of Science (BSc)
in Health Information Science . But I'm sure we'll get to that once we cover some of our

third year at university. I get to choose 2 of the options from the above anchor text, so I'll
choose my favourite quote and recipe. My favourite quote is ""You must be the change you want to see
in this world"" spoken by Mahatma Ghandi. This quote reminds me to be kind and compassionate because
I think our world needs more kindness and compassion. My favourite thing to cook is Bannock. I
cooked some with my friend who's an elder the other day. He taught me the recipe which is 2 cups of
flour, 2 cups of water, about 2 tablespoons of baking powder, and a bit of sugar. I like the bannock
recipe because everybody makes it a bit different. My friend told me most of the time people
estimate the amount of flour and water ratio to get a desired consistency of dough. We made a lot of
bannock, enough to share with my friends from school. Have you ever tried Bannock? What are you
interested in sharing from the above anchor text? What conversations are you excited to start or
which one do you want to start first?Mentor 2021-10-12, 23:59: Hello Leo, How is the start of your

getting cought up with my classes and couldn't really figure out how to respond but I got it all
down now. schools going good and a conversation topic to start would be how to you find is going to
post secondary is it more challenging than you thought and what could I expectMentor 2021-12-02,
16:42: Mentor 2021-12-02, 17:10: That's awesome you got caught up with school. Sorry I replied so
late, it's been a busy last week of the semester. You wanted to start a conversation about if
post-secondary is more challenging than I expected. I think post-secondary is a bit a bit more
challenging than I expected but eventually it gets much easier. Post-secondary does have a lot more
more homework, but there are fewer assignments. Classes have 3-4 large assignments, that are large
1000 word essays. I don't know if that's more than what you get. I also am in social work, where the
instructors use projects rather than tests to grade us. The biggest part of this is using the
rubrics, grading criteria, to complete assignments. There is a lot of reading text books and a lot
of writing essays. But eventually you learn what to read and what to skip or skim over. The reading
part becomes easier, and writing becomes easier with practice. It's very self-paced and it helps to
use the writing-centres, wellness centre, and other student services to help with the homework.
There's a lot of resources available if you search for them. During COVID all the school went
online, which was very challenging for me, but other students like it. So my experience is probably
different than other students. Do you have any other questions about how school is different than
highschool? Or question about any specific aspect of post-secondary school? There are conversation
choices we can choose from with specific topics. They have videos, or messages that we can talk
about? Did you want to start any? I'll copy/paste the list below: Finding Inspiration Different Ways

how everyone had such different responses and ideas is so cool too. I could see teachers doing this
in a creative writing class - and I'd be one of the students all over it haha. I really like what
the first speaker said - about if you are partaking in creation, you have intention. Sometimes when
I go to write - especially poetry - I don't necessarily have an intention I can put into words, but
I just feel like I NEED to write. And then after some playing around with words, something will
emerge that I latch onto and can write an entire poem from. I think it's interesting how you can
have that intention without even knowing exactly what it is, it might just be a fleeting feeling,
but something in you is like I GOTTA GET THIS OUT and create something. I love the process of
creation - I like losing track of time because I'm so focused on creating. At times like that it
really makes me feel like this is what I'm MEANT to be doing. Do you ever feel like that with
writing too? Or is your process different when deciding to write? :) Ba la la, StasiaMentee
2021-10-16, 00:33: I have to tell you, there isn't really a great excuse for why I haven't written.
But don't worry, I didn't just do it to you. Sometimes I just fall out of contact with people for a
couple of weeks at a time. I really do enjoy our talks, I just messed this one up. I'm typing this
out right now with my dog going nuts beside me hoping for food, and I can't feel my mouth. Man does
getting wisdom teeth taken out suck or what. Anywho, I don't neccesarily agree with the idea that
intention MUST be a key component of creation. Creation, at it's most base form, is giving life to
something, putting a piece of yourself into it. That doesn't translate into needing a specific
intention. Take a doodle for example. It's a creation, yet you likely had no intention behind it
when you started. This example could be called the lazy method. It's so small and inconsequential,
that intention is not needed. Makes sense. You don't have to put effort into it, so there's no
investment. I would argue that larger projects like books could be created without intention as
well. Personally I just let it go. (Yes I'm legally intoxicated from getting the teeth done and am
watching Frozen.) While I had the intention to finish the project, I would discount that as
irrelevant to our point. I felt the need to write consistently almost to the point where it ached,
so I did. Mostly on a paragraph by paragraph basis, without an overall driving goal or desire. (That
came back to bite me in the ass on the editing stage.) It is a bit tricky to continue a cohesive
large scale project without intention, but is by no means impossible. Now my teeth hurt, I have ice
cream to eat, and I must unpause Frozen. As much as I love our scintilating conversations, I must
depart to better things. Onwards and upwards as they say. Don't feel bad. It's hard to compete with
Frozen and ice cream. Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-10-18, 23:48: Heyyy!! It's no problem, the great
thing about this program is that we can take our time to reply :) Oooooo I'm going to be getting my
wisdom teeth out in a couple weeks and I'm a little nervous. But at least you do get to eat tasty
things like ice cream! I live with my aunt and uncle but my mom is going to drive 5 hours to come
hang out with me for a few days while I recover &lt;3 So I'm going to treat it as a vacation. Also,
I can't believe you paused Frozen just to reply to me. I feel honoured - I don't think I'd have that
same strength of will! Although, I did pause on a particularly cliff-hangy episode of a show to
reply to you, so you should feel special too lmao. :) I really hear what you're saying and I
appreciate your point of view! Creating soemthing is like gicing life to it and giving it a little
piece of yourself. In one of my classes today the professor talked about how what you create/your
content is like a representation of you. You created it and it is like an extension of yourself. And
because you're alive, it becomes alive in a way too. Also, I like what you said about feeling the
need to write until it ached. It's really cool to talk to another writer, because I feel like you
just GET it. I'm glad they paired us up. :) Were there other parts of the video that you perhaps
related to more? Or do you have an entirely different approach when it comes to finding inspiration?
I'm always curious about peoples' process. And sometimes I get inspired by other peoples
inspiration. Whoa. Inception-spiration?? Ba la la, StasiaMentee 2021-10-19, 23:28: First off, I have
to say this before continueing, Inception-spiration will never be acceptable here. I just won't
allow it. Some word combinations were never meant to exist, and that one crosses a line. Moving on
from that, I do feel honoured that you paused a show for me. It's actually kind of a good feeling to
know somebody stopped doing something they enjoy doing because they value somebody elses
time/company. Company might not be the right word for it, but you know what I mean. I'm watching
malificent rn. The wisdom teeth aren't that bad. Unless... You're a moron like me and rip out one of
your stitches. Then that really sucks. Long story, involving me being stupid, numbed, and being on
somewhat of a contact high. That sucked. Anywho. Yes the ache. I'm getting it myself rn actually,
but I need my dad to finish proof reading this manuscript befor I start another. Otherwise it's a
bit too much. Authoring am I right. Paired up nicely. Inspiration comes pretty randomly. I don't
have crazy OMG moments where I see a flower and spot the shape of the universe. Rn when I see
something cool I just mark it down as a note. I would keep on talking but malificent is still
playing and people are around me talking. I should probably get back to socializing, but you were a
nice break. I swear, my friends are a collective three years old. With maybe two brain cells between
them. Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-10-20, 21:12: Hahahah well I was going to write just
""Incep-spiration"" instead but I was worried the connection wouldn't be clear enough, does that word
sound better? I agree Inception-spiration is pretty ugly to look at haha. And yes! It is a good
feeling. Damn are you on a Disney marathon? I respect it! I was writing an essay but I think I've
done all I can for the day so Imma table it for tomorrow. Oof, that sounds painful! I'll really try
not to do the same, but if I do at least I know I'll have someone to talk to who understands the
pain. I hope you're feeling better now! I know what you mean about trying to finish one thing before
starting another! Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to stop my brain from attempting it anyway. I
have way too many projects on the go, but I'm going to try to focus on the one I'm most excited
about once I'm done my last shift at work. Nice!! Do you have a notebook specifically for notes? I
use a notebook to record little thoughts, observations, drafts, quotes, really anything that
inspires me or even if I just feel like writing about my day. I find it really handy to have
something to go back to to revisit old ideas or a promising draft. Hahaha your friends sound like a
lot of fun. And I mean, sometimes it's entertaining to be around people like that - or be a person
like that yourself - and just have a break from life. :) Ba la la, StasiaMentee 2021-10-21, 22:46:
The disney never stops. Or movies made for kids about 5-10 years younger than me in general. Heh
funny you ask about notes. I recently upgraded from a paper butterfly to a notebook. I made this
cool looking paper butterfly in one of my classes and drew up the draft of my next planned novel on
it. Unfortunately it's full of writing now, so when I recieved a notebook as a gift, I thought to
use that instead. Mostly though I just log onto the docs for the next novel and put stuff on that. I
have a friend who has too many projects on the go right now, and she's never going to finish any of
them. But hey, that's life I suppose. I prefer to take it one at a time until it's done. What do you
think about starting up the next converesation? Am I supposed to do some kind of associated activity
to go with this? What is going on? What am I doing? With that in mind. Ba la la la EvanMentor
2021-10-23, 14:41: Dude I feel that! Two of my favourite movies that I still watch when I'm in need
of some good vibes are Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero Six, even though they both came out when I was
definitely too old to be the target audience. But who cares, as long as we're enjoying them right!
They both make me cry every single time though... And that's dope about your new notebook! A paper
butterfly, that's so cool. That'll make a nice keepsake too :) Sometimes we gotta use what we gotta
use. I have several napkins with frenzied writing all over them that I still keep. I think there is
a solo activity for you to do if you want or if your teacher asks you to - I would double check with
them if you're unsure. :) Since I picked this topic, how about you pick next? I can unlock it once
you choose. I also just wanted to let you know that I might be a little slower in replying the next
few days because my cat Misha is having some very serious health problems and it's going to be time
to say goodbye very soon. I just wanted to let you know in case I accidentally go a few days without
replying, but I'll try to be as on it as possible. Hope you have a great weekend B) Ba la la,
StasiaMentee 2021-10-25, 13:40: Awesome about the movies, awesome about the notes. Glad to know
we're on the same page haha. Sorry to hear about your cat. That always sucks to go through:( Hope
your doing alright and take all the time you need. Ooh, picking my own topic, thats a big step up.
I'm truly honoured. How does studying sound? I am actually the worst at studying, and seeing as I'm
about to move into first year engineering, it's probably something I should work on. (Seriously, I'm
really bad at it.) Keeping this one short in anticipation of the new conversation. See you on the
other side. Ba la LA la EvanMentee 2021-10-25, 13:40: Mentor 2021-10-26, 20:26: Hey! Thank you :)
She's actually been doing better the last few days, so it might not be time to say goodbye yet! I
was really worried though, it really seemed like the end. She's not necessarily out of the woods
yet, but, I'm much more hopeful now :) Ahh, studying. What a fun topic. But as you mentioned, useful
too haha. I'll unlock that now! See ya on that page, Ba la la Stasia",,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-29, 22:43: Okay, first off, I think it's so strange that school doesn't teach us this
stuff. Like I had no idea about any of this. I'm one of the worst study people I know to still get
good grades, so this is such a great choice. I thought the idea of splitting up the time that you
use for studying into blocks and jumping between subjects were two particularly cool concepts.
Hopefully I'll be able to employ them in the future. Fingers crossed. Hows life treating you? I feel
like we've been talking about the modules and stuff so much that we haven't really had a
conversation recently. Eat anything cool lately? Find a new song? I'm curious! What do you think
about this study stuff? Do you use the strategies already? Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-10-31, 20:00:
Heyyyy!! HAPPY HALLOWEEN !!! THIS IS SUCH A HELPFUL VIDEO. I knew about some of the stuff before,
like how recall is the best way to actually remember stuff, but it's something I learned in year 1
of university in a psychology course. It definitely should be taught at the high school level, I
feel like so mnay kids would do much better in school if they were told about these things earlier!
I agree, switching up the subjects and taking breaks is really important! I sometimes try to go for
a little walk outside in between studying and it really helps just to get some fresh air and let
your brain chill for a few minutes. Life's going alright!! Misha has been doing okay, she's a pretty
stubborn cat lmao and I've just been doing everything I can to keep her comfy and happy. As for new
music, I've mostly just been listening to halsey's new album, I particularily like ""bells in santa
fe"" although it took me a few listens to really figure out if I liked it or not. But it has a sort
of haunting vibe to it that I enjoy. How about you? Any new tunes? Are you doing anything for
Halloween? I'm just spending the night in with my aunt and uncle and probably going to eat pizza and
watch the Voice. I'm pretty jazzed lol. As for a tasty food...I got a drink! My friends and I went
to this orchard/farm in Vernon yesterday that had this bomb ass apple juice and now it's all I
desire to consume lol. Hope you have a chill night!! ba la la la StasiaMentee 2021-11-04, 15:22:
Happy halloween indeed! It's also my bday on the seventh, and with xmas coming up, this is a pretty
rocking few months for me. Hehehe. WHOO Honestly I'm going to have to start employing some of these
strategies. In chem we're doing solubility equilibriums and it is the largest pain in my ass of
perhaps all time. At this point it would be more less painful to hangout with satan's posse down at
his pad. We got a quiz upcoming tmr, so studying is almost a must. I'll probably go over this video
again while trying to avoid studying. I feel like if I went on walks while studying I would probably
forget to finish tbh. Good to hear about Misha! Stubborn pets are adorable. For Halloween I really
just stayed at a friends place and handed out candy as his mom got wasted with the rest of the
neighborhood's adults. Pretty fun stuff. Watched megamind too. God that movie is a submersive
masterpiece. Okay, so for apple juice, is it better in the winter or summer for you? Contraversial
opinion warning, I like it more in the winter. Cool plus cool oohhhweee. That's all for today folks.
Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-11-06, 16:16: Omg happy early birthday! I hope it's a great one!! :) Do
you have any particular plans? Ahh that chem stuff sounds painful. I only took chem until it wasn't
required anymore. The theory was interesting but all the math? Oh boy. My brain just don't be
working like that. Hope your quiz went okay! Thankfully as an English major I don't really have any
quizzes (only my first year courses did) and this semester I only have one class with a final exam
B) So I won't have to worry too much about studying, it's more projext-based stuff. Which I prefer a
lot more! Megamind is SO good. I actually recently watched that too! It makes me laugh every time. I
love movies like that. I've actually never thought about whether I like apple juice more in the
winter or summer. I feel like it's awesome both times hahaha. But sometimes that cold on cold does
make for a good rush lol! Did you want to pick a new topic? :) Also I just got my wisdom teeth out a
couple days ago so I was pretty out of it there. But today is day 4 post op so feeling on the
upswing now. This no cronchy foods is killing me. I just want to devour everything I'm not supposed
to. But at least the worst is over haha. Ba la la, StasiaMentee 2021-11-09, 12:30: HAH WISDOM TEETH
SUCK. Anyways- Nah I just ate wayyyy too much junk food with some friends, and that seemed to work
pretty well for a bday. New topic sounds good! What do you think about well being and self care?
Hope you're doing well Ba la la la Evan",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 21:12: Heyyyy here we are in the self care section! I am SO glad that they have
included this here and you guys at the high school level get to learn about this stuff. I don't
think I knew what ""self-care"" even was during my high school years, especially Grade 12. Everyone I
knew was in the mindset of being as productive as possible and getting 3, 4 hours of sleep was
normal, something to brag about even. And at that age, to me ""self-care"" was seen as self-indulgence
and selflish. Which it obviosuly isn't, but it took me a few years to let go of that negative
mindset and realize self care is a priority and knowing that yourself first isn't selfish. I really
liked, ""Self care is basic to your well-being. It is not an “extra” or a special treat that you give
yourself only after all of your work is done."" That really just changed how I look at self care. I
still often fall into the habit of making self care a reward for getting work done versus it being a
priority and I want to change. When it comes to self-care for me, I feel like sometimes each day has
different self care needs. Somedays yes, it's self care to makie sure you get up on time and eat a
healthy breakfast and do some exercise. But I think that self care is also giving yourself an extra
hour to sleep when you need it. Or once in a while going to get that greasy hashbrown for breakfast
because it's your favourite and it brings you joy. I think self care is listening to your body and
your mind's intuition and getting more in touch with what you personally need on that day. You know
- balance haha. What about you? Do you already practice some self care, or is this a new concept?
I'm also curious if your friends in Grade 12 ever talk about this stuff! Hope you're having a good
day! Also - your birthday sounded super fun and chill, as birthdays should be. :) Ba la la,
AnastasiaMentee 2021-11-15, 14:04: Helloo!!! I'm back! I think it's super important to know the
difference between self-care and being lazy. Cause being productive is super important, but it
shouldn't be detracting from your overall health. Self care is trying to maintain that balance
between the two I feel, while lazyness could be detracting from both. As such, self-care should
definitely be looked at as a positive thing instead of mispercieved as lazyness. Making that
difference clear should be a priority. YES Self care shouldn't be a reward. Unless it is. Huh. How
do you decide whether it's a reward or if it's just caring about yourself? Cause like you accomplish
something and want to reward yourself with a snacky snak, then that could just be a reward instead
of self care. Self care I feel is all about maintaining your state of being, while a reward might be
that little extra that makes you that little extra happy. *Looks at greasy hashbrown aggresively*
I'll admit right now that I'm really really bad at this. Self care and studying are probably my two
worst things in my life haha. A lot of the time I don't feel like I deserve self care, which can get
a bit sketchy when I'm spiralling into a not-so-greasy-hashbrown place. ... Anywho! It was certainly
v fantastic. Whens your bday? Happy Monday Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-11-18, 16:03: Heyyy! Super
sorry for my later than normal response, been a few pretty packed days! Absolutely agreed! some
people view taking care of themself as selfish or lazy, when true self care is neither of those
things. And those people probably need self care the most lol. Hmmm that's a good point. I think
rewards can be a part of self care, as long as they're not detracting from your overall health, like
the point you made. If you're rewarding yourself for studying every hour with a handful of candy,
for example, that isn't going to be good for your overall health and care, even if it makes you
happy in the moment. I totally think once in a while is okay though because let's face it, candy is
delicious and can give a sweet serotonin rush. Unless you don't like candy, and in that instance:
[insert treat you like here]. I think figuring out how to balance things and have things in
moderation is a part of self care. I think another part of it is making the time to rest or do the
things you love without feeling bad or like you should be ""productive"" instead. Adequate rest and
relaxation time is key to overall health as well. I'm really trying to get better at this myself,
and not get mad at myself when I need a rest and just want to watch a show or something. Because
sometimes your brain needs that no thinking time to then be able to think properly again. I know
what you mean about feeling like you don't deserve it. It's so maddening how our brains do this to
us. Like no shut up you clump of cells I AM deserving of self care, whether I feel like I am or not.
Something that's helped me get through days like that is making sure to do basic self care anyway,
like making sure to shower and eat, because sometimes just doing things like that for yourself can
help you break out of the I-don't-deserve-this mentality. or even just telling yourself things like
""*I am worthy"" even if you don't believe it yet. It might sound cheesy but I swear it can help. My
birthday is february 25 :) Ba la la, StasiaMentee 2021-11-25, 15:08: OMG I DIDN'T GET A NOTIFICATION
I'M SORRY I'm writing this now to let you know I have seen this- but I'm in the middle of classes on
2 days of not much sleep so I'll actually respond later. Hope you're doing well! Ba la la la
EvanMentor 2021-11-26, 19:34: No problem at all!! Hope you're also doing well! :) Ba la la,
StasiaMentee 2021-11-28, 00:13: Yes yes yes! Health is super important, both mental and physical. A
lot of the time those two are pretty closely related to each other I think. Right now I'm trying
(and failling) to work on both haha. It's way too much of an uphill battle for something that's
making you a better person. What do you think about moving onto another conversation? I'm pretty
much good on this one if you have nothing else:) I'll even leave the selection of conversation up to
you as a way to apologize for not replying for so long;D Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-11-30, 22:07: I
definitely relate to it being an uphill battle! I think it's especially hard towards the end of the
semester when there's a lot more to do for school, and that's where I'm struggling now with making
sure to take care of myself and not just try to go full study mode all day. You're definitely not
alone in the battle lol Oooooo okay sounds good! I think I'm good too. Let's do the ""different ways
of knowing""! That sounds ominous. I must find out more. And don't worry at all about taking a while
to reply! I might be a little late responding too at the moment just as I finish up finals and
whatnot. :) See ya on the other side! Ba la la la la, Stasia",,"Mentee 2021-10-01, 18:52: Why hello there! To be perfectly frank, I'm here because it's a school
project, but don't let that deter you. Hopefully this turns into something cool, and if not, then
its still counted as school work (awesome). Oop my name is Evan by the way, probably should have
lead with that, but you probably know that anyways what with the email system. Anywho, I suppose we
have to do some convo starters. It's saying that I get to choose, so here we go. Food for thought
sounds good. I'm actually just about to start making some kickass brownies right now, but I figured
homework would probably be the best way to start things out. I'm not actually a fan of chocolate,
but I figured I'd give the brownies a go. Fingers crossed. For my favorite song/artist I would have
to go with vivaldi's ""les quatres saisons: L'hiver."" Vivaldi is an amazing composer. Well that was a
super basic convo starter, but it'll do. Hope you enjoy brownies, cause I'll probably end up sending
you some pics. Have a good weekend, and bye. I really hope this isn't going to be marked. ... Bye
for real.Mentor 2021-10-01, 19:37: Hii Evan! It's really nice to meet you! My name is Anastasia, but
you can call me Stasia if you'd like. It's all good that you're mostly just doing this because it
counts as school - I'd honestly do the same thing lol! This is my first time being an Ementor so I'm
a little nervous but also excited, I'll try to do the best I can. :) That's cool you're making
brownies! Do you often like to bake? It's funny, I'm sort of the opposite of you, I love chocolate
but brownies are my least favourite among the chocolate family. But I'd love to see a pic of your
finished brownies! I haven't heard of Vivaldi before but I'll definitely give them a listen. :) I
currently am eating some instant ramen, because uni life. But I'm going to try to actually cook
something for dinner tonight, probably jambalaya - I make it with lentils, tomatoes, and rice.
Sounds kinda boring but I promise it tastes good. Especially with a lot of spice added. As for a
song I really enjoy, lately I've had ""Cradles"" by Sub Urban on repeat. I saw in your bio that you
love writing too! What kind of stuff do you like to write? (If you feel like sharing). You probably
already looked at my bio too, but I'm also a writer - I really like writing poetry but I'm also
working on a novel in the modern fantasy genre. In my handy dandy little Ementor guide, it told me
know I should let you know when I can respond to messages. I check my email pretty regularly so I
should be able to respond within a few hours most of the time; but I do generally work friday,
saturday, and sunday so on those days I might take a little longer to respond if you happen to
message me. Okay, that's probably enough for now lol. I hope you enjoy your brownies &amp; have a
good rest of your day!Mentee 2021-10-01, 21:49: Stasia it is. Always thought it was a cool name from
books, but I've never met anyone IRL who has it. Although I suppose I still haven't met anyone IRL
that has it. Hmm. I could count you as half an IRL Anastasia how about that. Are you doing this for
school as well, or just free time? If it's just in your free time then thats pretty awesome of you.
I don't think I would volenteer my time to an indolent rapscallion such as myself in your shoes.
Alright I got to tell you, I've never had brownies before. But (yes there is a but) I plan to fix
that. Most people get mad at me when I say that, so it's a relief to hear you don't like them haha.
I don't bake much at all, so it could get messy. Hope it's not too bad, although nobody is home rn
so there will be no witnesses. ... Except my dog. Anyways, cradle is a pretty great song. I listen
to it too:) My tastes are pretty eclectic, so I have everything from pop to jazz to rock to
classical. Everything except counrty tbh. *Shivers in disgust* Vivaldi was a pretty popular
classical composer way back in the day, so I'm not surprised you don't know him. Not too many people
do. Nice on the writing! I don't do poetry too much unless its a assignment, in which case I pull
out liberal amounts of BS from my back pocket. That, along with a splash of cool vocabulary tends to
get the job done. I finished editing my book a month or so ago, and am awaiting my faithful servants
(parents, teachers, and friends) to finish proof reading it. They aren't very fast I gotta say. They
finish it and then remember they have to edit. Pretty frusterating, cause I was hoping to send it in
a while ago. But you know, its just time to relax I suppose. I don't do much creative writing to be
honest. I just kind of jumped straight into a book from nothing, which was a very very very steep
learning curve. Re-reading the first few chapters after I finished was agony. This has gotten a bit
long, so I'll end it here. Two quick questions before I leave though, I read she/her on you profile
but just figured I'd confirm it before messing it up. After reading that sentance I realise that
wasn't worded as a question, but I don't want to delete my beautiful creation, so I'm just putting a
question mark here and calling the last sentance a question? Next up is are you alright with
profanity? You're like 24 so I hope so, but it never hurts to confirm. Your ever faithful web
correspondence EvanMentor 2021-10-01, 23:35: Awe, thanks! I haven't met anyone else named Anastasia
either, we seem to be a rare species. And I'm just doing this as a volunteer, but it seemed like a
fun opportunity. ""Indolent rapscallion"" I quite like that haha. I definitely see why you're also a
writer! Aweee you have a doggo!! Name?? I have two cats, their names are Misha and Sochi. Misha is a
diabetic princess while Sochi is a cuddly goofball. I don't think brownies can be too messed up -
worst comes to worse, you have some mushy warm chocolate. Okay that actually sounds kinda weird, so
nevermind. Eyyy it's cool that you know cradles too!! I feel the exact same about music; I just
don't understand how people like country music lmao. Lately I've been listening to more alt rock
music, but I really enjoy a wide variety as well. It's insanely cool that you've finished a novel
already!! That takes sooo much work. Mine is... a mess. I have everything planned out for it, but
it's hard for me to find time for the actual writing. I hope your fam and friends will get their
edits done soon and you can start sending it in!! That's so exciting. And I know exactly what you
mean about rereading old stuff. It's like, oof, I really did that?? Haha, it's all apart of the
process though. Thank you for checking! I go by both she/her and they/them. Either is fine with me.
Just to check, yours are he/him? :) And yes! Profanity is okay with me - Admittedly, I curse far too
much in my daily life. I spent longer than I care to admit trying to think of a cool sign off but
alas my only braincell seems to have fallen asleep so Imma just say bye for now lol StasiaMentee
2021-10-02, 00:10: A rare species indeed, of the volenteer genus as well. I may never meet another
in my lifetime. Diabetic princess pfft. My dog's called strider, so named after the king of middle
earth. (It was my brothers idea, not that I'm dissing it. King of middle earth is a fucking amazing
title for a dog.) I have to agree with you on the warm mushy chocolate bit. It doesn't sound like my
best lifestyle. What exactly my best lifestyle is I have yet to find out, but that particular image
is not going to be in it. Yes! You get it! Every genre has it's value, except for country. Blegh.
Twangy twangy please kill my ears already. I have a bunch of friends who are in the exact same boat
as you are: all the planning done without the bulk of the manual labour. I completely bypassed that
section and just torched my sleep schedule making it up one paragraph at a time. Gave me nightmares
to edit, but I didn't get stuck in that quasi state. Win some lose some. Excellent on the swearing
bit. Cursing creatively is one of the few pleasure of my day, one that I take pride in. He him works
great. I think we've been through the tried and tested convo starters, so tell me a bit about
yourself! Hows the college life? (You're a party animal I bet &gt;:D ) On the cool sign offs thing,
I'm not entirely sure either. We can't exactly make a secret handshake up. Bah. You're the mentor,
you figure it out. Best of luckMentor 2021-10-02, 20:01: I love that your dog's name is Strider!!
What a dope character to be named after. I hope he appreciates it. Damn, I really admire your drive
when it comes to writing! Back when I was still a teenager I could run off 3 hours of sleep and be
fine but now if I do that I become a literal walking zombie who can't function at all, so I usually
try to get as much sleep as possible lol. I actually just made the recent decison to quit my job
though so I have more time to focus on writing - and school too of course. Lmao I'm really not the
party type - I've always been more of an introvert and into the staying home and spending time with
my cats kind of life. Buuuut I do have some friends from work and we'll all go out for dinner or a
movie night together when we can find time! I gotta go out at least some times and remind myself
there's a whole world out there. I'm one of those weirdos who actually likes school, so I'm really
enjoying university! Plus it helps to be in a program that I love. It's soooooo nice to be on campus
again too - last year was pretty tough with it all being online. Being in English classes, though,
is a shit ton of reading and writing. Luckily there hasn't been anything major due yet though, so
I'm staying pretty on top of things. For now. Ask me in a few weeks and I might be drowning. I have
4 classes right now; two of them I really enjoy because the professors are really into hearing what
us students think about the texts, like what stood out to us or seems important, because I like
being able to share what I connected to in the text. In one of my other classes though, the prof
just lectures and asks very direct questions - more of like yes/no answers - and it's just kinda
annoying because I want to share my own opinion, not just listen to hers. How's school going for
you? Are you in your last year? :) Also - if you want to, we can hit the ""Working through this
program"" to start getting into some other stuff! I feel like I've gotten to know you now, so I'm
ready if you're ready :) Okay, I think I got a cool sign off figured out: Ba la la la ~ ~ *
StasiaMentee 2021-10-02, 22:35: I feel like he doesn't appreciate it nearly enough, but he's a good
boy so it doesn't bother me. Quitting your job sounds like quite the investement into writing, hope
it works out! And honestly for me it was more about perseverance than anything skill related, so
more time should hopefully help. What do I know though, college sounds busy. You totally radiate
party vibes, you can't hide the truth from me. Jk, being an introvert is pretty nice. I count myself
among their number. You don't have to to much, and it just makes life easier haha. Since I want to
keep talking to you, I'm going to ignore what you just said about enjoying school. Otherwise I would
be duty bound to exit this website, stop talking to you, and probably fail this assignment. School
is super chill for me right now, last year alright. Classes are easy, people don't bug me, and now
if anyone gets in my way in the hallways they move around me instead of the other way around. Small
miracles I guess. I am unsure what we actually have to do for the working through the program stuff.
Is it given to us by the mentorcity platform, or do we have to find images and whatnot by ourselves.
Again, you are the mentor, so I leave it in your capable hands. ;) Ba la la indeed Stasia EvanMentor
2021-10-03, 12:15: Tell Strider he's a good boi for me!! I'm really excited to have more time off -
in the summer I actually wrote quite a bit for my book when I had days off, so I'm just imagining
the power I'll have with more free time - or will I procrastinate more? I guess we shall see.
Ahahahaha okay, please ignore what I said. School sucks!! Lol. I'm glad your last year is going
chill so far!! It is nice to finally be among the older students and enjoy the perks that come with
it. :) Lmao this is my first time doing this too, but I'm gonna press the button and we'll see what
happens. See you on the other side!! StasiaMentor 2021-10-03, 12:30: Ahh okay I've been to the other
side, and you should be able to click the ""Working Through This Program"" button yourself and once
you've watched the little video and stuff, just let me know what conversation you want to do first
and we can start on that. :) I'm working today but I should be able to reply to any messages at 8 pm
tonight. But also, since it's sunday, if you just wanna chill we can start this tomorrow instead!
Totally up to you :)Mentee 2021-12-10, 15:33: Hey hi hello once again! I've just recieved word from
my teacher that our block to be doing all this E-mentorship stuff is coming to an end. We easily
cleared all the neccesary components and I'm quite satisfied with the results. (Hope you are too! :D
) I know I wasn't such a great E-mentor at the end, what with my poor response time, but life was
catching up to me a bit. I had such a good time working with you though, and I felt like we were
really on the same wavelength. The program turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than I first
expected because of you, and I just wanted to thank you for the time that you gave me. I believe
there is a wrapping up survey section, but I don't have access to it. You are, as always, the boss
lady, so you should be able to open it up. Hope you're having a good week! *Realizes this is one of
his last ba la la la's *Sheds a tear Ba la la la EvanMentor 2021-12-11, 16:39: Heyy! Awe thank you
so much for all your kind words! I'm glad that the program was more enjoyable than you thought at
first ^.^ I was nervous as this was my first time mentoring but it was a lot more fun than I thought
and I definitely think it helped that we are both on that same wavelength. :) And no problem at all,
it's been a busy few weeks for me too, so it's all good! I'm really glad that we had all the talks
that we did! I'll go ahead and open up that section now! BA LA LA LA FOREVER Anastasia","Mentee 2021-10-05, 19:25: This seems like a pretty strange way to do things, there isn't a very
centralized communication system is there. I guess We talk about this subject here and others in
other places. Fragmented, but who cares. Anyways. Hello! Been a while. Not really, but a while. Yup.
Anywho, we get to discuss the topic with the prompts provided I suppose. I really wasn't expecting
agency in the world to be turned into a feel-good lesson about how being an outcast is okay. That
threw me off a bit, but otherwise I thought it was a good ted talk. I personally don't struggle with
looking at myself as an outcast, one of the many many priviledges and responsabilities of a
proffesional introvert. Sometimes at lunch I used to sneak into the library and write away, which
help the overarching goal of that time to finish the book. I handle the ""outcast feelings"" as they
were by not thinking about, or having them. It's a simple solution, yet quite effective. The
relationship between grit and agency is quite important imo. How can you accomplish things or have
liberty to do what you want without having the determination and results to back it up? Although,
grit really does apply to pretty much everything if you want to do it well. It does, however, apply
quite nicely to agency in that regard. Hope thats enough for now, see you when I see you Ba la la
EvanMentor 2021-10-06, 14:23: Heyy!! :) I agree it seems kind of fragmented, but I think it's just
so we talk about one subject at a time without getting too off track. I also agree that that Ted
talk wasn't what I was expecting, but I really liked it - I hadn't really thought about how
important having a community or connections are to your own success. Ahahah as a fellow introvert, I
relate. I don't necessarily think of myself as a social outcast - I am part of the LGBTQ+ community,
but since I am white and present fem I've never experienced any kind of discrimination that I know
many others of more marginalized groups experience. I am privileged in that way. And 100% I agree
you gotta have grit in order to accomplish things. I think it's so important to not only have the
passion for something but also the determination to see it through. I like how he mentioned that
asking for help is a part of grit too. I think too often the narrative is pushed that asking for
help is weak, but how the heck are you supposed to get anywhere without at least some help? I think
recognizing that others - especially friends and family, and even teachers - WANT to help (at least
the good ones). Like when you mentioned your friends and fam are helping edit your book - editing by
yourself would be a lot harder. I'm always sending my writing to my friends for critiques too.
Sometimes having that fresh perspective is just exactly what you need. And someone else might be
able to open a door for you for publication that you wouldn't have been able to open by yourself.
Okay, I'll stop rambling for now lol. I hope my thoughts don't come across too sporadic, I've had
two cups of coffee today and I normally don't drink caffeine so I'm vibrating as I write this. hope
your day is going well so far :) Ba la la la StasiaMentee 2021-10-06, 23:22: I agree. It's hard for
us to really understand everyones position on stuff like this, which is one of the points of the
video. And true, what would we do without a support to back us up. I wouldn't be anything like I am
now without my parents. I can't even imagine what life would be like if I had nobody to rely on.
Which is kind of the point of agency in the world, you have more freedom but less support. As a
white male, there's really only a very low lying sort of discrimination thats hard to push back
against. It's nowhere near what others experience though, so I'm grateful for that. Ikr! Grit is the
mango to life's milkshake. Essential, flavourful, and orange. Before you ask, the analysis is
completely accurate. On a side note, I've only ever had coffee once or twice, and both times it
sucked. I'm more of a kombucha guy myself; a preference that everone around me despises. Do you have
insta? It's a platform that I certainly check more often than this, if you want to chat on there. Ba
la la EvanMentor 2021-10-07, 13:35: I can't imagibe my life without support either! I'm definitely
only who I am now because of people who have helped me. Although, I do think it's still up to us to
have the determination to grow and change, even with others' help. There are some people who get all
the help in the world, but they don't have any determination for themselves, so they never really
get anywhere. I think that's the grit part again. You gotta have the mango-y, gritty goodness if you
want a good ass milkshake of life. Oooo kombucha! A man of culture I see. And no, I shall not
apologize for that pun. I've tried kombucha but it really isn't my thing. Is there a specific brand
you like? Maybe I'll try it again. I tend to be more of a tea person, but now with school started
again and more early mornings I've unfortunately gotten back into more heavily caffeinated drinks.
Unfortunately, during the program we're not allowed to share social media, BUT I shall ask and see
if it's alright to share after the program has finished in case we want to stay in touch :) Ba LAAAA
laaa StasiaMentee 2021-10-08, 00:59: Woah Stasia, getting a little aggresive with the ba la la
there. Trying to prove something? I cannot believe you're the first person to say that joke to me. I
say it to people all the time and they never get it. Those fools. You needn't apologize for genius.
Unfortunate about the social media thing, seems like a strange rule, but then again I didn't design
the program. I'm keeping this one short because I need to go back to writing scholarship essays and
getting ahead in classes. I bombed a quiz for the first time in my life, so I figure I might need to
start actually studying for things and getting good sleep and excercise and stuff. It is a wake up
call though to get going. Plus we sort of wrapped up this topic anyways. I'll leave the next topic
selection to you, even though I get to choose technically. Feeling a bit rebellious today. Ba la la
EvanMentor 2021-10-08, 14:58: Hahaha something in me just needed to do an extra loud ""LA"". Aha
really?? The fools! They aren't on our level. Awe I'm sorry about your quiz, that's happened to me
before too. I always remind myself that it's just one bad grade though, it doesn't define you.
Although it seems like you're already looking at the positives and making some good choices for
yourself :) Getting a good sleep is one of my main priorities right now too! OOOO my choice.....
let's do the ""finding inspiration"" one. It seems like a fun topic. la la ba, Stasia","Mentor 2021-12-11, 16:43: Last message - T.T I'm really glad to have gotten to know you a bit! I
think your passion and dedication to writing is SO fucking cool and I'll be looking out for your
books being published. I'm really glad that the self care section seemed especially helpful to both
of us, and I hope you continue to keep taking care of yourself throughout your last year of high

questions as you work through the materials above! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-16, 20:17: Hey
Katie:) I have read through and completed the module and quizzes! That being said my three career
options are; nursing, doctor (GP), and teacher. For nursing the demand is very high almost
everywhere in Canada except for Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan. The expected
salary ranges from fifty thousand-eighty thousand. For being a GP the demand is rising considerably
but is about half of that of nursing, it is high everywhere except Nunavut and the Northwest
Territories. The expected salary is between two hundred fifty thousand-three hundred fifty thousand.
Finally for teachers the demand is quite high being similar to the demand of doctors however the
highest demand is in BC and Quebec. The expected salary is between forty thousand-seventy thousand.
I find careers interesting as they all involve working with and helping others! It is also good to
know they are all in high demand and have a lot of opportunities.Mentee 2021-11-16, 20:19: Oh and
sorry for typing out all the numbers out as words and not giving specific numbers it wouldn't let me
send it with numbers and was saying it was personal information for some reason but those were the
approximate salaries!Mentor 2021-11-17, 21:36: Hey Cassidy, Great work! It looks like you have put a
lot of thought and research into these career choices! Have you had a chance to look into the
schooling behind pursuing each of these careers? I know we've discussed nursing, but I'm curious
about your thoughts about school for education and medicine. Any other thoughts on choosing a
career? Hope you're having a great week! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-18, 15:27: Hey Katie! I have
done some research on the schooling process of being a GP and my mom is a teacher so I know about
the schooling and experience associated with it as well. To be a doctor the first step is to get
your bachelors degree with a high GPA then take the MCAT to get into med school once those four
years are over you have to take the MCCEE to begin residency. This process is one I looked into for
our future options project and is evidently quite extensive. As for teachers college it is one-two
years long and has a short practicum afterwards, I believe there is a few pre requisite courses
recommend. Overall though this option is much more doable in comparison to med school! Now overall I
think I feel quite confident in the recommended educational and experiential to succeed in these
positions!Mentor 2021-11-19, 20:10: Hey Cassidy! Excellent work! It looks like you have done very
thorough research into career options :) Do you have any other questions on this topic or should we
start the next module? Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-22, 13:19: Thanks Katie! I think I fully
understand all the career options I chose. I don't believe that I have any more questions and I

weekend :) KatieMentee 2021-12-08, 15:48: Hey Katie. Thanks, I had a great weekend:) After reading
through this module the were some of my thoughts and responses to the questions. I have made some
considerations about different careers in the medical field but over all I want to go into nursing
the most, at least as the first step and have already applied to quite a few schools nursing
programs. To me the expected salary is not that important as I would prefer to be a nurse because I
enjoy it and not necessarily for the money. If this career path was not an option I would keep
working hard to achieve this goal and stay determined. It is important to excel or be passionate
about the school subjects that are affiliated with your career choice as that will be the main focus
while in post secondary and while working so it is necessary to be prepared and care about what is
going on. Like I personally am better at and enjoy sciences and math better that English and socials
which has been part of my decision to go into nursing!Mentor 2021-12-10, 12:29: Hey Cassidy! That's
so awesome to hear! Which nursing programs have you applied to? I'm excited for you to hear back!
Well done on thinking about the topics of this module. It sounds like you are on a great track to
pursuing a career in nursing! KatieMentee 2021-12-13, 13:19: Hey Katie:) Thanks so much, so far it's
going pretty well for sure! I've sent in my initial application to VIU and Camosun college, I have
almost completed the application to Selkirk (only resume is left to complete my application), and I
have done about half of the application process for tru! I also did the initial application on
myeducationplannerbc for the college of the Rockies but then afterwards found out that they don't
accept interim transcripts unfortunately and all courses must be completed by February which will
not work for me. I did the Casper test and am planning on doing the snapshot soon so overall it's
definitely coming together!Mentor 2021-12-15, 17:59: Hey Cassidy, That's so great! What a busy time

any questions or comments as you work through the reading and videos above! Have a great day!
KatieMentee 2021-11-04, 16:11: Thanks so much Katie! I finished reading through, answering the
questions, and watching the videos. I found the study tips to be interesting and I think they will
definitely be helpful to me! I am glad that I found out about these study tips because the way I
study is not great. I always tend to cram so the tip about spaced practice will be great for me and
I'll definitely be trying to integrate it into my study routines!Mentor 2021-11-04, 17:48: Hey
Cassidy, Which study tips did you find helpful? What are your current study habits? Do you have any
questions about studying at University? Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-05, 15:27: Hi Katie. I found all
the tips helpful but especially the one for spaced practice (breaking study time up in small periods
over longer periods of time). As well as making lists of essential ideas and trying to find or
remember the information for practice. Finally using concrete examples to remember concepts! My
current study habits are to read my information as well as re-write information until I have it
memorized which as worked pretty well for me so far except for the fact that I usually do it all in
one night! How do u study in university with the large range and increase of information? What are
the best strategies to efficiently study a range of information without having an outline?Mentor
2021-11-09, 20:11: Hey Cassidy, How is your week going? It sounds like you have a good study plan in
place! For University, I had to switch up my study habits from the ones I had in high school. I made
sure to make a plan of when to study and what to study at least a week before each exam. That way it
gives you sufficient time to review without feeling pressured that the exam is in the next 48 hours.
I would often make my own study plan of key topics from the lectures and then go back over that
while I was reviewing for the test. Sometimes the professors will also give you an outline of what
to study, especially in the first year of university. Spacing out the studying and allotting enough
time to study where you don't feel rushed is key to doing well on exams! Do you have any other
questions related to studying? :) Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-10, 17:24: Hey Katie:) My week is
going great so far! How about yours? Those tips are super helpful and make a lot of sense, I'm
guessing I will also have to make quite a few changes to the way I study in university and those
tips will certainly be great for that! I don't think I have any other questions and now feel more
confident about how to effectively and efficiently study! That being said could we possibly start a
new module? Possibly the career considerations one if that works for you:)Mentor 2021-11-10, 18:35:

unlock the next module now! Cheers, Katie",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-25, 22:07: Hey Cassidy, I've unlocked the next module! Let me know if you have any
questions as you work through the sections! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-29, 14:02: Hey Katie! after
completing this module these are my thoughts and reflections of the questions. I don't tend to think
of self care generally before other important tasks although I definitely should because when I lack
sleep for example I certainly am worse off the next day. Time management is definitely one of the
obstacles in proper self care for me as I leave it until the very last moment and run out of time.
In general I have to control my own self care which I sometimes push aside, I suppose my mom would
be my self care model by getting outside lots and taking time to relax which are things I try to
incorporate every day! I know I need to take better care of myself as I am usually tired and
overwhelmed with stress from school and current general work load. It is probable that post
secondary will make self care more difficult as with more independence then will be more
procrastination of self care and more work for school which will also negatively contribute.
Although there are some things for self care that I am good at and usually do such as; eating
healthy and drinking water but I need to make time to improve on the other aspects! :)Mentor
2021-11-30, 12:35: Hey Cassidy! Great reflection! I think it's important to acknowledge (and I do
this myself a lot) that no one is perfect at self-care all the time. I've definitely gotten a lot
better at it since I started university but it takes constant practice throughout our life. Trying
to incorporate 1-2 things at a time can be helpful in setting yourself up for success with self-care
activities. That is, trying not to do all of the things at once, as it can be overwhelming! That's
great that you are drinking enough water and eating healthy as that can be half the battle
sometimes! What are some ways you can work on time management as you transition to university?
KatieMentee 2021-12-01, 16:46: Hey Katie. I definitely agree with that! To work on my time
management I need to schedule my activities better and try not to procrastinate as much. Definitely
for the transition into post secondary I will need to adopt new better study habits and decide
priorities for the workload!Mentor 2021-12-01, 23:43: Hi Cassidy! It can be a hard thing to adjust
to but when you're able to plan out your assignments and study time for tests it can make a big
difference in the end and be way less stressful! Would you like to discuss anything else in this
module? :) I hope you have a good week! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-12-03, 16:53: For sure:) it's
definitely a learning process but these strategies will be very helpful! I think I feel pretty good
now regarding this module topic and am good to move on to the next one if that works for you.
Thanks, I hope you have a good week too.Mentor 2021-12-04, 13:30: Hi Cassidy, That's great! I'm glad
you find them helpful :) Sounds good about starting a new module. I will unlock the next! Cheers,
Katie",,"Mentor 2021-10-01, 18:41: Hi Cassidy! My name is Katie and I will be your mentor for this year! It
is nice to meet you I see from your profile that you are interested in pursuing nursing as a career!
That is so awesome. I am a Registered Nurse and work in Kelowna, B.C. I also like to do outdoor
activities so it appears that we will have lots to discuss! Please feel free to ask any questions
you have along the way. To start us off I've chosen two of the above ice breakers for myself: 1.
Words to live by: ""Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know!"" This quote has helped
me overcome obstacles and achieve big goals in my life. 2. Public persona: I look up to Oprah for
all of the humanitarian endeavors that she takes on. I also admire her positive attitude and
ambitious spirit. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! KatieMentee 2021-10-04, 14:08: Hi there
Katie. It's nice to meet you:) I'm glad to hear that your a nurse and love the outdoors, definitely
sounds like we have a lot in common! - I would say my words to live by are; be appreciative of
everything (moments and possessions). Also respect yourself and others in all situations! where did
you go to university/college for nursing and what classes did u take? And what were your favourite
classes and experiences within those years? I look forward to talking more and getting advice from
you about nursing.Mentor 2021-10-05, 23:15: Hey Cassidy! Nice to meet you too! Love your words to
live by! I think those are both so important. I went to the University of British Columbia Okanagan
for nursing school and I took a bunch of classes ranging from Anatomy and Physiology to Advanced
clinical reasoning. It was a super fun degree and I highly recommend the program at UBCO. I really
enjoyed getting to know my peers and making friends in my cohort. That is probably my favorite thing
about nursing school. The program at UBCO is set up to have the same classes and clinical rotations
with your cohort as your progress throughout the four years so you get to know most people pretty
well! My favorite classes were probably clinical as well as I loved getting to know and work with
patients! Are you planning on applying to nursing school? If so, which one(s)? Do you have to
complete this mentorship as part of a requirement for school? Feel free to ask me any questions you
have about nursing school or nursing as a career, and when you're ready you can scroll down on the
bottom of this page and select some conversation topics that you'd be interested in covering :) Talk
soon! KatieMentee 2021-10-07, 15:49: Hi again:) oh wow that sounds really fun the courses you've
taken and that experience! I've definitely thought about UBCO as it seems like a great school but
I'm mainly thinking of going to the school in my area for nursing! It's called Selkirk college and
the program is affiliated with that of UVIC, I've already applied there and and also thinking about
UBC and UVIC as well. We are doing this e-mentoring program for our CLC class to get adive about now
and our education after school! Why did you decide to become a mentor on here. And how has ur
experience with it and others been so far? ~CassidyMentor 2021-10-11, 14:25: Hey Cassidy! I hope
you're having a great long weekend! I had some friends that went to Selkirk and they loved it! Such
a great program. It wouldn't be a bad idea to also apply to other schools just in case your first
choice didn't work out. UBC and UVic sound likes great options! I chose to pursue e-mentoring so I
could share some of my experiences with students who were trying to pursue similar education! When I
was graduating high school there wasn't anyone that I knew that had a science degree or was a nurse.
Looking back I think if I had had someone to give me advice I might have pursued nursing straight
out of high school vs. after I completed my science degree. What are you looking to get out of
mentoring? Do you have any other questions about nursing school or a career in nurisng? :) Cheers!
KatieMentee 2021-10-26, 00:20: Hi again Katie:) I am Hoping to learn more about what the nursing
program entails and what you found to be affective to be successful during school! Through this
program I would love to learn more about my future and the schooling that goes along with it, but
also my current schooling and it's importance! Are you now a licensed nurse work? If so what is your
favourite part about it and how does it differ from your original idea of it? Now that we've got to
communicate and learn a bit more about each other would you be interested in opening up one of the
modules? I'm not picky to which one but I would love to start talking about some of them!Mentor

have a moment please scroll down to the bottom of this page and select which Coversation Topics you
would like to discuss and then we can move on to those when you're ready :) Yes, I am a Registered
Nurse! My favorite part of my job is definitely connecting and interacting with patients. When I
first started nursing school I didn't have a good idea of what 'a nurse does'. Going through the
four years of nursing school provided me with lots of different experiences which gave me a better
idea of what I wanted to do in my practice and what area I wanted to work in. Once you select the
conversation topics let me know which one you'd like to start with and I will unlock it :) Cheers!
KatieMentee 2021-10-28, 21:52: My week is going great thanks! How about yours? That's great to know
that the schooling process really clarifies the uncertainty! And I also love working/helping others
so that's great to hear that that's also your favourite part:) I have looked through the
conversation topics and I think right now the most compelling conversation to me is the career
considerations one to learn more about the job and potentially other options in health care!Mentor
2021-10-29, 16:27: Hi Cassidy! My week is going great! I am looking forward to the weekend :) Do you
have any plans for the weekend? Thanks for picking some conversation topics you are interested in! I
think your school also requires that you complete these ones: Studying, Well-being and self-care,
Entering the job market, and Paying for school. Please select these ones as well and then we can
move on to the first module! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-03, 16:45: Nice:) My weekend was good just
worked and hung out with some friends for Halloween. I have those ones selected as well now! Thanks
for letting me know about that. I'm glad we can start a module now!Mentor 2021-11-04, 11:06: Hi
Cassidy! No problem! We can end this thread now and move onto a module :) Katie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yours. Finding inspiration is super important! You're right -- it allows people to have a drive to
accomplish something, and pushes them to be better. And totally okay if you haven't found your
passion for school yet. It's a big decision, but you have time to change if you find out that it's
not what you're into. My cousin is in marketing, and she loves her job. There's a whole lot of
things you can do with it, and she's looking into traveling for it! As for me -- I had no idea what
I wanted to be in high school and what I wanted to study. I considered sciences first -- I was
really into neuroscience and astronomy, so I thought either of those had been neat. I realized in
the second half of my grade 12 year that I really enjoyed political topics and I was pretty good at
writing, so I thought why not? There wasn't anything that really pushed me towards it, but it felt
like it fit. I have inspiration that has changed throughout school. I remember I was really inspired
by finding women of colour who were excelling in their fields, especially when they were of Asian
descent, and I realized that I just knew I really wanted to make a difference. I remember another
really important thing for me was watching Emma Watson's speech for HeForShe. This is the video
here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk I remember watching that at some point and being
like ""this is what I want to do"". Of course I have doubts. Bad marks can ruin your week, and some
can really transform what you think about what you're doing. It can be hard sometimes, but it's
handy to find new inspiration to help you keep going. I'm in the same boat as you -- I am a
perfectionist and I am really hard on myself sometimes. I was so driven by this need to not
disappoint others and myself that it was easy to lose sight of what I wanted to do for myself. I go
to therapy now when I need help in handling my emotions towards that, it can be tricky! It's okay to
have some kind of pressure on yourself, but I hope you take breaks and remind yourself that it's
okay to slow down and that it's okay to do things at your own pace. I was really bad at that in high
school. I'd be glad to share more about pressures and stuff like that too if you wanted to know
more. Mental health is really important to me! Have a look at the anchor text when you get a chance
and tell me what you think. Have a good weekend and take care, AvaMentee 2021-12-10, 15:26: Hi Ava,
Thanks for sharing that! From watching the video... I found it interesting how the one guy who
couldn't play hockey anymore, still had inspiration to keep in the hockey industry. He just had to
find another way to be involved I the sport he loves. Another Idea that I thought was cool was the
one person who said they only do things they are experienced in. This is important in making sure
what you are doing is true my authentic. Another person said that he believes that creation is
always an accident.You still have to do a lot of planning but what is important isn't planned. I
think it is important to stick to what you love doing because you have a greater chance at
succeeding. I found concept interesting because I think a lot of people try and play their futures
safe. I think a lot of people miss out on unique opportunities because they don't feel like what
they are good at is enough. If someone is very invested in something they should stick with it
because that's how one gets noticed. I have applied to some schools for marketing but that's not
exactly what I'm interested in right now. It might be because I don't have much experience in it.
Some things that I have thought about is design school because I have experience designing and
creating. I'm not exactly sure what I will end up doing, but I hope I find something that I am
passionate about because then I will be more driven to do well. Thank you for your responses. Brenna",,"Mentor 2021-11-21, 14:42: Hey Brenna! Here is the new conversation. Entering the Job Market -- one
that can be pretty scary! I'm in the Co-op program at UVic, which is a great experience, but finding
a job in my field, especially when I'm just starting out can be tricky. I've written plenty of
resumes, and that article in the anchor text pretty much lays out what I've learned. Even as a high
school student, you have so many skills that are applicable for jobs. As a student, you spend a lot
of time using skills that can be super important like those mentioned above: communication,
responsibility/dependability, quick learner, teamwork, and technology. Do you have any specific
examples in relation to these skills? I still use these skills on my own resume when I apply to
jobs. With communication, I spend a lot of time communicating with classmates and professors to keep
on track with work. For responsibility and dependability, group work requires me to take on a role
that others depend on me to finish. I have quick learning skills because I have had to adapt to new
situations to find something that works with me. As mentioned before, teamwork finds its way into my
life through group projects, and has taught me a lot about communication skills and sharing the
weight. Lastly, technology is something I use everyday, and I'm still learning new things that help
me do things faster. Obviously, you can apply these skills to things other than school too! Dance is
somewhere I formed a lot of these skills too. Anyways, that was a big info dump, but I'd love to
hear what transferable skills you have and how you can apply that to a job. I'm also open to
answering any questions you have about resumes and things like that. Hope your weekend was good,
AvaMentee 2021-11-22, 13:23: Hi Ava Thanks for opening the new conversation. I have been
volunteering at my Skating Club for about 10 years. I am a program assistant which means I help the
coach teach kids how to skate. To be able to work with kids you have to be good at communicating
because you need to direct kids and lead them through circuits. I have to work with the other
coaches to work through skill with the skaters (teamwork). I also work at a seniors home and I have
to be responsible for all the visitors entering the building. I have to make sure they have the
proper requirements for entering the building. To learn the job I had to be a quick learner because
the job required me to know the names of the residence. I had to be good with names and be able to
know who was asking me the questions at the front desk. I also have to be good at using technology
for school because most of the assignments are online now. Can you talk more about the co-op
programs you've done so for? And what you are planning to do this year? How long do the co-ops last
and do you get credits towards school? Do co-ops usually place you in the same area or would you
have to move areas to complete your co-op?",,,"Mentor 2021-11-01, 23:04: Hey Brenna, I have opened the conversation for ""From Rural to Urban"".
Whenever you feel like you're ready to start a new conversation, select the one you want and let me
know in your message that you're ready to move on. That way, I can just open it no problem, and I
hope that makes it easier for you! Sorry for the confusion. To answer your questions before, I am
from Calgary, Alberta -- not a small city. I almost went the opposite, as Victoria is a lot smaller
than Calgary is. Victoria is a lovely place! It is very welcoming, and there is a great sense of
community if that's what you're looking for. That's not to say that Calgary doesn't have a sense of
community. I grew up in the suburbs, and our community was great. For Victoria, the campus and
classes in general are great to get to know people and have that sense of community, especially in
first year. Now that I'm living off campus, I still feel like I'm part of that community when I'm at
school, and my neighbours here are lovely. Go ahead with the anchor text and we can carry on the
conversation :) Hope your week goes well (and that your weekend was great!), AvaMentee 2021-11-08,
13:38: Hey Ava, Thanks for opening the conversation. It’s good that you are loving the sense of
community in Victoria. It must have been different for you leaving a bigger city to a smaller one. I
hope to move to a more populated place to have a change of pace. I red the anchor text and will
answer the questions... Three things I like about living in a rural area would be the connection I
have with nature, the connection with most people with in the community and no commuting. I like
being able to go for walks right from my house into nature and being able to walk places. I feel
more cared about living in a small community because everyone knows everyone. I also like that most
shops are with in a small drive, but we lack a lot of stores that big cities have. Some things I
don’t like would be that there aren’t many places to go shopping, and there aren’t as many
activities as a big city has. Do you keep in touch with the people you went to high school with? How
did you keep your friendships when you moved away? What are your favourite things about living in a
big city? I also Selected the ""Engering the job market"" conversation for our next conversation.","Mentor 2021-10-25, 21:17: Hey Brenna! I opened the Conversation for Studying, and I will be
answering your questions that you send earlier here. I apologize for not opening it sooner and for
the confusion about opening a new conversation, I have been kind of scrambling with school deadlines
the last couple weeks. My studying methods have varied over the years, but I have formed an
organizational system for my habits. I don't know about you, but I can tend to be a huge
procrastinator. Deadlines can be daunting. It makes my life so much easier when I keep an active
calendar full of my assignment due dates. I also keep a Google Sheets document to organize my
readings that I need to do for my classes, and it really helps me stay on track. As for Political
Science, there is a lot of reading, which is why the organizational aspect is so important and so
helpful in prioritizing what I need to get done. What works best with me in Victoria is making sure
I take breaks in between studying. It's so easy to feel overwhelmed with what's going on with
school, so it's really important to me that if I dedicate a specific amount of time for studying, I
also leave room for breaks. It's a nice way to stay refreshed or to maintain self-care. Looking for
outlets for stress are important too -- running or walks are great. I love Victoria! I am so used to
snow and the cold of winter from living in Calgary, and the rain is a welcoming change. Living by
the sea is also nice, as I have been living around the mountains my whole life. It's nice to get a
change of scenary. You're lucky you've been here in the summer! I always have to go home. I don't
find that it gets boring -- there is always so much to explore and everybody always has new spots
they want to check out and sightseeing is so nice. I no longer live on campus, as they give priority
to first years, but instead, I live off campus with five roommates. It sounds like a lot, I know.
The housing on campus is great! It's so nice to live on campus and be able to walk to classes or the
library. When I was in first year, I did the majority of my studying in the kitchen of my apartment
cluster, or the library. There's also a building at UVic that is pretty much open all night, so
students monopolize that space for the night too! I find studying somewhere other than home can be
super helpful because it really allows you to focus. Now that I've opened the conversation (sorry
again), we can look at the videos and anchor texts. Some opening questions for you: what do you do
for studying? Is there anything you'll think you'll need to adjust for university? Have a good week!
AvaMentee 2021-10-26, 12:19: Hi Ava, Thanks for opening the conversation. I think I am the opposite
of a procrastinator which can also be a bad thing. I put so much effort into my projects for school
that I feel burnt out. I then waste the time I could be doing things I actually wanted to do. I
think I have to work on managing my time better and not putting so much focus on one topic. Like the
first video said, in order to study effectively you need to switch up topics in order to remember
things. When studying I will try and draw more pictures and diagrams. I usually rewrite my notes a
lot, but I think incorporating more pictures will help me. I think I will incorporate small study
sessions throughout units so I don't have to cram all the studying right before a test. The video
said that people who do this will spend less time studying overall because they still remember most
of the information. I think I will have to manage my time better when I go to university. I will try
and not put too much focus on one subject because I will fall behind in other topics. I will try and
use some of the strategies in the video now to prepare me for university. I willl try your tip about
starting a google sheet to organize my work. It will be important for me to take breaks and not
overwhelm myself. Thank you for the study tips BrennaMentor 2021-10-27, 23:08: Hey Brenna, Thanks
for sharing that! Sometimes it’s hard to admit or even acknowledge that we have issues in regard to
our habits. I know it took me a long time to admit that I had some issues studying, so props to you
for recognizing that. Burn out is so tough to deal with and I totally understand how you feel. I
think I’m going through a bit right now myself. Once again, it’s great that you recognize that!
Don’t be too hard on yourself. It takes time to adjust habits and it’s easy to slip into things that
you’re used to. As for the video, it’s kind of nice for me to rewatch it too and gain those insights
to studying. It’s also important to remember that while it gives advice, it’s also important to
figure out what works with you! If you think diagrams and pictures will work, give it a go. As for
cramming, I understand that too. It’s hard to balance everything, but time management really helps.
I’m glad you want to work on that. Sometimes it helps to plan out your day fully when you’re at a
busy time of your life — setting aside time for yourself to have moments of rest and moments to
grind out the work. If you have any more questions about studying, I’ll be glad to answer. If not,
we can complete the conversation and move on to the next conversation topic if you’d like! Let me
know what works, AvaMentee 2021-11-01, 14:00: Hi Ava, Thank you for sharing your strategies for
studying! Yes, we can start a new conversation if that works. I selected the rual to urdan
conversation. I'm not sure if I can open it though. I thought this would be a good one to go over
because I am from a small community and I hope to move to a more urban enviornment. I hope to learn
more about the process of moving and what the changes in life are when switching environments. Are
you from a small community in Alberta? If so, was it nice to move to a more populated city? Victoria
seems like a nice environment because it is very populated but it feels more welcoming than other
places I've visited. Most cities don't have many trees, but Victoria is very green which is nice! I
think I would want to move to a place like Victoria because I would still feel like I'm apart of a
community. Thank you Brenna","Mentor 2021-12-16, 14:26: Hey Brenna, I am so sorry for the late response. Finals have been busy and
I meant to respond to you earlier. Thank you for your responses to the last conversation, I really
enjoyed what you had to say. I agree with what you said on people missing out on unique
opportunities. I think people should try new things if they want to! As for your applications, I am
sure you'll find what works for you. It may take some time, but you've got this! I believe you
selected this as the next option for the conversation. Let me know if I got it wrong! I am once
again so sorry about the lack of responses on my end. I hope you're doing well. If this is the
conversation you selected, go ahead with the anchor text and let me know what you think! Have a good
week! AvaMentee 2021-12-17, 13:50: Hi Ava, I hope all of your tests went well! The text asks what
the difference between living in the land and studying the land. I think the difference is that when
you study the land you are focused on understanding the importance of it. When you live on land and
don't understand its history you don't have a strong connection with it. When I travel somewhere I
like to research the place because it gives me more connections with the area. Knowing the history
of land can make you feel more connected with the culture and the intentions of the people living
there. Where I live, there is history that most people who live here know. Our town is revolves
around a factory that most people who live here work for. It creates most of the jobs here so it
plays an important role in our community. The only reason this town exists is because of this
factory. It is important to understand your own community because it allows you to understand the
importance of certain things that allow you to live there. Im not sure if I answered the questions
right, but I tried. Happy Holidays Brenna",,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-02, 16:42: Hey! My name is Ava and I’m your mentor for this year! Here's a little bit
about me: I am currently in my third year at the University of Victoria studying Political Science.
I am also doing a minor in Global Development Studies. I am originally from Calgary, Alberta. I've
read your profile, and I saw that you figure skate! I used to dance before I left for school. Kind
of similar. I also did school abroad in high school, and have looked into it for university. I'm
considering going abroad for grad school or law school. With COVID, I wasn't able to do an exchange
term, but I'd love to discuss it with you! I'd really like to know more about you in general too. I
also saw that you're interested in pursuing fashion design, which I'm excited to know more about. Do
you have any favorite designers, or celebrities you enjoy looking to for inspo? I'm always a huge
fan of what Zendaya is wearing. How has school been for you so far? Also, don't feel like you need
to tell me more if you don't feel like it. This is all about what you need and what I can help you
with. Lastly, I was hoping you could tell me a little more about what you're looking for in a
mentor. I see that you're looking for a role model, so I'd like to know what that looks like and
what that means to you. If you have any questions for me, feel free to send them along and I will
try to answer them the best I can. Cheers, AvaMentee 2021-10-06, 16:35: Hi Ava, My name is Brenna, I
live in a small town in the Kootenays (BC). I’m not quite sure what I want to do after high school
but I know I want to travel at one point. I saw you are studying political sciences. What are you
hoping to do with your degree? Where did you go when you went abroad in high school? Where would you
want to go if you travelled in University? I’m thinking of taking a gap year to travel but if I’m
able to do school while I’m gone, that would be more productive. I would love to know more about
your travelling experience while focusing on school at the same time. Thank you for you time and
answering some questions! BrennaMentor 2021-10-07, 21:13: Hey Brenna! Thanks for the response! I am
hoping to get into law school after I finish my degree, but I’m sort of in the same boat as you —
I’d love to travel at one point before the rest of my life gets going. When I went abroad in high
school, I spent five weeks in Europe in the following cities: London, England; Paris, France;
Strasbourg, France; Gimmelwald, Switzerland; Munich, Germany; and Prague, Czech Republic. If I
travelled for university, I would have loved to go back to Europe — I really would love to go to
school in Edinburgh, Scotland. The options are really endless though! As for gap years, my roommate
here in Victoria did a gap year before coming to university. She travelled Europe and doesn’t have a
single regret about taking the gap year, so if you do want to take a gap year to travel, there’s
definitely nothing wrong with that! If you do want to do school while you’re gone, I can tell you a
bit more about my experience. Your travels will probably be different, but we spent short amounts of
time in each city. Managing school with travel was an interesting experience, as it called for a
shift in my time management compared to what I was used to in high school. I put myself on schedules
so I could have time to do work and sightsee. Time management is pretty crucial if you're
continuously traveling, and I know one of my regrets is not seeing more because I was a pretty
brutal procrastinator. However, I have no regrets about the trip overall. It was such a great
experience. Let me know if you have any more questions, AvaMentee 2021-10-20, 16:49: Hi again, Sorry
for not answering sooner. I've been quite busy. Thank you for the information about you travel
expierience. I was looking into travelling to London. Was it expensive for you to live there? What
was your favourite place you visited on your travels? I saw you wanted to travel to Scotland. I went
there when I was about nine months old. I obviously don't remember anything, but I apparently met a
lot of relatives. So when you travelled did you do your school online or in person? Did you go
alone? Did you have a job or would you get a job if you went back? I would love to hear more about
your experience in London. Were the prices high for food, and rent? Was there a lot to do? I'm
looking into travelling to London but I'm also looking into going to Italy. Honestly though, I don't
think I'm ready to travel that far from home. I don't think I could learn a new way of life, while
doing school by myself. Hopefully one year though! Recenly I've been thinking about going to
Interior design school, business or fashion styling school. I'm really into designing and creating
things. Would you be able to open a conversation for me? I'm not sure how this site really works but
my careers teacher said the mentor has to? Thank you for your responses! BrennaMentor 2021-10-22,
02:35: Hey, All good for the late response! It's a busy time of year for me too. My trip was
organized through the school, so I'm not totally sure about how much we paid for rent. I have got to
say my favorite place I traveled was the Swiss Alps. I grew up in Calgary, which isn't far from the
mountains, but the Swiss Alps are so much different for some reason. They're so picturesque it looks
fake. School for me when I travelled was in person. Work was done mostly on the laptop though, just
because of the traveling. I travelled with my class -- there was about forty of us with five
teachers. I think if I do end up going back, I would get a job because I'd plan on staying a lot
longer. For London, there was so much to do. We did all the touristy things: Buckingham Palace, all
the museums, the London Eye. There is so much to do and I would love to go back! It goes by so much
faster than you think it would. It's totally okay to not be that ready to travel far from home!
That's why I chose UVic for school now. It's not far from home, but it's far enough, if that makes
sense. All three of those options you listed are great. Some of my good friends are interior design
and in business! I have yet to meet somebody going to fashion school, but that would honestly be so
cool. Thanks for your response! I loved hearing back from you. I'll open the new conversation now.
AvaMentee 2021-10-25, 13:30: Hey, Your London trip sounds like it was really fun! Could you talk
about your studying methods in Victoria? Are you liking Political Science so far? Is there a lot of
studying that goes a long with it? What have you found works best when it comes to studying? I have
a brother in Victoria, and he says it rains a lot. How do you like the environment? When I went
there In the summer it was so pretty and I didn't want to leave. It is probably way different from
when I was there. Does it get boring after a while or is there a lot to do there? Are you living on
campus? If so is the housing nice? Do you do most of your studying in your room or do you go out to
other areas? What have you learned about studying through your years of experience? Thanks for the
information! Brenna",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-08, 17:27: Hi, Hope you're doing well! It's nice to hear from you. Your three things
about living in a rural area sound so great -- it must be nice to have such a strong sense of
community like that and being in touch with nature. Fair points about the bigger city though -- it
is kind of nice to explore what the city has. I keep in touch with friends from high school. I'm
living with some right now! Going back home, I tend to spend a lot of time catching up with them. It
also took me a bit to realize that it's not weird or anything to send them something like an
Instagram post or a TikTok and be like ""hey, this reminded me of you."" Staying in touch doesn't mean
you have to be in contact 24/7, but it's nice to have those people you can chat to whenever. When I
moved away, I did as I mentioned. Starting small conversations help. I know small talk is sometimes
not that fun, but it's a nice way to keep in touch and ask them how they're doing. Since a lot of my
friends moved away after high school, it was easy to make small talk like that because we were all
experiencing new and different things. As for my favorite thing about living in a big city, it's
kind of like what you said. It feels like there's no shortage of things to do. When I'm back home,
my friends and I try to find a restaurant we all want to try, or even just explore the city in
general. I'm always looking for new experiences, and you never know what will be your new favorite
thing unless you try it! Thanks for selecting the next conversation. Maybe we can chat a bit about
this video if you'd like and then we can move onto 'Entering the Job Market'! I thought this was a
cool video (I'm really into movies and film and I'm always exploring new sorts of media), and I
think it's an interesting way to draw parallels between rural and urban living. Some questions for
you: How did you feel watching the video? Was there anything that stuck out for you? And for moving
away: What are you nervous about for moving away? What do you think will be the biggest change or
challenge? What are you looking forward to if you do make that change to a bigger city? Cheers,
AvaMentor 2021-11-18, 15:46: Hey Brenna! Hope you're doing well! I haven't heard from you in a
while, so I was just wondering how you're doing. I'm sorry I haven't messaged to check in sooner,
school for me has been really busy. I'm sure it's the same for you! If you get the chance to reply
to the message before, let me know! We can move onto the next conversation once you do. Cheers,
AvaMentee 2021-11-18, 20:48: Hi Ava, Thank you for checking in! Sorry I haven’t responded in a
while. I left for Vancouver last Tuesday the 9th and got stuck there because of all the flooding. I
am actually in the car now finally driving home. We had to go through the States because all of the
roads out of Vancouver are closed. It was crazy! Anyways to answer your questions about the movie...
When I watched the video I realized how different living in a city can be from on a Rural area. It’s
a complete change of pace. In a rural area it seems you have a lot more freedom in nature where a
city has a lot more social interaction. In both scenarios the people seem happy where they are. I
guess it depends on what kind of life style one is looking for. For moving away...I am most nervous
about navigating myself around a new place. I think the biggest change will be that I won’t have
immediate help from family like I have now. I am however excited to get out of my small town and try
a new lifestyle! Thank you for checking in, BrennaMentor 2021-11-21, 14:32: Oh no! I'm glad to hear
you're doing okay, but yeah, I could imagine that would be stressful. I can't believe the flooding,
it's been so crazy. I hope you made it home okay! I'm glad to hear that you're excited to start a
new lifestyle and try new things even though there are things you are afraid of, that takes guts to
admit! I'll open the next conversation now. Ava","Mentor 2021-11-24, 18:54: Hi, Figured we should start on the next anchor text! Working with kids is
fun! I did that in high school too, and it's a great experience. Same thing with the seniors' home,
it seems you have gained some really important experience from both of those jobs. Look at you go!
And yeah, online school also pushed me to do a lot of more things like that too. Big adjustments in
our lives with these really weird times. As for your questions about the co-op programs, you start
at UVic in Co-op after (or during? I can't totally remember) your second year. UVic has one of the
best Co-op programs in the country apparently, so it's really neat! I unfortunately have not gotten
the opportunity to have a job for co-op yet. I applied to tons during second semester last year for
a job in the summer and it didn't work out -- hiring processes during COVID was weird and a lot of
students ended without jobs. This year, I'm hoping to get a Co-op this summer. I think I'll have a
better chance this year with COVID calming down a bit and now that I'm an upper year I hope they'll
give me a chance! Co-ops are usually a semester long, but some can be extended. A lot of the ones I
applied for last summer had the opportunity to be extended into the fall too. UVic's Co-op program
is really neat because there are opportunities everywhere. I applied to plenty in Victoria, but
there were also remote jobs, some in Calgary where I'm from, and others across the country. Usually,
there is also the chance to do international ones. I think doing an international one would be such
a neat experience. You do get credits for school! It's really neat, but if you complete a certain
amount of co-op terms, you'll get a Co-op thingy on your diploma. If you don't complete that number,
you get 'Work Experience' which is still good! Other than that, the school has a training course for
Co-op students and it was a lot of help. It taught me a lot of things about what I should be doing
or how to properly write my resume or how to act in an interview. If you ever wanted to check out
UVic and its co-op programs (it varies on the different studies), I've included the link:
https://www.uvic.ca/coopandcareer/index.php Let me know what you think of the anchor text and video,
and I feel like I've said lots this time around, so I'll tell you about my interview experiences
after you do so. Maybe select your next choice for a conversation too! We're moving quick. Have a
good rest of your week, AvaMentee 2021-11-29, 00:24: Hi Ava, Thanks for the information about
co-ops. That's cool that UVIC has the best co-op programs in the country. I hope you get one this
year! From watching the video I realized that all aspects of a good interview are based on being
professional. You should always go to an interview prepared. Have short answers and stories prepared
for the questions they might ask. It is important to never answer with one word. Short stories or
experiences will make you memorable. You should also always ask a question at the end of an
interview because it shows your interested in learning.At the same time you want to do research
before hand. Research the companies your applying for because you don't want to be asking questions
that you could have answered yourself with research. I would love to hear about a interview
experience you've had! I chose ""Finding inspiration"" as the next conversation. Have a good week!
BrennaMentor 2021-11-30, 18:37: Hey! Thanks for the good wishes! You're absolutely right -- you
should be prepared for an interview. It may seem tedious, but it actually helps a lot if you have a
general idea of what you can say for questions. A lot of the time, they ask for examples, so stories
are great! And yes, asking questions at the end of an interview is always great too. It's also an
important time for you to learn things too if you have any questions about what your role would be
like, so research is important! As for an interview experience I've had, it was for a co-op last
summer. I did prepare and research lots, but I still felt unprepared! I tend to get pretty nervous
and it was a panel interview, but I learned my lesson. Preparing and research are so important for a
good look for an interview. It leaves a good impression. Nerves are normal too, but for next time, I
hope I don't end up in a mess like I was. I have opened the next conversation, so maybe you can get
it started this time! If I'm slow on the replies this week, it's because the end of my semester is
coming soon. Just wanted to let you know! Cheers, AvaMentee 2021-12-03, 17:09: Hi Ava, Thanks for
the interview example! It looks like the new conversation wasn't opened up on my side. It still has
the work experience conversation text. I think I chose finding inspiration as my next conversation.
I think having inspiration for anything we do is important. With Figure skating, having famous
skaters to look up to helps to achieve new goals. I always looked up to Patrick Chan because he was
always so graceful and I wanted to be able to skate like him. As I get as a skater I was recognized
for my elegance on the ice and I wouldn't have been able to achieve this skilll without the
inspiration. Having inspiraron allows people to have a drive to accomplish something. I have applied
to marketing for some schools but I'm not sure if that's what I want to do because I haven't found a
passion for it. I feel like having some inspiration would help me. Maybe I could research more jobs
that come out of the degree so I can look forward to something. Why did you want to start your
degree? Did you have something inspiring to make you want to follow this path? Has your inspiration
changed throughout school? Do you sometimes have doubts about the path you chose? Setting high
expectations can be tough to deal with as well. I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed at
everything I do. I think it's because I have inspiration for many aspects of my life and I want to
live up to them. It's important to realize that life changes and we all have our own lives to live.
Living up to someone or something may look different than your expectations. Do you set high
expectations? Happy studying and good luck on your tests! Brenna",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-20, 13:15: Hey Brenna, Thanks for the well wishes! I have one more today, so we'll
see how that goes. As for your answers on the first part of the conversation, thank you for your
thoughts! It's alright if you don't think you answered the questions right -- I think for this any
answer works. This is about you learning more, and as long as you feel alright about that, that's
what matters! I agree with you. Researching and knowing history of the land allows you to feel more
connected with whatever place you are. And thank you for sharing about your town's history! I agree
with you. It is important to understand your own community because it allows for that understanding
of why we are living there. As for the idea that “scientific” knowledge and “traditional” knowledge
in conflict with each other -- that's always bothered me. I think it's important to reflect on both.
You can learn so much more that way. As for this section on Different Ways of Knowing, the TED talk
was interesting! My schooling experience in high school back home did not share much about
Indigenous knowledge, and luckily, university has allowed me to shift that. Challenging my own
biases and attitudes towards learning is something I'm always wanting to grow. How did the TED Talk
make you feel? How do you feel about the Seven Teachings? I hope your December break is full of rest
and love! Take care and happy holidays, Ava",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's what I can help with! MichelineMentee 2021-12-06, 13:13: Hey Micheline, for post-secondary I
am considering either taking a gap year to travel Canada and save money, or the more likely option
is that I would get my associate's degree of science at my local college so I can save money while
studying by staying at home, etc... and after that, transfer to UVIC to hopefully get a degree in
marine biology and work/study on Vancouver Island.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1047514156,1047541071,9/23/2021 12:32,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-25, 14:36: Were you able to explore the different sites that the anchor text
provided? I thought these sites were quite great, and to be honest, I didn't access these sites when
I was deciding on post-secondary schools but I feel like they would've been very helpful if I knew
about them, especially the Work BC Career Compass because it gives so much info about possible
careers. I noted on your profile that you were also wanting to be an electrician, and I noticed on
the Career Compass that they have some info available for that. Did you find that to be helpful? I
did complete a Bachelor's degree, but I can try to answer some of your questions related to
certificates/diploma programsMentee 2021-10-26, 17:32: I was able to look through the website and it
was very helpful. I will definitely look at if I have a possible career in mind. The information is
very clear and easy to understand which is very nice.Yes, the information on electrician's was very
helpful for my future. One question I have about a degree is how stressful was it while taking the
courses? like did you ever feel overwhelmed?Mentor 2021-10-26, 21:31: Yes, I was definitely
overwhelmed when I completed my undergrad. Not to scare you, but I do just want to be honest about
my experience. I think that biggest struggle is time management. Unlike high school, you get no
class time to work on assignments. What you get for a schedule is you lecture time and the entire
time the prof will just well lecture haha but that means that there is a lot of time where you are
working independently. And on top of that is just balancing normal life stuff like cooking meals
(since I was living away from home), getting enough sleep and rest. I have to admit I was super
focused on my grades so I didn't really partake in a lot of extra curriculars. But I know many
people who were able to manage extra curriculars (like sports) or have a part time job, and still do
well in their courses. It's all in figuring out how to time manage and what all you can handle, and
making sure you don't stretch yourself too thin.Mentee 2021-10-28, 13:22: I really appericate the
honesty. It definitely didn't scared me away from the idea. The idea of needing to figure out and
get time management under my belt is exciting to me. I will also make sure to play sports to since
thats a big part of my life that keeps me grounded. Again I really appericate the honesty with how
your experience is and will make sure I get a plan for my days under my belt early into the semester
or beforehand.Mentor 2021-10-29, 23:08: I'm glad you apprecited my honesty. I thought it was better
than being blindsided. I do admire your outlook in terms of finding challenges exciting! But
definitely make sure you are adding in your schedule things that you love doing so you dont go
completely crazy haha, and mentally preparing yourself for what's to come is helpful, even if you
don't have an exact plan before starting, and it is kind of hard to have an exact plan without
having experiencing what the workload is like first. I hope that makes sense. If you don't mind me
asking, have you decided on what school(s) you'll be applying to? Or are you going to take a gap
year?Mentee 2021-11-01, 11:26: I will definitly try to prepare my mind for what it will be like even
if I have no idea what it is like. I have a few friends at Uni so I know I can ask them what to
expect too which will help me prepare. I have applied to UVIC right now, but I might take a year off
to travel and work. It will just depend on a few factors.Mentor 2021-11-02, 02:30: Yes definitely
ask your friends what their experiences are like because it's different for everybody so it's good
to get a different perspectives. And nice! I heard UVic is a pretty great school. But yes whatever
you decide, it should be good. I personally didn't take a gap year before my undergrad, but I am
currently taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school right now. It is also a very good idea
to just relax and get some life experiences. If you dont have any more questions or anything else
you want to discuss in this topic, we can move on to the next conversation. From my understanding,
your teacher would prefer if you stick to the conversations that was initially selected, but she
doesn't mind if you just pick whichever one you want, as long as we do 4 in total before your class
ends.Mentee 2021-11-04, 13:08: That's why I want to take a year off is to gain those experiences and
lessons that I will always carry with me. I don't have any more questiopns with this topic so we
could move on. I don't care what our next topic is at all too.Mentor 2021-11-04, 22:37: That sounds
like a great plan! Sorry, I think there is another set of anchor text within this conversation, so I
think we can move on to that first before choosing a new conversation.",,,"Mentor 2021-11-24, 02:31: Hopefully you find this topic that I chose useful! Figuring out your study
method is so important but of course that will take some time and it could even vary depending on
the classes you take. Kinda like that video said, your notes, or in general your study methods, in a
math class will be different than a history class. Personally, one thing that helped me is
definitely not cramming. I know that's such a cliche but I found it effective and it was overall
just less stressful. Not gonna lie, but my study habits kinda went down the drain during COVID
because it was tough doing online school so I've experienced both paced learning and cramming. But
keeping on top of things is a lot of work because you have to keep up with several classes in terms
of the lecture material for exam studying and on top of that you'll most likely have assignments and
papers that'll take up your time too. But when I was at the ""peak"" of my study habits, I would have
the class readings done before the lecture or at least within the same week as the lecture, and I
try to take notes from the textbook if I think it will be useful, which depends on the class. Then
during the lecture, I prefer writing my notes down on paper. Most profs have a powerpoint
presentation during the lectures which they make available to the students. So if I know the slides
will be available I dont write them down, I focus on what the prof is saying. Then I aim to do the
following within the week of that lecture: I will type up the lecture notes and insert my own
written notes in the same document. Then from this notes document, I will make flashcards. And I
just keep adding to this doc and making flashcards with every lecture. So closer to the exam date,
like a week or two if possible, I can start going through my notes and flashcards and everything is
all organized. Hopefully that makes sense! How about you, what are your current study habits? Was
there anything from the video that you already do, and is there anything you wish to do?Mentee
2021-11-25, 14:03: Right now my study habits differe from class to class with my math course and
chemistry class being mainly practice questions over and over to following understand what I am
doing. for my english course I mainly re-read over texts to remeember what the points it is making.
I will study the night before a test and then quickly the morning of the test. Other then that I
mainly just do my work in class and whatever else I have to after school, and I will ask questions
on whatever I don't understand. I found the video interesting, but what helped me the most was how
you explained that if the professor makes the powerpoint presenation avalible that you don't write
down anything it says and will focus on what the prof is saying. I never thought about that, but I
will remember it so once I am at uni I do that. so thank you so much for piece of imformation!Mentor
2021-11-26, 01:14: That's really awesome to hear that you already have those study habits while in
high school because they will be necessary once in uni, and again I'm also glad that you're one of
those people that are not afraid to ask for help! Honestly, a lot of profs even appreciate the
questions because it shows that you care and you're putting in the effort to try and understand
things. But no worries at all! I'm glad I was able to share that because I found it to be an
efficient way to do things and most profs do expand quite a bit from what they have on their slides.
So just bringing back my previous question, was there anything from the video that you wish to try
out even while you're still in school now or you when you start uni?Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:16: I
think the thing I will take from the video is to break down how to do questions. In math I will
usually following alone and understand how to do it then, but doing homework I get stump a good
amount. So I will try to take better notes breaking down the steps to the formulas and why to do
that way.Mentor 2021-12-02, 02:12: That's awesome that you're able to take that away from the video
and use it in school now! I would recommend watching the video again when you start uni just to pick
up more tips that would be specific to your class. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss in
this topic or anything you were curious about in terms of my study habits? If there isn't anything
else, we can move on to the next topic. Let me know which one you would like to do next. Definitely
not rushing you thouMentor 2021-12-02, 02:12: Mentee 2021-12-02, 13:20: One question I have is when
you were in Uni, did you take study breaks? if so how long were they? How did you schedule
them?Mentor 2021-12-03, 15:10: That's a good question! Honestly, I don't think I necessarily took
scheduled study breaks. Usually my breaks would come when I was having a meal, in between classes if
it was a short amount of time that I wouldn't have enough time to get into something, or at the end
of the night. I was pretty bad for giving myself breaks, and even worse for feeling guilty when I
took them. But of course, I shouldn't have and definitely allowing yourself breaks is a must for
your own well-being! I wish I had a better answer but I was really too pre-occupied with getting
good grades to cut myself some slack. One thing I always tried to do though is make sure I eat
enough and I get a decent amount of sleep. But yeah, sorry I wish I had a better answer. I do think
it's awesome that you are thinking of that because breaks are a must, whether it be to work out,
watch a show, or even just chilling on the couch doing nothing for a little bit to give your brain
the break it deserves. I'm not sure if you've heard of the Pomodoro method though? It's when you set
a timer, for example 45 minutes, and you do as much as you can in that time. Then once that timer
goes off, you take the next 10-15 minutes to just have a break, then set the timer again for 45 for
work and you just keep cycling through. I know that's a pretty effective method for a lot of people.
I've tried it a few times and it was really nice and it made me feel quite productive.Mentee
2021-12-06, 11:59: Your answer was still good! I have heard of the Pomodoro Method, and have tried
it myself. I found that it worked well and felt productive too. I will definitely make sure I take
brain breaks when study too. I know I could Just oush through it, but I will be very mentally
drained if I do that. And getting enough sleep and eating the right food are important on how well
you can study, so I will make sure I do that tooMentor 2021-12-06, 23:55: Yea, there's so many other
study methods, but unfortunately I did not use one so I don't have one to share. It is only a quick
Google search away if you're interested in others like the Pomodoro method. But definitely learn
from my mistakes haha to make sure to take breaks! Sometimes when you're on a roll, it makes more
sense to just keep going. But sometimes I found myself easily distracted, not able to focus or if
I'm writing, unable to add anything to the page. That is usually a sign for me to take a break. And
most of the time, breaks even help you work better, like that advice I'm sure you've heard where
you're supposed to walk away from something you're writing. Once you come back to it, you're
refreshed and hopefully energized to work again. I think that's another thing to keep in mind, what
are your ""warning"" signs that signal you need a break?Mentee 2021-12-09, 14:06: yea I remember
hearing this somewhere, I cant place it exactly, but it was just how even though you are working and
mkaing progress to a write or whatever, juts how much of that progressis positively affectly your
work. I know I've had times where my progress actually put me a few steps back and in reality were
pointless things to do. I thought of that because of how you mentioned being on a roll but knowing
when to take abreak to refresh your mind. I definitely will take your advice and make sure to take
breaks!Mentor 2021-12-11, 01:22: Yea totally, sometimes you end up forcing the work whether it be
because it's due soon or you had planned to get it done at a certain time since you have other
things planned. But yea in a way it can be counterproductive because you can be doing something more
useful/something else that is still productive in its own way (for example mental health break,
working out, cleaning your room/house) instead of just forcing it. It's really about balance, which
is such a cliche and it's easier said than done, but just knowing when you need to stop which is
partially knowing yourself as well and those ""warning signs"".Mentee 2021-12-13, 11:48: It definitely
is about finding the right balance, and I know that it will come in trial and error to find the
right balance between school work and taking a break. I will try to find the balance that works best
for me at start of school, so I have it under my belt when it comes to studying for mid terms and
finals.Mentor 2021-12-14, 00:13: Yes that is a good mindset and a good plan! I feel like we should
at one point do the ""self-care and well-being"" conversation as I think you would find it
interesting! Was there anything else you were curious about or wanted to share?Mentee 2021-12-14,
17:10: No, I don't have anymore questions. The self-care and well-being topic sounds like a good one
to cover!Mentor 2021-12-17, 22:37: Okay, I will unlock it for us!Mentee 2022-01-10, 11:58: Sounds
good!Mentor 2022-01-10, 22:29: I have unlocked it :)",,,,"Mentor 2021-12-17, 23:33: So I think we've covered a bit of this during our last conversation but I
think the resources here are really interesting and could be really helpful. I can't quite remember
if I pointed this out already, so I apologize if I have but one thing that was a good reminder for
me on the article is that there are mental health resources avaible within most universities. For
example, we have a wellness centre in our university where there are counsellors available for us to
speak with and the fees for that are built right into the student fees. So definitely take advantage
of that! How would you rate yourself for basic self-care (you don't have to give a number rating
haha)? But are there also other things you do for self-care aside from the basic ones listed
above?Mentee 2022-01-11, 17:26: One thing I do, or try to do is journal everynight. I will write
about how my day was, or what thoughts were weighing on my mind that day. By writing it down it
helps me process it and allow me to forget about it. I excrises daily, and try my best top stay
hydrated too. One thing I should do better for my well being is not spening my spare time as time to
scroll on social media. I know it causes my anxiety, but I still do it.Mentor 2022-01-12, 18:32: I'm
honestly very happy that you've shared that you journal every night! As someone who learnt about the
benefits of journalling, it's so cool to hear about someone doing it in real life, and I'm sure
you've seen the benefits otherwise you wouldn't still be doing it. Even more, as someone who seems
to really care about their physical health, it's awesome to know that the mental health is not
neglected which is usually the case. I hope you are able to keep up with that even your schedule
gets busy with uni. I think we can all spend 5 minutes out of our day just to process and spend time
with our thoughts. I know I need to remind myself of that constantly! I struggle with the same thing
with just mindlessly scrolling through social media. Today is actually my first day of just trying
to stay off of it and it's not as bad as I thought and I honestly feel more productive! And it is so
true that many of our anxieties can come from being bombarded by not so healthy things on social
media. So again, I commend you for being aware of that! Have you taken some steps to get off social
media recently?",,"Mentor 2021-09-25, 16:36: Hey there, I'm Jihanne I'll be your mentor for the next few months. I just
recently graduated with a degree in psychology. I read in your profile that you were hoping to be
matched with an athlete. Unfortunately I am not an athlete. But I hope we can connect on other
things! What other extra curricular activities do you participate in?Mentee 2021-09-28, 18:40: Hi
Jihanne, I'm Eamon. I'm excited for this experience with the mentor problem. I can't wait to see
what I can learn from you too! It is complete okay if you are not an athlete, and I'm sure we can
find common ground somewhere else. Most of my extra curricular activities are sport and fitness
based, but I do enjoy reading autobiographies of success people and learning how to ""conquor"" the
mind. What other activites do you do?Mentor 2021-09-28, 21:52: That's pretty interesting about
conquering the mind. It's probably not the same thing, but when I read that, the first thing I
thought of was mindfulness, have you looked at that at all? In my free time, I like to play guitar
and read books too (used to be mostly fictional but now I'm reading more psych-related lay
books).Mentee 2021-10-06, 15:44: Yea it's kinda like mindfulness, but it's more just pushing pass
the mind in anything different I guess is the best way to describe it. Like when you are running and
you want to stop since it's getting really hard to keep the pace but instead you conquer and keep
running. Like it's just understanding that the mind will quit before the body does and when you know
that you can keep pushing through the pain and let it make you stronger minded. I hope that makes
sense. I always wanted to learn how to play the guitar but every time I try I give up to soon so one
day I'll get it fullyMentor 2021-10-07, 00:24: Yes that makes sense. It's really something you can
apply to anything you want to achieve. Sometimes we're our own worst enemies, so that's really
admirable that you're trying to achieve that level of control and determination. And I get that with
playing guitar, it can be tricky and frustrating that makes you just want to quit. What really
helped me stick to it is trying to learn songs I really like as opposed to just learning individual
chords. I found that to be a good motivator and quite satisfying once I can play the song. And you
end up just learning new chords with new songs you try to learn.Mentor 2021-10-07, 00:24: Did you
have any questions for me, or do you want to try going through the program?Mentee 2021-10-15, 17:21:
Yea, one day I know I will figure out for sur show to play it. It's one of those things that I could
play for myself or others too which would be fun for both cases. I don't really have any more
questions, but if you have any please ask away!Mentor 2021-10-15, 23:38: I don't have any questions
right now either, so should we get started? I think we're meant to be doing the following
conversations: Studying, Well-being and self care, Entering the job market, Career Considerations,
Post Secondary Considerations, and Paying for school. Which one do you want to start with?Mentee
2021-10-20, 15:24: Yea I'm down to get started. I think starting with Post Secondary Considerations
is a good place to start.Mentor 2021-10-20, 19:25: Okay, sounds good. Let me know when you're done
reading the ""working through this program"" section and then I'll unlock that first conversation for
usMentee 2021-10-21, 13:14: Read through and reading to start",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-04, 22:56: That article for 20 differences between high school and university is
really great because it does list a lot of important differences. I honestly have been in uni for so
long that I almost forgot that that wasn't how it was back then, so I'm glad this article exists! I
wish I read this before going into my first year! What did you find most surprising from the
article? The other article too has some great tips for setting up for success. One thing that I do
strongly agree with is not being afraid to ask for help, whether it be from a professor or
librarians or advisors. Although I did say before that there is a lot of independent study time,
that doesn't mean that people aren't there to help because they most definitely are, you just need
to ask. The other thing was about your syllabus and making sure you have a calendar/planner and have
all the important dates marked. If you want, I can elaborate on the syllabus for you. Just let me
know!Mentee 2021-11-08, 12:36: I found both articles very helpful. From the first article I found
the how important the student council is to the school. In high school its always been fro planning
events, but at university it hold a lot of power in health and resources for the student population.
I definitily agree with you on the imposrtance of asking for help. I know some people who are to
proud and stubborn to assk for help. All it does is hold back what yoiu are capable of achieveing. I
will make sure to ask for help on anything I need clarifying on. I don't fully underatqand what a
syllabus is, so if you don't mind I would grealty appericate your explanation of it!Mentor
2021-11-08, 22:28: That's great that you found the articles helpful! And yes in our school we have
NUGSS (Northern Undergraduate Student Society) and just like the article says they are responsible
for our health plan and they organize tons of events for students. I am happy to hear that you are
open to asking for help. I totally agree with you that sometimes other people's pride get in the way
of them helping themselves. For sure. Unfortunately, I do not have a syllabus I can send a picture
of, but I will try to explain as much of what I can remember. So usually the very first day of
classes, you will receive a syllabus for each class. In there, you can find a lot of important
things. - It will give the prof's information including their email and their office number. It may
even have their teaching assistant's email. - It will also indicate the prof's office hours. So like
I mentioned before during class hours, the profs just lectures and you can ask questions during or
after the lecture. But if you have more in depth questions, you're more likely going to have to go
to their office hours which is usually a couple hours once a week where you can go to their office
and ask for help on anything. - Then on the syllabus, there is also the reading list. Usually profs
will try to cover 1 chapter from the textbook each week and so the syllabus will tell you what
chapter they will be discussing in class and you can decide to read the assigned readings before the
lectures or after the lectures as the article said. - Another important part of the syllabus are the
dates. So right off the bat, you will know when your exams (midterms), quizzes, papers, and/or
assignments will be due. I highly recommend getting a physical calendar or planner or if you prefer
electronic calendars and take the time when you get all your syllabi to write down all the important
dates for each of your classes - Most of the time the syllabus will have a short or in depth
description of the papers and assignments you'll have to complete. Sometimes profs will provide a
more in depth criteria closer to the due date of the assignments/paper. - Sometimes it will even
mention what the exams will contain. Some profs test on both textbook material and lecture material.
Some profs tests only on lecture material. It may also indicate the format of the exam (multiple
choice, short answer, long answer questions, definitions, matching, essay questions) I think that's
about it... Or at least all I can remember off the top of my head. Did that make sense?Mentee
2021-11-15, 11:56: Yup that made complete sense! Thank you so much fro the explaination. I
definitely will get a calender to mark donw those dates so I will never be surprised when it comes.
I am really thankful for the explanation because I would never thought of what it was.Mentor
2021-11-15, 22:45: Yes, no worries at all! I'm glad it made sense and you found it helpful! Did you
have any other questions? Or would you like to move on to the next conversation? Let me know what
you decideMentee 2021-11-22, 11:50: Thank you again for the explanation! I don't have anymore
questions either and I'm ready for the next conversationMentor 2021-11-22, 13:06: You're very
welcome! Which conversation would you like to do next?Mentee 2021-11-23, 17:19: I'm completely down

look through the material and reflect on some of the questions. Of course, you jot down some ideas
or follow up questions that you would like to discuss with me further.Mentee 2021-11-08, 13:44: What
are some of your strategies and habits for studying?Mentor 2021-11-08, 14:26: Great question!
Throughout my experience in highschool and university, I have tried many different strategies. Have
you heard of quizlet? I attached a link here. Quizlet is an online platform, and app, where you can
create flashcards to help you study. There is also a database of flashcards made by other students
that you can use. To get the best results, and to reinforce my learning, I added flashcards to my
quizlet account after every single class. Following this, I would review them every weekend. It is
awesome to have the app handy when you are in a waiting room, or in line as it is much more
productive than scrolling social media (although I am guilty of that as well). As a side tip, I
reccomend reviewing the cards using 'learn' mode! I found that this technique greatly helped me when
it came to writting the test as it forced me to review the content several times. How far in advance
do you normally prepare for a test?Mentee 2021-11-09, 12:06: Sweet! ive used it in my online courses
to help better understand concepts it is very useful i agree! Well, usually i don't really prepare
for tests, I've kind of just understood the concepts and went on to the test. If i do not know any
of the concepts, I will study until I get the concepts enough, which is not as great of a habit as i
would like.Mentor 2021-11-11, 10:43: It's great to be honest about that, thanks Ben! I can relate to
not feeling the need to study for tests here and there; however, in University it becomes a lot more
difficult to 'wing it', which is why it is good practice to get into the habit now. Will you be
applying to university next year? How about your note-taking skills? Do you feel that you have a
solid method that works for you?Mentor 2021-11-11, 10:45: If you watched the above video titled '6
habits of highly sucessful students', how likely is it that you will try some or all of these
strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these
strategies?Mentee 2021-11-18, 15:46: I definetly will be implementing some of these strategies in my
studying, especially the spaced out learning. I feel like it is important to not do all of the
studying at once and rather to spread it out so you have time to process. What would get in the way
would definetly be how many classes i am having and my stress levels, but once learned I will be in
a very good position to suceed in my studying. I will be applying to university this year and I
believe my note taking is actually quite good! Do you follow these six habits?Mentor 2021-11-23,
10:10: That's awesome! I really appreciate your detailed response I too believe that spaced out
learning is one of the the most important ones. Switching between subjects is also ultra helpful
during university when you have many topics to study each day. What strategy seems the most
challenging to you?Mentee 2021-11-30, 12:23: The most challenging for me would be the elaboration
strategy since once I know the concepts I just go along with them, I dont exactly elaborate on them
or ask how or why to myself, which would be a cool thing to know why we learn certain things. It is
pretty easy to connect concepts together though, and I find them easy to understand in a broad
perspective.Mentor 2021-12-01, 18:10: Asking critical questions can be difficult, but it is
definitely important. It's awesome to be mindful of your strengths and weaknesses! Thanks for
sharing. Would you like to start on our next conversation? If so, which one interests you
most?Mentee 2021-12-06, 13:22: A conversation I would love to talk about would be entering the job
market. I've always been interested in how hard it is to get a job and what you want to look for in
companies morals, wages, etc.Mentor 2021-12-10, 16:39: Awesome, I will finish this conversation and
we can get started on 'entering the job market'. It is great that you are considering the morals of
a particular workplace - I think it is something that can easily be overlooked or forgotten. I am
excited to dive into this topic together!",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-27, 15:11: Hey Ben! My name is Sarah, I recently graduated from UBCO with a degree in
Biochemistry. You and I have been paired through ReMBC for this semester and I am reaching out to

avid outdoor enthusiast who loves mountain biking in the summer/fall, and skiing in the winter. I
also really enjoy avocado toast, coffee, and audiobooks. Next on my bucket list is to travel around
Europe. My grandparents moved to Canada from Italy, bringing with them the wonderful cultural
knowledge. Growing up, I was fortunate to learn their authentic recipes. My personal favourite is
Neapolitan pizza! I look forward to hearing from you soon. All the best, SarahMentee 2021-10-20,

including the golden state warriors, charlotte hornets and (College team) Michigan state spartans!
Do you cross country ski and downhill?Mentor 2021-11-02, 17:09: No way! Golden state is my favourite
team too - I love Steph Curry! I downhill ski &amp; snowboard at my local hill. This year I thought

here on eMentor. I hope your day is going lovely so far! I peeked at your profile this morning, and
I am super happy we have lots and lots in common. From reading what you wrote, I hope to be able to
provide you with the knowledge and life advice you need to be successful in your career choices and
personal life. I wanted to send you an email first to say how excited I am to be getting to know you
for a couple of months! When you have time, please take a look at this week's prompt and let me know
if you have any questions about how this will go. :) Looking forward to hearing back from you! xx
JennyMentee 2021-09-27, 13:33: Hello Jenny, I am excited to be connected with you! I read over your
profile and am super interested in your goal to become a gynecologist and your motivation being to
better this place for women. I thought of pursuing a career in gynecology due to the poor medical
care I unfortunately recieved over the past 3 years. Both men and women have different bodies and
with that comes unique complications, doctors in the past have told me that if they discovered what
was wrong with me sooner- i wouldn't be suffering their consequences today. I want to be able to
give women but especially young women a loud voice for all their healthcare needs. However, money
has always been a large determinator in my life and has turned me away from a few other career ideas
in the past. I find it difficult not to stress about how I'll pay for schooling and the idea of
putting myself in debt gives me great anxiety. I am anticipating the advice you may have to share
with me! Sincerely, Megan :3Mentor 2021-09-29, 17:01: Good morning, Megan! Happy to hear you are
also excited! Thank you for sharing me your story, Megan. I totally stand there with you, and that
if we desire change, we must be part of that change somehow. OBGYN has been something I've been
interested in studying ever since high-school. Most notably, I grew up in an underappreciated
community, with not a lot of access to health care and woman care, especially, so I definitely agree
with you there! Money always poses as an issue for most people, and there are many resources,
financial aid, bursaries, etc. that can help fund for your schooling. I hear ya, it's expensive. But
I am sure that with time, you will gain more clarity. Baby steps, I believe. :) I am looking forward
to hearing what you have to say about ""Anchor Text 1""! I think it's always an awesome ice breaker
(but I am already fully confident we will get along very well, seeing as how you are so articulate!)
xx Sincerely, Jenny (I'll avoid sending you a big paragraph and send you thoughts about the prompt
tomorrow.)Mentor 2021-10-01, 19:23: Hello Megan, I hope your week has been well, and school is going
smoothly for you! I put a lot of thought into it, and there are two things I'd like to share with
you based on our first prompt together. 1. ""Words to live by"" There is a Chinese proverb I like to
live by, ""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now."" I believe that
when we think we've missed that opportunity window to do something, we end up saying, ""Well, there's
no use in starting now, because it is too late."" But it is never too late to begin ANYTHING. Whether
you would like to go do that one club that began sign-up 2 weeks ago, whether you'd like to take
swimming classes, the best next time to do these things you want is now. :) I apply this a lot in my
life nowadays, with my ambitions and things I would like to achieve alongside school. 2. ""Food for
thought"" A recipe I absolutely adore is: World's Best Lasagna | Allrecipes What would you say is
your favourite comfort food? I absolutely love, love lasagna, as it's so easy to make, fast, and
lasts for days in the fridge :P Perfect for lunches and late dinners for a couple of days LOL.For
me, lasagna has a lot of comfort feelings associated with it, and the smell of it reminds me of
dinner at mom and dad's house. I am excited to see what you will share with me! Are there times in
your life where you didn't take up an opportunity simply because it was ""too late"" to do so? Have an
amazing weekend, Megan! Jenny",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roch said about how ""creation is always an accident"". Whenever I'm doing something creative, I

sorry for taking so long to respond back to you, lots of stuff going on here. My favourite hockey
team is the Pittsburg penguins! It's been my favourite team ever since I was young, they've been my
dads team so I just jumped on the train. Your quote stuck to me aswell, I also go by something
similar, such as ""bet on yourself"" it reminds me to always believe in myself and not to give up. I
took a listen to your favourite song and it has a good vibe to it! I'm more into rap but I also love
to expand to different genres. The current song I've been putting on repeat is 16 by baby keem, hope
to hear from you soon!Mentee 2021-10-26, 11:55: I'm glad you liked the song! And hoping you did well

did you choose the school you're currently at? did you always want to pursue this option?",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-04, 16:40: Hey Ethan, I'm really sorry I haven't responsded to you in over a week.
School got busy and I honestly didn't realize what day it was. Can't believe it's already november
:( . Hope school is going well for you. I opened the modules for post-secondary considerations and
career considerations since they most related to the questions you had for me so check those out
when you have time. But to answer your questions. I didn't know my program even existed until last
year. I was studying nursing and had full intentional to go into that field but I realized I didn't
wanna work in a hospital setting. But I know i wanted to work in the medical field somehow. So, I
actually took a career quiz and found recreational therapy. It sounded interesting and the more I
read about it the more i found that it suited what i wanted for my career. It allows me to help me
in a long-term setting where i can possibly see improvement form connections with patients. While
simultaneously playing games and having fun with everyone. It's also really flexible and i can work
in almost any work setting which i really liked cause now i can avoid the hopsital. Complete honest,
I chose my school because it was the cheapest one around me and it's actually the only school that
offers my program. I know you mentionned enjoying sports so a possible field to consider may be
sports science i know a lot of poeple in that program and they seem to enjoy it a lot Go through the
modules and let me know if you have any other questions, my workload isn't as bad right now so i can
probably respond sooner. cant wait to hear from you :) see yaMentee 2021-11-08, 13:18: I've been
feeling the same about the time flying by, pretty crazy. I'll definitely take a look at the modules
as soon as possible and I feel like I would want to avoid a hospital aswell specially being flexible
is very important to me. One more question I have is how many student are in your classes? Do the
professors have one on time at all? Take your time to respond I am in no rush hahaMentor 2021-11-11,
15:09: Hey Ethan, I hope everything is going well. To answer your questions, my program is a cohort
so I have almost all my classes the next couple of years with the same people which is really nice
cause you get to know each other pretty quickly. College classes are usually 30-40 people at a time
so it makes it a lot more personal, pretty similar to how your classes would go in highschool. Since
it's a smaller classroom the teachers have more room in their office hours to talk to you one on one
and give a lot more support. I know some friends in university who's classes sometimes have 200
people so it can be more difficult to get one on one time with the professor. If that's important to
you then I would recommend colleg oppossed to university if that's something your interested in. Let
me know if you have anymore questions, I would be happy to answer any :) enjoy your weekend if I
don't hear from you before then.Mentee 2021-11-19, 13:18: Hey Asaki, hope your doing well and
alright with all the flooding that's been going on. I think the smaller class would definitely help
me. What's your plan after university? Do you want to move to a certain place or do you just want to
find a job quick as possible? Im thinking of taking a gap year to play hockey and just make some
money, did you take a gap year or get right into it?Mentor 2021-11-19, 19:25: Hey Ethan, I'm okay
out here but I know the flooding has affected a lot of the people I know. Hope your safe as well.
That's a great question! I have no plans set in stone but after I graduate from my program in a few
years I'm most likely going to work in the field for at least a year just to gain some experience
and see if I enjoy it. I def need a break from school. But, eventually I am planning to get a
masters in Occupational therapy, it relates to my current program and something I've been interested
in for a while. If you're unsure of what you want to do or even just want a break from school then I
think a gap year is a good idea. I took a semester off before going to college so I was working full
time for 6 months. It was a nice break from highschool and the money was definitely good but if you
do that I recommend planning it out. When your friends are going off to college and university it
can get a bit lonely and sometimes you can feel lost when all your doing is working. I think that's
great that you'll have hockey though, it'll help you destress and get to probably hang out with a
bunch of new people. Leisure time is important make sure to remember that! I will say though that
when I took a break it made me realize that I really wanted to go back to school. So if you take a
gap year it might make you realize that school is for you or not and either path is fine. Did you
have any programs in mind that you're interested in? I have more experience in medical and science
fields so if you have any questions about that then fire away. Stay safe and hope to hear from you
soon :)Mentee 2021-11-25, 15:19: Hey Asaki, occupational therapy sounds fun! I will definitely take
your advice on the gap year, I think it'll be good for me and help me explore. Some other careers I
have explored is trades, I think just because I've enjoyed wood working and hands on stuff but not
my favourite interest, for myself I'm not the biggest fan with medical stuff haha, but it definitely
is super interesting for sure. I'm currently doing a project explaining a lot about working out and
everything that is involved with it, for example the nutrition, preparation, the actual workouts,
and the recovery. I was wondering if you could give me any tips for the recovery and the stretching
post workout if that makes sense. Hope to hear from you soon !Mentor 2021-12-13, 15:57: Hi Ethan,
I'm sorry i havent responded in a while, life has been hectic with finals week and finishing up my
fall semester. That's great that you're thinking about trades, I know a lot of people who got into
that. The schooling usually isnt too long and there's a lot of job opportunities out there for you.
There's also a lot of programs that allow you to work and go to school for trades. Do you know what
area you're thinking about? I'm not too familiar with nutrition and workout stretches so I dont
think i wouldve been much help hahaha. My program focuses mainly on purposeful leisure and
recreation and working with the community. Hope school is going well and winter break is coming up
soon so have fun during your break. If i dont hear from you before then Happy holidays, hope you
have a nive christmas with your family :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just started university and it is a lot harder than college but I am pulling through the first
month, which is good. What grade are you in? How was your summer, did you do anything fun or go
anywhere around BC? Anything you're looking forward to in school or your classes or just in general?
I have lots of questions to ask to get to know you better but I'll hold off for now, so I don't
scare you with my million questions! hahaha Anyways enjoy the night with a little unwinding session
of listening to music or watching a show/movie. I know I will since I went to work and did lots of
homework! Looking forward to talking to you about your interests or answer any questions you
have.Mentor 2021-09-29, 22:46: Hey Sydney! Just wanted to see what you were up to? I see you have
not seen my message nor chosen a topic that you want to focus on. Wanted to let you know that I
might be busy next week as it is already midterms week for uni. So if I don't reply that will most
likely be why. I'll try to pop in to see if you have decided on the things you want to talk about in
between my exams/projects. Hoping to hear back from you soon!Mentee 2021-10-04, 20:58: Hey Jham! I
hope you are doing well. I am in my grade 12 year right now and it is a huge jump from grade 11.
Last year, we did the quarter system, which I liked because I could focus on two subjects at once.
Now, we are back to the semester system, so it will take some time to get used to four classes at
once. Because I worked full time this summer, I didn't get to do many fun things, other than day
trips with friends and family. Now, I don't have much time to work, as I am busy with volunteering
at the SPCA, and am also taking an off timetable leadership and fitness class! Although it's a busy
schedule, I think it will be benefitial for me in the long run when I eventually have to transition
to univeristy. I am sorry for not checking in earlier, and I hope your midterms go well!! Looking
forward to conecting with you soon.Mentor 2021-10-06, 12:51: Hey! OOO Grade 12, that is quite a big
jump from 2 to 4 classes. University is kind of your schedule right now. I am also taking 4 classes
alongside work and volunteering. How's volunteering at SPCA? What topic do you want to work on
first? I'm almost done with my midterms, just one left and a paper, so I'll probably have more time.
I saw in your bio that you're also interested in forensic psychology/science. I am also interested
in that field and possibly getting my master's in forensic psych. I still have a little bit left to
think about my career before I graduate. What else are you interested in? I am assuming animals
since you volunteer at the SPCA? I have a puppy named Diesel that I got for my bday.Mentee
2021-10-09, 16:32: Hey! I hope your mid terms went well. Yes, it has been a huge jump.. I hope I can
manage things more efficiently in the future because the work load is stressful. Volunteering at the
SPCA is so rewarding because you get to see the positive behavioural changes in the animals, and
watch them become adoptable. I would like to start with the topc of post secondary considerations, I
am going to start applying to univeristy this weekend for early admissions. I am going to apply for
a few psychology programs at different schools for a bachelors of science. I also am interested in
the behavioural neuroscience program at UBC! My interests are for sure forensics, and sport
psychology, criminology, law, and yes always animals! Are you taking a bachelors of arts or science
in psychology right now at UBC?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

😁 Jenny",,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-04, 05:13: Good afternoon, Seth! My apologies for not getting back to you soon, as I
had said. 😊 Been very occupied with school, and I am sure that is the same for you as well! I hope
your week has been good so far, and everything is going well for you. This topic has definitely been
on my mind this week; I’ve watched this video a couple of times, and I think the topic we are
exploring this week is definitely a topic we need to absorb and digest. Also – I think this topic is
super fitting as we are both LGBTQ+, and we both have plans to enter the medical field someday. I am
looking forward to exploring this topic with you! I hope the glossary was useful for you! I think
many words nowadays lose their true meaning when people misuse them or use them in incorrect
situations and connotations. Do you feel as if any of the definitions provided a newer insight on
the meaning of the word? Maybe even cleared some misunderstanding or clarified an idea? Nadine
strikes me as a strong woman – admirable and unstoppable in her tracks, especially when you think
about how much she’s been through with experiencing racism, discrimination, and marginalization in
her life and field of work. I find that Nadine Caron’s story is a unique and one-of-a-kind story,
which can be good/bad depending on how you interpret it. Good as it is showing a revolutionary
change in society, and it is inspiring and sparking all kinds of people across the world to overcome
stereotypes, discrimination, and marginalization. But bad because we need to see more stories like
this and more indigenous people in the medical field. It is unfortunate that this is a rare case
because indigenous people struggle with much marginalization, implicit bias, microaggression, etc.
that deprived them of succeeding and gaining access to opportunities and resources. What did you
think about the video – did any part of it invoke certain emotions in you, good or bad? If so, why
is it that you feel that way? In the video, Nadine talks about how she experienced racism from a
hurtful comment made by her colleague. She later says, “I think that’s the apology that Aboriginal
people in Canada are waiting for” (Video, 9:05). What is your impression/interpretation of what she
means by that? I look forward to hearing your responses, Seth! I hope that the questions I ask you
provide you with some outlook and things to consider. But I also found the questions provided at the
bottom helpful too! Anyways, feel free to send me your thoughts however that may be. 😊Mentor
2021-11-04, 05:14: Have an awesome week, Seth! JennyMentee 2021-11-15, 12:41: Hello, It's not a
problem. Busy busy days lately. It's kind of the middle of the semester so the pace is busy and
steady. I hoep school is going well for you as well! I think it's very important to just acknowledge
that being LGBTQ+ comes with quite a few extra challenges career wise so I'm glad I can talk to
someone with a bit more experience in the world. I agree that a lot of terms are often misused. It
just loses all context when all there is is just contraversy surrounding them. We aren't even really
talking about these words as words anymore, instead just using them in whatever context other people
are. I just learned what critical race theory is from that glossiary. It's surprisngly hard to
figure out what it is when all you hear is people arguing about it on the news. Which makes it hard
to form a reasonable opinion on issues because it's hard to find unbiased information that just tell
you what things mean. The amount of struggle it's gotta take to get into the medical feild as an
indigenous woman sounds like a lot. Indigenous people struggle so much with intergenerational trauma
and often are barely given human rights. The oppurtunities are limited and it's really an uphill
battle. And then trying to justify your place in the world after you have an established career is a
battle that doesn't end. I watched a similar video in a law class. It was an indigenous man talking
about his struggles with keeping his culture while also pursuing a law career in a predominately
white area. Just his struggle with discrimination and not being allowed to show his cultural
idenitity through tattoos, symbols, jewlery, and rituals because it's viewed as unprofessional. In
some ways I can relate to the experience. I'm not a visible minority which I'm grateful for my
priviledge in that regard, but I find myself worrying about how my gender and expression will affect
my career. I'd love to be a doctor, but will I lose patients because of differing opinions? Will
people request other doctors over me if they find out I'm transgender? In someways, having this
experience as a transgender person may help be able to treat genderqueer people. Navigating trans
health care when no one I've met has lived through the experience is hard. But I have to decide if
I'm willing to allow my idenitiy be apart of my career and take those risks. It's not the same as
being an indiegnous person or any visible minority for that matter, but I may be discriminated
against in some cases. What's your experience been discrimination wise? Have you experienced
discrimination and/or is it something taht worries about you? How do you deal with it? I look
forward to what you have to say!Mentor 2021-11-19, 16:21: Hello Seth! Indeed, with the end of the
semester/term coming - I bet we are both busy busy students running around with our heads off. :P It
is nearing the end of the year, do you have any plans for December? I enjoyed reading your response!
In my following message, I will reply to your lovely message. :) I hope your week has been smooth
sailing! JennyMentor 2021-11-25, 00:55: Good evening Seth ""Being LGBTQ+ comes with quite a few extra
challenges career-wise"" - I totally agree with this statement! It reminds me of a quote I heard a
while ago - To accept the things you cannot change, to have the courage to change the things you
can, and to have the wisdom to know the difference between the two. With extra elbow grease - I am
sure you and I can get to the places we want to be, despite the challenges we will face and cannot
change/avoid. :) Thank you for sharing with me your lovely thoughts - you are very articulate so it
is very nice to read what you're thinking! I stand by a lot with what you say, especially in regards
to the feelings you have about being a doctor with ""differing opinions."" But I think that's the
thing we really need to see in the medical community because I am sure many people feel the same way
we both do. I find the medical community to be so traditional and rigid, and I hope to see that
it'll change in the next decades when there are more LGBTQ+ doctors and nurses out there. I think
that matter is important because every patient is different, and it is good for patients to be able
to feel comfortable and represented when they are treated and cared for. Some super good questions
there! What's your experience been discrimination-wise? In my experience, I get discriminated
against often for my ethnicity and my age. I work in an environment with lots of new parents and
babies, and I occasionally get profiled for being inexperienced, unknowledgeable, and ESL by many
parents. I think racial and ageist profiling is something I get a lot. Is it something that worries
you? Sometimes, I do get worried. Similar to how you described, I have certain assumptions about
what people will think about me when they see me in the work and school environment. The medical
route and field is a challenging one, and the thing I stress the most is having been looked down
upon for being Asian and female. How do you deal with it? I deal with it by challenging the
perspective/stereotype. :) I try to educate people, stand up for others/myself, and show others
otherwise. But, at the end of the day - when all fails, I encourage myself to understand that
everyone is raised differently under different teachings and environments. I cannot change people
and how they behave, and in situations like that, the only person you can control is yourself and
how you think and behave. Not everyone will accept me for who I am - but I am the main character of
my own story, so I think I trump over that kind of people. I am really enjoying this prompt with
you! What do you think about the extension activities? Please check them out when you have time -
let me know what you would like to explore further with this topic! We can give one of the
extensions a try, either ""Defining Moments"" or ""Response Strategies."" The conversations will move at
our pace - anytime you want to take your time or move on to another, give me a shout! Thanks again
for your lovely reply, Seth! Really made my day when I read it. Have a good weekend, JennyMentee
2021-12-06, 12:18: Hello! Thank you very much for your response. It's heart breaking to hear that
you have to go through that kind of thing. To be treated based on assumptions, but it sounds like
youre a very kind person and you handle yourself so well. Your outlook on life is always refreshing.
It's so easy to just fall apart and let it be discouraging. I believe that being in a minority group
(visible or otherwise) comes with some wonderful experiences and benefits. You have a cultural that
differs from western ideals. And although I dont' know much about your culture, I feel like your
experience of the world is different because of it. As an LGBTQ+ person, there is a very unique
experience there. I experience gender and sexuality in a way that feels so new. It's difficult, but
I'm also grateful that the universe offered me this priviledge. It's new and exciting. You make a
great point that diversity is needed in the medical community. Everyone is so different. How are we
supposed to treat every need if there's no one whos ever been through it to help? Of course, theres
a limit. But it's like how a lot of people in the mental health feild are mentally ill themselves.
They understand and can empathsize. It's so important. I think youre going to really be great in the
medical feild. You're so understanding and kind. To avoid making this message too long, I'll include
my response to definining moments in a seperate message shortly.Mentor 2021-12-11, 00:28: Hello
Seth! :D I hope your exam prep is going well, and your courses are smoothly coming to an end before
the holiday break! I believe that identifying as any type of minority - maybe it be ethnicity,
LGBTQ+, etc... all has its unique challenges and difficulties that need to be overcome in some way
or form. And I think that with time and the right support system (your friends, family, and even
yourself) those wounds quickly turn to strong scars. Scars because they are resilient and show the
journey that we had to go through to where we are now. Nowadays, things are better in the world for
LGBTQ+ people - legalization for gay marriage, open pride parades, and many clubs, organizations,
movements to be a part of and express who you are and show what you believe. Back then, it was never
this easy, and I hope it gets easier as time goes by. So TL;DR, I totally agree that our special
identity is what brings us many unique experiences! Without rain, we don't know shine - so although
things are tough here and there, being who we are is just so rewarding as is. I can't ever imagine
living life otherwise if it meant things were ""easier"" for me in the public's eyes. It is a worth-it
trade off, I believe. :) *They removed the emote button so I will have to use text emotes :P*
(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ I think and say the same thing for you! I think where ever you go in life, you will excel
and make people very happy around you. You are also super kind and empathetic, and I really enjoy
the way you see things and life. I will also do the same, see you there! JennyMentee 2022-01-07,
19:48: Hello! So sorry for the late reply, life has been quite hectic for sure. I've essentially
been working full time with the holiday rush haha. i hope your exams went well! I like your
comparison with scars. We really are the embodiment of our journey mentally and physically. Life has
never been easier for a lot of minority groups in the western world, but it comes with some very
unique challenges. I'm glad that we have similar gratitude for identity. In some ways, it is hard,
but it's quite rewarding in its own special way. We need that variety in the medical field","Mentor 2021-09-23, 13:18: Hello, Seth! My name is Jenny, and I am super thrilled to be matched with

I'm excited to work with you and see the kind of insight you have in life. It's fantastic to be
working with another LGBTQIA2S+ person whos inteterested in health care. I'm interested in hearing
about your experiences and the path you've taken. As for the prompts- Musical Interlude- one of my
favourite songs currently is Coming Clean by Green Day. The song is about Billy Joe Armstrong (the
lead singer and guitarist of the band) coming to terms with his sexuality. The main chorus includes
the line ""I found out what it takes to be a man, now mom and dad will never understand"" and I can
relate to that. Being LGBTQ+ in general is very hard and not an experience a lot of people get to
have. Green day is just one of my favourite bands, but that song sticks me with me. Food for
thought- https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10813/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/ This is my favourite
chocolate chip cookie recipe. Who doesn't like a good cookie? It makes me happy, but on top of that
cookies are just a great thing to share. People are usually happy when you make them some cookies
and it makes me feel warm when people enjoy what I make. It's a very rewarding experience.Mentor
2021-09-29, 17:51: Good afternoon, Seth I am very happy that the feeling is mutual! It's like a
diamond in a haystack, hard to find, but a pretty gem when you meet one, right? I am excited to
share to you my experiences as we go along, and hear about your journey as well. My response to your
prompts: Wow, that is a very short but powerful song, thank you for sharing that! The line you
mentioned, I feel, hits the hardest in the song. There are many ways it can be interpreted, and I
believe that is the beautiful nature of the song you shared. More commonly, I can understand how it
depicts ideas of coming out in a world where people are not easily understanding, and willing to
understand. When I discovered I was gay in middle school, I solemnly promised myself I wouldn't tell
anyone, especially my parents who ""will never understand,"" seeing as how they were raised and the
ideas they imposed on me as a child. Nowadays, the feeling is different, and the desire of ""coming
clean"" is stronger. ""Secrets collecting dust but never forget,"" really expresses how I feel in terms
of that. Hehe, thank you for the cookie recipe share, can't say I have not seen this one yet. :P
Cookies fresh out of the oven are just the best, I find! I'd like to add to what you say, and the
smell of cookies cooking is so heavenly, it's what I describe ""a comforting, homey smell."" To avoid
a big message, I will share to you my prompts in the next one. :) xx Sincerely, JennyMentor
2021-10-01, 19:41: Hello Seth, I hope your week has been well, and you're cruising in your classes
smoothly! What is your semester looking like? After some long thought, there are some things I'd
like to share with you! 1. ""Words to live by"" There is a Chinese proverb I like to live by, ""The
best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now."" I believe that when we think
we've missed that opportunity window to do something, we end up saying, ""Well, there's no use in
starting now, because it is too late."" But it is never too late to begin ANYTHING. Whether you would
like to go do that one club that began sign-up 2 weeks ago, whether you'd like to take swimming
classes, the best next time to do these things you want is now. I apply this a lot in my life
nowadays, with my ambitions and things I would like to achieve alongside school. Are there times in
your life where you didn't take up an opportunity simply because it was ""too late"" to do so? 2.
Musical Interlude I really enjoyed the song you shared with me. I would like to share one of my
favorite songs I like to visit back to here and there. IMAGINE. (Ultimate Mix, 2020) - John Lennon
&amp; The Plastic Ono Band (with the Flux Fiddlers) HD - YouTube The song I have shared with you is
by John Lennon - Imagine. I learned this back in high school in the choir, and I've been shaken by
the lyrics ever since. He emphasizes calling for peace and unity and moving past our differences and
barriers to be together as one. It is an old song and refers to the Vietnam war. However, I believe
it has held its water for years. Especially nowadays, with the social/political climate, many
history-made events occurring, and so much conflict going on, we can't help but imagine a world with
""no countries,"" ""no posessions,"" and there is ""nothing to kill or die for."" I guess I really enjoy
this song, because ""I am a dreamer"" too. I think a lot can be said about what the lyrics convey in
this song. I hope you enjoy it! Whenever you have the chance, please feel free to proceed ahead to
""Anchor 3"" where we can begin to decide on what conversations to start. Have an amazing weekend,
Seth! Take care and stay safe, JennyMentee 2021-10-20, 15:51: Hello Jenny, Sorry I've been away
lately, It's been a really odd time in my life mental health wise. I have a lot of harder classes,
biology and chemistry 12, and then CLC and Psychology. My classes havent been going to well but I'm
working on learning stdying skills and all that. Never really had to before haha. How areyour
classes? What does your semester look like? I read your responses and that proverb stuck with me. I
can sit and think about all the things I feel like I missed out on, or I could get up and change it,
get going. It's never too late for most things. I quit band during a really hard tim but it was
something I really enjoyed. And I feel like it's too lae to go back and rejoin. Imagine is a great
song! And I think the message is important.I know that when my dad was in elementary school, they
wouldn't allow them to sing it beause it included the lyric ""imagine no religion"" and that was
labeled as too contraversial. And like you said, we are full of conflict in the current world. And I
don't believe that the lyric is about taking away the freedom of belief, it's just about taking away
the things we are so divided over. Its honestly exhausting living in a society where you have to
constantly fight. No more conflict would be a great break. I'm a little confused on where Anchor 3
is. Is it the section with the choosing the topics? I hope you have a great day! You seem ike a
wonderful person. - SethMentor 2021-10-23, 13:26: Good morning Seth! That is a-okay! I hope you're
doing well. Thank you for getting back to me, I was very happy to read your response. Wow, those
classes sound like a doozy, I can definitely relate. Even now, I am still learning how to study
effectively and efficiently. I find it's a process you learn over time and throughout your studying
years. It's a skill you always are developing as you figure out what works for you. I am sure you'll
figure things out! This semester, I am taking calculus, chemistry, biology, and English. :) A
difficult semester especially as each science course includes a lab portion which is like half a
class, but I am also in your boat - figuring out what works for me. Just keep swimming, I tell
myself. Yes! Anchor 3 will be where we discuss what topics to talk about. :) You can access that by
going through the conversation topics using the blue button on the bottom of the prompt until you
reach it. Please let me know if you need anymore clarification! I will reponse to your lovely
messages in my next reply. Have a lovely day Seth! Super duper excited to get to know you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-12-06, 12:31: These two women have amazing stories to tell. The courage it has to take
to fight against the stereotypes. To take these experiences and use them to better yourself and the
world around you. Thats a lot of work. And there are a lot of situations in the acting industry in
which people have to scarifice their self to play roles. When you stand up, youre standing up for
everyone. I think I'm going through my defining moment right now. I'm in a SOGI club (sexual
orientation and gender idenity) and as it becomes more popular, people start talking about it more.
I hear people using it to insult each other and it makes me feel guilty for being in it. I only stay
because I know I'm not there for me. I'm a high school senior and most of our members are 8th
graders. They need to see that they aren't alone in this confusing time. And some one has to make
some kind of change. It's just so hard. On top of that, I find myself devolping a crush on a guy
whos straight. And it making me want to scarifice my entire identity as a trans person just so he'll
like me back. I know life would be easier if I just wasn't trans. I want to be happy with myself,
but I also want to be wanted and at this moemnt, it feels like both of those things can't be true.
What's your defining moment(s)? How have they changed your perspective? As always, I look forward to
hearing your thoughts. :)Mentor 2021-12-11, 01:40: Hi again, Seth. (ᵔᴥᵔ) Yes totally, standing up
against deeply rooted stereotypes and ideologies takes an amazing amount of courage, perseverance,
and resolve. Also, standing up for what you believe in when it is not generally believed in or
accepted is an understanding that you will face a lot of disagreeing people and judgmental comments.
So, it is crazy amazing what these women are doing, and I want to support their causes and movement
when I hear their stories. They are speaking for people who can't. Wow, I am in awe of your defining
moment story. I can say that I have been in a similar situation in terms of SOGI club. In highschool
(I graduated in 2019), some bandmates of mine and I were trying to set up a club like that - an
LGBTQ+ safe spot. We were inspired by the ALEX bus that would pop by every Friday, providing
emotional and mental support and also free and confidential medical care, testing, etc... I would
always see the nurses there every Friday and anybody can come by for toiletries, food, a place to
relax/sleep - basically anything you needed that you couldn't get at home or in school. So, we
wanted to expand this ""safe spot"" to our fellow LGBTQ+ friends that didn't quite know about this
safe haven. But, in the process of that - we were judged by many students and even some teachers and
administration that didn't support the makings of this club. Sometimes, I feel guilty for how I was
feeling then as I really wanted to ditch the group and idea because I was afraid of what people may
say/think about me. So hearing your story that you shared with me (thank you for sharing with me!) -
I can say that I really admire you and who you are and what you are doing. I am sure that many
people think the same (even though they may not necessarily tell you that honestly) because what you
are showing is an act of courage and strength. And what you are doing is something that may cause a
chain reaction in the future when someone decides to show an act of courage like you are doing
today. You are a part of that change. And honestly, life is too short to get fixated on what people
think. Of course, I can understand that it is easier than said, but it is true! It is hard, but take
it day by day, because life really does go day by day. It will never go year by year, month by
month. So, when you conquer just one day - that is a big achievement in itself considering how
difficult things are. Keep it up! \ (•◡•) / About your situation: In a society where people demand
things to make sense, demand labels, concepts, etc . . . It is hard to truly, truly fit in with who
you are. And as I said - take things easy. Every answer begins with a question and you are at the
question stage. You may not discover your answer now or tomorrow, but rest assured that your answer
will come. (My two-cents) True, happy, and healthy loving/liking someone shouldn't make you feel
like you have to change a big part of yourself for them. So for my defining moment: I have been in
many relationships where I lost track of who I was (I have always been a big people pleaser.)
Relationships as in friendships, dating, even short-term like co-workers or classmates. I have
prided myself for getting along with people so well because I blend in wherever I am. And because of
this, I put on a mask to hide anything that could possibly get me judged for - my heritage, my
culture, sometimes even my likes/dislikes, and core identity. But, the instance that was a slap to
my face was when my best friend confronted me about it, and said, ""I don't even know who you are
anymore. You're Jenny, but what even makes you, you nowadays?"" And from there, I was shocked, but it
seriously changed my perspective on who I was and how I was ""living life."" It made me determined to
discover who I am, and write my own identity. My experiences are unique, my life is unique, so why
should my personality and who I am basic? I am still on that journey to this day - but I am
determined to be myself no matter the hardships. I am gay, and I am nothing but blessed to know that
I am! :) I hope you are taking good care of yourself during these rough times and exam season.
Hearing how things have been - what things (activities, hobbies, etc.) do you enjoy doing when life
gets tough and you need a break? How do you recuperate from all the stress going on in your life?
Sorry for my long reply - I really enjoyed this week's topic, and I only hope to explore more with
you! Let me know if you would like to check out the next extension/move on to the next topic. Have
an awesome weekend, Seth! JennyMentee 2022-01-07, 20:12: These women really are paving the way. And
sharing your story is half of the battle, but it's so important. It's what inspires others to share
and builds community. We get to talk like this about these issues because someone was brave enough
to stand up. Thank you. I think there's quite a bit of honour in even the idea of sharing that safe
space. It's important for people to even know that the option is there. But as a teenager, it's such
a confusing time and criticism hits quite deep. We all want to find our place and be accepted. I
think it's worth giving yourself some compassion for how you felt then. You were still part of
something great. I really appreciate the encouragement. Sometimes the right thing isn't the easy
thing and that's okay. And as for relationships, I do appreciate your two cents. It's hard to
remember that relationships don't require major sacrifice of self. I think your story is quite
powerful and really makes me think. Life is often easier when we people please. Never rocking the
boat or standing out. And although, it is a useful skill to blend, it's not always a healthy one to
have. I'm sure that conversation didn't feel great, but I'm glad you had someone in your life to
snap you back to reality. You and your identity are worth celebrating. You hold so much within
yourself and I'm glad you're learning to be yourself unapologetically. Stress is a great enemy of
mine. I'm going to be honest, I'm struggling a bit with substance use lately, but I'm definitely
getting better and just in time for back to school. But I do enjoy writing quite a bit. That's a
great hobby of mine and quite an expressive one at that. How do you cope with it all? I can't
imagine university courses are easy and there's quite a bit that comes with post-secondary
life.Mentor 2022-01-13, 21:50: Good evening, Seth! I apologize for my delayed response; the
beginnings of a semester are always so hectic for me personally! :) I will reply to your lovely
response detailed in my message tomorrow morning. I hope everything is going well for you so far in
school and in your personal life. I am looking forward to reading all your messages and responding
to you! :D Have an amazing evening, JennyMentor 2022-01-15, 18:47: Good afternoon, Seth! I was
really happy to get the notification about your email. I was thinking about how you are doing and
wishing you a lovely Happy New Year! I know it's a bit cliche, but I am wondering - do you have any
2022 resolutions (or goals) you would like to work towards this year? :-) I really enjoyed this
conversation with you, and it's awesome that we can both speak about something very real and
confronting with such articulation and comfort. Our talks about your experiences and mine, as well
as the tribulations of these women, all prove a big point: we need more instances of “defining
moments” to inspire social change. As unfortunate as these experiences are, they’re the “stepping
stones” to a better future for the next generations to come when we learn from them. Your words of
affirmation about my experiences made me really happy, and I say the same thing to you as well. You
are also a part of something great! It made me really happy to give you a bit of my “two cents”!
Just know I am here for you alongside your journey, and I am very appreciative that I get to be in
touch with you. I can great relate and sympathize with your situation; stress has always been an
enemy of mine, and I envy those who can take the stress and make something great out of it. It has
been a journey of healing over the years – I can say I am better, and I only hope from hearing how
you are that you are doing well too! I will be honest: it pulled my heartstrings when you told me
what you are going through. Please know that I am here to talk to you and provide you with the
necessary help/resources no matter the time of day. And many others are here for you
unconditionally. Writing is actually something I also very much enjoy as well! What kind of writing
do you like to partake in? Poems, entries, etc. I am super curious! 😊 To be honest, I am still on
that journey to discovering how to cope with it all because you learn so much as the years go by and
you’re always improving. It only gets harder as time progresses and approaching my 3rd year is quite
the thought. Even the idea of med school feels sometimes so far away. For me, I can only listen to
my mind and body and advocate for myself in these trying times. If I need some time to myself – I
treat myself and write or do something I enjoy. If I need someone to talk to – I seek it through my
therapist or a friend. I think the idea of “coping” adapts with you, but the most important thing is
you gotta listen to yourself when you know things are rough and do the best to alleviate things.
Organization and planning are also things I find that help me with coping because when I have a
plan, I don’t feel so as rambled in space. How about you, Seth? What kind of things do you like to
do when things get tough as a way to cope with it or provide a “mental break” to yourself? Have a
spectacular weekend! :D JennyMentee 2022-01-16, 18:17: Hello, Jenny! I don't personally do a lot of
new years resolutions, but I guess if I were to think, I'd have to say that I aim to focus more on
myself and just make the right decisions. I know what's good for me, I just need to treat myself
with the respect and care that will help me in the long run. Of course, it's a gradual process, but
it's doable. What about you? What are your goals and thoughts moving into 2022? It's really great to
talk to someone who not only is further along on a similar path but understands the experience. Of
course, every path is different. but it's an honour to have your time. I'm sure I've mentioned this,
but as an LGBTQ+ person, it's hard to see a lot of representation within the career I want. It's
nice to have the opportunity to talk to someone about the future and the struggles. I really do
appreciate the support and kindness. And your experience is very helpful. I'm glad to hear that
you're doing better with stress. It really is a process and takes a lot of strength to get better.
Healing is a process and it takes a lot of work. I am getting there for sure. I've put five years of
work into my mental health and in some ways, I'm starting to see results. And recently I'm beginning
to start to get some real answers which in some ways is hard to take, but it's nice to know where
pieces fit. It's fantatsic to meet a fellow writer! Currently, I'm getting back into poetry, but I'm
definitely more of a short story writer. What about you? What do you like to write? I think coping
is a life long journey. And I agree with your ststaement that coping adapts with you. We are fluid,
what works for me now isn't going to work as a change and grow. You sound like a very hardworking
person. Getting to med school is a lot of work even for an average person and if you add extra
struggles, that even harder. I appreciate you sharing your ways to cope. Rwaching out to people is
fantastic. I think planning is a great way to help. It really gets things out and gives you
something to almost reference so there's more headspace. For me coping is more taking a break.
Sometimes, I have a tendency to throw myself into work/projects, but I like to write or draw
sometimes. I have some medical colouring books and i like to just sit and colour muscles . It
requires some focus, but not enough to be draining. And writing is a great way to channel emotions
out. I'm going to move on to a new topic I think, so I'll send another message shortly.Mentor
2022-01-24, 22:08: Good evening, Seth! How are you today, how is your week going so far? No worries
– I will be honest with you; I am not too versed with resolutions either. XP But, I think it is good
to think/reflect about what you would like to achieve this year, as a way to manifest those things
to come your way. I am in total agreeance with you, and I think that is a lovely resolution! Perhaps
even aligned with what I would like to work towards this year. School-wise, I would like to develop
stronger studying habits, both more effectively and efficiently. I would also like to get involved
much more; I would love to volunteer more and make this year the most fulfilling as can be in
preparation for my future. I recently got a new job as a healthcare assistant, helping individuals
with disabilities/health conditions that cannot complete their daily tasks at home. I am hoping for
this to be a valuable experience towards my journey to med school! I recently got this new tattoo,
“Vivens.” It means “living” in Latin (a bit cheesy and cliché LOL.) But it pretty much sums up my
ambitions – with school and so much on your plate, the days go by so fast, and you can’t believe
it’s already Monday. I want to try to make every day as memorable as I can, as meaningful as I can.
I tend to default to a mundane routine when things get hard, and it has been taking a toll on my
mental health (sleeping, studying, eating, and repeating the routine.) Every second of your life,
you are simultaneously the oldest you've ever been and the youngest you can be – you just can’t miss
it! I am super duper happy to hear that, Seth! Life really becomes a turning point as you gain more
clarity about your life and yourself; a newfound understanding of just about anything can be so
refreshing. I am rooting for you! I am glad to hear that, and I like to hear about what you do to
channel out the stressors. I should get into that! Yes, yes, the feeling is mutual. I love poetry as
well, and I also journal as a way to remember certain events in my life (it is connected to my
resolution!) I used to love writing short stories as well! I really like the way you write and
express yourself on here, I can imagine how amazing your writing pieces are! Thank you, Seth! You
very much strike me as a very intelligent, observant, and thoughtful person. :) There are those out
there that must be blessed to know you. For sure! I have opened up two topics so please check them
out and let me know! I have messaged you on both of them just to help guide you to them. We’re
pretty much just sailing in a boat together, so whatever topic you’re interested in checking out,
shoot me a message. Have an amazing Monday and week, I hope things go the way you want them to! 😊

you. I remember hearing you taking a bigger class load, and I hope that you're doing super well
there. :) If you would like (and have the opportunity since I know that you probably have lots of
assignments/projects/quizzes/etc), I would love to hear about how you're doing! Have a lovely

1047513627,1047541064,9/22/2021 21:15,"Mentor 2021-11-01, 16:12: Hey Sasha, After watching the documentary, I think I kind of agree with
Denys Arcand's statement. On how we are able to create a genuine creation that other can relate when
it's something we have an interest/experience in. But I also think we can sort of imagine what
others are going through -- the ability to think through another's point of view. The old saying
""put yourself in their shoes."" What ideas do you agree with or don't agree with?Mentee 2021-11-02,
16:47: I agree! The feelng of authenticity generally dervives from our own personal experience and
values but there is something to be said about empathy, and putting yourself in someone else's
shoes. I'm a creator, I probably have hundreds of charcters and dozens of stories planned out.
Imagine how boring it would be if they were all simply a reflection of me? I believe that each
character has a piece of me in it but they're more like a funhouse miror reflection than a perfect
carbon copy. I was also in spired by Roch Carrier's quote: “I believe creation is always an
accident. You have to work hard but in the process, something happens and this is the essence of
creation. It’s something that you cannot plan. You have to do a lot of planning but what is
important is not planned.” I think that's something truly beautiful. As I watched the video I was
thinking about a story I am currently writing and how when I go onto my next draft I would surely
find many plot holes and unanswered questions and as I pondered this I thought ""How exciting."" When
I write, no matter how much planning I do, the story always tells itself to me and not the otherway
around. It is as much as a suprise to me as anyone else who reads it and I think that is simply
remarkable. Sorry if that was a bit long! I got excited :)Mentor 2021-11-02, 16:55: Afternoon Sasha,
Ooh, I like how you point out that even though you are the one planning and creating the story,
nevertheless the story is the one that tells you what may happen. And that's the beauty of creating
something. This ties in to how we are motivated by the goal of creating something that excites us.
Are there other quotes from the documentary that resonates with you? If not, should we close this
conversation?Mentee 2021-11-10, 15:17: Sorry for the late response, I think we can close this
conversation :)Mentor 2021-11-12, 19:01: Hi Sasha, Thanks for letting me know. I will do that right
now. Oh, but which conversation would you like to do next? Have a great weekend!Mentee 2021-11-14,
15:49: How about from Rural to Urban?Mentor 2021-11-14, 16:14: Sure! I will have the conversation
open up.",,"Mentor 2021-12-08, 15:51: Hey Sasha, Great to hear that you have worked on resumes as part of the
CLC curriculum! I like how you point out your experiences in debates and how that reflects in your
skillset. I also think that everyone can find transferable skills beyond the scope of in school
experiences. One example I could think of is doing the dishes! 😆 And to change that into ""resume
writing"" one can say that their employees can depend on them to do repetitive tasks.Mentee
2021-12-08, 15:57: True! I work at a bakery and I have a lot of different tasks ranging from brading
bread to doing the dishes! On a resume I could put that I am self directed and good at balancing
multiple responsibilities. :)Mentor 2021-12-08, 16:03: Indeed! Wow~ being surrounded by all that
baked goods 😋 is just *chef kiss* I see we are getting a hang of this conversation, why don't I open
up the next one, ""the job interview?""Mentee 2021-12-08, 22:26: Sounds good to me! :)",,,"Mentor 2021-11-19, 14:02: Hi Sasha, Do you have any questions about the idea of living or moving to
the city? For me, I think that would be a quite abrupt big change. Different physical environment
and this feeling of unfamiliarity. What do you think you may experience or express if there is a
sudden change to living in the city? on a side note, have a great weekend!Mentee 2021-11-22, 11:47:
Hey Rachel, hope you had a good weekend! Three things I like about living in an urban area: 1. Sense
of community, I feel like everyone is at least a little bit connected 2. Not a lot of people, I hate
crowds so I love how few people there are. 3. I know how to get ecerywhere I need to because it's
small Bonus: Easy access to nature, I live on a mountain! Two things I don't like about living in an
urban area: 1. Everyone knows you, there is no anonymity at all which can be annoying. 2. There are
less fun events and cool places to go like arcades, conventions and restraunts. My question: I'm
very scared of getting hurt by other people like getting jumped or something, how can I combat this
fear? Also do you have any general tips for me?Mentor 2021-11-24, 17:51: Hi Sasha, Great questions.
Please note I'm no professional but I will do my best to give some responses. I also feel scared of
being randomly attacked. That is something I feel to be of a more ""greater risk"" when going to the
city. Say, downtown or something. Some pointers others had given me when I was younger was not to
look like you're scared. Even though you are. This could be very obvious that you're looking around
(the side to side ""check""). Or, taking out your phone constantly. I mean, you may be checking for
directions but people tend to do it to avoid interactions and to do something with their hands when
they're feeling skittish/anxious. I know this may not be the ""answer"" you're looking for, I can only
provide some reassurances/things to look out for. When you feel uneasy about the people around you,
take 3 deep breaths. Breathe deeply from your stomach and slowly exhale from the mouth. Do this as
many as you want, till you feel you're in control and be able to react when something bad happens
(i.e. getting jumped, people coming up to your face, out of the ordinary stuff). I want to make sure
that you can react/make a decision IF something does happen. I'm a big worrywart, so I would
recommend to re-assess the situation before reacting. Sometimes, it's just the overthinking that
gets us all alert. Lastly, I would say act cautious but don't forget to have fun. 🙂 When you get the
chance to go to big events, the goal is to enjoy yourself. Take a break from school and life, in
general. Thanks for reading this mumble-jumble!Mentee 2021-11-25, 14:04: Hiya Rachel! Thank you so
much for your advice, it wasn't mumble-jumble, it was very helpful! I think that we're nervous about
many of the same things which is reassuring. I really appreciated your advice, and I'll be sure to
use it in the future. I always try to look confident when I'm nervous but I'm never actually sure
how much it works and I think the breathing excersize will be very helpful as well. :) Anyways,
thank you so much again for your advice, it was truly helpful! :)Mentor 2021-11-25, 14:31: Hey
Sasha, Wow! I'm glad you found my previous response helpful. If you have any advice for me as well,
please let me know! This is a great learning opportunity here. 😃 Would you like me to go ahead and
open up the ""between worlds"" conversation?Mentee 2021-11-26, 16:39: Sure, you can open the next
discussion! I'm not sure how much advice I can give since I live in a ver tiny town (like around
3000 people during the off season) but here's my best shot! When I get nervous about being around
people or getting lost in bigger centres since I'm AWFUL with directions, I like to make a routine!
That may be a specific route I always walk or a certain order to my day so I feel organized and
safe. I also listen to music a lot in public but when I'm walking in unsafe areas, particularly at
night, I always make sure to take one earbud out so I can still enjoy my music and be calm while
knowing what's coming. I'm not sure if that helped you at all but it's helped me in the past :)",,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-23, 15:21: Hello Sasha, nice to meet you! I’m Rachel and I will be your mentor this

12:39: I don’t believe so! I also can’t believe it’s almost October! I love Halloween so I’m very
excited but the more months that pass, the closer I get to graduation which is both exciting and
terrifying!Mentor 2021-09-27, 15:36: I agree with you! Graduation is an exciting thing but also the
start of new things. :) Sadly, I don't know if trick or treating will happen this year... I will
unlock the next anchor text and we can see what other activities we will be doing together.Mentee
2021-10-29, 15:20: Hi, happy Halloween! Today is dress up day at school, I dressed up as She Ra
(don't know iff you know her) and a whole bunch of my friends went as other charcters from the show.
Are you dressing up? I checked off two more boxes for conversation topics, could we start with
finding inspiration (more specifically motivation?) Thanks!Mentor 2021-10-29, 15:37: Hey Sasha, Aww~
I missed dress-up days at school. I love how you and your friends dressed up as characters from
She-Ra. Did anyone dress up as Bow and/or Glimmer (lol, those two are my favourites from the
series). And, yeah - I will unlock the finding inspiration conversation and we can focus on
motivation! Have a great Halloween day at school!",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-29, 16:02: Hi Sasha, Thank you for the advice from last week! I feel the ending to be
bittersweet. The film shows the fast-paced transition from an environment filled with lush imagery
-- nature to a new environment-- all industrialized and formulated. And perhaps, it evokes the
feeling of homesickness and longing to be near those we love and the familiarity (and safety) of
home. ah, time to grab the tissues. What feelings did you feel from watching the documentary?Mentor
2021-11-29, 18:18: Oof, I just realized that the question I was trying to ask probably doesn't make
sense. To clarify, what emotional response did you get from watching the film? ☺️ Have a good
afternoon!Mentee 2021-11-30, 16:55: Hiya To me the film felt quite ominous, like a building sense of
impending doom. The pacing I think was a large contributor to that as the more industrialized
everything became the faster it went and the faster it went the more it felt like you couldn't stop
it even if you wanted to. It almost felt scary or dangerous in a sense. I feel like the woman at the
end looked lost as well, like she couldn't see where she came from or how she got here, I guess
that's all of us in a sense. We don't really know all the decisions that lead up to us being here,
we just know where we are. I agree that it did evoke a feeling of longing, a longing to return to a
place you know you can't return to so in that sense it is very bittersweet.Mentor 2021-11-30, 17:06:
Wow, I love how you put it as we aren't all aware of how we got here in a sense that sometimes we
don't know exactly about our cultural identity. It's like that missing hole/piece of ourselves that
we haven't been able to discover nor explore. When you mentioned that, it made more sense of why the
film felt bittersweet. As something to end off this month's conversation, should we close this one
and start a new one? Stay warm and dry this rainy day~Mentee 2021-11-30, 17:23: Sounds great Rachel!
It's raining here too (I absolutley had to look out the window at school to check lol) XDMentor
2021-11-30, 18:59: Haha indeed! I will close this one now, but do let me know which conversation you
would like to do next! 🙂Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:11: How about entering the job market?Mentor
2021-12-01, 17:12: Sure! I have the conversation unlocked now.Mentee 2021-12-07, 16:26: Hi Rachel,
is there anything I need to do to start the next conversation? :)Mentor 2021-12-08, 13:36: Hi Sasha,

2021-12-08, 15:25: In my CLC class we also reviewed something simmilar and made resumes! Out of all
the desired qualities listed I think I have excellent communication skills through debate! I'm not
sure if that's what I was supposed to say, let me know!","Mentor 2021-12-13, 19:49: Hey Sasha, After watching the video I thought about an interview I had
done some time ago. It was for a volunteering position and I remembered having a hard time
explaining my reasoning. Thank goodness the interviewer has a sense of humor. I believed the
question was on how I would manage the participants (keep in mind they are young children) and I
said something about ""manipulating"" them into doing the activities. Perhaps I should have used
better wording like, ""encourage participants to attend activities..."" Haha, anyways, do you have any
questions on interviews or maybe you have some funny stories of your own. Feel free to share!Mentee
2021-12-14, 16:32: Oh my goodness that's kind of amazing! XD Also totally something I would do too.
:) I've only had to do one interview and it was for my current job! I remeber my now boss asking me
if I liked cleaning, since I had applied for the cleaner position, and I panicked a bit. I didn't
think it would sound believable to say ""Oh yeah, I loooove cleaning"" but I didn't want to say no
either. I think I said something about enjoying a routine, not minding cleaning and loving
orgainizing but I'm not sure. In that same interview she asked me if I had any questions, which is
pretty standard but I had no idea what to ask. I thought about it for a good five minutes while she
pulled up some paperwork but I honestly have no idea if I ever thought of a good question to ask
her. I re read my cover letter the oother day and it was also a hot mess. I certainley would not
have hired me but I'm really grateful that she really needed workers and I made a good first
impression. She says that she knew I fit when I walked it kinda bouncing/dancing to the music I was
listening to. That's my interview story! Do you have any tips that I could use to be more prepared
for next time?Mentor 2021-12-16, 17:44: Hi Sasha, Thank you for sharing your own story! I'm thankful
that there are always people out there giving us a chance. Here's to the real world. 🍵 Glad that you
asked that question! I would say to prepare some ""default"" responses for standard interview
questions. One that always caught me off guard is the ""tell me about yourself,"" question. Something
I'm working on for that question is to apply my default response and ""personalize"" it so that it's
tailored to the position. It's like doing a cover letter/resume but ""hey, it's an interview"" thing.
Example - phrases Interviewer: Tell me about yourself Me: ""I'm currently a student studying to
become a [blah blah blah]. :I have worked on [so and so..something that is taken from your resume in
which you can use the phrase, ""you can see more in my resume"" that brings the interviewer the
attention back to your job application]. ""From my previous projects and my current goals, I am
interested in the position [mention some of the job descriptions/aspects you have a proficiency in.]
OR ""I'm currently pursuing my interest in [program/general courses you're taking]. ""In my previous
years, I had led my group members on [mention specific project that is related to your interview --
time to apply the transferable skills here!] Tie in how that project and your current interests
makes you a great candidate for the job For ReferenceMentor 2022-01-03, 14:40: Hi Sasha, I hope you
had a wonderful and restorative break! Before we close this conversation - do you have any questions
(or tips) on job interviews? (it doesn't have to be on interviews specifically) Here's to a new
year!🎉Mentee 2022-01-03, 17:59: Hi Rachel, I hope you enjoyed the Holidays! Thank you so much for
your tips, they were very helpful. I don't have any more questions so I think we can close the
converstation. :)Mentor 2022-01-03, 18:27: Hey Sasha, No problem! Which conversation would you like
to work on next?Mentor 2022-01-04, 17:10: Good afternoon Sasha, Since E-mentoring is optional now,
would you like to continue working on a new conversation? If you also have any questions in general,
I would be happy to answer them! Cheers to 2022! 😊Mentee 2022-01-10, 12:10: Hey Rachel, I do have
some questions! It may sound silly but I honestly still have no idea what to expect from university
or how it works! How do you switch majors, or can you? Do you get to pick the classes you're in? Is
studying for everything really as hard as it looks on social media? Is passing a feat or completley
doable? Thanks, sorry there's so many! :)Mentor 2022-01-12, 18:07: Hey Sasha, Great questions. I'm
afraid I don't have all the answers and my response may not align with your own experiences but I
will do my best to answer them! Sorry about the long answers. 😬 How do post-secondary work? Looking
at universities as a whole is quite much to take in. I'd recommend breaking things down that make
sense and are related to what you need. Example: Program/courses you are thinking (or required) to
take -&gt; how does the day/time for each lecture works for you personally -&gt; What are the
options (day/time of lectures, instructor) for the courses you want/have to take -&gt; What are some
fun stuff you can do at school (in-person/online)? These can be clubs to join, workshops,
volunteering, etc., -&gt; Take a look at your schedule and see what fun stuff you can add so you get
some experience of what your school is like out-of-class time. Now, from here, you might notice that
once you break some things down, you're actually creating a schedule for yourself for X
term/semester. The overall response from me is to narrow your focus first then slowly broaden it
after you have gotten the important components. Can you switch majors? Yes! You can. I don't think
you need to stick to one thing, after all, we all find ourselves to be interested in something else.
Okay...but how can you switch majors? Typically, most academic advisors tell you that you don't have
to decide on something concrete in your first year (I believe), so the best option is to
continuously communicate with an academic advisor regarding this process. The best bet is to get in
contact with them (using your post-secondary school email) and let them know what the process is for
students that are thinking of switching majors (ask for an appointment regarding advice for a career
path, switching majors, etc.) Do you get to pick the classes you're in? Yes...and no. No - for
required courses. If there is only one option for your required course to select. Then... uh... you
will have to take it. I know, I know not the best answer. Yes - depending on what courses are
available for you to choose. Say you are required to take a composition course. Then YES! there will
probably be more options to choose from. Example: lecture time, instructors But... for required
courses that are more specialized, you don't have that many options to choose from. When in doubt,
always ask your department chair/head or counselor! Is studying really as hard as it looks on social
media? Hmm...this question is more subjective. It actually depends. The general response would be:
doesn't matter what you study, everything is all difficult. But of course, we get into this debate
of, ""but this X is much difficult than Y!"" We will ignore that argument for now, although at times,
that argument is mostly valid. So, instead, I would ask you to ask yourself regarding your current
or perhaps the past courses you've studied for: Was/is it really hard? I say, instead of focusing
on, ""gosh, that seems difficult."" Think about how you want/will be preparing (studying) for your
next term at your school (high school, post-secondary). Truly, I do believe passing and completing
courses are doable! Besides hard work, it is also important to ask questions! I always wondered how
I could have improved for so and so if only I do ask for clarifications. So...besides studying for
the sake of studying, find how you can study efficiently. 🙂 Again, thank you for asking these
questions. My neurons were firing trying to find a response. If you have more, please feel free to
ask me. 😀 Stay dry this rainy week!Mentee 2022-01-20, 14:06: Thanks so much for your response!
They're very helpful! I appreciate you taking the time to type all of that out :)Mentor 2022-01-20,
15:16: Hey Sasha, No problem! I'm glad that the responses are helpful. If you have any other
questions, please feel free to ask me. Some tips that may be of use to you: Go to office hours!
Depending on your post secondary and program - the best way to get in touch is to meet your
instructors. Usually office hours are by appointments or drop in (first come, first serve). Q: but
what if I don't have time to go to office hours? A: Email is your best friend. - No really. Want
clarification on the exam date? Double-check that your understanding of a topic? Email your
instructors or TA (teaching assistant) your questions and don't forget to be polite and respectful
when asking! Tl:dr: have questions? visit office hours or email your instructors (tutors, TA, etc.)
Have a good day! ☀️Mentee 2022-01-27, 11:38: Thanks Rachel! And thank you for being an amazing

Feel free to share your result with me, and we will discuss it together :))Mentor 2022-01-24, 23:43:
How is school going? I bet you have a lot of works, and probably busy right now :)) I'm so curious
about your Career Quiz result 🤔 Did you have any chance to complete it?Mentee 2022-01-25, 23:28: Oh
boy! It's the last week of my semester and everything has been jam packed with projects, tests and
final exams! 😅 I'm sure you could relate on that!! I've finally gotten the chance to take me quiz! I
always thought I'd have my future plans down to a 'T' by the time I was in grade 12, but graduation
is growing closer and closer, already being half way though, I am slowly becoming more and more
unsure about my decision.. Well my results said I might be interested in: -Administration office
-Employment insurance -Police officer -supervisor -Paralegal and related occupationsMentor
2022-01-28, 19:39: Hmm... administration office and paralegal sound fancy to me 😎. Among the
results, do you have any preferences? Or is there any other career you like?",,,,"Mentor 2021-12-02, 15:40: Alrighty!! I'm so excited to learn more from you. Let's begin by sharing
your idea about these following things: -3 things you like about living in a rural area and 2 things
you don't like. -One (or more) question(s) you have about living or moving to the city.Mentee
2021-12-06, 12:11: Me too! I've lived in the same really small town basically my whole life. There
are a few sections to my town, I live in the mountains so some smaller towns are below and others
are above. My house is up one of the mountains. I'd have to say there are pros and cons... I don't
really like living up the mountain because you can't walk anywhere and people live in all sections
so I have no friends close by. If I want to see someone I have to catch a ride. Maybe once I have my
license it will be better 😅 There also isn't much to do here! Our mall is super small and overall it
just gets pretty boring.😬 On the bright side though, our school is pretty small so everyone knows
everyone! It's a good way to build connections within the community. There is also almost never
traffic! Unless there is construction or something... And there are a few places within a few hours
driving that have more things to do and see, so our town avoids the busy rush of people while still
having access to it, if your willing to drive of course😂 Did you come from a small town? Did you
find the transition difficult? What do you do for fun when you're bored? What is the energy of the
city like?Mentor 2021-12-08, 12:57: Sounds interesting heh!! 😎 I am actually an international
student, so there are tons of things that surprise me when I came to Canada. I never used public
transportation in my country, so riding the bus was a little bit difficult for me at first...
Honestly, cause my parents always drive me to school by motorcycle in Vietnam (I'm Vietnamese by the
way ✌️) It's not like the cool motorcycle image on the internet. If you google ""Vietnamese
motorcycle"", you'll see the reality 😂 Here in Vancouver is SUPER busy!! You'll see a lot of people
""running"" for the bus (including me) even on Saturdays. I ride R4 bus to UBC, and trust me, it's
always full. I try to catch the one at 8:00am but still end up in a crowd 🥲 I think one of the good
thing about living in the city is the motivation to work hard and study hard.💪 The rushing of others
kinda reminds you that ""time flies so do wait until the last minute"" or motivates you to start
working. It might be weird but I admires the ""working on bus"" people. I see many many students
scribble on their ipads or type on their laptops on the bus, and I like how they use their commute
time to work. Watching Kdramas is what I do when I'm bored, and I'm waiting for Winter Break to
finish those 😆 Have you got any chance to visit the city? I heard that the weather on mountains is
super nice, is that true? What do you do in your free time?Mentee 2021-12-08, 15:31: I googled the
motorcycle you mentioned, it's so cool!! 🤩 Maybe you're just used to it so it's not as cool haha,
but me and my friend both thought it was so neat! How far was the drive? Was it scary at first
riding? 😯 I hope you get the chance over break to finish any Kdramas you need to catch up on! Any to
recommend? 😋 I love seeing people working on the bus too! I always wonder what they're working on..🤔
My oldest sister lives in Vancouver, it's about an 8 hour drive from here! I love going there, the
big mall is definitely a highlight! I've never personally driven in the city but my mom seems to
have the hang of it she doesn't need me behind the wheel.. 😂 I definitely want to live in the city
when I'm older! The weather here is nice! Every season is beautiful! Almost every yard has a tree
view! It's also great for skiing. There's Great Lakes around, and overall great weather, views and
attractions! Maybe there is more to do than I thought.. 🤔 I'm pretty busy most days! I do a lot of
after school activities! So when I do get free time I take advantage! I make an effort to spend time
with my family, friends and also myself! Making sure to do self care! 😜 What is your favourite thing
in the city? Do you ever feel overwhelmed? Did it take some getting used to?Mentor 2021-12-09,
15:10: I always feel sleepy when my parents drive me on motorcycle 😂. *im gonna blame the breeze
hehe* I'm currently into ""Crash landing on you"", ""My name"", and ""The heirs"". Trust me, they're all
worth watching!! I totally agree with your decision, you should live in the city when you're older.
There are many opportunities here. Like I had a hard time looking for a part time job cause I have
no experience. I applied 30 places and got all rejected 😂. But since Vancouver is a big city, MANY
MANY chances are still there, so I finally got one ✌️ I rarely feel overwhelmed. I try everything to
avoid that, so I do a part time job besides studying. When I work, I kinda get away from schoolwork.
Interacting with customers makes me happy 😊. For study motivation, I go to the library. There are
many distractions at home, so library is definitely the best place for studying! After school
activities are awesome! I'm glad that you do many of them. They make your life more interesting and
help you learn many good lessons. I used to do martial arts, piano, drawing, and hair braiding. Even
though I forgot all of them now 😂, but they make my childhood awesome. Talking a walk in the rural
must be great, do you usually do that? Does it help relax your mind? Have you ever feel
overwhelmed?Mentee 2021-12-13, 12:12: Haha that breeze must've been so nice! 😍 Thanks for the
recommendations! I will definitely watch those shows, it will give me something to do over break!
Since all my activities will be on break too! The city must be great for opportunities like that! I
can't wait to experience things through a city perspective.☺️ Taking a walk is definitely a common
occurrence for me! There are so many hiking trails close by, so if you need time alone that's the
place to go. Plus the view is definitely worth it. I do often feel overwhelmed, my dad likes to call
me 'high strung'😅 (I'm easily stressed and push my limits) But finding time to take a walk while
listening to music can clear my mind pretty quick! I also find relaxation through things like yoga
and diving. I enjoy the silence and time to myself. That's so great you have a part time job and
still find time for studying and other priorities! How do u manage your time? Do you go with the
flow or have a schedule?Mentor 2021-12-16, 16:48: I only work on Saturday, so i have a whole week to
take care of the school works. Going with the flow is very risky, so creating a schedule is a better
way. I don't usually create a schedule, i setup an alarm instead (the alarm's sound is so scary😖). I
always prioritize studying, so I don't put a lot of pressure on the part-time jobs (like it's good
to have one, but also fine if i don't have any😊). If you are confident with your time-management, I
would encourage you to have a part-time job. I meet a lot of great people at my workplace and learn
a lot of stuffs nobody taught me before. Yoga must be fun! I heard that yoga also helps relax your
mind. It seems like you have fully understood the topic, is there anything else you want to ask? Or
maybe anything you want to share with me? As always, I'm happy to learn from you 😄Mentee 2022-01-10,
12:07: Hey! I hope you had a good break, Happy Holidays and great New Year! 🎉😄 I hope your finals/
exams went well too! That's great you are able to balance school and a part time job, even if it's
one day a week, it's great experience and relation building! Yes I fully understand the topic! Thank
you for everything you shared with me. 😊Mentor 2022-01-10, 12:50: Thanks a lot, I hope you had an
awesome break too 🥳 It's great to hear from you again ☺️ As you might have heard from your teacher,
eMentoring is no longer required since you guys will be busy with other assignments. I really enjoy
chatting with you (to be honest, I learn so many good things from you as well 😊). But if you need
time to complete other works, it's totally fine! If you would like to continue, that's awesome cause
we can work on whichever conversations you want to. So, do you have enough time to continue the
program? Remember that whatever your decision is, I totally support it 👍Mentee 2022-01-11, 16:35:
Thanks! 😁 I really enjoy chatting with you too! I love being able to share and learn from you! ☺️ I
do have a lot of projects going on but I really love chatting with you, I would love to continue the
program, if you are interested as well!Mentor 2022-01-12, 11:59: Aww that's so nice!! ☺️ I'm so
happy that you decide to continue. We can move on to your next desirable topic, which one do you
want to work on next?Mentee 2022-01-12, 15:23: Me too! 😊 I'd love to discuss 'Career Consideration'!","Mentor 2021-11-04, 23:01: Having the right technique for studying is very important. It took me a
long time to find out the best strategy. I've tried a lot of different ways, and of course, not all
of them works *I ended up with bad scores 😢* The first video mentions many awesome techniques!!! To
be honest, I'm still struggling with the scramming issue :))) I tend to procrastinate until the last
minute because of the thought ""there's still a lot of time 🤣"" Recalling is also important since I'm
not very good at memorizing 😓, which is why I force myself to study at the early morning. Do you
recommend any specific strategies for memorizing? Do you use different strategies for each subject?
Which strategy is the most useful to you?Mentee 2021-11-17, 15:25: I study best when using a method
of correlation. Trying to relate things I need to remember to something I already know. This works
best for me when trying to remember definitions! For example in psychology I had to memorize what
mean, median and mode meant. I remembered mean is the average because they both have the letter 'A',
median is the middle number because they both have the letter 'I', and mode is the most occurring
number because they both have an 'O'. This method has always worked for me, even when I really have
to stretch to find a connection! 😅 My hand writing is not the greatest🤦‍♀️.. so when writing notes
in a rush I find them hard to read later on, so making sure to slow down and make neat notes is
definitely important and benefits me later on. Repetition for me is definitely the most useful form
of studying for me, really nailing the idea into my head. Re-reading examples or definitions. I also
find myself studying in the morning, or right before a test to really refresh my memory and clear up
anything I may have missed. He talked about the difference between paper notes and computer notes,
which form do you find more efficient? Which format do you prefer? (Outline, Cornell, Mind
Mapping)Mentor 2021-11-19, 19:18: Hmm... your technique is interesting! I like the way you remember
mean, median, and mode 👏. That's awesome! 😊 Honestly, I prefer computer notes to paper notes. I
write very slow, so I will miss a lot of information if I write in paper 😓. Also, laptop is SUPER
convenient. My mood is unstable, so sometimes I'm kinda want to study a specific subject and
sometimes I don't. 🙄 The laptop will provide the accessibility to all of my notes, so I don't have
to worry about ""forgeting stuffs at home"". I just do a bulleted list for my notes. I love mind map,
but l'm kinda lazy to do one🤣. I also rewrite in my own words and avoid complicated vocabularies.
What about you? Are you a paper-note fan or computer-note fan? 🤔 Which strategy is the most
challenging for you?Mentee 2021-11-22, 12:50: That's so smart! Having your notes all in one place,
on your computer, to avoid misplacing or forgetting them! I should try that😅 My handwriting can get
pretty messy, especially if I'm rushing so maybe computer notes would be better for me! But I've
always been a ""paper-note girl""😂 I also write my notes in bullet points. I find it the fastest. I
don't usually go for a mind map because I write so messy I find it more difficult to look back on it
or remember my train of thought. I've never tried Cornell notes but they seem interesting, maybe
I'll try them sometime!🤔Mentor 2021-11-24, 10:55: Hmm... paper-note is also great for recalling an
information! I used to be a ""paper-note girl"" too 🤣 when I was in high school. So... it's totally
relatable. When I attended my first lecture in university, there was a ton of information and
writing in paper didn't help me to get all of that. That's when I realize computer-note is the best
choice for me. I love paper-note a lot, but I have to say bye-bye to it...😢 Writing note is
important because it will be a ""tool"" you use to study for an exam. Talking about exam, I have 3
finals during the winter break, so *meh* can't even enjoy the christmas 😓 How do you study for
exams? Do you read through your notes, textbook or create flashcards? Do you like self-study or
group-study?Mentee 2021-11-29, 11:56: Good luck on your finals !! I bet you'll do great! ☺️ I
totally understand how the transition from high school to university could require a change in note
taking too! I personally prefer self-studying, only because I get distracted by other people pretty
easily..😅 I just wanna talk!! Haha! I find re-reading my notes the best way for me to study.
Sometimes re-writing information to really get it down. But I'm always open to new ways of
studying!😋 Which method do you prefer? Do you like studying in groups? Have your studying methods
evolved like your notes method?Mentor 2021-11-30, 13:55: OMG we have so much in common 😆 I also
prefer self-studying (for the same reason like yours, I get distracted when people are around) 😓 I
find out that watching ""study reels"" on Instagram prevents me from procrastinating 🤣. For some
reasons, more study-motivation reels keep appearing on my reels *like Instagram can read my mind*. I
spend a lot of time on social media, and those reels are like: ""don't wait until the last minute"", ""
keep working"", ""stop scrolling on social media"", so I can't enjoy my Instagram peacefully 😂
Hmm.....seem like you have fully understood this topic. Is there any question do you want to discuss
together? or we can move on to another topic. If there is no question, feel free to tell me which
topic do you want to work on next? 😊Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:36: Haha, yes someone who understands
studying alone!! 😂 I seem to get study-motivation on my phone too! Especially at times I know I have
a project or test nagging at me😅 You're right, Instagram totally knows! You definitely answered all
my questions so well! I feel like I have a good understanding! I am ready to move forward to our
next topic! I'd love to discuss 'From rural to urban' next! ☺️",,,,"Mentor 2021-10-22, 17:02: I definitely have been burned out a couple of times without even noticing
🙄 My friends and family are the ones remind me about that :)) Later on, I pay more attention to my
eating habit. Like I used to can't resist from chocolate *I ate kitkat to survive🤣* and I ended up
getting a bunch of pimples. Also, I start to drink more water cause my skin is always dry *I'm
always struggling with the drinking-enough-water problem* 🥲 Hmm... what's about you? How do you
think about the importance of self care?Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:44: Haha I totally relate! I've always
seen self care as more of a treat/ reward, but I now understand it is a basic need. I tend to push
myself to my limit and finish all I need to do before taking a break. Which would only lead to
stress and rushing work to get it done, instead of taking my time and doing my best. This is
something I'm working on, trying to give myself a break and go easier on myself. Especially with
school. I'm not very good at communicating how I'm feeling but my mom definitely tries to check in
on me and can notice if I'm feeling off or overwhelmed. Usually any problems are solvable with a
break, good diet, enough sleep and finding time to relax and even spend time with my friends and
family. Did you find any changes when transitioning to school, maybe living on your own, in managing
self care? How did you control school and taking care of yourself? Was it difficult to meet needs
like healthy food, taking breaks and finding time for yourself?Mentor 2021-10-25, 14:20: That's an
awesome solution! Yes, definitely taking a break is the best way to take care of yourself. 😄
Transitioning to university changes all of my life habits. I'm not a morning person, but now I have
to force myself waking up early 🙄. I feel like early morning is the best time to memorize stuff.
Also, deadlines just keep coming and coming, so I always feel like I haven't done anything. It's a
HUGE different from high school. I believe weekend is the best time to catch up all the works cause
I have a whole day at home! I used to waste my weekend doing nothing and end up rushing on the
weekdays (not very efficient right?) About managing self care, I totally agree with what you have
mentioned (taking a break between tasks). Make sure you ACTUALLY take a break, do something you like
that isn't related to the work. Also, I would be helpful if you set an alarm so you know when your
break ends *I took a break for 3 hours without even notice 🤣* Usually, Friday is the day I spend for
myself, like I don't do any work on a whole day at all. I just like Friday is the best day on the
week to do that, cause I don't have to worry about school tomorrow. I usually use Friday to watch a
movie with my family. What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? What do
you usually do while taking a break (listen to music, draw, watch a movie, etc..)? Do you have
people in your life that model self care?Mentee 2021-10-27, 15:55: Yes, the accidental three hour
break is so relatable 🤦‍♀️ I should definitely try setting an alarm! Hahah! I'm certainly not a
morning person either, but I now do a morning gym session which forces me out of bed. So I
understand that feeling! I like to have a full day to myself too, and I love your movie with family
idea because family time can also be good self care ☺️ I tend to keep headphones in almost always so
music definitely is something to help me focus and keeps me from getting overwhelmed with work
loads. I also really enjoy drawing and if I see myself doodling on my pages or notes I know it's
time to take a break! I also like to spend time with my friends and family and forget about any
stress for the time and just enjoy myself and their company. Do you think spending money on self
care is wasteful? Purchasing things like skin care, clothes, snacks, etc.. Would u consider it
regretful later on or is it worth the self care fix when you're stressed out?Mentor 2021-10-31,
15:56: I never think that spending money on self care is wasteful because it's extremely important
for my mental health. Umm.. but overspending on clothes and makeup is my current issue. 🥲 Shopping
is a way to treat myself (it makes me happy!! 🥳). I usually shop after finishing a test or a big
project like a reward for myself. Well... as long as I control my budget, I will never never regret
the things I have bought. If you have been in a situation when you feel regretful after spending
money on something you like, think about the happiness it brings to you. Trust me, it's all worth.
Don't worry so much about it, you can make money anytime! Seems like you have a good grasp about
self care. Do you have any else you would like to discuss. Also, if you have any questions, we can
go over them together! Happy Halloween !!! 🕷🕸Mentee 2021-11-01, 12:06: That makes me feel better
about spending money, thank you! You're so right, you can make money anytime, I never really thought
of that aspect. Of course within reason of a budget 😋 You've really helped answer a lot of my
questions and I feel good about this topic 😊 Thank you !! Hope u had a good Halloween weekend
!Mentor 2021-11-01, 15:04: Halloween is awesome since I can eat my cousin's candy 😆 Do you want to
do an extension activity for this topic? Or we can move on to another one. If you would like to move

love spending time with my friends and expressing myself through art and clothing. I can’t wait to
get to know you, and if you have any K-pop song requests I’d love to listen! I love music and
discovering new songs!! School is going good, I’ve been keeping busy for sure. I hope you had a good
weekend! What have you been up to? Are you looking forward to colder weather?Mentor 2021-10-04,
16:05: I'm currently into ""Lalisa"" song. You should listen to it (WARNING: it's really addictive)!!!
Art &amp; clothing sounds so interesting 😆 I also love fashion (so I shop a lot :) )My weekend was
awesome, I watched ""Edge of Tomorrow"" with my little cousin. ☺️ So... Are you ready to explore the
program 😁Mentee 2021-10-06, 15:30: Haha awesome! I will listen ASAP! Awe that sounds like a good
weekend ☺️ I love shopping too!! Definitely more than enough.. 😋 Yes! I am ready, and really excited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have worked throught the information so we can discuss more about it! What did you learn from
watching the videos? I learnt that taking notes of examples is extremely important. I have been
guilty of just taking down my notes and ignoring the examples because ""I can figure it out with my
notes"", but this is not the case! A lot of the times I can't and have to work extra hard to figure
everything out. I hope you had a great weekend!Mentee 2021-10-29, 16:46: The process of doing this
has already highlighted the issues I have with studying, I have looked at this for the past 4 days
and have not been able to start the process without getting distracted within a few minutes. I have
many difficulties when studying such as being able to retain information, a lack of motivation to
start, and being unable to stay on task. I have tried many different ways of studying but none have
been effective. The first video has 6 techniques, the first strategy is spaced studying, I have
tried that but I do not have a schedule that works with it. the second strategy of switching is
worth a shot but the problem lies in the ability to start and stay motivated. Asking questions is
what helps me retain information best, but not with myself, I prefer working and studying with
another person. I just wish it was more available. concrete examples help but memorizing these
examples is just as difficult as what the examples are about. words and visuals are just not at all
effective for me. recall what you know is just not gonna work. Note-taking is very difficult because
I greatly dislike physically writing stuff down, I don't have very neat handwriting so my pages are
a mess. so when you are having difficulty starting the process of studying what do you do? my week
has been incredibly hectic because I was the leading organizer of a week's worth of school
events.Mentee 2021-10-29, 16:46: Mentee 2021-10-29, 16:46: Mentor 2021-11-01, 16:26: Hi Niko, I hope
you had a great halloween weekend! I'm sorry you've been having difficulties studying. To Prevent
distraction, I suggest to try putting major distactions in another room and shutting them off (such
as leaving your phone, iPad etc.. in another room) or moving to a room with minimal distractions (a
room without a TV, loud noises, distracting posters). While studying, I always leave my phone in
another room and put my laptop on do not disturb. I find this technique helps me focus and stay on
track. I know it can be difficult to find time to study when your schedule is jam packed, but at the
begining of each week I find planning my schedule out for the week and setting aside designated time
to study works best, which is especially useful when your schedule continually chages each week.
This is also related to prioritizing what's important. Planning your schedule out for the week based
on work, school, and social life lays everything out and allows the visualization of the free time
you have available and when there is a possibilty to shift tasks around. In regard to studying
techniques, I relate to needing someone else to study with. I find talking with someone about
different topics and hearing their viewpoint on the topic helps me retain the information more
effectively as well. I would suggest talking to your teacher about having access to studying with
other people, such as having in class discussions with a partner or starting a study group that
could take place after school, would this be something you'd be willling to talk to your teacher
about? If neither of these are possible you could even talking with a friend over video chat. If I
am really not feeling up to studying, the best thing for me to do is reflect on why I am not wanting
to study. Am I tired? Do I feel overwhelmed? Am I just not interested in what I am learning.
Figuring out why you are having difficulties starting to study is a great way to find solutions. The
next time you are having difficulties studying, try reflecting on what you are feeling in that
moment! Usually when I'm having difficulties starting to study, it's because I'm not that interested
in what I am learning, but despite that, I know it's something I'm going to have to learn. To make
things interesting, I try and relate what I am learning to real life exmaples that I am interested
in. For example, (because I am learing science), The binding of actin and myosin are what allows us
to move our muscles. If you like cars, you can think of actin as the wheels and myosin as the motor.
The wheels and the motor have to work together to allow the car to move, and the motor is the
driving force that moves the wheels. Finding examples like this helps making learning a little bit
more interesting and forces you to think a little bit deeper about the topic which strengthens
learning as well! Have you ever tried a study strategy like this? I hope some of this information
helps, and if you have any questions just let me know! :)Mentee 2021-11-02, 12:23: WoW! That was all
really good advice, thank you! All the things you suggested seem like they are at the very least
worth a shot and I have the perfect thing to practice on. I have a sheet of things I need to know
for my psych class and doing all the things you suggested is at the very least worth a shot. putting
my phone away, setting some time aside this Wednesday and this Friday night. I will ask my teacher
if there is time for a dedicated study block for the test! Understanding my own personal feelings is
something I am really good at doing so being a bit insightful on why I am unable to study shouldn't
be that difficult. Examples are usually what I rely on when remembering something but making them
more personalized is absolutely worth a shot. Genuinely, that was a paragraph of fantastic advice,
thank you again!Mentor 2021-11-03, 02:10: I'm so glad you find my suggestions helpful! I've taken a
lot of psych courses for my univerisity degree and I have learn from experience that just reading
the textbook and writing notes aren't that effective when studying, especially when studying for a
course that demands a lot of memorization such as psyc. However, psyc may seem like a memorization
heavy course (which it is) but I believe comprehension is equally as important, and examples are for
sure the way to go! When you are studying tomorow night, if you are having difficulties starting and
you reflect on what you are feeling in that moment, let me know what you are feeling! I'd love to
work through some solutions with you. If you do find you study session efficient, I would love to
know what worked for you and what didn't. Good luck with studying tomorrow and let me know how it
goes!Mentee 2021-11-08, 01:16: Throughout the week I've managed to study for an hour and a half. in
all honesty this far exceeded my expectations. i put distractions to the side and utilized my short
attention span as an advantage swapping between different subject areas to study as my mind drifted
between them. in retrospect, I realize this was the switching strategy and it seems to have worked.
so overall I am very happy with myself because this is the most I've ever studied. i was unable to
study this Wednesday due to an emergency with a friend so I had to rework my plans for This Saturday
and Sunday. I love playing DnD so I used that as the commonality for relating the things I was
studying. when covering mean median and mode I simply used dice to look at each. this kept me
engaged in studying. I managed to make an entire page of note on how to represent data. My class is
also getting a study block to prepare for the test so I will be able to study with classmates.
Overall this has been a great success! this is the first time I think I have ever managed to study
by myself.Mentor 2021-11-12, 20:29: That's awesome! I'm so happy you have started to find strategies
that are working for you. Do you have any additional questions or topics regarding studying you
would like to talk about? If not, I will unlock the next conversation of your choice. What topic
would you like to talk about next?Mentee 2021-11-15, 13:12: I think I am good in regards to
studying. It is actually really difficult to choose which conversation to choose because a lot of
them seem very interesting. I have been in a mental health decline due to school so I am curious
about well-being and self-care.Mentee 2021-11-25, 15:05: Hello?Mentor 2021-11-25, 15:07: Hi Niko, I
have sent you a message under the new conversation tab of 'well-being and self-care' Let me know if
you did not recieve this message!Mentor 2021-11-25, 16:05: I believe you have to click ""complete
conversation' then fill out the survey to move onto the next conversation.",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-15, 18:11: Hi Niko, at the end of our conversation about studying you said you have
been on a bit of a mental health decline becaue of school. As mentioned in the video, taking time
for yourself is extremely important to prevent burnout. Burnout is super common this time of year
with the weather getting gloomy and the days being shorter. Before we begin to talk about well-being
and self-care I am wondering what self-care means to you and what self-care strategies you may
already be using?Mentee 2021-11-26, 11:54: I have absolutely been dealing with burnout. I have taken
lots of extracurriculars and every day I walk to school literally uphill both ways. So I usually
just try to rest, exercise a bit, and maintain a semi-healthy diet. I haven't dealt with burnout due
to my very lenient attendance in previous years so it has hit like a truck. The dip has mostly
subsided, I wanna say it was because of support from friends. I never really thought of specific
things I do for self-care so I don't really have a system of dealing with dips.Mentor 2021-12-01,
17:45: Hi Niko, It's great you have healthy self-care methods, such as exercising and socializing.
Something I would suggest is being self-aware when signs do come up that you are starting to feel
burnt out. Or even recognizing that the end of the semester is approaching and this will be a
difficult time. Do you know some signs that you are starting to feel a little run down? Is self-care
something that is important to you? Recognizing how beneficial self-care can be is the first step to
starting a routine so you are feeling the best you possily can feel! As for specific things you can
do, it really depends on what makes you feel relaxed and at ease. For some people that can be going
on a run, and for others than can be reading a book. For me, watching my favourute shows is relaxing
and gives me a little bit of time to just focus on my show and put my stressors to the side. What
are somethings you do that make you feel relaxed?Mentee 2021-12-03, 16:49: It is really difficult to
feel relaxed, not because feel stressed more because my brain can never slow down. My mind runs a
mile a minute at all hours of the day until I pass out. What I usually do when I feel overwhelmed is
start doing chess puzzles because all my focus is on doing these puzzles instead of stressful
things. Certain videogames also have this same effect because it is almost like reaching a state of
nirvana when everything just flows perfectly. muscle memory, instinct, thought, are all in a present
state. i just wish that could happen more consistently. I am pretty good at introspection and
knowing how I feel and why I feel it. I do believe self care is something I value highly but I also
know that sometimes sacrifices have to be made to achieve certain things you really believe in.
There are lots of big projects coming up before the winter break so I am working hard because I can
rest during he break. I also am going to be able to relax by going skiing every weekend, so that's
great.Mentor 2021-12-08, 23:59: That's awesone you see the value in self care, but I completely
agree that sometimes sacrifices have to be made. But I do have to note that nothing is worth the
expense of your mental health. A moderare amount of stress is good, it gives you the drive and the
motivation to complete what is needed, but too much of it has extremely negative effects on your
body, physically and mentally. It is al about self reflection and noticing thre signs your body
sends when it is expereincing too much stress. Thats great your getting your projects done to go
skiing! are there any other questions you have regarding self care and well being or are you ready
to move onto the next topic? If you are ready to move onto the next topic which topic would you like
to discuss next? Don't forget to click complete conversation and fill out the survey, then I will

I will be your mentor. I am currently in my 4th year of university obtaining my Bachelor's of
science in Neuropsychology. I enjoy the outdoors, sports (basically all of them), reading, and
learning about new things! What sort of hobbies are you interested in? And anything else you'd like
to share! A song I think worth sharing is under pressure by queen. I love the movie Bohemian
Rhapsody which follows the life of how the band queen came to be. I love the strength and
perservernce that was shown in the movie. If you want to here the song you can follow this link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWdLt3Afjrg A recipe I love to cook and eat would have to be baked
Feta pasta. Its super easy to make and is definitely my go-to. recipe a handful Cherry tomatoes 1
shallot half a cup of olive oil 3 smashed garlic cloves 1 block of feta 3 springs thyme 10 oz of
pasta 1 lemon zest You cook the pasta while you pre-heat the oven to 400, mix everything together
and put the block of feta in the middle of the mixture then pop it in the oven until the cherry
tomatoes soften and voila! I love anything with cheese so this has to be one of my favourites! If
you have any questions feel free to reach out and I'll do my best to help!Mentee 2021-09-27, 13:40:
Hello Christine, I am doing pretty darn good! I think it's really impressive going for
neuropsychology and a bachelor degree nonetheless. I also absolutely love the outdoors, living in BC
surrounded by mountains is honestly a blessing. I live in a small town near a ski resort so going up
there and seeing everything kilometers around you is awe-inspiring. I can hardly hold onto a hobby
for more than a couple of weeks but there are some video games I have been playing for a couple of
years. I try to do small woodworking projects that just take hand tools every now and then because
that's another thing I enjoy. On this website, it suggests a few topics of conversation and one that
really stuck out is 'Words to live by' I have a few personal philosophies that I live by and the one
I'm choosing is ‘Look for the best in every situation, don't be blissfully ignorant of the bad,
accept it all and find the good.’ I pride myself on my optimism and confidence so That quote is
something I think about when I start having more negative thoughts or when I need to analyze a bad
situation. There are so many bad things happening which I try to be aware of and it's sometimes hard
thinking positively and humanistically but that quote really helps center me. I attached an image of
the Torres Del Paine mountains in Chile, I Love mountains and think they are the most beautiful land
formations (rivers, lakes, plateaus, etc). These mountains, in particular, are just stunning in my
opinion, the black rock at the tips of the peaks with the surrounding area is just a wonderfully
humble but extravagant sight. I appreciate you volunteering for this program and can't wait to hear
back from you. :)Mentee 2021-09-27, 13:43: Also just wanted to say that psychology is a very very
interesting subject and think it's very coolMentor 2021-09-29, 00:25: Thank you for sharing that all
that with me! I agree that it is amazing living in BC. It's the only place I know that you can go to
the beach then drive a few hours to go skiing. I love to ski, I normally ski on Whistler mountain.
Last season I started learning how to snowboard as well, there's a little mountain called sasquatch
mountain which is only about 45 minutes from my house and it was the perfect mountain to learn! Do
you ski or snowboard? Also, you mentioned there are some video games you have been playing for a
while, what video games do you like to play? Also, i admire youe choie of quote and appreciate you
sharing that with me! those are definitly words to live by. Those picturse are amazing! have you
been to Chile? I would love to go, I haven't travelled that much but hope to in the future. My
ethnicity is half french half philippino, so I went to France a few years ago and got to visit some
family there. I still haven't been to the philippine's though, my family is hopefully planning on
going next year! I have also travelled around North America quite a bit because I travelled for
softball growing up. I have been to arizona, texas, seattle, oregon, Las Vegas, New york, Utah and
Florida. Where have you travelled? I'm more than happy to volunteer for this program and I know
we're gonna have a great semester!Mentee 2021-10-01, 15:20: I have been skiing on Red mountain since
I was 4. it's a twenty minute drive for some of the best skiing in the world. The only travel I've
done is in BC with the exception of a few trips to Seattle. Every other winter my family goes on a
big ski trip around BC visiting a half dozen other mountains. If I were to ever travel I would love
to go for a big hiking trip around the world, including the Torres del Paine in Chile. The main
video game I play and stick with is Destiny 2. it has such genuinely fantastic world-building, lore,
story, and characters. The gameplay is also top-notch having some of the most interesting and
dynamic features that arent in any other game. I personally believe it is a science fiction universe
rivaling that of star wars or star trek, with the added bonus of being able to experience that
universe as the protagonist. As for ethnicity, I'm as white as snow; Irish, and german. In regards
to this program, I honestly have no idea the real purpose of it besides talking to a university
student and understand what the experience should be.Mentor 2021-10-03, 21:34: That sound amazing!
Thats so lucky you live so close to a mountain you can ski on. The ski trip you and your family do
sounds like so much fun, that's definitly something I would love to try myself! Seattle is a
wonderful place, my family and I have gone there quite a few times. Lastly, Destiny 2 sounds like a
really fun game, it sounds similar to minecraft, which is a game I love to play. Thank you for
sharing all of that with me! are you ready to start the program? :)Mentee 2021-10-04, 13:49:
Minecraft is an amazing game, I've invested a lot of time into it too and yeah I would say there
have been enough formalities so I'd love to start the program.Mentor 2021-10-06, 18:06: Awesome!
Let's get startedMentee 2021-10-08, 00:05: What does that actually entail? once again, this has been
very poorly explained by my teacher.Mentor 2021-10-11, 23:19: Basically the anchor text will
describe what we will be talking about then we are free to discuss anything about that topic! Such
as any questions you have, any knowledge you would like to share, or just a general conversation
about the topic!Mentee 2021-10-20, 16:28: Sorry for the delay, the conversation pieces were finally
explained in class. The first one I would like to discuss is studying because that is something I
have struggled with.","Mentor 2021-12-14, 01:29: This conversation describes agency in the world, which essentially means
what our potential is in the world. However, sometimes there are barries stopping us from achieveing
our true potential. A common barrier is feeling like an outcast. This was especialy prominent to me
when I entered Univeristy. I felt so small in such a big community and it was difficult for me to
make friends. It took me a while to figure out how to handle this. I started by just accepting that
I was isolated, but that quickly did not turn into a good decision because I started feeling lonely.
To turn this around I started putting myself out there more. I started sitting beside people in
class and being the first one to say hello, and I started joining clubs to meet new people with
similar interests. Can you think of a time when you felt like an outcast and how you handled
it?Mentee 2021-12-15, 16:33: I currently feel like an outcast in my grade. It is a weird feeling
because I am well-liked and received by basically my entire grade. no one has any issues with me and
everyone knows me. I feel like an outcast because I don't have any real groups I hang out with. I
often feel like a 'disposable' friend. even if I am invited to these groups and we have a
consistently good time. My good friends are all spread out in their own groups. this makes it really
hard to not feel like an outcast. I feel lonely while surrounded by people who like me and who I
enjoy the company of. To combat this I've been essentially arguing with my own thoughts and trying
to prove myself wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your school year is going well so far. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and working
through these discussions! Before I share my thoughts from the prompts from above I thought I would
quickly introduce myself :) I just finished my masters in neuroscience and love research - my
favourite parts of research are data analysis (I love coding) and writing up results into an
interesting (and hopefully useful!) story. I also really like camping and take my two cats with me
on my adventures. As for the prompts, I am writing this at lunch so thought I'd share a picture from
my latest camping adventure. I really love the change of seasons, and find fall colours especially
beautiful. Along those same lines, this is a quote I've always really liked by Albert Einstein:
""Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."" I've always found that
exploring outside helps to give me perspective and appreciate everything around me a lot more. Do
you enjoy hiking or camping at all? It's great to meet you and I can't wait to hear back when you
get the chance! KatieMentor 2021-10-01, 15:32: Mentee 2021-10-25, 13:36: Hello! I'm Max, I don't
really know how to introduce myself but I will try. I have quite a few hobbies but the main ones
have always been video editing, game development, and music production. The prompts: My favourite
quote is coincidentally also from Albert Einstein “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by
its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” I've always
liked this quote as I've never been good at traditional school studies but have always had strong
passions for other things. I listen to a lot of different music but my current favourite band is
""Lovejoy."" They just came out with a new ep titled ""Pebblebrain"" and I've had it on loop since it
came out.Mentor 2021-10-29, 10:45: Hi Max! It's so great to meet you :) I'm listening to Pebblebrain
as I reply and am super into it. I really like music where the horns stand out like at the start of
You'll Understand when you're older. What other bands do you like? Have you listened to the
cranberries at all? Recently my go to song is Zombie by them. Sounds like you might have some great
recommendations though, if you're into music production. How did you get into that? Do you play any
instruments yourself? Game development sounds super sweet too. Not something I'm super familiar
with, though I've recently got into gaming a bit more so I'd be interested to hear more about that
too :) I really love the quote you chose. I'll keep that one on hand too! I think that sometimes in
school, when things are graded a certain way, or you are forced to learn things in a certain way, it
can be really hard to showcase what you're good at and what you're interested in. The fact that you
have strong passions for other things is really really cool and in the real world are often what
makes you stand out and (I know this sounds cheesy so I apologize) is what makes you YOU. How is
school going for you so far this fall? Once I hear back from you I'll head to the next section
(working through the program), but I don't want to jump ahead too quickly :)Mentee 2021-10-29,
17:14: Hi! This is my 3rd time writing this so I hope the website doesn't reset it again haha I have
not heard of the cranberries before but I will listen to them when I can! In terms of music
production, I started originally so I could make music for a game I was making and it stuck ever
since. I do play a few instruments: guitar, bass, piano, and a bit of drums, I also used to play
saxophone! School so far has been alright, just not enjoying doing all the work in group projects
haha. Other than that it's been going pretty alright.Mentor 2021-10-31, 18:59: Sorry to hear you're
having issues with the website! If it keeps happening, let me know and I can see if there is
anything I can do (or I can find the right person to contact!) One option could also be to type in
notes or word on the computer and then copy and paste into the box so you don't have to rewrite
anything! Let me know what you think about the cranberries! That's really cool you got started in
music for a game you were making yourself. And wow - so many intruments! I would looove to get a
drum kit and learn how to play, but I do play the keyboard and back in the day I also played french
horn and trumpet! (Hence my love of ll the horns haha). I feel you with the group projects. I was
never the biggest fan of them because it was hard to work with people of varying levels of interest
in the project. I think during my university years I learned to appreciate them a bit more,
especially if I met people with similar interests as me! I'm going to open the next section, working
through the program, but this conversation should still be open!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

question about what classes I took, it really depends on what school you end of going to. For me
personally I took Biology 11,12 and Chemistry 11,12 and physics 11, English 11,12 and Pre-calc 11,12
for my core sciences. However, a lot of the courses I took I didn't really need so like I mentioned

live on campus?Mentor 2021-11-25, 20:35: Yeah good choice. Dont worry if you end up switching majors
in your first year. A lot of people end up changing their majors in university. For housing, I'm
living off of campus. It is fairly easy to find rooms or places to stay, but I wouldnt leave it
until last minute as the good places may get taken. Just a heads up, having classes at 8 in the
morning seems doable but trust me you will end up skipping many if you have classes that early.
Everyone falls for that trap since in highschool thats what we do, so try and avoid that. For places
to stay you can look at facebook, craigslist, posters around the university...etc there are quite a
few places you can look.Mentee 2021-12-16, 13:35: Hahaha yeah 8am classes will not be something for
me to do as I'm late for school everyday! I'm still crossing my fingers and hoping I get into UoC,

2022-01-17, 00:10: Hi! so I re-looked through all of the texts and Iunderstand all of that. I am
kind of struggling with budgeting right now especially knowing that my schooling is like $10,000 a
year and with just buying a car not too long ago and all the maitenance and payments that come along
with that is really leaving dents in my paycheques. another thing is that I dont like my job so
trying to leave early is a common occurance with me, I am trying to find the time to go and hand out
resumes but that is really hard right now with everything going on. I am trying to find a easy job
that is less hard on my body so I can work longer shifts. also applying to scholarships is harder
than I though especially when your someone who hasn't done very much for the community which is a
requirement for a lot of them and on the other hand going to a school outside of the province
because a good sum of them are only for if you are staying in BC. So I guess my questions for you
are How did you do it? What was your part time job? how many scholarships did you apply for and
where did you find them? Do you know anything about student loans and how those work? What was the
biggest budgeting issue you had for your first year and how did you deal with it? Thanks and sorry
for the long awaited responce!Mentor 2022-01-19, 23:47: Hi Kenzie – I am happy to answer your
questions! School tuition + car + living expenses are the type of expenses that it is best to plan
and budget for. It is equally important to make sure that if you are going to be working while going
to school, that your workplace accommodates school schedules, and it is not going to take away time
that you would need to study. When I was working + studying, I struggled with finding the right
balance and found that my work was taking too much of my time and energy, which inevitably impacted
my grades. I started looking for gigs that I can easily do while I am at university and save time
traveling to work and fit it in between my class time. So, I started tutoring students! Universities
have job forums online where you can put in an add for tutoring services. If you are in first year,
you can still tutor students that are taking courses that are not in first year but prep for first
year. For example, there are students at university that take pre-calculus and are usually looking
for tutoring as well. I also posted on local online forums (like Craigslist) – lots of high school
students are interested in getting tutoring and many are open to online lessons – which makes it
much easier to accommodate with your own school schedule. However, with this keep in mind that the
pay is not going to be consistent – sometimes people cancel sessions or decide they don’t need it
anymore. So it is not something that you may depend on for basic expenses, but can come in handy for
pocket money. I took student loans and for me, it was the best option that worked with my needs
because it allowed me to have back up income in case I needed to take time away from work. Since I
lived in Victoria, which is notoriously expensive, the student loans did not cover all my expenses,
so it was kind of a necessity for me to have a job. However, if I REALLY wanted, I could have made
it work with just my student loan, but I wanted to have my own apartment and not take the bus to
university, which means higher rent and car expenses. If you opt to stay with family or get a
roommate, you can cut down the costs – take bus more often and cut down on gas and insurance. If you
are going to Calgary, the rent is MUCH reasonable there. Tip: Find a place closer to uni so that you
are not spending time in commute. When I lived further from university, I found that I was going to
classes lesser because I did not want to commute so much and get tired. Alongside student loans, I
also applied for scholarships. Even if you have not done any volunteer work yet, remember that you
can also do it later on! I would recommend that take the first semester to focus on adjusting to
school and studying etc. and then in the second semester, join a school club that interests you. The
time that you spend in it counts as your extra curricular. I personally found that volunteering to
be a student leader for mental health initiative was very rewarding for me because I met like-minded
people who shared same goals as me, I got to attend events and learn lots of different tools, and I
got to do exciting events for students. This way, when you apply for scholarships for next semester
after that, you can talk about your volunteering/school club. There are also dedicated scholarships
for women in STEM at universities. Every semester there are different ones available, apply to as
many as eligible to have better chances and check routinely if anything new is offered. The
financial aid offices at the universities are a GREAT resource and its is really important to take
advantage of the advice and options that they have available for students. When you apply for
student loans, if a student declares a disability (learning/physical etc), the student is also
provided a bursary (which is not loan since that portion does not have to be paid back). Similarly,
if a student applied has low income, they automatically assess that and give a bursary for that too.
If you are wanting to not incur any debt, I know that some students have applied for loan and have
it as back up in case they need to use it, but if not, then pay it back when they are done school.
You don’t incur any interest on the loan while you are in school and have grace period as well once
you are done school. Now, to directly answer some of your questions: How did you do it? – it was a
combination of making mistakes, learning, adapting. In the first couple years, I did not reach out
much to get help that is available to students. Once I did, I found that it made things A LOT
easier. I did it via combination of student loans + part time job income + scholarships from my
volunteering + bursaries from StudentAidBC What was your part time job? I worked at a retail store,
call center and tutoring services. I found the retail job hard to manage because I was on my feet
for long hours and physically exhausted. Tutoring was easy because I like teaching and I was able to
fit it into my schedule work. Call center was nice that I got to sit and use the downtime to study
but it can be mentally exhausting when it is busy and you are talking non-stop for hours. how many
scholarships did you apply for and where did you find them? I applied to as many as I was eligible
to based on the criteria. I checked at the start of every semester via the university page – this
info is usually in their financial aid section Do you know anything about student loans and how
those work? Yes I do. Do you have any specific questions about that? In a gist, I believe you would
need to have a parent co-sign when you first sign up. It is better to get the application done
sooner than later. You apply at the StudentAidBC website. You would need to be accepted into your
university when applying. They send the form to the university to fill out info about tuition etc.
They send the first portion of the loan at the start of the first semester, and then again at the
start of the second semester if you applied for Sep-Apr session. What was the biggest budgeting
issue you had for your first year and how did you deal with it? I found that the issue with my
budgeting was I was not planning out my expenses. Spending too much eating out instead of eating at
home or bringing home made lunch. Not setting clear boundaries on what to spend the money on and not
get pressured to spend it on things/events that others want you to go to. Spending too much money on
text books – best to buy used and negotiate the price. More and more professors are starting to
recommend books that are free and available online.Mentee 2022-01-24, 19:36: awesome! everythiing
you just said made a lot of sense and really helped me realize what my next steps are how can move
around the first year of university. I think I am good to move to the next converation!Mentee

you got some helpful tips from my experience! I can absolutely unlock the next conversation. Can you
please navigate to ""Complete Conversation"" for this topic and that will allow us to move on to the
next conversation. :)",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-21, 22:45: Hi Kenzi, This is a great topic to discuss because it is SO very important
to be conscious of our well being and taking good care of our own selves. When I started university,
I found that I was so immersed in the busy schedule of managing classes, assigments, part-time job,
finances, friendships... It was overwhelming and I found that I was not eating well, I was
cancelling plans with my friends, I stopped going to the gym and was not sleeping enough... Little
by little, these actions started to take a toll on my physical and mental health. I was burnt out,
energy drained, and felt really frustrated with my day to day routine. So... I took a step back and
analzyed what was going on with me. I wrote down things that were going on in my life that were
positive and negative, things I wanted to change, things I wanted to keep. Writing it all out,
understanding my priorities and spending time researching on time management and organization, I was
able to start putting some pieces together based on what worked for ME. I started waking up early to
fit gym session in the mornings, made sure to keep in touch with my friends by studying with them
(this way I was still socializing but also being productive). I started meal planning and then I was
only putting in time and effort one day of the week and had all my food sorted out without a worry!
Essentially, with all these small changes tailored to work towards what I needed, I saw a HUGE
difference in myself. I was feeling mentally strong, getting back in physical shape, and feeling
good about my school by taking appropriate amount of classes and workload that I was able to manage.
And I can't stress enough how much of a difference SLEEP made to me. I would love to hear your take
on the consideration questions above. Also please feel free to ask me any questions about my journey
:)Mentee 2021-11-01, 18:25: I also think that this topic is very important. I know what you meant
when you said “I was so immersed in the busy schedule”. Now that I'm in grade 12 I feel my schedule
has gotten shorter but more chaotic, kind of like saying there's a lot on my plate but my plate got
smaller. Because of balancing school and work. I think that it is very easy for me to think about
self care as something important. When all you do is work and not do anything for yourself it can be
very draining to your mental health and even your physical wellbeing Time management plays a big
part in self care and taking good care of yourself. The reason i say this is because if you plan out
your day and make time for all of the projects and things that you have to do you can get those
things done and still have time for yourself. Something else that is connected to this is sleep.
When you make a plan and give yourself time to do something you are able to go to sleep early. And
if you get a good sleep you will have the energy to get all of your things that you need to do done.
Honestly for this question “ do you have people in your life that model self care and what are some
of the things that they do to take care of themselves” I believe that a lot of my friends are in the
same boat as i am and are struggling in our grade 12 year to take care of themselves and are
focusing so much on their school and assignments and grades that they are not focused enough on
themselves. So I believe that everyone in grade 12 should all be able to take a day off sometimes
and that includes me. I think that it is the little things that hint to me that I need to start
taking better care of myself like when I sleep in or when I get bags under my eyes or when I see
myself not being able to take in or understand the notes that are put on the board. I feel like the
transition is going to be very hard on self care and mental health especially because I will be at a
new school and that alone will make me anxious. Another thing is going to be leaving home that will
also make it hard for me to adapt. One of the positive things about going to U of C is that I have
lived there before and I know what it's like. I feel like I need to get better at getting a better
sleep and really focus on getting all my work done when I have time but still being able to give
time to focus on myself and relax, so to sum that up I need to have better time management. But on
the bright side I feel as though I do a good job with trying to eat well and drink lots of water. I
also know that I need to get better at finding the time to do some physical activities like going on
walks or even going to the gym I know that is a lot of writing but I feel like its very important to
put thoughts to words and that all this writing was very beneficial to me.Mentor 2021-11-04, 15:41:
Hi Kenzie Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and experience with me. I really appreciated
reading that and you are right that writing down our thoughts helps us process our thoughts and
emotions better and it serves as an outlet. It sounds to me that your grasp on the importance of
time management is really strong – you are able to identify parts of your daily routine that need
improvement, parts that you are doing well. I would also add to your point by saying that setting
realistic expectations and allowing ourselves to not meet those expectations is also very important.
Throughout my highschool and university, I used to put a lot of pressure on my self to get good
grades, do extra-curricular, manage a job on the side… and if something didn’t go as planned, I
would be too self-critical of it. Over the last few years, I have been really working on my
‘self-criticizing’ behaviour by telling myself that even if I did not get to the tasks I was hoping
to get done, it is OKAY. If I needed to sleep extra few hours because I was exhausted, that it was
okay. We can try to manage our time as best as we can, but we also need to allow flexibility – not
everything is going to go as planned – that is just how life is. One of the best advices I got when
it came to time management and planning out my schedule was to establish sense of priority for each
task. So, in the finite amount of time that we have in the day, if we can’t get to all of the things
we wanted to get done, focus on what is the priority and get that sorted and still feel that sense
of accomplishment. Based on how you are currently prioritizing your days/tasks, how do you feel
about that? What is the ideal scenario for you or how would you like to shift that priority? Going
to a new school, new environment can definitely be intimidating! Maybe dedicating some time to
attend social events at the start of the year would be a good idea – meet new friends and people who
are likely feeling anxious as well – fitting in time to socialize might be one of the priority items
for you. You mentioned that you are wanting to put some time towards relaxing and getting some
physical activity. Perhaps combining the two would get you to the same goal? Myself, I go to yin
yoga classes and early morning/evening walks to get some steps in but also feel relaxed. What kind
of activity do you think would suit you?Mentee 2021-11-14, 21:29: thanks for your perspective of it
all. I never even though about finding a way of relaxing but also getting exersize. I also know that
thats the reason I love winter is because walking through the snow and being surrounded by the
silence is so calming. the other question you had was about how i feel im doing with prioratizing my
tasks and I feel like I can always improve on that. I know that I can have days where I fly through
assignments and tasks but other days I do nothing even though I have work to do. I can do better by
doing a little but of work each day and maybe go on more walks or do little half hour workouts. I'm
not sure what else there is to say but I can say that this converation has been very benificial to
me.Mentor 2021-11-16, 23:25: Walking in the snow sounds amazing. Where I live, we don't see lots of
snow, so when it does snow, I make sure to enjoy it as much as a I can. And yes, good way to relax
and get some exercise :) I am glad to hear that this conversation was helpful!! If you feel that we

to introduce myself to you. I'm Jalila and I currently live in Victoria, BC. I attended University
of Victoria and I see from your profile that you are planning to study at U of C - which is pretty
cool! I did live in Calgary for few years as well. It definitely gets very cold there! At UVic, I
studied engineering, and sounds like you have a passion for that too :) If you have any questions
about that, I would love to answer them for you. Some facts about me: I have a ragdoll cat (and hope
to get a dog soon!) I love playing on my nintendo switch. Currently I am playing Zelda - Breath of
the Wild I like to make digital drawings Can you introduce yourself to me, please? Look forward to
hearing from you!Mentee 2021-09-27, 14:16: Hi Jalila, my name is Kenzie which you may already know.
Yes I am very interested in going to u of c for their engineering program I am very good at math and
science my favourite science is physics and chemistry but I have never tried Bio because it has
never really interested me. I am also interested im architecture and becoming an architect so that's
my plan B. I'm also very energetic and love to be outside in nature. Another thing about me is that
I love my dogs with all my life. Their names are Charlie and cooper. I am also so excited to move
back to Calgary seeing as I lived there for 10 years of my life. I look forward to chatting with you
more!Mentor 2021-09-27, 20:18: Hi Kenzie, I enjoyed your introduction and very nice to meet you!
Math and science are great subjects to enjoy, especially when interested in engineering. They were
also one of my favourite subjects in high school. Growing up, I used to draw a lot of buildings and
try to understand the architectural design decisions behind those buildings. I can definitely
connect with your interest in architecture :) I am sure that Charlie and Cooper are lovely dogs!
Dogs + nature is an awesome combo! I am hoping that when I get a dog in the future, I will be able
to spend lots of fun outdoor adventure time. Now that we have had a chance to introduce ourselves,
shall we move on to the activity that is on this page? Can you please share two of the items from
the above list in the instructions to share with me. I look forward to that :)Mentee 2021-09-27,
20:29: Hey again, sorry I didn't even read the instructions to be honest I just jumped right in
so.... words to live by, a quote that has always stuck with me is no rain no flowers and the reason
I live by this quote is because I have always only thought about the bad and never the good stuff
that comes with the bad and so this quote helped me see that you need the ""bad"" to see the good in
life. food for thought is another one that stuck out to me I have always loved cooking and baking
and one of the things that I make over and over again is banana bread it is for sure one of my
favourite things to make (with or without the chocolate chips!) another family friend recipe that I
could eat all day everyday is this dill macaroni salad it has dill pickles and pasta and ham and
cheese and all sorts of good things!Mentor 2021-09-29, 23:16: Hi Kenzie, It's my first time hearing
of 'no rain no flowers' - your perspective on it is very insightful. I agree that sometimes we can
become consumed in the negative aspects, but if we can adjust our perception, there is a lot of
positive too! mmMm banana bread, especially warm right out of the oven is amazing! And, thanks for
sharing the recipe for the dill macaroni salad. I'll try it out for the next pot luck dinner!
Awesome introductions! Alrighty then, shall we move on to 'Working through the Program'? You will

name is Challen (pronounced like ""challenge""); I'm 23, currently starting my English Masters program

I hope my experiences help you anyway! For your records, I also have anxiety (clinical and currently

your profile -- what got you into true crime (I used to enjoy it pretty prolifically and wrote a
whole essay on H.H. Holmes in highschool, much to the confusion and distress of my class, haha) and
cars (which I don't know anything about, unfortunately, but I'm curious to learn!)? Are we looking

quite a few of those on my plate at the moment, so I don't blame you if you just wanna breeze

you'd care for any! Talk soon hopefully -- but no rush, though! :DMentee 2021-09-23, 20:20: Hello
Challen!! (: Quite the interesting name by the way. Anyways, what got me into true crime was my
grandfather, oddly enough. He used to work as a police officer in Kansas state. He'd tell me SO many
stories about working as a police officer and that even inculded some cold cases he was apart of.
Which then lead to the extentive reasearch in true crime, mass murders (like Jonestown, one of my
favourties), and serial killers. Now, I know I probably shouldn't say that the Jonestown massacre is
one of my favourite things, becuase it's not a good thing that it happened. Alright, moving on haha,
as for cars the 1966 Ford Thunderbird in cherry red (you might want to google it) is one of my
favourite cars. There's also the 1963 Ford Thunderbird roadster, it's a sports car, so it's smaller
than the other one. In all honesty, I have no idea why my teacher told us we were doing this, I
think I may have missed the whole explanation of it. However, from what I can gather from classmates
is that this is kind of a advice for the future and guidence with the capstone project? Overall, I'm
fairly neutral about it. I look forward to what this program has to offer!!Mentor 2021-09-25, 13:17:
Thank you! I picked it out myself. ;) That's a really cool way to get into crime -- another phrase
that doesn't come out quite as intended, haha -- and I'm glad that you two had something interesting
to bond over. I don't have as cool a story for my interest; I just liked listening to the ominous
voices of YouTube readers going over new reports I haven't heard of, lol. And hey, the '66 is VERY
nice in red!!! I'm not much of a car person myself, but I've seen many an oldie pass by on the way
to the antique roadshows my hometown used to run semi-regularly and admittedly that's one of the
nicer-looking ones I've seen. Not a bad choice at all. Neutral is totally fair!!! I'm glad to hear
you don't hate the idea outright, at least. :P From what I can see, you aren't required to do
alllllll of the units here, either (although we can if you feel like it when the required ones are
done!), but your teacher has assigned you the Studying, Well-being and Self Care, Entering the Job
Market, Career Considerations, Post-Secondary Considerations, and Paying for School units, so we've
got plenty to start on if we wanna get it done by the end of the term. Hopefully some of it's
interesting to you. QwQ Let's head over to the next page and get through the intro stuff!",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-07, 15:14: Then start here we shall!!! I admit that I can't exactly make a ""calendar""
because my curriculum doesn't include much in the way of actual studying (I do a lot of reading of
course materials literally whenever the free time comes up, so I suppose my ""schedule"" is... a lack
of a schedule?) but I can speak to some of the elements being mentioned here: I prefer to work alone
because I am veeeery easily distracted; I really enjoy music but find that it has to be music
without lyrics or I'll pay more attention to the words in the song than the ones on the page; and
that as far as engaging with text goes, I really enjoy annotating documents as I read them (ie.
underlining and scribbling my thoughts in the margins) because it helps me process what I'm reading
and ensure that I'm actually engaging with it rather than skimming. Outside of that, my ability to
study is a bit of a free-for-all and I don't necessarily suggest taking my example as far as the
time constraints go. :'D How about you?Mentee 2021-10-07, 23:30: Oddly enough there seems to be some
opposites. I'm easily distracted as well. However, I actually need another person with me because
they'll help keep me on track and I can bounce ideas or what I think off them. Listening to music is
what I do when I can't study or do homework with another person. I perfer music with lyrics because
if I happen to be doing a test it's a normal occurrence for me to have song lyrics pop into my head.
Therefore, when I'm studying I can link a certain part of the subject with a song verse or lyric
because my memory isn't great but I can some how remeber every lyric to a song?? Anyways, with me I
find it extremly hard to even just focus for a few minutes on one thing. So, I normally don't study.
Now I know that sounds REALLY bad, but I retain what the teacher is teaching, write down notes if
needed, pay attention, do the work I can in class, that's all I'll do and I'll do well. It's a tad
strange for the lack of a better word.Mentor 2021-10-13, 20:47: Oi, sorry I've taken so long to get
back to you, it's been a hectic week over here and I flew all the way back to BC for Thanksgiving
and had hundreds of pages of homework readings and oiiiiiiiii-- Anyhoo, thank you for sharing your
thoughts on this one! This is really interesting, how much we inherently differ on things -- and yet
I completely feel you on the studying thing, habitually I'm the same way. (Although now that I've
hit my Masters I've reached the point where there's too much to retain naturally... once I figure
out how to cope with that, I'll let you know! :'D) So if you had to choose three strategies from
this module overall that you think might help you to improve a bit in the not-studying department,
what would you try? How would you change things up? (And don't forget to save your answers to your
portfolio so they can be graded later -- by your teacher, not by me, but still, lol).Mentee
2021-10-20, 15:30: Mentee 2021-10-20, 15:46: Mentee 2021-10-20, 15:52: Sorry for the blank mssages,
the chromebooks at my school are not the greatest. I think some hings I should improve on for
studying would probably have to be productivity skills, planning and organizing, and then focus and
consentration. In achieving this I would probably have a set schedule on what I'm studying and when.
That would hopefully help with productivity all of the three.Mentor 2021-10-21, 00:25: No worries!!!
Messages don't cost anything, haha. And hey, a set schedule is a good start -- although you always
have to be careful that it isn't so rigid that it doesn't work for you as an individual human with
other needs and responsibilities. But if your brain is the sort that responds best to structure to
get it in the ""studying zone,"" so to speak, that strategy could really help you! One thing I will
add that has helped a lot for me recently is the use of timers and visual aids -- I picked up an app
called Engross (not plugging it or anything, it's just free and I like it!) that I can use to set
study sessions with little pre-scheduled beeps to tell me when to break/switch tasks, like a version
of the Pomodoro method but better because I get to choose the length of the studying sessions/breaks
rather than adhering to the 25/5 time structure that... frankly doesn't always fit into my day or my
deadlines. So that's a cool thought. And I have a big problem with getting distracted, which the app
helps with too (it has a ""distraction counter"" button that you hit every time you realize you've
lost track of your work, and practicing that helps to encourage mindfulness and reduce slips in the
future). The extension activities include the Pomodoro, so if you haven't heard of that until now
and I'm speaking a little bit of gibberish, feel free to wander over and have a snoop on those too!
:P",,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-27, 15:46: I took a look at the Pomodoro technique and I think I'm going to put it to
the test this week.Mentor 2021-10-28, 12:58: Yay!!! I'm using it today myself to see if it'll keep
me going on an English essay -- let me know how it goes for you! :DMentee 2021-11-22, 12:29: I
completely forgot about this if I’m being honest with you BUT I did do a little reflection on the
pomodoro technique and will be saving it to my portfolio for my teacher. Now, I would probably like
to look into opening the “Finding Inspiration” conversation/module.Mentor 2021-11-23, 00:35: Hey,
you know what??? That is TOTALLY fair and I respect the heck out of it. I'm glad you're back and
raring to go on this stuff, but I'm also glad that you took time to go be a human being. I've done a
lot of that this year myself -- and though it's always important to do your best, what your best
looks like from day to day can vary. Something I've had to contend particularly as a human who took
far too many years to get an ADHD diagnosis and is currently behind in many, many academic things,
so take it from me: you be a human being before all else, my friend. Onto the inspiration module!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047501110,1047541047,9/22/2021 21:11,"Mentee 2022-01-17, 21:50: Sorry for the late response, been super busy!! The idea that stood out to
me was “I believe creation is always an accident. You have to work hard but in the process,
something happens and this is the essence of creation. It’s something that you cannot plan. You have
to do a lot of planning but what is important is not planned.” I related to this idea a lot because
I like to think that the best things come from the places you would never expect and you can't force
things, they just have to fall into place. I think that when it comes time to ""figure out what you
want to do with your life"" people tend to try and move so fast and force things that might not be
meant ot be, but beautiful things will happen when you just work hard, you'll always get somewhere.
Hopefully in my futre I try to keep this in mind because letiing things fall into place is always
the best way to go.Mentor 2022-01-22, 14:27: Hey Kenzie! No problem! Thanks for sharing what stood
out to you the most and your thoughts about it! I am definitely a ""planner"" so it was interesting to
hear your perspective on the unplanned. Something that stood out the me was the quote by Léa Pool
""“Not knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life."" I've
always been a planner and like the stability of knowing what I was going to be doig with my life
(high school, university) and then I graudated form university and have no idea what's next!
Learnign to the live with that uncertainty has been challenging but also great. Also, I know your
teacher made eMentoring optional for the rest of term, so no pressure to continue if you don't want
to or don't have time. Of course, I would love ot keep chatting with you, but I know how busy grade
12 is, so it's completely up to you :)",,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-27, 20:40: So I assume I ask you one of these questions now, I wanna ask which
strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking.Mentor 2021-10-29, 18:14: Hey Kenzie! I
definitely liked using the ""recall what you know strategy"". In my first two years of university, I
never used it. Instead I would read my notes and highlight important things and my grades were way
worse than when I started testing myself on the information even though I spent more time reading
notes and highlighting. I also liked to use quizlet to do this. I would make up my own test
questions, create answers from my notes and textbook, and then practice the quizlet whenever I had a
chance. What are you favourite ways ot study?Mentee 2021-10-29, 19:41: I definitely agree that ""the
recall what you know"" strategy is the most useful for me. For most of my years in high school, I
never had to study. I was very fortunate that I picked up and retained informal very well.
Obviously, now being in grade 12 I have a lot of material to retain, so I have found that to be the
best method for me although I haven't explored much. I also love using quizlet. I find that applying
the material I have learned by quizzing myself on it helps to to retain in.Mentor 2021-11-01, 14:39:
That's great!! I was the same way - in highschool I didn't have to study too much. Have you found
any ways of studying that don't work for you?Mentor 2021-11-12, 14:18: Hey Kenzie! I hope you're
having a great long weekend! I miss chatting with you :) Let me know if there's anything I can help
withMentee 2021-11-15, 14:11: Hi Brookelynn! Sorry, I thought responded, but I guess I didn't send.
Did you ever do a capstone project in highschool?Mentor 2021-11-16, 21:57: Hey Kenzie! No worries at
all :) that's happened to me tons of times. I didn't do a capstone project but I had something
called grad transitions where I presented about what I accomplished high school and my plans for
after grad to a panal. What do you have to do for grad capstone? Also - let me know when you want to
start a new conversation and which one you want to do :) No rush at all though!Mentee 2021-11-17,
16:37: For a capstone project we have to create a passion project that essentially has to do with
something you want to do in your future. We can start a new conversation now, you can chose one if
you would like! I dont have any preference.Mentor 2021-11-21, 14:21: That sounds fun! What are you
thinking of doing for your capstone project? Okay :) I'm opening the conversation on well-being and
self-care now!",,,,"Mentee 2021-11-23, 11:49: Okay sweet :) What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that
indicate you need to be taking better care of yourself?Mentor 2021-11-28, 14:33: Hi Kenzie! I'm so
sorry It's been longer than 3 days since you sent your message! I meant to message you on Thursday
telling you I would respond today and it completely slipped my mind (maybe a clue I needed to do
some self care?) haha. I know when I need to be taking better care of myself when it takes me a long
time to fall asleep at night, I am forgetting things on my to-do list or all of the things I have to
do feel impossible to finish, and just overall feeling down. I think the first indicator is when I'm
not doing the things on my to-do list, but sometimes I let it get past that point and the other
thinsg I mentioned start to happen. How do you know when you need to do some self-care?Mentee
2021-11-30, 12:54: No worries! My biggest indicator that I needvto do some self-care is that i start
to forget things and missing important tasks and due dates. I also notice that I have trouble with
my thinking because I overthink everything haha.Mentor 2021-12-03, 20:27: Oh my gosh! I can relate
to over-thinking everything! When I'm feeling that way, it's almost like I'm so overwhelmed I can't
even decide where to start. Usually, when that happens it helps be to write a list of things to do
(inlcuding easy things like making my bed or something) and then I start by completing one of the
easy things. Do you know what self-care activities usually help you feel better?Mentee 2021-12-06,
13:59: Making lists definitely helps me a ton too! Sleep I think is one of the biggest, but hardest
things that make me feel better. Little things that can make me feel better are sitting down and
eating a meal with no distractions, hanging out with friends, or taking a bath. What self-care
activities make you feel better?Mentor 2021-12-08, 19:05: Those are awesome! I agree with sleep! The
one that I use the most often I think is going for a walk while listening to a podcast! It really
helps me to get outside for a few minutes, off my phone and laptop. Do you think self-care might be
harder when you've started doing your schooling to become a massage therapist?Mentee 2021-12-10,
15:18: I agree, spending time on technology definitely has an impact on my mental health as well. I
think self-care will be a bit more difficult when I am doing my schooling to become a massage
therapist. However, I think that with the course load I have right now, I have built a lot of skills
regarding self-care. I also think things might be a bit easier because I will be living with my
boyfriend and no longer be doing long distance, also being in highschool there is a lot going on
within my friend group that can be stressful, so I think it will be good to be away from that which
will help with being more self aware for self care I think.Mentor 2021-12-14, 12:27: That's great!
Yeah, when I started university I found there was a bit of an adjustment period where self care was
a challenge and then after that I figured out how to balance my life a little better. Post-secondary
is nice because, at least for me, I felt like I had more control over my friend group and who I was
spending time with. I grew up in a small town too where you're like basically always with the same
group of people. Long distance is super stressful! My boyfriend and I have done it on and off for
the last year-ish too, so I feel you! hahaMentee 2021-12-14, 16:31: I also grew up in a small town,
so I think it will be nice to expand out from the same friend group anyway! Do you think we are able
to another conversation?Mentor 2021-12-17, 16:15: Definitely! Which conversation would you like to
start?Mentee 2021-12-29, 23:08: Okay how about finding inspiration?Mentor 2022-01-05, 19:55: I hope
you had an awesome Christmas! The finding inspiration conversation is open :)",,"Mentee 2021-10-07, 15:42: Hey! I'm Kenzie, your mentee! I'm in grade 12 and want to be a massage
therapist after post secondary.Mentor 2021-10-07, 19:45: Hey Kenzie! I'm Brookelyn and I'm so
excited to meet you :) At univesity I studied biology and psychology and one day I would like to be
a doctor. How is grade 12 going so far? I remember it being a lot of fun with my friends but also
super stressful at times. Massage therapy is such a cool field! Why do you want to do that after you
graduate?Mentor 2021-10-15, 13:33: Hey Kenzie! I hope you've had a super great week! I'm so excited
to get to know you :) If you are confused about anything to do with eMentoring I can totally help
you!Mentee 2021-10-15, 14:18: Hi Brookelyn! Grade 12 is stressful yes, this semester I have CLC,
English, Pre-calc, Comparative Cultures, and Bio online so very busy. On top of that I also have a
part time job! I want to do massage therapy because I have always been interested in the human body,
but was not willing to go to school for a very long time to become a doctor of sorts.Mentor
2021-10-18, 12:57: Wow! That's so much on your plate! I worked part time during grade 12 too as a
cashier at a grocery store, and I didn't love it at the time but I'm really happy I did now!
Awesome, it's so cool that you know what you want to do and don't want to do :)Mentee 2021-10-19,
11:45: Yes, it's a lot! The job I have is great because I can do homework while I am at work. You're
going to school to become a doctor right? What kind of doctor?Mentee 2021-10-21, 15:04: Hey
Brookelyn! Do you think it would be possible to get started on our first conversation?Mentor
2021-10-22, 00:26: Hi Kenzie! It's awesome that you can do homework at your job :) I am not in
school to be a doctor yet, I just finished degree in biology and psychology this past April and am
applying to medical schools now. yes we absolutely can!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've just unlocked our first convo: Wellbeing and Self Care! Just a brief overview of how each
convsation works: both of us will read through the text in eacher sections and also any links or
videos that are provided as well, and then we'll discuss what we learned and how things we learn
here might be implemented in the future. I actually found this section SUPER helpful from a
univeristy perspective because you are on your own taking on a lot more responsiblty than maybe
you're used to and it can all get very overwehelming really quickly. So with you being in your last
year of high school, have you been in any situations where you've felt completely
burnout/overwhelmed and what did you find helped you to get through it? Personally, my two first
years at uni i would ignore if i was feeling rundown and just power through (working from 8am to
10pm) until the semester was over which, looking back, was a horrible stratgey because it wasn't
very enjoyable and super tireing. There's definitly days where you can't finish everything you want
to get done so now I make myself stop working around 6-7 at night no matter what so that I can spend
a few hours doing whatever i want! I also found that making myself go to the gym 3+ days a week was
also a great way to deal with stress as well. Let me know what you think!Mentee 2021-11-29, 14:03:
Hey Izzy, it is snowing here and getting pretty cold, but that also means the ski hill should be
good this year which is exciting! So I feel burnt out a lot. I like to either workout or play
basketball for 2 hours after school so I get home around 5:30- 6:00. Then I get home and am really
tired and need to study/ do homework most days of the week. It's hard to put in quality work when
you're like this. But I make sure I don't study too late because I value my sleep and know I'll feel
bad tomorrow if I don't get enough. But I know when I start university I'll have to prioritize
school to my best ability, so that might mean not working out as long so I can for more time and
energy to study.Mentor 2021-12-01, 13:33: Hi Kayden, thats super exciting to hear that its snowing!!
My parents just sent me a video of it snowing in my hometown so i'm feeling pretty ready to go back
to the Kootenays and get in as much ski hill time as i can (in Victoria its rainy through
november-january :( so i'm excited for a break from that). Wow it sounds like you are very busy and
it's definitly difficult to get any work done after a full day like that. It's great to hear that
you're concious about how much sleep you get because a lot of people sacrifice their sleep for work
which often doesn't work out great for them in the long run. I agree that in Univserity you may have
to switch around your schedule a bit but a good hack is to take advantage of what part of the day
you're most productive - for me i really love working out or playing sports throughout the week and
I don't want to have to give that up for studying, so because i know that i'm a morning person, I
try and get a good amount of work done in the mornings and then excersize in the evening when I have
trouble focusing - but you can play around and figure out what works best for you! Is there anything
that you like to do that helps you bounce back from feeling burnt out after a long day?Mentee
2021-12-06, 13:18: Hey Izzy, yeah I also feel like I am a morning person so doing work In the
morning then doing my others activities like working out or playing some basketball could be really
beneficial. It's nice because I'll be tired but not have to to as much work. what I like to do to
bounce back from a long day is to, get lots of sleep, have a nice bath/shower or just relax in
general to take my mind off school and other stresses. It helps me a lot, especially if im already
tired. I can relax and recharge before I do more homework and studying.Mentor 2021-12-08, 12:55:
Hello! It sounds like you're super concious of what you need to do to keep yourself from becoming
overexauhsed and how to deal with burn out if it happens so thats great to hear! A really common
thing I see with people entering first year uni is that they think that try to be busy all the time
to feel ""productive"" but its really more about being efficeint and knowing how you yourself work
best. An important thing to remember is that taking time just to chill shoudn't be considered not
productive (i have to constantly remind myself of this). Since it sounds like you've got a good
grasp on how to support yourself, are there any other selfcare/wellbeing things you want to go over
or anything you're looking for tips on?Mentee 2021-12-10, 15:38: Hey Izzy, I think you've given me a
good understanding on how well being and self care fits into university so thanks. Are you ready to
move on to another topic like finding inspiration maybe?Mentor 2021-12-14, 14:25: Hey Kayden, that
sounds good! You're also welcome to check out any of the extension activities assocaited with any of
the sections as well if you're interested in pursing any of the topics further on your own!Mentor
2021-12-14, 14:29: Ok I've just unlocked finding inspiration, before we move onto that, you just
need to click on complete conervsation link above to fill out a little survey about the section
wellbeing and selfcare and then we can move on!",,"Mentor 2021-09-24, 13:35: Hey Kayden, I'm Isabella/Izzy and I thought I’d just tell you a bit about
myself to get us started off. I'm in my fourth year of studying biochemistry at the University of
Victoria; I moved to Victoria from the Kootenays so its super cool to hear that you're from
Rossland. One of my favourite things during Christamas break is to get my snowboarding in at
Whitewater and Red since there's no good hills on the island. When I do get some free time during
school, I love grabbing food with friends, working out and trying new things (trying to learn to
skateboard currently). What classes are you taking this year and/or specific ones that you’re
excited for? How are you feeling for graduation? Physiotherapist sounds like a great goal, I just
took a human anatomy class last year and really loved it. As I said before, I graduated high school
from rural community so I have experiance moving from a small area to a much larger one and even
though its a little intimidating, Victoria's been an amazing place so far (once I figured out the
bus system) and I’m super happy that I made the move out here. If you have any questions right off
the bat just let me know, I’d love to try and answer them! Other than that, I'm excited to hopefully
give you some insight into life after high school.Mentor 2021-10-13, 12:57: Hey! Just let me know a
little bit about yourself and if you have any questions about the program, then we can start working
on the different conversations!Mentee 2021-10-21, 15:38: Hey Izzy it's Kayden, sorry for the late
response, it's been really hectic at school and I didn't get around to responding. Somethings about
me are I like do play basketball, ski and working out with friends. I think it's cool that you're
leaning to skateboard because I have lots of friends who love to do it too! So for post secondary,
I'm planning on becoming a physiotherapist. I need a bachelors of science so I thinking on going to
a smaller campus for my first year called Selkirk, and then transfer to UBC to complete the three
last years of the program. I haven't applied yet but will very soon. Do you have any tips for
applying and any suggestions for my plan?Mentor 2021-10-25, 17:46: Hey Kayden! I think your plan of
starting off at Selkirk for your first year and then transfering to a bigger campus like UBC sounds
great. Since UBC is such a big campus compared to even UVic, going from a small town to UBC straight
out of high school can be a massive shift and pretty overwhelming so I honestly think what you've
got planned is perfect (and you'll save a bit of money too which is always a plus). Application/tips
wise, I think Selkirk is pretty straightforward to apply/get into but i would recommend looking into
what the univeristy transfer requirements are for UBC to get an idea of what their requirements are
for grades and classes. Its good to know what you're grades would have to be since UBC it is a bit
more competive. Do you know what bachelors program you're interested in before applying to
physiotherapy (biology, chem...etc.)? Since I'm in Biochemistry, I've kinda got my foot in two
worlds so i can answer any questions you might have about that what the program might look like or
any of the other science programs. Also if you're ready to move forward with the program, just let
me know and then we can start the ""working through this program intro""!Mentee 2021-11-03, 17:25: Hey
Izzy! So I’m thinking of choosing biology because I feel that chemistry is harder but what do you
think? What are the courses like compared to high school? Also I’m ready to start moving through the
program.Mentor 2021-11-04, 17:37: Hello! I think biology is probably a good starting point, its a
bit more memorization than chemsitry (and often people find chemistry harder because it takes a
stronger math background and also its more theorietical - have to visualize molecules and atoms in
your head). And don't stress about it because you can always switch majors too at any point! In
comparrsion to high school, courses are usually a bit more difficult partially because you have to
have to independetly motivate yourself to study and partially because (depending on the prof) they
often ask more in depth questons on exams so you have to really understand the material but you get
used to it. Alright so to begin I'll get you to follow the link above this chat ""Working Through the
Program"" - just read through the information and watch the video and then you can go to the next
link ""Conversation Choices"" to see how the conservations will work. Once you've read through these,
then just check off any of the convseration topics that you're interested in learning more about and
then we'll start working through them!Mentee 2021-11-23, 12:39: Hey Izzy, how's it going? Sorry I
haven't responded for a bit I been pretty busy. I chose finding inspiration, well-being and studying
for the topics. We can start off with anyone you want I don't care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me because I'm not only sure that I'm going to university, but I'm also not applying anywhere in
BC. Although, when I was researching I did come across a variety of programs or career options I was
either, not previously aware of, or I didn't even think to peruse. The exact number that I'm making
per year does not nessassarily matter to me to much, but at the level that I would like to peruse my
education there aren't many extremely low paying options. I have to do quite well in university for
any career plan that I have at the moment. My brother is in med school and he talks to me
extensively about how hard everything was, my dad was a lawyer and complains on the daily the
painful ness of writing the bar, and I understand that Vet school is also quite difficult. All three
options I will have to work very hard in University and try to get A's consistently. I have applied
for Health Sciences and Biology, at Queens, Mcgill, UofT, and Uvic.Mentor 2021-12-07, 15:55: Thanks
for getting started and going through the questions at the end. You mentioned that you aren't really
sure that you are going to university, have you considered looking at some of the other options
above such as some possible colleges or other institutes? It's totally fine if you aren't thinking
of applying to anywhere in BC either (I can understand why this particular conversation might be
slightly harder since it doesn't follow your personal plan) but what I would suggest would perhaps
look at some of the colleges and universities outside of BC to see whether any of the programs
interest you and perhaps even reach out to those schools with your questions. Lots of the schools
across Canada have career preparation tabs or counsellors that help prospective students decide on
their plans.Mentor 2021-12-07, 16:04: It's good to hear that through your research you were able to
find some different programs and career options of interest! I remember when I was applying to
schools during my senior year that it was quite tricky as well and there were so many different
things to do. Sometimes it takes people time to see what they would like to pursue and personally,
these experiences are what build a person. I completely understand where you are coming from when
you mention that you have to do well in university for any career plan as life is competitive. (I
feel like we are experiencing the same thing haha). But one piece of advice that I learned is that
everyone is different and sometimes striving to just do your best is all that matters, whether it be
getting all As and a couple of B's to even failing a class, I wouldn't let those things scare you
from wanting to do what you dream of doing. Every person is different and schools consider that when
accepting students from all different backgrounds, I don't think it's solely based on academics, so
don't stress! :) Also, I agree, I've heard similar things about med school, being a lawyer and
attending vet school and they are all quite competitive, but with the right help, you (we) can
achieve it! I try not to let this advice bring me down to reaching my goals :)Mentor 2021-12-07,
16:08: Those are some great schools you have applied to! From that list, which is your top school
choice? I remember when I was applying for universities, I never made it into my first choice of
faculty/major, but after taking some extra time in school I managed to get in and learn new things
along the way! Although it feels like a long journey, I've tried to make the most of it! Before we
move on to the next part of this conversation, is there anything else you would like to discuss/ add
or ask?Mentee 2021-12-10, 15:24: That's great to hear that I'm not alone in this! And haha sorry i
reread what I wrote and it didn't make much sense. To clear things up I am 100% sure I'm going to
university next year. There isn't any other option that interests me honestly. I wouldn't be happy
in the trades, I have already travelled around the world twice so I don't need to take a travel
year, I wouldn't feel pushed doing a gap year, and I don't feel like I could do the best possible at
a college! My top choice is probably Queens or Mcgill. My brother is going to Queens right now for
bio chemical engineering and my dad got into Mcgill Law so I've heard amazing things about their
experiences at both schools. I've applied for Heath Sciences and Biology in both and I hope to get
in. I don't have anymore questions we can move on to the next part of the conversation!Mentor
2021-12-10, 18:14: Haha, no worries thanks for clarifying it! It's nice to know that you have
thought about other possible options though without eliminating them completely, it's always good to
make decisions based on a broad perspective before narrowing, it down because you might even miss
out on some possible opportunities. Those are some great top choices! It's great to hear that you
have some support on the homefront with making decisions and maybe even can provide you with an
inside perspective of what the universities are like haha. I wish you the best of luck with the
application process and hope you get into your desired schools! Awesome, I think I've unlocked the
next part of the conversation..., but please let me know if you are having trouble with it.
Otherwise, we'll continue the conversation there!Mentee 2022-01-07, 18:55: Hey Sorry I've been gone
for so long! Had a rough break, my entire family got covid and I currently have it as well. I'm
ready to start our conversation again, hope you enjoyed your holidays!!❤️Mentor 2022-01-13, 02:52:
Hello and Happy New Year! It's great to hear from you again and yes I had a restful holiday break
:). I'm sorry for the late reply, it's been pretty busy lately. Oh no, that is definitely not a fun
way to spend the holidays! I hope you were still able to find some time to enjoy the holidays and
the snow and I hope you and your family get better soon! It seems like a lot of people are getting
covid these days... hope you aren't feeling too down. I'm ready to continue our conversation again
as well. I believe I've unlocked it. You should have access to it but please let me know if you have
any issues. On another note, I was curious to know if you'll be continuing with this program as I'm
aware that your class may be finishing it soon? Please correct me if I am wrong?Mentor 2022-01-13,
04:08: Also, I have responded to your messages in the ""Post-secondary Considerations-part 2""
conversation. Additionally, (I'm sure you already know this) but I heard that your teacher has
decided to make this mentoring program optional for the rest of the semester. So I wanted to know if
you would like to continue talking and keep up with this program as I am willing to continue being
your mentor. And since the program is no longer required we can also work through any conversations
you would like and discuss any other topic that you might find helpful. Otherwise, if you feel that
you do not want to continue anymore that is okay as well. We can just wrap up our conversation.
Please let me know what you would like to do :)",,,"Mentor 2021-11-12, 17:03: Thanks for completing the evaluation survey for the Well-Being and
Self-Care conversation. We'll move on to Studying now, which I've unlocked. Similar to the last
conversation, please read through the information above and watch the following videos and then we
can start discussing! Perhaps before you watch the video about the 6 study strategies, I'd like to
know what are some studying strategies that you find useful that you use? And how have they helped
you with studying? After you have watched the video: were any of the studying strategies mentioned
similar to ones that you already use and did you learn any new ways of studying?Mentee 2021-11-17,
16:56: I thought the video was very helpful and informative. I use a lot of the tips and tricks that
they discussed but I also learned some new ones! My favourite trick, which they also said was the
most affective, was active recall. Dumping out the contents of your brain either by explaining
concepts and information or writing things down on a piece of paper. It allows me to make
connections and visualize concepts that I didn't think about thouroughly before. Another trick that
I thought was interesting was spacing out your studying. I knew that it was less stressful then
cramping everything in the night before, but I didn't know that it was actually more effective and
allowed you to receive better grades. I'll be trying that for my next test for sure. What is the
most effective way to study for university?Mentor 2021-11-19, 01:59: You watched both videos, right?
Just confirming, so that we can discuss both if you would like to. It's great to hear that you are
learning new information from these videos! I completely agree with you that active recall is an
effective way to study! I personally use this method when studying for specific courses as I find
writing things out and visualizing concepts helps solidify the material more which makes it easier
to retain. And yes, absolutely. Spacing out studying seems to work as well although sometimes it's
understandable if you can't necessarily do this because life gets in the way so cramming is
ultimately the only option haha (If I'm being honest, this happens to me too sometimes). At least
dedicating 1-2 hours a day to study for every class that you're taking should help in the long run
and help with long-term retention of material versus short-term retention.Mentor 2021-11-19, 02:05:
Great question, this is fairly subjective though as it can be different depending on the person, but
I would say the most effective way to study for courses when in university for me is applying all of
the concepts mentioned in the video. Yes, this probably sounds daunting and like a lot of work but
getting through the hurdle of studying effectively in university definitely helps in the long run.
It also depends on the course, active recall helps in most classes but for classes where
calculations are involved, I like to work through as many practice questions as possible to really
understand the material. I also find that spacing out the number of hours studying for different
courses can be tricky when taking a full course load at university, but even if I manage to get
through material for 3/5 courses in one day I consider this an accomplishment and then the next day
I start with the remaining 2 courses. Also, another great way to study (and this can be applied to
high school as well) would be to collaborate with others! Sharing ideas and working through problems
with other students allows for a better understanding of the material and is helpful for all
students.Mentor 2021-11-19, 02:11: Here are some more questions for you to think about: What do you
do when you study for a class? What tips and tricks of your own could you suggest to someone if they
were struggling with studying? And also, what do you find is the biggest issue for you when it comes
to studying? Do you find yourself procrastinating, or getting distracted? If you could please answer
these that would be great, that way I can help you with understanding how to study better and
perhaps offer some other tips.Mentor 2021-11-30, 14:29: Hi Katrina, just wanted to touch base and
see if everything is okay? We haven't spoken in a while and it would be great to continue the
conversations with you! Hope to hear from you soon!Mentee 2021-11-30, 21:13: Yeah sorry i've been so
busy applying for schools! I got side tracked but i'm back now and ready to continueMentor
2021-12-01, 02:07: Thanks for getting back to me, it's great to hear from you! I understand, I hope
applying for schools is going well. This is a really busy time of the year for everyone at the
moment including myself, but at least you can incorporate what you have learned so far from these
conversations to your day-to-day activities, especially during these times (I'm hoping :))Mentor
2021-12-01, 02:09: I sent some thought questions below for you to answer if you scroll through the
messages, but if you are feeling like you understand this conversation pretty well and don't have
any lingering questions, please let me know if you would like to move on to the next module of your
choice.Mentee 2021-12-01, 11:43: I think I understand the conversation quiet well and am ready to
move on to the next module! Which would u recommend next?Mentor 2021-12-01, 14:24: Sounds good!
Would you like to start the Post-Secondary considerations module next?Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:44:
Sounds great!!Mentor 2021-12-01, 15:55: Okay, I'll go ahead and unlock. Like last time, please
complete the short survey before starting the conversation. Please have a read of the material and
we'll message in that conversation :)",,,,"Mentor 2021-10-29, 03:25: Feel free to ask me any questions, such as the ones listed above under the
link to the article, this way we can actually have a conversation about this topic (and perhaps
learn things from one another) :) I've personally encountered many situations where I would put my
self-care and well-being on the back burner (which was not good), but after implementing some of the
tips mentioned in the article and video such as going for walks and getting regular physical
activity, taking breaks from work, drinking lots of water (less coffee haha) and getting enough
sleep (still working on improving this last one though) I've felt a significant change in myself.
I've also found that taking an entire day break from anything school or work-related really helps as
it allows for one day of recuperation throughout the week. So, I'll start us off with the first
question: After watching the video and reading the article, what did you find was the important
takeaway message(s) and what did you find helpful from the video and article? Would you consider
using any of the suggested tips or do you have any other new tips that you could think of?Mentor
2021-10-29, 14:26: Also, just a side note, I was wondering have you had the chance to look through
the ""start here"" items at all? Where it says ""Solo conversations- Talk to yourself"" on the
navigation wheel.Mentee 2021-11-02, 12:30: Sounds great! I think the biggest take away message I
received from the video and article was how important it is to maintain your self care, not just do
it periodically, as well as how self care looks different for each individual. I am notorious for
not taking care of myself probably, I constantly don't receive enough sleep, push myself to far, and
can't seem to delegate. Although, reading the article I narrowed down two points that I want to try
and work on. The first was keeping an agenda. I seem to forget when things are due or procrastinate
until the last minute. In the future I plan to write down my goals, due dates, and designated study
times to make my life easier and more organized. The second point I wanted to focus on was
remembering the basics; throughout the year my sleep schedule, eating, and physical habits seem to
get worse. I crave academic validation, and between that, the strict body norms of dance, and
keeping up socially with my grade, I tend to not take care of myself. To work on this I wanted to
try to go to bed at the same time every night, not party more than once a weekend, and keep up
healthy eating habits. How hard is it to keep a healthy workout routine in university?Mentor
2021-11-02, 15:38: Thank you for your message! Before continuing with the conversation I wanted to
mention that if you haven't had the chance to complete the solo conversations on your own, don't
worry about it but I do recommend having a look through either on your own or even we could go
through them together if you have any questions. I just think it's useful to look through these
topics because the information is quite useful!Mentor 2021-11-02, 15:39: We can finish the
conversations and then work through the solo ones if you want, just let me know what works for
you!Mentor 2021-11-02, 15:56: That's great! And most definitely, maintaining self-care is really
important. I completely understand where you are coming from, it's hard to manage sleeping on time
and keeping up with important tasks, life can get busy! I think the two points you have chosen to
work on are great ways to get started. I agree with the idea of keeping an agenda, personally, I've
always found this useful. Another tip I have on how to stay more organized with your plans (and what
I've found helps) would be in addition to the calendar in your planner maybe even getting a physical
calendar to place in your room on your desk would work. This way you know what you need to get done
just by looking up at the calendar. Having a schedule or your goals posted in many spots helps!
Also, I find colour coding my due dates helps (and it makes it look nice haha). With regards to your
second point, I can definitely relate because it can be very hard to keep everything balanced
between work, school and social life. If this is fine for me to ask, but how are you taking care of
the basics of self-care? Are you taking breaks in-between your schoolwork? Are you getting enough
sleep, how many hours?Mentor 2021-11-02, 16:05: And to answer your question: I find when it's the
start of the term, it's easy to stick to my workout routine. There aren't many things due and its
not exam season yet, but in the middle of the term when exams and assignments start to occur it can
be quite hard to keep up with a healthy workout routine because then I like to allocate that time I
could be working out to my studying. I guess it varies and depends on the individual and how well
they can manage their school course load and coordinate it with their workout routine. The good
thing about university is that you are able to choose your own courses which means you can
essentially make your own schedule, so for me on my days off or when I have an online class where I
can attend it from home then I take at least an hour of my day to work out and this eventually
becomes apart of my schedule. I have another question for you, how important do you find time
management and what role does it play in taking good care of yourself?Mentee 2021-11-03, 12:41: I
find time management very important, even though I struggle with it. I tend to procrastinate until
the last minute to do my assignments, but I cannot hand something in without it being perfect so
I'll stay up until 3 in the morning instead of doing it periodically. To answer your first question
I definitely do not get enough sleep and tend to go on my phone for hours at a time.Mentor
2021-11-03, 14:24: It's nice to know I'm not the only person that struggles with time management and
it's totally normal when people have busy lives. I think implementing the use of an agenda should
help you with this though! I've found that using one has started to help me stay on track. Sleep is
very important, I would say though if you are getting between 6-8 hours each night that is good
enough (based on personal experience of course so it can vary from person to person). And yes, the
phone is a major distraction! I also find myself going on it quite a bit so what I do is I hide it
by placing it in my desk drawer or somewhere else and then only go on it during my study break. That
way it keeps you motivated to do your work! These are just some of the things i've found that help
me so I'm hoping they can help you too! I really enjoyed this conversation we had about well-being
and self-care, great work! Do you have any lingering questions or comment about this topic at all?
If not, please let me know which conversation you would like to work through then this conversation
will be complete. **Just in case forgot and as a reminder your teacher mentioned that the extension
activities are not required as they want you to get through as many conversations as possible given
the limited amount of time you have to complete this program.Mentee 2021-11-05, 18:59: It's so good
to hear that I'm not the only one with these problems! And also what a great tip to keep my phone
out of sight, i'll be trying that while i'm studying for my next test thank you! This was a great
conversation, should we start with Studying next? I think it relates to Well Being and Self care
quite well.Mentor 2021-11-07, 00:16: No worries, I'm happy to offer any helpful tips that may be of
use! Let me know if it works out for you on your next test. And great choice, I was also thinking of
moving on to Studying. I'll open up that conversation.Mentor 2021-11-07, 00:20: We'll have to
complete a survey first before moving on to the next conversation. Please let me know if you are
unable to complete the survey.",,"Mentor 2021-09-24, 15:28: Hi! My name is Zaraah and I'll be mentoring you on this platform

Applied Animal Biology at UBC. After looking through your profile it seems that you are also
interested in pursuing a degree in Applied Animal Biology, which is great! A little bit about myself
as an icebreaker, I enjoy going on hikes and playing sports such as soccer and swimming and I also
enjoy baking. I also like travelling but given the pandemic, it hasn't happened as much recently.
What are some of your hobbies and interests and feel free to tell me more about yourself if you'd
like! Lastly, I'd like to mention if you have any questions, please ask as I am happy to answer
them. I hope to hear from you soon and here's to a fun mentoring experience!Mentee 2021-09-27,
14:11: Hey Zaraah! It's Katrina, and i'm so glad that you're my mentor. I love to dance
competitively, and do it 6 days a week. I love animals and being outdoors. Although, I love shopping
just as much and going to the city. My family travels a lot and we went around the world for 6
months in 2012 and went to south america for 3 in 2018. We also go to hawaii almost every year. What
kind of classes are you taking in Animal Biology? And what field are you thinking of pursuing?Mentor
2021-09-28, 21:04: It's nice hearing back from you. I also enjoy being outdoors as well! And wow
dancing 6 days a week, are you a part of a dance club? It's great to hear a little bit about
yourself and to know that we share many similarities! I also go to Hawaii almost every year. Great
question, for my degree in the first two years its usually general biology, chemistry, English,
physics and math classes, but as I got into my final years then I started taking more environmental
and applied animal biology classes (topics relating more to animals such as reproductive systems in
different animals, animal welfare courses, an equine class (where I got to learn about Horses!) and
of course there are many others to choose from. Originally, I was planning on pursuing a degree in
veterinary studies, but over the last year since a science degree is pretty versatile, I've decided
to go into Optometry. I know it's a completely different field altogether, but I've still enjoyed my
undergrad degree thus far! If you'd like to continue getting to know each other, we can certainly do
that otherwise do you feel that you are ready to move onto the ""Working through this program"" part

I was not aware of how short of a time you attend university, not to mention the difference in
breaks compared to high school. I am a bit nervous when it comes to staying on top of my school
work, but hopefully with some hard work I will be able to get the grades I want. I am excited to be
in a bigger center, but I am also scared that I will be lonely. Although, I've always been a very
social and out going person so hopefully friends won't be hard to come by.Mentee 2021-12-13, 13:20:
I definitely want to stay active while I'm in university. In the article they stated that you should
be keeping a schedule of work for classes and assignments, but I also would like to incorporate a
work out slot in there. Excersicing is an effective way to get out all of my enegery and calm my
mind down. I'm pretty nervous that if I stop excersicing, especially since I dance three hours a day
this year, that it will take a tole on my mental and physical health. What does your syllabus
outline look like?Mentor 2021-12-15, 18:27: Before attending university, I was quite surprised by
the differences between high school and university and the overall transition too! There are much
longer breaks between classes (depending on the university) but I tend to use this time to catch up
with studying or as downtime by hanging with some friends. After the first couple of weeks, you
start to get into a routine and adjusted to the new university lifestyle! Staying on top of the
school work in university can be daunting and stressful, but again after a few weeks maybe even a
few days it gets better :) And of course, there is always the fear of being alone and not making any
friends as soon, but from my experience at UBC, I found that in the first week of classes there were
lots of different opportunities and events to mingle with others that were held for different
faculties and programs. Obviously, this is different for every school, but I would even suggest
beforehand that you take a look at your prospective universities clubs and events just so you have
an idea of what you'd like to join! This is always a great way to meet people!Mentor 2021-12-15,
18:32: Staying active is very important during university. I definitely agree with the article,
keeping a schedule of the work and assignments for classes is always helpful to stay on track. And
then having your schedule all planned out and written in front of you makes it easier to schedule
your work. (This is where the planner and calendar come in hand, as discussed in a previous
conversation, haha ) Always putting your physical and mental health first is SUPER important!! so
making time to do the things that you enjoy and to make you feel relaxed is always good. What are
you most looking forward to in university and what are you least looking forward to?Mentor
2021-12-15, 18:41: I have many different syllabi outlines for my courses, but I'll describe one of
them for you so you can get an idea of what classes would be like: For my cell biology class:
usually, the outline for the entire course includes expectations, textbooks and resources to get,
important contact information, policies and rules for attending classes at the university and what
to do when sick or unable to attend an exam. BUT the most important part is the schedule for
assignments and their deadlines throughout the course as well as the assessment methods and how much
everything counts towards the overall grade. It's also important to know that the syllabi change
every year depending on what worked well and what didn't throughout previous terms. The midterm for
this class is worth 20% and usually occurs during October or November (when it's exam season), then
there is a final worth 50% which happens in December. Now for this class, in order to pass it,
people have to achieve a 35/70 for the overall score of the midterm and final in order for
activities such as the tutorial and class quizzes and worksheets to count for the other 30%. (this
can be super nerve-racking, but luckily not all courses are like this...mainly just the science
ones.) I hope this was enough detail, but please let me know if you have any more questions even
about what I just sent as well for further clarification or just out of interest!",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-07, 00:24: When you have completed the survey, please let me know and I'll unlock the

about the kind of things you look at or find out through the Career Compass if you'd like to share.
Let me know if you have any questions!Mentee 2021-12-08, 16:06: Hi Cicily, thank you for the help I
figured it out. After taking those career considerations quizzes I learned that my most likely
future job will have something to do with health care such as diagnosing and or treating patients.
It showed that the most likely place I would work would be the lower mainland with 30 job openings
their each year. This was helpful and I agree with the job suggestions. I am ready to move on if you
are ready to start another conversation.Mentor 2021-12-14, 20:31: Hi Judah, First of all, sorry for
the late reply! I have finals this week and have been a bit busy with that. I'll be better at
replying from now. That's so interesting. It kind of relates as well to your idea of being a
trainer, because you mentioned in your bio that you'd like people to be healthier. How do you feel
about working in the Lower Mainland? I've opened the paying for school conversation at the top
because I know you're in grade 12, and might be looking at applying for schools soon. Let me know
how you do with that and we can discuss it if you want.Mentee 2021-12-15, 13:03: Hey Cicily, I would
feel good and be happy about working in the lower mainland as I was born there and my sister is
living there currently. After watching the paying for school video the and looking through the
links, the prices ranges and breakdown are mostly what I expected. Some questions I have would be,
what was the most challenging budgeting issue, what was the most surprising thing you learned, and
what advice would you give a grade 12 student looking to go into post secondary?Mentor 2021-12-17,
19:37: Oh, nice that your sister is living here! I would say that the most challenging budget issue
for me is food. When I'm busy with school, assignments, exams and stuff I'm usually too tired to
cook and end up getting take out which is a lot more expensive. What I did this semester is I got a
value pack at our dining hall where you pay for some meals and get some free. It was still more
expensive than cooking, but less expensive than take out, and it was all you can eat. Then I had
some simple stuff to cook on other nights. That saved me a lot of money. But yeah, food was probably
the biggest challenge for me. Fees and housing can be expensive, but you usually pay that up front
and it's done. It's the small stuff that can really add up if you're not keeping track. In terms of
finances, I would say just general advice would be to apply for any bursaries/scholarships through
the University that you might be eligible for. Then I would say when you get to school, find out
what services they have for students. Like the Student Union here at SFU has a Food Bank program
where you can get a grocery store voucher for use in the semester no questions asked if you're a
student. Also, finding out how your student health insurance works, and if there are any
optometrists, physios, dentists etc... that offer discounts to students can really help. I didn't
know anything about SFU student medical insurance until recently, and it would have saved me money
if I had known. Just really - find out what's available to you. Feel free to ask some more
questions, I've also unlocked Finding Inspiration at the top since you selected that one at the
bottom.",,,"Mentor 2021-12-14, 20:33: Feel free to go through the links and let me know what you think.
Budgeting and school fees is something I've defintiely had to deal with.Mentee 2022-01-10, 12:36:
Hey Cicily, I'm not sure if my last message went through but after looking at the links and reading
through the questions I was wondering what was the most challenging budgeting issue for you and what
surprised you about money management in your first year of post secondary?Mentor 2022-01-11, 22:34:
Hi Judah, Yeah your last message did come through. Did my reply to you not go through? I can see it,
but sorry if you can't! I replied under your last comment on the Career Considerations tab. I'll
copy and paste it again here: Oh, nice that your sister is living here! I would say that the most

interesting that it's the small things that really add up and make a difference. I eat a lot so I
think food would be a challenge for me as well. I'll take a look at finding inspiration now!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-23, 16:20: Hi Judah! It’s nice to meet you! So cool that you’re into sports. Do you
play hockey then? What kind of writing do you do? I really like going to watch games at my
university. I like watching basketball, and it’s volleyball season right now so I’ve been going to
those games a lot. For the get to know you prompts, I chose: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: I
took this photo last week. These are some of the residence building on campus. The sky always looks
so cool at sunset. Food for thought: I just chose this photo of some really great nachos that I got
at a restaurant in Charlottetown a couple of years ago. They were really good and it was also the
first trip I planned on my own. I took a bus up to PEI from Halifax. I look forward to hearing back
from you! CicelyMentor 2021-10-15, 13:13: Hey Judah, Just checking in! Would be great to hear back
from you when you've got some time. Maybe over the weekend?Mentee 2021-10-21, 14:17: Hi Cicely,
Sorry about not getting back to you I was having trouble with this site. Yes I play hockey for my
local Jr. B team and I practice and affiliate with the local Jr. A team. I don't do much writing,
but I enjoy it when I get the chance writing essays and story's in English class. That's cool that
you go watch the games, which University are you attending? I'm looking forward to starting a
conversation. JudahMentor 2021-10-25, 13:52: Hey! No problem, I know the site can be weird
sometimes. I go to SFU in Burnaby, and I went to college before that. I'm in my last year. Awesome
that you're on the Jr. B team! Anyway, feel free to select some conversations on the bottom of the
page (below the messages). There are some that your teacher wants you to do, and then feel free to
choose some others if you want. I can open one once you've chosen.Mentee 2021-11-02, 17:06: Hey, I
chose four different conversations for you to view at the bottom.Mentee 2021-11-15, 12:52: Hey
Cicely, Haven’t heard from you in a while just wondering what my next steps going forward should
be.Mentor 2021-11-15, 13:13: Hey Judah! I unlocked Career Considerations last week. If you scroll up
and look at the wheel, it should be in a different colour and be clickable. Let me know if you can't
access it.Mentor 2021-11-22, 21:57: Hey Judah, Hope you're doing well. Let me know if you can't
access the section I unlocked.Mentee 2021-12-02, 13:14: Hey Cicely, I think I can access it but I'm
not really sure what my next step should be. Would you be able to let me know what I should be doing
going forward? ThanksMentor 2021-12-06, 21:29: Hi Judah, Sure! You can scroll up to the wheel at the
top of the page, and ""Career Considerations"" should be a different colour from the others. The
conversations change colour when I open them. Once you're there, you can read the text and click on
the links offered in the text and then we can talk about them. So like, Career Considerations has a
link to the WorkBC Career Compass quizzes and then it'll explain what jobs might be good for you
based on your results. You can go through the page and let me know when you're done, and what you
thought of it. We can talk about the results a bit, and about what you want you want to do for a
job/career. Then once you feel good about it, we can move on. Then we just do that for each of the
required sections. It doesn't have to be a lot of conversation per section, as long as you feel
comfortable with what you've gone through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that. In the meantime I unlocked Career Considerations for you to explore to help you see how to
decide on a career. ThanksMentee 2021-11-15, 11:53: What do you recomend is the best way to study? I
find i'm not very efficent and get disracted easily.Mentee 2021-11-15, 12:38: I love living in rural
areas. But most post secondary institutions are in big citys. Im going to try and go to a university
in a bigger city. Do you have any advice for living in a larger place?Mentor 2021-11-23, 16:19:
Different things work for different people regarding the best way for studying. Over the years, I
have found that it is important to limit all your distractions, for example, put your phone away for
a certain amount of time. For me, I usually study for fifty-minute to one-hour periods with 10-15
minute breaks in between. I try to avoid studying at home because my home contains a million
distractions. Another way that works for me is making a precise schedule on google calendar. I write
what I need to study and for how long. This trick keeps me focused the entire day. My friend makes a
checklist for the entire week, on a notebook. He crosses all the things he has done as he does
them.Mentor 2021-11-23, 16:28: I think it is important to budget your money. Think about the amount
of money you have coming in from your parents/scholarships/loans/jobs. Put away your tuition money,
rent money, grocery spending, any other important bills you pay. Once you have figured how much
money you have left to spend on leisure activities, spend some of it doing things you love. Explore
this new city, your new campus. Meet new people and make friends and go out with them. Usually,
public transportation is plenty in bigger cities, so take advantage of that. Considering all that,
make sure you give yourself the space and time you need to spend it on just you. I say that because
it is easy to get lost sometimes doing things that you are required to do, but give yourself time to
check in with yourself once in a while.",,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-20, 15:26: What's the best way to find out what I wanna do? I really enjoy physics
and sports but have no idea where to go. JohannMentor 2021-11-08, 18:08: Hi Johann, I apologize for
not being able to get back to you earlier. I have been having some computer issues, so thank you for
being so patient with me. My name is Shania and I am currently a Physics and Theater undergrad at
Simon Fraser University. I have finished my Theater major and now working on my Physics major. In
your message, you said you really enjoy Physics, but don't know where to go. I think it is great
that you don't know where you want to go because that's a beautiful journey of self discovery and
enlightenment. To help you with that question, I want to ask you what is it that you enjoy about
physics so far and why? Here is a quote that I would like to share with you from Einstein: ""The most
incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."" I am sharing this because I
have thought about this ever since I started studying physics and it might help you in your
self-discovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as you work through the above materials. Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-30, 18:21: I wasn't super sure
what we were supposed to do here but I chose a quote and will say what it means to me. I chose: “Not
knowing sometimes brings the biggest change, the most important change in your life.” I think that
all of my hardest situations in life have always been the ones with the biggest changes and the
scariest unknowns. I am typically able to foresee how my future will be to an extent and how I can
get there, so I usually know the right choice to make. However, from my experience, the situations I
have been in where I was very unsure what would happen in the future have always turned out for the
best and have had a positive outcome that has made me stronger. I think that the unknown can be
scary, but life holds so many unknowns and it is impossible to predict everything, so new situations
make us stronger and wiser for our futures. The unknown can also bring big changes, as said in the
quote. While change can be terrifying, it is necessary for us to grow and learn, so it is a
necessity. Learning to accept change is something I am always working on and I have done my best to
become more comfortable with letting my future take ""the ropes"" of my life and learning to accept
whatever outcome I am given. I think that this quote was one that really made me think about my life
a lot. It provoked a big reflection and I think that I will try and remember it for the future and
the idea that the unknown and change are necessary and will get easier as I gain more
experience.Mentee 2021-11-30, 18:22: Oops sorry, I sent it to the wrong one! I will fix that!Mentee
2021-11-30, 18:24: I think I've got it in the right place?Mentor 2021-12-01, 23:41: Hey Jaden! Yes,
this is the right place! Thanks for sharing the quote and your experience of why it is meaningful to
you! I agree, it can be hard to plan out every little detail and when things don't go as planned it
can be a difficult thing to accept. Well done on your reflection! You have lots of wisdom there :)

discuss what you've learned in the module! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-12-08, 15:06: Hey Katie! I have
looked into budgeting a lot for this course and I have a pretty good handle on it. However, I do
know that I will be basically broke after I come back from my gap year of traveling, so it's a good
thing I want to go to a nearby college so I can live at home! I do have a few questions for you
regarding school and budgeting... What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? What do you
recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? What was the most surprising
thing you learned about yourself and money management in your first year of post-secondary
education? How did you keep track of all the money and all the payment dates? Money is something
that stresses me out a lot and I just spent a lot on my truck so my money has gone down a lot. I
have been working a lot more to make up for that and make money to travel, but I know working 5 days
a week is not substantial when in college or university, so any tips you have would be great! Thanks
a bunch, JadenMentor 2021-12-10, 12:42: Hey Jaden, Well done at thinking about the topics in this
module! Where are you planning on traveling? That will be so fun! Living at home can be super
helpful for many reasons. Having support from your family during your transition to University can
be helpful in addition to the cost-saving components. The most challenging budgeting issue I
experienced during university was trying to figure out how to keep track of all of my expenses. When
I went to University for my first degree I had financial support from my parents as well as my own
savings to fund my tuition. When I completed my nursing degree I used student loans to pay for the
tuition. The student aid BC website has fantastic resources for budget planning (available to
anyone) that I have been using since beginning my studies in nursing. The resources allow you to
keep track of all expenses which is helpful for your time in school and beyond. As for part-time
work and school, I always worked throughout both of my degrees. An important aspect for me was to
have good time management skills and planning ahead. When you start the semester it's a good idea to
get a planner and put in all of the dates for any assignments or exams. That way you can effectively
plan ahead to complete those items while you work part-time. One surprising thing that I learned
(and continue to learn) is that managing money can be fun if you effectively budget and plan ahead.
Utilizing the budget planning documents from student aid BC is super helpful for this! To keep track
of all of the payment dates I would either put them in my planner for school or my phone calendar. I
am definitely a super organizer and it's definitely an important skill to refine as you begin your
post-secondary studies :) Great questions Jaden! Let me know if you have any questions about my
responses! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-12-16, 13:09: Hey Katie! I am planning on going to Ghana in
Africa to volunteer teach English. After that I am hoping to do some travelling around London,
England with some family and I also really want to go to Bali, Greece and Italy! Thank you so so
much for all that helpful info! It answered all of my questions perfectly and it makes perfect
sense! I am a very organized person too so I think keeping eevrything organized should be no problem
at all:) Its almost the break woohoo! I am so excited for some relaxing time! JadenMentor

great holiday season! :) Cheers, KatieMentee 2022-01-05, 13:10: Hey Katie! I had a great holiday
season and am happy to have the extra week off to relax as I just injured myself on Monday! I was
skiing and I hit a tree with my knee. I have a bad bone bruise and the doctors wern't sure if
anything was torn so I am on crutches and in a leg brace for the time being. It sucks not being able
to ski but I am relieved that I dont have to hobble around at school for a while. It is my left leg
too so I can still drive! How was your holiday season? Should we move on to the next module? Thanks
a million, Jaden:)Mentor 2022-01-05, 19:45: Hey Jaden! I'm so sorry to hear about the accident. I

on to the next! :) Cheers, Katie",,"Mentor 2021-10-21, 02:26: Hey Jaden, I have unlocked the 'studying' conversation for us to use. Let
me know if you have any specific questions as you read over the material above. Have a great week!
KatieMentee 2021-10-21, 14:39: I personally am a very visual person, so I tend to need something
physical to study with. Usually, what works best for me is rereading all the material I have learned
and then jotting down key notes about it on a separate piece of paper. The more information for me
to go over while studying, the better. This means that I usually take a lot of notes during class. I
have a very good memory so I can usually memorize the information after reading it over a few times.
I have excellent focus and concentration so I am able to study in any environment and not get too
easily distracted. I am extremely motivated and find it very difficult to procrastinate as it causes
me more stress, so I very rarely put off what needs to be done. I take into account all of this when
studying for tests and exams and try to leave plenty of study time for myself before the big
day.Mentor 2021-10-23, 21:27: Hey Jaden! How's your week going? That all sounds excellent! It sounds
like you have a great idea of what works best for you. When I first started university I had to
switch up how I did things and sort of ""re-learn"" how to study with limited time. This can be a
tough stressor for students as they transition from high school to university. Do you have any
specific questions about studying in university? Cheers! KatieMentee 2021-10-25, 12:04: Hey Katie!
My week was busy last week but good! I had a bit of a crazy weekend and ended up taking care of some
people who had a bit of a rough time at a party (my first aid training came in handy). It was a good
learning experience for me and at the end of the night I was more aquainted with the roles of
paramedics. I also got told that based on how I handled the situation I would be a great nurse, so
that made me super happy! How was your weekend? Yeah that does sound a bit stressful. Do you have
any studying tips or tricks to help maximize studying in limited time? Also, what is your favourite
study technique? Thanks, Jaden:)Mentor 2021-10-26, 18:53: Hey Jaden! How's your week going? You must
be getting excited, you're almost done with school! That sounds like an interesting experience! I
hope everyone is okay. Certainly, a good experience for you, and it sounds like you received some
great feedback My weekend was good! I've been working and doing school work The study tips I would
suggest trying out is reading and/or reciting the lecture notes 2-3 times. The first time have the
intention to just read over the notes, the second and third time try reading the beginning of the
sentence or bullet point and then close your eyes as a test for yourself to see if you can remember
the corresponding information. I've tried many techniques and this was a method that one of my
biology profs suggested and I find it works well for me! Everyone is different and you have to find
what works for you, but this might be worth a try! How do you manage your time while in school? Do
you have any questions in regards to time management in University? Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-10-27,
17:05: Hey Katie! Yup, I'm beyond excited to be done school soon! I've been literally counting down
the days! It definetly was an interesting experience and one that I will never forget! Everything
turned out okay in the end and everyone was all safe (a huge relief!) I'm glad you had a good
weekend:) Thanks for your studying tips! I'll try those for sure! I try and get as much work done in
class and for my time managament. I have a detailed scedhule and checklist that I follow everyday in
order to fit in everything I have going on right now. I try and prioritize school and then if I have
time I do other things as well. Do you have any tricks for time management in Uni and life in
general? Its something I struggle with.. Thanks so much, Jaden:)Mentor 2021-10-28, 21:39: Hi Jaden!
I'm glad to hear that everyone is okay and the situation turned out well in the end! Time management
can be a tricky one :) It's still something I struggle with at times, especially now that I'm
working as a nurse and still a student in grad school. It can be hard to carve out the time to do
enjoyable activities or exercise, but trying to maintain that work-life balance is to important! For
Univerisity specifically, I always take a few hours at the beginning of the semester to write out
all of the semester's assignments, exams, and projects that are due so that I can formulate a plan
for when I'm going to complete the components. Have you ever tried this? I'd also recommend trying
to schedule in time for activities that you enjoy! This way it makes it a bit easier to go and do
them. Having a planner is a must! You can get one from the school or buy one yourself. Whichever
works for you! Have you ever tried any of these strategies? Cheers, KatieMentor 2021-11-17, 21:37:
Hey Jaden! I haven't heard from you in a while and wanted to touch base to see how you're doing! :)
Hope all is well! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-18, 15:09: Hey Katie! Super sorry I haven't responded
in so long:( I've been crazy busy with school and I've been working a lot more as well to make more
money because I just bought a truck! I finished my online course yesterday (psych 12) which was 2.5
months early so I'm proud of that! Me and my boyfriend also just broke up so that has been a bit
rough...:( Thank you for the time management advice! And yes, I do like to plan and write out a full
schedule for school before I begin it:) I have also been working really hard on making time to chill
out and do some at-home workouts and it's been helping my mental health and happiness levels so
much! Another thing that I have been doing is volunteering during school hours in classrooms 3 times
a week (for a school project) which has been really fun and volunteering always makes me happy!
Working with kids is so great and I'm excited to become a nurse and get to meet new people all of
the time!! How have you been? Hows work? I can't believe that it's only a few weeks until Christmas
break! Do you have any Christmas plans? You rock! JadenMentor 2021-11-19, 20:15: Hey Jaden! Nice to
hear from you :) No worries at all! Congrats on the truck and on finishing your class! I'm sorry to
hear about you and your boyfriend breaking up. I hope you are okay. That's awesome that you've been
making more time for self-care activities! It really does make such a big difference in our wellness
:) Are you still on track to finish school and graduate at the end of December? So close! I've been
great. Working a lot but had a chance to relax over the reading break last week :) I am looking
forward to Christmas also! I have to work the holiday this year (part of a career in nursing!) but
I'm excited to do some festive activites also. I will admit I just put up my Christmas tree! What
are your holiday plans? Should we start the next module now? :) Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-22,
20:19: Hey! Thanks so much for the congratulations that's so sweet! I'm okay after the breakup, it
was for the best and I've been focusing on myself a lot more now. Yes, self-care helps so so much:)
The semester actually ends on January 31st, so I'm very very close (70 days away!), and yes I am
still set to graduate then! Haha, that's exciting about your Christmas tree! We are going to cut
ours down soon I think! We have plans to go to Radium for a few days with my favorite cousins and
Aunt and Uncle over the break which will be a lovely little vacation! Starting the new module sounds
great! Also, this mentoring thing has been really great for me and I've learned so much! Thanks for
being a wonderful mentor, Katie! Talk soon, Jaden:)Mentor 2021-11-27, 05:31: Hey Jaden! That's so
exciting!! Two more months and then you will be done! I am excited for you! Any plans for after?
Sounds like a fun vacation to look forward to! It's almost winter break :) Thanks for the feedback,
Jaden. I'm glad you are enjoying it :) I will open a new module now! Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-11-29,
13:25: Hey! I am hopefully going to Mexico for a few weeks once I am done with school as I have some
friends there:) I can't wait for winter break! Do you have any fun winter plans? JadenMentor
2021-11-30, 12:30: Hey Jaden, Wow! That will be so fun! A well-deserved vacation :) I am looking
forward to a break from my master's program over the next few weeks! As well as spending time with
my family and friends! KatieMentee 2021-11-30, 18:05: Hi! Yes, I am very excited! That sounds lovely
and like a well-deserved break for you as well:) JadenMentor 2021-11-30, 18:21: Hi Jaden, Are you
able to see the new module that I opened? Just want to make sure you can see and navigate it!
Cheers, Katie",,,,"Mentor 2022-01-11, 17:58: Hey Jaden, I've unlocked the next module. Let me know if you have any
questions are you work through it. Have a great week! KatieMentee 2022-01-12, 15:21: Self care is
somewhat important for me to think about (one of my goals is to consider it more.) However, I am a
very busy person, so it tends to slip my mind as I am usually distracted with school, work, injuries
and other things. Management plays a massive role in taking care of myself, as I need to properly
manage my time and plan my day accordingly if I wish to have time to practice self-care. My mom is
someone who models self-care on a daily basis and I respect how well she takes care of herself. It
is good for me to live with someone who treats themself so well, as I can have easy access to
in-person role modelling. One of the signs that I have noticed that has led me to believe that I
need to take better care of myself is my constant exhaustion. Despite how much sleep I get, I am
almost always tired. This exhaustion is mental, emotional and physical. I am very good at most
basics of taking care of myself, but sometimes I forget or slack off. I am good at eating healthy
food, as that is what my family always has in our house and what we typically eat. I do my best to
get adequate sleep and go to bed at a good time but often find myself laying awake with a busy and
stressed mind. I struggle with drinking enough water at school as we have very few breaks and my
waterbottle doesn't fit in my backpack. I try to workout and move my body as much as possible. This
might mean skiing, ski touring, going on walks or at-home workouts (if I am unable to do outside
activity.) I struggle immensely from taking breaks from my job and school work and I belive most of
my exhaustion comes from overworking myself. I am excited for when I am done school and I no longer
have to focus on it and carry all the typical highschool worries. How did you manage self-care in
highschool? what do you like to do as self-care? Do you have any advice for self-care in
post-secondary? How hard is it to incorporate it into your scedhule? Thanks!Mentor 2022-01-12,
17:36: Hi Jaden, It sounds like you have a great awareness of self-care! It certainly is
multidimensional and you've touched on several different aspects (i.e. sleep, exercise, water
intake, healthy diet, etc.) which is great! The thing about self-care is that it might look
different for everyone and you have to try a few different things until you find what works best for
you! Time management is certainly a big part of self-care and this is something that I'm sure we can
all improve on! I like to plan out my weeks using either my phone calendar or an agenda. This way
you can schedule in time to do activities that you enjoy. This was essential to my self-care in high
school and post-secondary. Things that I like to do for self-care include any kind of exercise,
sleep, cooking healthy food, enjoying time with loved ones and friends, playing with my dog, and
doing fun activities like watching a movie or baking. How do you manage your time now to incorporate
these self-care items into your days? KatieMentee 2022-01-12, 20:27: Hey! I try to stay as on-task
as possible throughout my day so when I am done with my tasks I can have some time to relax. I find
that if I am lazy and procrastinate during the day is affects me later, so I work as hard as I can
to have as much relaxation and self-care time as possible! Thanks Katie, I have lots of information
from this module now:)Mentor 2022-01-12, 21:54: Hey Jaden, That sounds great! Sounds like you have a
good plan :) Are you ready to move on to the next module? Cheers, KatieMentee 2022-01-17, 18:52: Hey
Katie! I actually only needed three modules for my project, which brings this mentorshio to a close
as I wrap up my last courses! Thank you so so so much for being such an incredible mentor over these
last few months! I have learned so much from you and wish you all the best in your future! Thanks
for being awesome, JadenMentor 2022-01-19, 13:22: Hey Jaden, Thanks for letting me know! You have
done so great and I am excited about your future in nursing! It has been great getting to know you
over the past few months. Best of luck with everything!! Cheers, KatieMentee 2022-01-19, 16:54:
Thanks again:)",,"Mentor 2021-09-22, 21:37: Hi Jaden! My name is Katie and I will be your mentor for this year! It is
nice to meet you I see from your profile that you are interested in pursuing nursing as a career!
That is so awesome. I am a Registered Nurse and work in Kelowna, B.C. I also like to do outdoor
activities so it appears that we will have lots to discuss! Please feel free to ask any questions
you have along the way. To start us off I've chosen two of the above ice breakers for myself: 1.
Words to live by: ""Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know!"" This quote has helped
me overcome obstacles and achieve big goals in my life. 2. Public persona: I look up to Oprah for
all of the humanitarian endeavours that she takes on. I also admire her positive attitude and
ambitious spirit. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! KatieMentee 2021-09-24, 17:06: Hello! It
was great to hear from you! It's wonderful that you are a nurse! How do you like it? What sort of
things do you do in your job? What pushed you to pursue nursing? What sort of outdoor activities do
you do? I love biking, skiing, and hiking:) I really identify with the quote you chose and I try to
live my life that way. Lately, it has not been easy as I am very overwhelmed and stressed with
school. However, one good thing about my week was that I passed my N drivers test yesterday which is
super exciting:) Oprah is awesome I look up to her as well! I look forward to hearing from you! Have
a great weekend:) JadenMentor 2021-09-24, 23:26: Hi Jaden! Nice to hear from you! Nursing has been
great! The past little while during the pandemic has been tough but it definitely is a rewarding
career. One thing I really appreciate about nursing is that it's diverse and offers many
opportunities in different areas including the hospital, community health buildings, the government,
universities, school districts,etc. When I was completing my first degree (in science) I started
working in a lab that dealt with genetics. I began to realize that the work was very independent,
and although I enjoyed it, I wanted to pursue a career that was team-oriented and this led me to
nursing! For outdoor activities, I love to snowboard, take my dog (huge dog fan) for walks, cycling,
swimming, and hiking! I'm sorry to hear that you've been stressed with school. I've definitely been
there! What kind of courses are you taking in school this year? Congrats on passing your N! That's
so exciting!! I remember when I passed mine and it was super exciting. Enjoy and stay safe! When you
have time to scroll through the different 'conversation options' below, let me know which ones you
want to talk about and we can go from there. Nice speaking with you! Have a great weekend too
Cheers, KatieMentee 2021-09-27, 12:24: Hi again Katie! I've heard how crazy being a nurse is
currently! Hopefully eveyrthing has settled down a bit now as we try and figure out the whole COVID
situation! One of the main things that has drawn me to nursing is all the opportunities it holds, as
well as how many options you have within nursing:) I love all of those outdoor activities as well!
Although, snowboarding can be a quite painful sport with some bad crashes, and I tend to ski more
because of that... I went to an online school last year and was able to get ahead on my courses, so
I only have the 4 courses I'm taking at the moment until I will be done highschool! Currently, I am
taking Psych 12 online, Foundations 12, Chem 12 (which is a really hard course becasue I've got a
hard teacher) and CLC. I've really been enjoying the freedom that my N gives me and I will stay safe
for sure! What did you mean as 'conversation options'? Thanks so much, JadenMentor 2021-09-27,
14:26: Hi Jaden, Happy Monday! Nursing is a great career option for sure! Are you thinking of
applying after graduation? Are there any specific areas of nursing that you're interested in? That's
funny you say that about snowboarding because that has been my experience with skiing! Four more
courses and then you'll be done! That's so exciting! Does that mean you'll graduate in December? Are
you looking forward to it? What is CLC? Chem 12 is challenging. That was my favorite course in high
school. For conversation options, if you scroll down to near the bottom of this page (past the
conversation thread) you'll see a list of conversation options that you can choose to guide our
interactions over the course of the semester. After you've picked some topics we can move on to the
next tab called ""Working through this program"". Have a great start to your week! KatieMentee
2021-10-01, 15:40: Hey Katie! I am taking a gap year after school where I am signed with an
organization to volunteer teach in Ghana. I would also love to travel to Bali and Greece after that
if I have enough money! I would like to attend Selkirk College in Castlegar for nursing, and they do
not defer applications, so I will apply next September for their program. I am not sure about a
specific area of nursing, but working in the ER certainly fascinates me. That is funny about the
sports thing😂😂 we are complete opposites! Yeah, I will be done school after this semester, which I
believe is mid-January. CLC is Career Life Connections. Basically, it helps prepare you for life
after high school and is mandatory for graduating. Chem 12 sure is hard but it's so satisfying once
you understand! I recently did very well on a test and it was great that my hard work paid off! I
chose Paying for School, Finding Inspiration, Well-being &amp; Self care, Studying, and Entering the
Job Market for the discussion options. Enjoy your weekend:)Mentor 2021-10-01, 18:39: Hi Jaden, A gap
year sounds excellent! I haven't been to any of those places but it sounds like it will be an
amazing experience! It sounds like you have a great plan for school! Selkirk College has a good
program for nursing And ER nursing would be a great option! Lots of excitement for sure. When I was
in high school I did the exact same thing as you and completed a semester early! It was the best
thing I ever did as it gave me some time to travel and relax before starting University. Are you
completing this mentorship as part of your CLC class? I'm glad to hear that you did well in your
Chem 12 class! It's so rewarding when your hard work pays off! Thanks for picking some conversation
topics that you're interested in! I am looking forward to talking about each of those with you. When
you're ready you can click the ""working through this program"" link above this thread and we can
continue on to the different conversation topics! Have a great weekend too! KatieMentee 2021-10-04,
12:41: Hi! I am super excited about my gap year. It has helped me stay motivated for school, as I
know that I will get a break from schooling for a while:) I've heard great things about Selkirk's
nursing program so I really hope I get accepted into it! Yes, this mentorship is a part of my CLC
class! And it was a super rewarding feeling to have done well on my test:) Okay, will do Hopefully
you had a great weekend! JadenMentor 2021-10-05, 23:09: Hey Jaden! How was your weekend? I hope
you're having a good start to your week. A gap year sounds like a great idea to rest up and get some
travelling in before starting University! You must be excited to graduate... it's coming up super
quick! Oh, that's cool that your CLC class gives you time to do this mentorship! Are you supposed to
work on it a certain amount of times per week? What do you hope to get out of the mentorship? Do you
have any questions currently? Hope you're having a great week! KatieMentee 2021-10-12, 22:47: Hey!
Sorry it too me so long to respond I've been crazy busy! My weekend was great I hope you had a nice
thanksgiving:) Yeah I'm super excited for my gap year I can't wait to be done school! I don't really
like school this year so it will be great to put it in the past. Our teacher for CLC doesnt really
care how many times we converse with our mentors its more of a personal preference. She just wants
us to do it as much as we feel we would like to:) I hope to make a new friend out of this mentorship
and hope to have a better understanding of what nursing school and the career itself entitles. One
of my questions is about nursing school... Is it a crazy amount of work? Also, it is really
stressful becoming a nurse? Thanks so much, Jaden:)Mentor 2021-10-14, 14:51: Hey Jaden, No worries
at all! How was your long weekend? Oh no! I'm sorry to hear you aren't enjoying school this year. Is
there anything in particular you're not liking? Awesome! Well, feel free to message as much or as
little as you'd like! It's certainly a great opportunity, one that I wished I had when I was
graduating high school. Nursing school is a lot of work, but most University degree programs are. I
think most programs can be stressful but looking back on my experiences I found I was more stressed
with my science degree compared to the nursing degree. The faculty and staff at UBCO were very
supportive and want you to succeed! It is quite important to build a set of strong coping mechanisms
to offset the stress that comes with University. One thing I like to do is go to the gym or do yoga.
What are some of your coping mechanisms for stress that work for you? Basically anything you enjoy
that makes you feel fulfilled and happy! Have a great week!! KatieMentee 2021-10-19, 17:16: Hey
Katie! My long weekend was great I house sat for a cute dog and had a wonderful thanksgiving dinner
with my family! How was yor long weekend? I haven't really been liking how busy I am with school. I
barely have time to see friends anymore as I have on average 4 hours of homework a night and it has
been really draining mentally and physically. I love to go for a bike ride, meditate or do some
workouts at home to cope with stress. However, I have been much to busy to do these things lately
which really sucks:( Can we unlock the next conversation please and thank you? Jaden:)Mentor
2021-10-21, 02:25: Hey Jaden! How are you? That sounds like such a fun weekend! What kind of dog? I
love dogs! My weekend was also great. I worked and then got to have a nice dinner with my family :)
Oh yikes, that sounds like a busy schedule! I can definitely relate. It can often be hard to carve
out the time to spend with friends and family or to do self-care activities but it's so important!
That's awesome that you have a list of 'go-to' coping strategies! Forsure! I will do that now :)

by so quickly. I don't know about you, but I am ready for the winter break. Here is our next topic,
please keep in mind that your teacher also recommends completing 3 other modules (entering the job
market, career considerations, paying for school).Mentee 2021-12-07, 17:03: Hi Brett, The idea that
I chose was by Denys Arcand, and the idea that I chose for him was the “If I want to do something
truly authentic … I should stick to what I know, to what’s happened to me. I only work from inside
of me, from what I am truly experienced in.” I gave each of the bullet points of the questions a
number. 1: How I interpret this idea is “You should stick to what you can understand”. 2: When I
read this idea I understand it and I agree and disagree with it. I agree with it because if you are
good at something and you like it, it might be a good idea to do something with it. I also disagree
with this because it is saying that if you don’t know something then don’t try learning it. 3: What
was the inspiration for the idea? 4: I think that I am fairly good at chemistry, but I still have to
learn some of the stuff that I need to pass the course. -JaredMentor 2021-12-08, 21:41: Hi Jared,
Thanks for your thoughts on the module!! This module has been really interesting for me as I am
typically not a sterotypical 'creative' person. I really like the idea that you chose from Mr.
Arcand. My favorite idea in this module is from the first speaker, Mina Shum, speaking about intent.
This really spoke to me because beyond inspiration or work put into art, there is intent behind
every action or decision we make, whether this is something we are concious of it or not! My choice
to go into healthcare work was definitely shadowed with the intent to help people and work to make
the system as accessible and efficient as possible! I also really think that Ms. Pool's idea is
important as in my opinion it is important to go out of your sphere of influence and knowledge, to
push the bounds of your comfort zone. I suppose that overall in whatever I do, I try to find a
medium between Ms. Pool and Mr. Arcand's ideas; playing to your strengths but being ready for
unexpected to bring more interest into your life. Let me know if you have any questions about the
module or my response; I'd love to hear what you think of what I said and if there are any
connections in our thoughts you may identify. Also let me know which module you would like to start
next :) -BrettMentee 2021-12-09, 13:35: Hi Brett, I have a very difficult time trying to connect
ideas with other ideas, or just making connection altogether, so I can't connect my ideas with your
ideas. Sorry. I don't have any questions about the module. The next module that I would like to do
is paying for school. Thanks. -Jared",,,"Mentor 2021-11-23, 22:50: Here is the next module, Jared. I'm looking forward to discussing this
topic with you!Mentee 2021-11-25, 13:48: Hi Brett, The occupation that I am interested in is
becoming a chemist, or something chemistry related, but for the data I took the chemist data. I gave
each of the bullet points of the questions a number. 1: I had done some research on this already so
none of the subjects surprised me and I also expected as much for the courses that I needed to do,
so I am doing them right now or I have them next semester. 2: Of course the money is important, but
doing something that I enjoy and can stay afloat money wise is important. 3: The carrier that I
wanted was displayed. 4: Well it is important to have good grades because then a school will be more
likely to accept your application or even pay for your schooling. If you do struggle at something,
work harder at it in order to make it become easy. -JaredMentor 2021-11-25, 18:37: Hi Jared, It
sounds like you're very organized and forward thinking in planning for requirements for applying to
post-secondary institutes to be a chemist. I have a friend right now who is majoring in chemistry
and even though it is a degree which might be tough, she really enjoys it. For an example, here is
the degree information page for chemistry from Thompson Rivers University (I chose this example
because this is where I started university!)
https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/program/view/TRU/32343/chemistry-bachelor-science-degree-major and
their requirements for applying:
https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/program/view/TRU/32343/chemistry-bachelor-science-degree-major I
think your values around salary and doing well in school will balance nicely when you look to the
future and start applying! Some suggestions that I have that might be helpful to you: - choose your
top schools: where would you like to go? does it involve moving? how much would rent/moving cost in
addition to your tuition, student, and book fees? - for each school on your list of choices, check
and double check what classes you need to have done in highschool before applying, best to do sooner
in case the classes aren't regularly offered at your school! and EVERY university may have different
requirements for what classes you need to apply, so check them all so that once you graduate you can
apply to as many of ypur desired schools as possible! - degree doesn't equal a career, especially in
sciences! A bechelor in many sciences doesn't necessarily set you up for a degree, so maybe do a
little bit more research into what kind of specific career in chemistry you want (environmental,
bio-chemistry, research, industrial, agricutural, the possibilities are endless!!) This
converstaion's information seemed to be quite introductary and doesn't really go deep into the
topic, so do you have any questions about post-secondary planning? Any questions at all, no matter
how serious they are I'm happy to try to help answer with you. This is a big topic, surely there are
aspects you may be wondering about? My only follow up question for you would be what do you want to
do with a chemistry degree, what type of work do you see yourself happy doing? -BrettMentee
2021-11-26, 16:49: Hi Brett, For the question that you asked I am still trying to figure out what
kind of chemisty that I want to go into, so I don't fully know what kind of classes that I am going
to need. I have done some reaserch on the schools that I want to go to. For my first two years I
will go the selkirk college then for the last two years I don't know what school I will go to. I
don't really have any questions for post-secondary planning, but thank for the offer. -JaredMentor
2021-11-26, 20:06: Glad to hear that you seem to have it planned out! I'd definitiely recommend to
check Selkirk's website each year when you're picking your classes in cases they update their
requirements! Which topic would you like to talk about next?Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:10: Hey Brett, I
would like to do the ""finding inspiration"" topic. -Jared","Mentor 2021-12-10, 00:26: Hey Jared, here is the next module! Maybe a little more dry than the
others (if you don't like finances like me) but a very important topic! Looking forward to
discussing this one with you!Mentee 2021-12-14, 17:34: Hi Brett, These are the questions that I have
for you. 1: How hard was it to get into the mindset of having to limit your spending. 2: If you
don’t want to divulge the information for the next question you don’t have to. What were some of
your spending limits? 3: Did you have a part-time job, and if yes how did you balance the school and
work load. 4: Again if you don’t want to divulge the information for the next question you don’t
have to. Did you ever miss a payment on anything? -JaredMentor 2021-12-14, 19:43: Hi Jared, Thank
you for your questions, they're great questions! I will answer them and then ask you some general
questions so that we can have a broader discussion :) perhaps we will spend some extra time
messaging on this topic as it is a big one, is so important, and can be difficult to understand!! 1.
My spending mindset has definitely changed (obviously!) as I've transitioned from highschool to
undergrad and now to pharmacy. My family includes my father, who is an accountant, so financial
repsonsibility has always been something that has been on my mind and reminded about by my dad,
still to this day, whenever I see him. So to answer your question, it wasn't too difficult, but I
did have to adapt my mindset as my needs have changed with my life transitions. 2. I will not lie, I
am not the best in terms of financial responsibility!! I actually do not have specific spending
limits per-week or per-month per se, BUT I do keep relatively close track of my bank balance (I am
in no way rich! haha); some of the things I keep track of are: - how often am I getting take-out
meals? coffees? etc. I usually will use this to see how much 'spending money' I am going through as
besides groceries, this is one of my biggest expenses and takeout tends to add up VERY fast if you
aren't careful. -other expenses I keep track of as they take a good bite out of by account would be
as previously mentioned, groceries, as well as gas, and small/miscelaneous costs (these may include
parking, subscriptions, and other things like entertainment and books) Something that I generally
aim for is takeout meals ~$15 and groceries ~$75 per week as a maximum. 3. I do have a part-time
job; in undergrad I worked an 8-hour each weekend at Tim Hortons. I had 2 years of school where I
didn't work and for the past 1.5 years I work one 8-hour shift at a pharmacy each Saturday. For my
time management I realize that I will be working each Saturday so it is naturally blocked off where
there is no way I can get studying or schoolwork done. Something else important is realising that I
will be tired after a full day at the pharmacy (on weekends theres only myself and one pharmacist on
shift!) so generally, the whole day is blocked off. This is just something I do subconciously and
when looking ahead, for example at future lectures (to study), labs (to prepare for or work on), or
exams to study for I know that my week is actually more like a 6-day week. 4. I have missed a credit
card payment or two! These were my fault as I forgot to send my payment and I have been incredibly
fortunate that I have the means to at least make my minimum bill each month. I recommend: set a
reminder! I will say that there have been times where I have been quite tight on cash, this is where
I really tighten my belt and buy little to nothing until I can get a little bit more saved... if you
try this you'll see just how much we spend on non-essential things!! Now, some questions for you: -
how do you manage your time currently? Do you have a job during the school year? what strategies do
you use for managing your time and what do you think you'd do if you had to balance a job during
school (if you don't already)? - what is your spending mindset? Do you set yourself budgets or no? -
what are some more of your questions about finance in university/post-secondary? specifically, I
think we should talk more about paying FOR school in addition to spending while in school!Mentee
2021-12-15, 16:04: Hi Brett, 1: I know I should be managing my time better than I have been, but
only a few things were handed in late, but that was mostly because I was away. I do have a part-time
job. For my job I serve dinner to seniors from 4-7, so I can do this after school, but when I do
work after school it is a long day. My work schedule is 4-4 so I work for four days then I am off
for 4 days. 2: I don't personaly have any spending budgets, but I don't know if my parents have any
budgets for me. I don't spend much at all. I buy something small like once or twice a month, which
explains the potential no budget for now. 3: Did you save some money for school before you hit
collage or university. If yes how much did it help you. -JaredMentor 2021-12-15, 21:39: Jared, It
sounds like you are very busy between work and school! It also sounds like your job is interesting -
I am currently the president of the Pharmacy Geriatrics Club at UBC becuase I enjoy advocating for
best practice in our aging patients. Budgets are totally understandable, as I've said I don't keep a
strict one either. I do think I will transition to being quite strict with myself once I am working
in a career, but for now the demands on my banking can be easily tracked so I understand where
you're coming from. I saved a little bit for school - at the time it seemed like a lot of money!! I
used mine mostly as spending throughout the school year as I either didn't work or worked few hours
during school. I think its a good idea to have something in savings that you can use if needed -
even if its just for a small treat after a hard exam! Have you been able to look at the links above
to see the general costs of programs, especially at the school you are most interested in? I would
really recommend that you take a look andwe can disucss what you think about that and strategies to
fund tuition etc. Unfortunately in today's system, a part time job is typically not enough to fund
all of your committments throughout a school year, even if you work full-time in the 4-month summer
in post-secondary. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and discussing this some more!
-BrettMentee 2021-12-16, 13:23: Hey Brett, When I go into the links I can't find what you asked me
to look for, so Idon't really know what to do at this point. -JaredMentee 2021-12-17, 11:55: Hey
Brett, Just so you know I won't be responding to anything for the next two weeks because it is the
christmas break. Hope you have some happy holidays. -JaredMentor 2021-12-17, 23:44: Hi Jared, Have a
great holliday break!! Here is the link to Selkirk College's fee schedule for an example - every
university will have their fees somewhere on their website, so it is worth the time to take a look!
https://selkirk.ca/sites/default/files/Admissions/Tuition%20Fees/UAS-Domestic.pdf
https://selkirk.ca/financial-information/tuition-fees/tuition-fees When you get back from the
hollidays, we can continue our conversation on this topic, or move to another - let me know if you
still have questions or things you'd like to talk about in paying for school. -BrettMentor
2022-01-11, 18:13: Hi Jared, I hope you had an excellent, restful, and healthy break! I realize that
this program has become optional for the rest of your semester. I'm sure you must be busy as your
semester wraps up, but I just wanted to touch base and let you know I'll be watching for messages if
you'd like to continue our discussions. If we don't discuss anything further, I want to thank you
for your time and effort in discussing and thinking through the modules that we have gone through,
and wish you well with your future endevours. -Brett",,"Mentor 2021-10-22, 23:29: Hey Jared! Thanks for your input. Since you'd like to start with the
studying conversation, here it is! read through the anchor text and watch the video, and we will
discuss. Also, please let me know whether or not you have any questions about the program or how it
works. Have a great weekend! -BrettMentee 2021-10-27, 15:22: Hi Brett. I was just wondering do I
have to send you the anwsers to the questions or not? -JaredMentor 2021-10-27, 20:00: Hey Jared!
Hope your week is going well! There are definitely a lot of questions in each conversation, some
have more than others. No, you don't necessarily have to send me ""full"" answers to every single one,
but a few points on it or your thoughts on each one would be appreciated (and you can go into more
depth with some of the others). If there are any specific questions which you would like to go over,
please let me know. Also, if there are questions that are confusing, or you feel like you don't know
how to answer, please let me know and we can discuss them more. Point form in your responses is more
than OK! (you don't need to send me full sentence/paragraph answers). Hope this clears things up!
Also, did you have any questions or concerns about the introductory modules about how the program
works?Mentee 2021-11-04, 13:23: Hi Brett, Sorry for the late response. I gave each of the bullet
points of the questions a number. 1: I think to study something is to review whatever subject you
are studying for. 2: I don't usually study, but when I do study I go over what I have done, and if
there are questions that I have not completed I do them. 3: I was taught to look it over, and do
some questions on it. 4: The strategy that I have done a bit on from the video is the ""Recall what
you know"" strategy. 5: The strategy that seems the most useful to me is the “Recall what you know”
strategy. I think that this is the best strategy for me because it fits to how I think, and how I
work. 6: The strategy that I think that would be the most challenging is the other strategies from
the video because they don’t fit with how I learn. 7: I don’t have any questions about the
strategies in the video. I can’t think of any strategies to add to the video. 8: Other than the
“Recall what you know” strategy I don’t think that I will use any of the other strategies suggested
in the video. -JaredMentor 2021-11-05, 18:50: Hi Jared, Thanks for your answers! I love using the
'recall what you know' strategy as well; my program offers us a lot of practice tests and questions
before examinations and I really use these to hone in on what I don't know (and so need to study
more!!) To be honest, I'm not the best at studying. That being said the 2 habits I use the most are:
- combining visual and verbal information --&gt; I like to re-write my notes and add diagrams or
explanatory pictures to the information that I re-write in my own words. When I go back to study my
notes, I have notes that are written in my own words combined with visuals and this is much easier
to study that having to read long textbook chapters! -Ask, Explain, Connect: This is my favorite
study pattern because it makes you feel confident in what you know, and identifies areas that you
still need to improve on. What I do (and I think this would be great for you to try too!!) is that I
picture that I am the one who has to teach the class the topic I am studying. I ask myself ""how
would I explain these concepts?"" If I can explain a concept from class well, I know that I can
probably answer questions about it on the test. I have a few questions I'd be interested in hearing
your thoughts on!: when you use the 'recall what you know' strategy, what are the steps you take
while doing it? Would you ever give the other methods from the video a try, even if you think they
wouldn't work for you? What makes you think these strategies don't fit with how you learn? How do
you learn the best? Also, which module would you like to do next? We will finish our discussion on
this topic and I will open the next. Have a great weekend, Jared! -BrettMentee 2021-11-09, 17:16: Hi
Brett, 1. What I do is look, and go over what I have, and if I have any questions that I have not
done I will do thoughs. 2. I might try some of the other stategy from the video, but probably not
end up doing them. 3. The reason why I think that these strategys might not work for me is I just
don't like to do stuff on my own time. 4. I don't know really how well I learn. The next topic that
I would like to do is the ""Well being &amp; Self Care"". -JaredMentor 2021-11-10, 17:58: Hi Jared,
Fair enough, if you have a strategy that works well for you already, sticking with it is a good
plan. I would encourage you to keep these strategies in the back of your mind however, they may
become useful as you progress through highschool and begin to take different courses that may have
concepts which are trickier or work that isn't necessarily out of a textbook/question based.
Reflecting on your work and how you process to learn the information in class is always a good idea
as you can find out if there are oppurtunities to better understand the information being discussed
in class! I will open the next module now :) -Brett",,,,"Mentor 2021-11-10, 18:00: Hi Jared, here is the new module. Have a look through the anchor text and
videos and respond to some of the question prompts. I'm excited to learn with you in this module as
health and wellbeing are so important, especially when you're trying to learn new things :)Mentee
2021-11-15, 12:40: Hi Brett, I gave each of the bullet points of the questions a number. 1: How easy
it is probably changes with my mood and how I am feeling. 2: I usually end up doing most of my
homework on the weekends, but I should probably do some more on weekdays. 3: There are some people
that try too. I don’t really pay attention to what they do to take care of themselves. 4: I don’t
always really know what is going on in my body or mind so I don’t know my signs. 5: The workload is
probably going to increase, leaving less time for ourselves. 6: I definitely need to get better at
going to sleep on time. 7: I should be eating healthier food. It’s just food that is not as healthy
is just so good. 8: I am pretty good at drinking water. Most of what I drink is water. 9: I am
definitely someone that should be doing more physical activity, but I don’t do much. 10: How I like
to do my work is to get it all done then take a break because if I do take a break I am going to end
up either puting it off or forgetting about it. -JaredMentor 2021-11-16, 00:07: Hi Jared, Thanks for
your response! Hope your long-weekend was great and you/your family and friends are safe from all
this flooding. It seems like you have a good rough idea on how you handle your own self-care! You
have someone in your life who models it, are aware of the challenges of time-management especially
as workload increases, and are aware of your 'basics' and how you can imrove them (sleep, exercise,
diet, hydration). I will not lie, I am not great at self-care and it is something that I have been
working on over the last year as it is super important! The video and article both mention burnout
and this is a very real phenomenon, especially if people don't have good self-care strategies and
are transitioning in a major way in their lives... like starting a difficult/busy year in school,
starting university, moving, etc. Time management plays a big role in self-care too! For example,
when I'm really stressed, I love to relax and watch a movie - but I can't always take 2 hours out of
my day unless I'm managing my time well when I feel great, so that when I need to take a breather
during stressful or overwhelming times I can afford to take a break. Some followup questions for
you, -DO you think of self-care as important? why or why not? -What are some general things that
make you feel better when you're stressed? sad? overwhelmed or feeling unmotivated? do you share any
of these actions/methods with people you know? -Can you think to a time when you felt stressed or
like you needed a break.... what kind of thoughts or signs in this situation that looking back on
you realise might be good general signs to watch out for in the future? For myself, I can become
more irritable, sad, need more sleep, and eat a lot more junk food (even than normal... I eat a lot
of sugar - oops)! I hope you can take some time and reflect on these questions again and try to get
a lot out of this module! Self-care is important and your future self will thank you for putting in
the work to think of some warning signs and self-care strategies :)Mentee 2021-11-17, 15:51: Hi
Brett, I gave each of the bullet points of the questions a number. 1: I think that self care is
important because it will probably let us live a bi longer. I think that it is important but I end
up not doing what I should be doing to care for myself. 2: Probably playing a game or watching some
netflix. 3: I can’t really look back and remember, and I don’t want to look back and remember an
embarrassing memory. -JaredMentee 2021-11-22, 12:07: -Hi Brett I just wanted to check up on you
cause its been a bit since you last responed. If you have been waiting for me to ask for the next
subject I would like to do the ""Post-Secondary Considerations"" one -JaredMentor 2021-11-23, 22:49:
Hi Jared, My apologies, my email notification seems to have been swallowed by my inbox! I will open
up the next subject. Apologies again, I'll keep a better watch on my notifications!",,"Mentor 2021-09-25, 00:39: Hi Jared, My name is Brett and I will be your mentor for this online
course! I am looking forward to the conversations that we'll have about the topics your teacher has
selected, as well as any extra which may interest you! I am 22 years old and am in 3rd year of the
pharmacy program at UBC - I am becoming a pharmacist. A little about me: I like to spend my
free-time outside, exploring Vancouver, and of course with some Netflix mixed in. I'm excited to get
to know you more and would love to hear more about you! If you have any questions about the program
you can always send a message to me on this platform and I will repsond within 3 days - I will try
to reply on the same day when possible :) -BrettMentee 2021-10-19, 19:34: Hi Brett, Before I begin
my main writeing I just wanted to let you know that I don't always write a hole lot. A quote that I
like, ""If you can't change it, change your attitude."" I like this quote because it is important to
follow, and because it is a spin off of ""If you can't beat them, join them"". My favorite food are
quesadilla's because they are fast and esay to make, and you can put all sorts of other stuff into
them to make them evan better. -JaredMentor 2021-10-20, 14:42: Hi Jared, nice to hear from you!
Thank you for your message, I am looking forward to the modules of this program! Your quote sounds
like it is very useful in time of difficulty or stress, I like to always try to take a step back and
take a breath before continuing. Quesadillas are also a favorite of mine! I like them because they
are quick and tasty like you said- always great for a quick study break :) How is your school year
going so far? What do you do in your free time / what are your interests? Its been great to talk,
and no problem if you don't always have a lot to say - this is a judgement free zone! I will open
the next module and look forward to working with you. -BrettMentee 2021-10-20, 15:48: Hi Brett
School was going good until I was sick for nearly two weeks, so I missed a lot of school, but I have
caught up on everything but chemistry. My interests are video games, youtube/Netflix,
D&amp;D(Dungeons and Dragons), and board games. What I do in my free time is watching
youtube/Netflix, if I have to I will go to work, playing video games, and playing board games.

student at the University of Victoria, and will be your mentor for this program. I'm here to answer
any questions you have and offer advice. Ultimately my goal is to help you achieve yours, so if
there is ever anything I can do for you let me know. I will try to respond to messages as quickly as
possible and always within three days. I can see from your profile you like to fish, I do as well,
mainly catching bass in the lakes around here. What do you usually fish for? I also see your
intrested in becoming an electrician. Although my areas of expertise is healthcare I do have some
knowledge around the trades and also have a friend my age who is a red seal electrician and just
started his own business. I can ask him any questions you have if I don't know the answer. I also
see your want to discuss ""life advice and how to get through college"". I'm sure some of the modules
will touch on these topics however if you have specific questions feel free to ask. Is there
anything I should know about you besides what's on your profile or anything you want to tell me?
Additionally, please see the list of conversation choices below and check off the ones your
interested in (check off the ones required by your teacher) and let me know if there is any other
topics not on the list you want to discuss. I look forward to working with you Hudson and as soon as
you introduce yourself we will move to the next section.Mentee 2021-10-07, 15:51: Hey Evan sorry it
took so long for me to get back to you. And I am doing great. So I am just in my grade 12 year and
in January I am going to Selkirk college to do my trade program. I don't know if that is what I
really want to do, but it is something to start with, and if I don't like it I still have some other
options that I can look at. And I just want to know if there is any tips that would help me in
college. And I also fish's for a lot of bass down here in my local lake.Mentee 2021-11-09, 12:35:
hey so i have looked at the text and vidos and i think that they will help me out thought my
schooling, because i have a hard time making to to study and when i do lose focus and stop doing it.
but when i go to colage i will realyy need to get into the habbit to study. and that if i ever need
help with somthing that i am working on it is never a bad thing to ask for help from someone that
has those skills. i would like to know what helps you study even when you dont want to?Mentor
2021-11-11, 00:00: Hey Hudson, Below is a list of things I do to get school work done when I don't
want to. Now that you have completed this module I have unlocked the next one called ""post-secondary
considerations"". If I find myself extremely unproductive and not motivated on a particular day, I
don't do any work. It seems odd, but if nothing is coming due, your time is better spent doing
something else or 'recharging your batteries so that when you do work, you are more effective.
Nothing is worse than sitting in front of some work all day and procrastinating (phone, youtube etc)
when instead you could have gone out and enjoyed your day. If you're doing some work and start to
feel unproductive, take a break! (but set a time limit). The Pomodoro technique is one example of a
way to do this (there is some science behind this method). Sometimes it can be hard to start, but
once you get going, it's easier. If I'm feeling unmotivated, I like to start by working on the
things I enjoy the most or are the easiest, even if they are not the priority. Once I complete that
task, I feel good that I'm getting things done, and then I tackle some of the more complex and
important tasks. I always use to-do lists. Put it on your desk and when you complete a task,
physically put a checkmark beside it or cross it out. It's motivating to see that you're making
progress. Another tip related to this is at the start of a semester, look at the syllabus for each
class and put all the due dates and tests etc, into your calendar (I use google calendar on my
phone). Make each class a different colour, and if you're using a digital calendar, you can often
set reminders for each thing so that it will remind you X amount of days before something is due.
Check your phone messages and social media, turn the phone on silent or off, and then put it away
from your work area, in your backpack, or in another room. It's just too tempting to pick it up if
it's right beside you. I tell the people around me I'm working for the next X amount of hours so
that they know not to bug me unless it's important. I use headphones or earbuds and play white noise
like rain sounds or anything non-lyrical so I can't hear anything around me. I personally get most
of my productive work done between about 11:00 pm - 4:00 am because there is minimal distraction,
but if you have morning classes, this isn't very realistic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047490352,1047541073,9/22/2021 21:03,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-18, 22:34: Hey Fallyn! Let me know once you've gone through the info above and we can
chat about it. Anything in particular you want to talk about or any questions? That second link with
those mini videos from students has some really great info!Mentee 2021-11-25, 14:05: Hey! I have
gone through the information. A lot of the tips from the first article I have already thought about
or been told. I am most likely staying home for my first year, so I would only have to worry about
tuition and textbook costs. But most likely I will move out for my second year, so it was useful to
read and now be able to think about everything that I will have to pay when I move out. I have been
thinking of having a part time job, but I know my program is difficult so I am not sure I will be
able to balance it. Do you have a part time job and if so how do you balance it with your studies? I
have done some budgeting but it was very minimal, so I will have to make a more in depth one. What
were some of the most challenging parts of budgeting for you?Mentor 2021-11-27, 16:03: What kind of
part-time job are you thinking about? I think whether its doable or not really depends on how many
courses you take at a time and how many hours per week you would be required to work at the job. Do
you think you will be in school full time? Do you know how many courses you have to take at a time?
I didnt have a part-time job when I was studying engineering and instead worked in the summers and
also did co-op work placements throughout my degree (have you heard of co-op? if not we should chat
about it!). I think some people were able to work part-time during school though. If you have good
organization skills and are able to organize your time effectively then that really helps too, so
that you are sure to get your school work done. Some people also only work on the weekends.
Budgeting is hard! It definitely takes discipline haha. Especially when theres always extra things
to do - friends to go out with, restaurants, activities, etc. It will probably help a lot that
you're living at home for your first year! I find it helpful to make an Excel spreadsheet for
budgeting. Just to lay it all out and see how much money you can allocate where in a month. What
have you done for budgeting so far?Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:58: I was thinking of just keeping the job
I have now. It's very flexible and my boss never says no when I ask for time off. I will be in
school full time, the program that I am most likely taking has 6 courses a semester. So if I do keep
a job I would probably only work on the weekends. I have heard of co-op and my program does offer
it, but I'm not sure what it all entails. For budgeting in my clc class we made budgets for a whole
year. I took into consideration tuition fees and possible income. Like you mentioned I would
definitely make my budget monthly in order to follow it better.Mentor 2021-12-03, 23:56: oh thats
awesome that your current job is so flexible! Then it couldnt hurt to stick with it and see how
things go once you start school and to adjust accordingly. Do you know what the specific courses
are? Im not sure about Selkirk College but at UBC 5 courses per term was typically considered a full
load but many engineering students had to take 6-7 courses per term. So it can definitely be a lot
of work but also depends on what the courses are! Sometimes a course is worth less credits AKA takes
up less time. Co-op was awesome in my experience. Its essentially work experience. Its great though
because you 1. make money, 2. get to try different jobs in different fields to see if you like them
3. get to try these jobs for 4-8+ months with no strings attached once you leave 4. get lots of
experience with writing resumes/coverletters and job interviews, 5. learn lots of skills on the jobs
too. Nowadays I think having relevant work experience (especially as a engieering student) really
helps once you graduate uni and enter the job market. In my case, my co-op work experiences kind of
gave me an idea of the types of jobs I coudnt see myself working in long term, which was valuable. I
met and worked with great people, got to move to different areas of the province (Gibsons and
Rossland!), learned a lot of things. Anywho, let me know if you have any questions about co-op! Oh
thats great you had that budgeting experience in your class already! Let me know if theres more
things on the topic of paying for school etc (or anything else really) that you wanna chat about,
otherwise we can move onto the next conversation when youre ready and let me know! :)Mentee
2021-12-09, 13:30: The six courses for first semester are Engineering design and communication,
chemisrty, programing, compotition, calculus and fundametnal physics. Each one is three credits. I
think I will defently try balancing school and my job and see how it goes. Co-op seems like a great
experience and very valuable! It seems like something I would like to do, for I can get expierence
and as well as see if it is something I would like. Is it hard to enroll in it and how many days a
week do you work?Mentor 2021-12-11, 22:17: I think it will depend on your program what its like
getting into the co-op program! Some co-op programs take everyone who applies, some have an
application/interview process. If you're interested you could probably find some info from your
school and see if they have co-op and what the process is like! Co-op is full time work! Usually
monday to friday regular working hours. The schedule varies from school to school but you might be
in classes for one semester (ex Sept-Dec), then do co-op for the next semester (Jan-May), then
school the next, etc. Co-op terms are usually 4 months or 8 months, but some people can do up to a
12 month placement. Usually you do a few different 4 or 8 month placements throughout your degree if
youre in a co-op program. I did two 8 month placements and one 4 month placement, so a total of 20
months of co-op throughout my degree. To give you an idea, my co-op started in my second year of
engineering and my schedule was: school sep-may of 2nd year, co-op may-dec, school jan-may, co-op
may-sep, school sep-jan, co-op jan-aug, then school sep-may and I graduated! Another thing i liked
was being able to have a break from regular classes by doing co-op terms. Even though I was working
fulltime it definitely felt like a break and was more relaxed (dont have to study/do assignments in
the evenings!) One downside I'll mention was that if your schedules are different from your
classmates/friends you might not get to see them in classes again. Also it extends the time it takes
to do your degree - that bugs some people! Hope thats helpful. Let me know if you have any other qs
about it! Which conversation do you want to do next? I'll open it up for us :)Mentee 2021-12-14,
16:29: Okay, thanks for all the information! l will look into it a bit more. I think even though it
will take longer, it would still be worth it to get the experience. Can we do the rural to urban
conversation next?","Mentee 2022-01-11, 16:47: I like the simplicity of living in a more rural area, and how it is not
busy. There is very little traffic and is fairly safe place to live. It never becomes overwhelming.
I also enjoy how quite it is. Cities seem loud with the amount of people going by every moment of
the day. Some things I do not like about living in a rural place is the shopping. There are almost
no stores and because of this we always have to order online. Theres also not many things to do for
entertainment besides drive around. Is it more expensive to live in a city? Is having a car a good
idea or is it easy to get around on public transit/walking only?Mentor 2022-01-12, 21:26: Id say
probably yes in general its more expensive to live in a city but Im no expert. I think it depends
how remote of a town youre comparing it to. Because super remote towns can be pretty expensive too
with getting fresh groceries and stuff. I think in cities youre more tempted to eat out because
theres so many cool restaurants to try, and to pay for activities and stuff. Housing cost is
definitely more. As for having a car it depends on what you do day to day! Transit is usually MUCH
better in cities which is great so youre not driving the car thats sitting in traffic and busses
move through traffic pretty quickly. Train is even better. That being said how easy it is to get
around on transit depends on where you live, even in a city. Have you spent any time in
Vancouver/the lower mainland? I also like the quiet of smaller towns. I like that its so much easier
to access nature and when you do is so much more pleasant when there arent crowds of people there
too. Online shopping/delivery has improved so much lately that its pretty good (except for when
theres weather catastrophes...). I kind of like just going to the big city once in while for
necessary shopping and not having it all at your fingertips all the time - another reason why one
might spend more money in the city!Mentee 2022-01-13, 13:22: I have spent a bit of time in Vancuver
and Langley area on a few trips. One time we got a sky train pass and it was so handy, and you could
get almost anywhere. I definetly think I would end up spending more money because of whats all there
like you mentioned. I would really need to make a budget and stick to it.Mentor 2022-01-15, 16:48:
Ya budget it a good idea for sure!!","Mentor 2022-01-28, 21:18: This is a great topic and super important!! I've changed my study habits a
lot over the years, and they change depending on the subject im studying too. Whats your experiences
with studying? What techniques do you use? Any questions you want to talk about?",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-24, 21:29: Hi Fallyn! My name is Melissa, and I’m going to be your mentor in this
program. I grew up mostly in BC and I’m currently in my second year of studying medicine at UBC. I’m
excited to get to know you throughout this program! Can you tell me about yourself a little? What
kind of things do you like doing? :)Mentee 2021-09-28, 17:29: Hello! Some things that I like to do
is ski, hike and read. I play volleyball and basketball for my school. I am very good at academics
especially math. Right now I am taking english, chemistry, and genocide studies. I am finding Chem
pretty hard right now but the rest of my classes are going well. I am not sure what I want to do
next year but I would like to do something that involes being outdoors. How do you like studying at
UBC?Mentor 2021-09-30, 17:45: Nice! It sounds like you are super active! What kind of skiing do you
do? I also like skiing - last year I started learning how to skate ski, its been pretty fun and I'm
looking forward to snow so I can get back to it! UBC is good! I did my undergraduate degree in
Vancouver in engineering, and now Im in Prince George in UBC's medical program. The vancouver campus
was pretty big but in a beautiful location. If you have any questions about what UBC is like, ask
away anytime :) I'm going to start us off with the ""food for thoughtr"" question above. Recently I
discovered halloumi - have tried it before? Google ""halloumi salad"" if you want to see. Its a type
of cheese (I really love cheese!) that you can grill. Anyways, Ive put it in salads, and even made
skewers with it and it is very tasty. I like finding new vegetarian type things to eat so it was
exciting to find it! Do you want to answer one of the questions? :)Mentee 2021-10-19, 21:31: I do
downhill skiing when I have free time. I really like halloumi aswell, one of my friends recently
showed it to me. I have only had it grilled with a bit of lime juice on it. But having it in salads
sounds really good! For the lonely landscape question, I find that the ocean feels lonely. I used to
live on the ocean and I found it very isolated. Also when looking out you can see forever, but
there's nothing to see. Unless you get lucky and see some sea animals. I am thinking of going into
engineering next year and am wondering what I can expect for it?Mentor 2021-10-25, 15:43: Hi Fallyn!
Thanks for sharing that!! Lime juice on halloumi sounds good! Thats really interesting about the
ocean feeling lonely. Where on the ocean were you living? Oh cool! What kind of engineering are you
thinking about going into? I studied chemical engineering so can answer questions as best I can
:)Mentor 2021-10-26, 10:40: Also, do you want to select the conversation choices that you're
interested in/that you have to complete for school? You should be able to do it on this page
:)Mentee 2021-10-28, 14:19: I lived on the Sunshine Coast. It took two ferries to get anywhere, so
it was super isolated. I’m not sure what engineering I want to go into yet. I have just applied to
the general engineering program at Selkirk college. Though environmental at the moment sounds the
most interesting.Mentor 2021-10-28, 20:09: Oh ya that sounds like it could be pretty isolating.
Where on the sunshine coast were you? Ok cool, good luck with your application. In terms of what to
expect for engineering, often the first year is the same for all types of engineering - you do some
math, physics, chemistry, programming, technical communications courses. I have a cousin who is in
an environmental engineering program at the moment and it sounds like she likes it a lot! Courses on
soil science, fluid mechanics, water pollution, hydrology, etc. I found engineering was a lot of
work but if you're interested in it then that doesnt matter as much and everyone is going through
the same thing. Hopefully thats some helpful info. Let me know if you have any other questions about
it!Mentee 2021-11-03, 15:30: I lived in Powell River! Okay, thank you for the information. I also
have a friend in environmental engineering and so far she likes it as well. I'm not sure how
interested I am in it, but im really good at math and physics so I thought I would just apply and
see what happens. I have checked off some of the conversation topics.Mentor 2021-11-04, 13:37: Ya
fair enough! I went into engineering because I was good at math and physics too actually. But now
I'm studying medicine! All I can say is its definitely worth figuring out if its something you find
interesting 😄 Ok! Lets move on to the next conversation - on this page you click ""working through
this program"" and start the next conversation on that page",,,,"Mentor 2022-01-15, 16:49: Did you have a chance to check out this video?Mentee 2022-01-18, 20:35: I
think the relatioship between living in the city and living in the country that the director is
trying to communicate is that when living in eaither place live keeps going forward, but in
different ways. Since it showed the country side first I think it represents that that's where we
come from and where we truly belong. The pace of the video sped up as it started transitoning to the
city making giving the feeling of apprehensiveness. I think it might also represent how cities are
often much more busy, and fastpaced. The feeling of apprehensiveness matches with how I feel when
thinking about moving to the city in the next year or two. The fear of not being able to enjoy the
outdoors as easily or as much also somewhat matches the feeling and ideas the video creates for
me.Mentor 2022-01-21, 22:30: hey fallyn! thanks for sharing that. Thats really insightful. I agree
that the pace of the video sped up to show the busy-ness that we often feel when in the city vs the
slower pace of life in a smaller town. For sure it sounds like it'll be an adjustment for you and
that unknown might bring some apprehension. Just know there are nice things about the city too that
you might find out you like :) but hopefully you will be able to mold your life so that it'll be
possible to settle in a smaller place if thats what you think will make you happiest! (Also, you can
always access nature it just might take a bit more time to get there in a city)Mentor 2022-01-21,

studying one?",,,"Mentor 2021-12-15, 11:44: Hey fallyn! I just want to make sure you saw this part of the 'paying for

importance of planning. I like to keep things structured, and I like to follow my routine for a
specific day. But, sometimes, things don't go as planned, and that's okay. It's also important to
learn to go with the flow and adjust to unexpected circumstances. What did you think about the
video?Mentee 2021-11-02, 12:28: I agree with you because sometimes I get overwhelmed when my plans
don't happen and I need to learn to go with the flow. What I found interesting was when Mina Shum
was saying that everybody wants something and when we're waking around the street we have a purpose
even if we don't know what it is. I'm not sure exactly what to take away from that but I found it
very interesting that what we do in our everyday life has some sort of purpose that we either know
of or don't.Mentor 2021-11-07, 12:17: Hi Ella, Yeah, I definitely agree with you on that! I think
that as we go through different experiences, that's how we figure out what our purpose is in life.
I'm just curious, what are your interests right now? Do you think that these interests will lead you
to finding your purpose in life?Mentee 2021-12-02, 15:26: My interests right now are dance,
business, and working. I think these will help me find a purpose in life because I am passionate
about dance so that might lead me in that directing in the future and working will help me find jobs
in the future.Mentor 2021-12-09, 14:31: Hi Ella, That's great! Being interested in dancing and
working can really help you in the future!Mentee 2021-12-10, 15:39: Yes it's busy but worth
it!Mentor 2021-12-24, 13:12: Hi Ella, Yeah, I think that everything gets pretty stressful and busy
at times. But as long as you are able to balance everything, you are going to be okay! Just
wondering, do you know what major you want to take in university/college?",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-23, 13:50: Hi Ella, How are you? I'm Jazmine, and I'm so happy to be your mentor!
Among the options given above, I decided to choose ""food for thought"" and ""words to live by."" So,
first, my favourite food would definitely have to be steak. Though I usually only eat it during
special occassions. It's still one of my favourites. The amount of protein, flavour, and tenderness
of the meat is something that I really love. I also know how to cook steak, so it's really perfect
because every time I have a craving, I don't have to go to a restaurant to eat my favourite food.
For the ""words to live by"" category, I really believe in the saying ""one step at a time."" It's
really easy to get caught up in school and work. It's easy to feel stressed about a busy work week,
but I always remind myself to finish one task at a time. This really helps accomplish even more than
I thought I could. Looking forward to reading the categories you chose! Have a great week! Best,
JazmineMentee 2021-09-27, 14:14: Hello my name is Ella! I like to dance and I also love a good
steak! Your words to live by are very inspiring and I agree with trying not to get stressed about
the small stuff. That is something I need to work on but hopefully with your mentoring I can
improve. Looking forward to the future!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-02-14, 21:44: Hi Ella, How are you doing? Are you ready to do this activity? Best,

2021-11-18, 16:39: Hi Madia! Thanks for starting this conversation! 3 things that I love about rural
living: I love how peaceful it is. It a very low stress environment and I love how tight knit a
small community is. I'm able to do all the things I love easily(skiing, hiking, swimming etc.) I can
create the type of lifestyle that I want. It would most likely be a cabin away from noise, with
dogs, lots of land and a big shop. 2 things I'm not fond of during rural living: There are no big
attractions or stores. It can be quite boring sometimes. Questions I have: What was it like for you
to move to a large city? What was scary and what did you like? What do you wish you knew before
moving? Did you find any new activities that you like in the city that you can't do in a small town?
Thanks as always Madia! EliseMentor 2021-11-21, 01:11: Hi Elise! I also love those things about
rural living. When I was younger (especially before I could drive) I felt that living in the city
was a lot more exciting, and maybe it is, but I've come to be grateful for what rural living offers.
I've also realized that I'm much more of a rural person than a city person. I also agree with your
disadvantages! As soon as you need something that you can't get locally you have to drive pretty far
to get to a city that has what you need. Maybe sometimes its a good excuse to have a road trip...?
lol I found moving to a big city to be both exciting and scary. I was excited to see what the city
had to offer vs. my home town. I was leaving my friends and family and would have to make new
friends, and I didn't speak much French but I was moving to Montreal. I did struggle making friends,
but luckily I had my boyfriend and his family. I eventually made a great friend too, but it took a
while. And luckily, a lot of people in Montreal actually speak English, and if not my boyfriend
could translate lol. I really liked having great transit options, and being in walking distance to
stores. I wish I knew more about Montreal before I moved there. I feel like I didn't really take
advantage of living there, and looking back I would have liked to do more exploring. I spent a lot
of time at home, and would have liked to done more outings. As for activities there were a lot of
little things because cities just have more options. I like to try new things when cooking/baking
and there were lots of international grocery stores (that are amazingly inexpensive). I also had the
oppourtunity to see my favourite musician live (Tom Odell). When I lived at home my friend and I
drove 8 hours to see him in Vancouver the very next day. The 30 minute transit ride was definitely a
lot more convenient lol. I also found some restaurants I love! There is this place that sells
samosas for $0.50! It was also nice to be able to go to actual stores instead of ordering stuff
online. Overall I think moving to the city was a great experience. Even though I had some hard
times, it had a lot to offer, and I grew to appreciate rural living a lot more. It also allowed me
to finish my Biology degree and get to know my boyfriend's family very well. Hope you're having a
nice weekend. Thanks for the great questions :)Mentee 2021-11-29, 14:02: Hi Madia! Sorry for the
late reply. I had a message typed up, but I forgot to hit send.(Oops haha) It's good to hear that
you had similar worries at my age and that you figured it out. I think the majority of the stress
around this transition is due to the fact that I haven't been in a large city on 2 years.
Personally, I think the road trip excuse to visit a city is the best option. I wouldn't want to live
in the city full time. If I have to, I would probably need weekend excursions away from the noise
and at least one person I know in the city. After awhile I think I would become accustomed to it and
find new things I enjoy. Plus, I would gain a new perspective of life. I think I'm okay with this
topic now. Do you want to start the studying module? Thanks so much! EliseMentor 2021-12-02, 22:25:
Hi Elise, No worries at all :) As for moving on to the next topic, I think there is still one more
prompt in this topic. Above this box there is the blue text that says ""Between Worlds."" If you click
on it, it should take you to the next page. After that we can definitely move to 'studying' or any
other module you like. Hope you are having a lovely week! :)","Mentor 2022-01-15, 12:52: Hi Elise, The studying section is open. Looking forward to hearing from
you :)Mentee 2022-01-17, 23:14: Hi Madia I hope you're doing well. Here is my response to this
section. Before Videos: What does it mean to study something? It means to practice and perfect a new
skill or lesson to prepare for a test etc. What do you do when you study? I take good notes, make
flash cards, do practice quizzes and pre read the next days lesson. What have you been previously
taught about how to study? I have been taught to study on short bursts to keep my brain fresh and
reduce fatigue. After Videos: Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video?
What was your experience with those skills? I have used the ask, explain and connect method while
reading a textbook. I also try and integrate both colourful words and pictures into my notes because
it makes my notes easier to read. I write down clear examples in class to help me with my homework.
Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain. No cramming seems like the one I should pay
most attention to because I like ti procrastinate. Which strategy do you think would be most
challenging for you? Why would this be the case? No cramming would be the most challenging because
it's the one that I struggle with the most. Do you have any questions about these strategies? Are
there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional
strategy effective? I would add pre reading because it introduces you to tomorrow's work and let's
you process it overnight. By pre reading the next days work it makes it easier to understand. How
likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might
get in the way of you trying these strategies? I think I will try most of them, but my
procrastinating might get in the way of the no cramming. I am a pretty good student, but lately I
have been struggling with applying myself to my school work. I think I need to utilize my day
planner more often to help me organize my time for studying and to make a check list so I feel
motivated. Thanks so much Madia! EliseMentor 2022-01-19, 21:50: Hi Elise, Great responses! I too
struggle with procrastination - seems like a bit of an unending battle lol. I think its good to be
aware of habits like that though, so you can make an effort to chage them (if you want to). I hope
this section was helpful! Let me know if there are any other sections you want to look at! or any
other questions that you might have! All the best, MadiaMentee 2022-01-21, 00:56: Hi Madia! Thanks

assignment. Thanks so much for all your help! I really appreciate how much effort you put in! Elise
ObalMentor 2022-01-24, 16:15: Hi Elise! That's great! Hope your assignment goes well. I enjoyed
working on this with you so much. I really appreciate the amount of effort you put in as well - it
definitely makes this whole process more enjoyable. I hope the rest of your school year goes well!
And that you stay safe and healthy. Good luck on all your future endeavours! All the best, Madia",,,,"Mentor 2021-12-08, 20:43: Hi Elise, This conversation is now open. Looking forward to hearing from
you :)Mentee 2021-12-15, 17:40: Hi Madia! I hope you’re doing really well. Here is my response from
this section: How easy is it for you to think about self care as something important? It’s sometimes
hard for me to think of self care as something important because I don’t always realize it actually
helps my productivity rather than hindering. What role does time management play in taking good care
of yourself? Time management plays a big role in self care because you need to schedule and balance
work with fun. Do you have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of
the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do
into your own life? Both of my parents push self care more than I do. They push self care through
family activities, daily exercise and quiet time. I need to start scheduling these activities into
my life and prioritizing them. What are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate
you need to be taking better care of yourself? 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with depression. I really
struggle caring for my emotional health and I’m looking at treatment options such as medication,
self care and therapy. How might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self-care more
difficult? Your mentor may have some insight into this! There’s a lot of stress with this transition
and it takes a toll on my mental health. The stress also makes self care more difficult, but all the
more necessary. How good are you at taking care of the basics of self care? : Getting adequate
sleep? I either get too much or too little (6/10) Eating healthy food? When I am stressed or sad I
find myself eating more and more. I figured this out when I was losing a lot of family members
during the starting years of high school. I gained 20lbs in 6 months. I was able to get back to
normal and in shape 6 months later, but with my recent depression I am slipping quite a bit. (5/10)
Drinking water? I try to drink quite a bit of water, but it’s always super hard with masks a school.
(8/10) Regular physical activity? My life has been pretty scheduled lately and I usually come home
and feel too tired. I know that exercise will fix this problem but it’s just getting the push from
myself to do it.(4/10) I am pretty good with planning active activities with friends such as skiing,
hiking and walking etc. we try and do something together once a week. (8/10) Taking breaks from
work? I try and take breaks from work, but I end up procrastinating and not doing work. This leads
me to stay up really late rushing work. I get my work done, but it’s not healthy. Quiet Music and
gum sometimes help with motivation. I think I should probably try time blocking my work and breaks
and turning of all notifications. I have found that I am struggling with being distracted by my
phone at home (Thankfully not at school as well), but it’s really hard to stay on task when all my
work is online. (5/10) These issues have been worsening and I was brave enough to ask for help. It
was super difficult to bring it forward but I am also learning to empathize with others who struggle
with mental health and that there should never be shame in asking for help. I am hoping the break
will help with all of this. I am looking forward to taking a break from school to focus on myself
rather than what others want. Thanks so much for reading this long message and I hope you have a
wonderful week! EliseMentor 2021-12-18, 16:33: Hi Elise! I'm doing pretty good. I just found out a
couple days ago that I got an interview for med school. I haven't been feeling great lately, but the
news definitely boosted my mood! Self care can definitely be hard to prioritize. I often find myself
feeling guilty whenever I do things that might be considered self care. I have a really hard time
letting go of all the things I think I should be doing instead. I think that school makes this even
worse because there's always something school related that I could be doing (studying, homework,
planning, projects, reading, etc). It can get very overwhelming. It's is definitely important to
prioritize self-care. It sounds nice that your parents appreciate self-care. That definitely seems
like a positive environment to be in. I think that self-care looks different for everyone and it may
take some time to find out what works best for you. My mom likes to watch movies and play games with
family/friends but my dad would rather get outside and go hiking/sledding/skiing. I'm still trying
to figure out what works best for me. I'm sorry to hear that you have been suffering from
depression. It's really amazing that you asked for help and pursued a diagnosis. That cannot be easy
- and it really shows the courage and strength that you possess. The transition to post-secondary
can also be made more difficult if you move as your support network isn't nearby. I think modern
technology makes this a little better, but it's definitely still a factor. I also found that I
needed to find new modes of self care. When I was in high school I played a lot of sports and I
think that was a good form of self care for me, but I didn't have that option in post-secondary. I
think it is important to recognize how good you are at ""taking care of the basics"". You seem like a
very self-aware person and that is great! Recognizing that you need help, and asking for help shows
such incredible strength. Being able to talk about it also shows a lot of strength and I think it is
good for people to do so. Thank you for sharing this with me. I'm here to talk if you ever want or
need it. I hope that you have lots of time for self-care during the break. You deserve it. I am
happy to read any length message from you lol :) Hope you are having a relaxing weekend. Kindly,

are delayed in going back to school and that eMentoring is no longer a requirement. That being said,
I am more that happy to keep corresponding if you would like to - and there is no pressure if not :)

to hear from you! I would love to continue talking with you till the end the semester. Sorry, for
such a late response. The schools here were closed for an extra week and none of the teachers
changed the project deadlines due to the closure. I have lots of work ahead of me 😅. I do have a
refelection project for this mentoring program due on the 20th. It would be wonderful if we could do
one more section. Could we do the section on studying because I am find that to be a trouble spot
for me right now? Thanks so much and enjoy your weekend! Elise ObalMentor 2022-01-15, 12:51: Hi
Elise! That sounds great. And no worries - we recieved a message about your guys' late return to
school so I wans't expecting a response for a while :) Oh no, that sounds like a lot of work.
Hopefully its not too stressful! That reminds me of when I was in grade 11 - we had a strike and all
of my teachers cancelled finals except for 1 who said if we came back before the final we would
still have it. Luckily we didn't so there was no final, but we were all very stressed about it lol.
Okay, lets move onto the studying section! I believe it is open, so I will send you a message over
there just to confirm. I'll do my best to respond quickly so you can complete your reflection
project. Thank you, Hope you had a nice week :)",,"Mentor 2021-09-23, 23:00: Hi Elise! My name is Madia. A bit about me: I graduated high school in
2015 and took a gap year to work as a nanny in Ireland. After that I did 2 years of a Rural
Pre-Medicine program, then transferred to Concordia University in Montreal to get my Bachelor's
Degree in Biology. I graduated in 2020 and moved back home to start building a tiny house with my
partner. Currently I am hoping to get into Midwifery or Medical school for next year, but in the
meantime I am taking a Doula course. I enjoy the outdoors (skiing, hiking, canoeing...) as well as
reading, and I recently started crocheting (which I'm really loving right now). I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better. Hope you are doing well! :) Words to live by: If you can do something
about a situation, why worry? And if you can't do something about a situation, why worry? - Dalai
Lama (I really love this quote because it helps me feel ~slightly~ better when I am worried about
something. It is one of very few quotes that I think about often, and it's very practical.) Food for
thought: Leanne's Kale Salad -olive oil -slivered almonds -kale -feta -balsamic vinegar Toast
almonds in olive oil until fragrant and golden brown. Pour over torn and de-stemmed Kale to wilt.
Toss well to coat kale in oil. Crumble in feta and add balsamic to taste. Toss and serve. (I love
this recipe that I got from a highschool friend's mom. It is so simple and delicious. It doesn't
have any measurements because I do it by feel, but it is easy to make. It is absolutely delicious,
and I've never met anyone that doesn't like it! I think most people don't like kale because they
have never had it this way. My parents (and their friends) ask me to make it ALL the time in the
summer.)Mentee 2021-10-04, 14:16: Hi Madia! I'm Elise! A bit about me: I'm set to graduate from high
school in 2022 and I am currently working on figuring out what I want to do next year. Currently,
I'm looking into some type of engineering or going into tho medical field. I am looking forward to
see where life takes me! I love skiing, boating, building things, cake decorating, reading, hiking
and anything that keeps me creative. Thank you for the recipe and the quotes! I'm really looking
forward to trying it out. Some questions I have for you: I was wondering where you took your Rural
Pre Med Program and how did it go? What things should I look into while choosing a program or
school? What problems did you find once you transitioned to post secondary? Thanks so much and I
look forward to getting to know you better! EliseMentor 2021-10-05, 22:31: Hi Elise! (Elise is one
of my favourite names btw because I've always loved the song 'Für Elise) I'm so happy to hear back
from you. I like cake decorating too! I don't do it very often, but it's definitely a fun (and
delicious) creative outlet. I did the Rural Pre-Medicine program at Selkirk College in Castlegar. It
was a lot of work, but I really enjoyed it. I think that there is a lot of benefit in going to a
smaller college before university. I made lots of friends and all the professors were really great!
I found it a lot more conducive to learning because of the smaller class sizes. I decided not to do
the 3rd year, as I wanted to get a Bachelor's Degree and the 3rd year wasn't trasferrable - meaning
it wouldn't could toward my degree and I would have to do 2 more years of classes instead of 1. As
for how to choose, that's a little tougher to answer. That being said, I would think about what
courses you have enjoyed in highschool and why you enjoy them. I have always enjoyed Biology, and
that helped me in my decision to pursue medicine. I really didn't know what I wanted to pursue
initially, so I took a year off to try something new (becoming a nanny in Ireland) and during that
time is really when I figured out I wanted to apply to the Rural Pre-med program. Just remember,
whatever you decide to do, you can always change your mind if it isn't right for you. I think it's
important to choose a path that's sustainable for you (in term of not burning out before you
finish). I found my transition to post secondary to be pretty smooth. I think time management can be
tricky, and it can be a little stressful, but it's not entirely different from secondary school.
Midterms can be a lot of work, especially if you have more than one in a day/week, or if you have a
midterm many weeks in a row. I think it just solidifies how important it is to not fall behind.
Schools have a lot of resources to help you when you neee it, so it doesn't have to be as scary as
it may seem. The hardest transition for me was moving to Montreal and not having any friends at
university. The classes are so big, and I'm pretty introverted, so it was difficult to make friends.
I did eventually make some friends, and I could text/FaceTime my friends in BC, but it was
definitely a little lonely. I hope those answers make sense and aren't too long lol. Let me know if
you have any more questions. :) MadiaMentee 2021-10-07, 15:56: Hi Madia! Thank you for your quick
response! My cousin did the same program at Selkirk a few years ago. She liked it overall, but
didn't finish it because she had a car accident one day on her way to school. I've been looking at
the program and I didn't know that the third year wasn't transferable to a bachelor's degree(thanks
for the heads up). I was also wondering: How much did your grades fluctuate from secondary to post
secondary? What did your expenses look like in your first year? What other careers were you looking
at before you decided to do Rural Pre Med? Thanks for all the info and I hope you have a wonderful
day! EliseMentor 2021-10-10, 16:09: Hi Elise. The 3rd year isn't entirely untransferrable, but it
didn't transfer into a degree I wanted or a school I wanted. I think it's transferable to Royal
Roads university (but I can remember which program), and some others. I think the Selkirk website
outlines where it is transferable. And obviously if you get into med, the tranferability into a
Bachelor's degree doesn't really matter. I would still recommend the program to people interested in
pursuing Rural Medicine. And I found the first 2 years that I did to be really good, and easily
transferable out of province. I'm very sorry to hear about your cousin. I hope you don't mind me
asking (feel free to ignore this question if you do), but is your cousin Evelyn? We were pretty
close friends as she was my lab partner and we also worked together. I would say that my grades
didn't fluctuate too much. My average probably went down a little, but generally was pretty similar.
I did find Calculus to be a lot harder than high school math (which was my best subject back then).
I think that this varies between people, and generally has more to do with time management and study
habits than it does to do with ""intelligence"". I think it is harder for many people to stay on top
of things in college/uni, so good habits go a long way. My expenses in first year were pretty
minimal because I was living at home and had some scholarships. That being said, I think tuition was
like $3000 a semester and I spent at least $1000 on textbooks. This is Selkirks breakdown of fees:
https://selkirk.ca/financial-information/tuition-fees/tuition-fees and other schools will have
similar tables or calculators. If I was renting and buying my own groceries my costs would have been
a lot more. I would really suggest not buying new textbooks. There are lots of 2nd hand textbook
sale groups on Facebook and you can save a lot of money that way. I learned pretty quickly that new
textbooks are not worth it. Most professors say that older editions are just fine (though sometimes
the page numbers don't line up, but you can work around that). Sorry I can't be more helpful about
the rent/living expenses side of things, but don't really know the costs. I had a pretty difficult
time deciding what career I wanted to pursue (honestly still not entirely sure). I was sort of
thinking about engineering in high school, but not very seriously. And then my older sister went
into engineering and I didn't want to do the same thing as her (maybe not a logical choice, but I
didn't like being compared to her lol). When application time came around in grade 12 I had no idea,
so I decided to take a year off. When I was in Ireland, the two things I was considering were Acting
(I love drama class in high school) and Med school, and I decided on medical school because I didn't
feel like I had the skills or courage to pursue acting. I don't think I was ever serious about
pursuing acting anyways lol it just seemed like it could be fun. I hope you are having a lovely long
weekend and are enjoying the nice fall weather. MadiaMentee 2021-10-18, 14:12: Hi Madia! Thank you
for your quick response. Yes, Evelyn is my cousin. I actually think I might have met you once. Wow,
it's such a small world. I didn't know that some schools have online calculators for schooling costs
(That's super helpful 🙂). Also, it's nice to know that some people still don't know what they want
to do exactly and are still figuring it out like me. I was wondering what are you thinking of going
into right now? Some other questions of mine: What are some programs that you wish you knew about?
What did you hear about the Engineering program at Selkirk? What work/volunteer experience have you
had so far? Do you have any recommendations for application tips and tricks? Thanks so much for
being so helpful! I hope you have a wonderful day! Elise ObalMentor 2021-10-21, 16:58: Hi Elise!
Yes, it is a small world. I am so sorry for your family's loss. Evelyn was a wonderful person and I
am very lucky to have known her. The calculators are super helpful, and I think they are fairly
accurate. Right now I am thinking about medicine, midwifery, and maybe pharmacy. I have the
prerequisites for all of them and I think I can make them all work with the lifestyle that I want in
the future. There is definitely pressure to know exactly what you want to do, but I honestly think
most people don't know. And that's okay. Its also okay to try something and change your mind. I used
to always think that people in their 20s had everything figured out, but thats definitely not the
case lol. All of my siblings took a while to discover their career path, and it has definitely taken
the pressure of for me. I wish I knew about the midwifery program sooner. I first heard about it
when I was already in the rural pre-medicine program. This, and other circumstances meant that I
could only apply for the first time last year as I didn't have the pre-requisites. It's okay though,
as I am able to apply now. Pharmacy also only came on my radar this year. I am still not 100% sure
about it, but I think it is a path worth exploring. I have heard good things about the Selkirk
Engineering program. I think it seems like a good starting place to become an engineer, especially
if you want to stay close to home for your first year. To my understanding you have to transfer
after that, and that could be good or not depending on the person I think. From what I remember, the
program at Selkirk was very male dominated, which could also be a consideration for some people.
(This is quite the opposite from the RPM program which had way more women). As for volunteer
experience, here is a non-extensive list: - Best Buddies: I was a peer volunteer and later a
co-president for the club. ""Peer Buddies"" are matched with adults with disabilities to form lasting
friendships. As a co-president I helped recruit volunteers and organized monthly group events -
Rural eMentoring: This one is self explanatory lol :) - BC Summer games volleyball referee &amp;
transport supervisor - OuiCanSki: teaching immigrants to ski so that they can participate in a very
Canadian pastime - SQx Danza: I presented to boards around the Columbia Basin to get funding for
this volunteer dance organization that aimed to promote arts and culture in grade schools. My
recommendations for applications are to start them soon after they open so that you maximize the
time you have to work on them. I would also recommend getting someone (or a few people) to look over
it as you write it. My partner was SO helpful when I was writing my applications, and it helped me
get 2 interviews last year. It is also helpful to start a ""resume"" of sorts that contains all your
work, volunteer experience, and traning/certifications. This will make it easier to think of things
when you are filling out applications. I hope this helps. I have really enjoyed answering all your
questions so far! Hope you are having a nice week. :) MadiaMentee 2021-10-25, 13:52: Hi Madia! It's
good to hear that you have some great plans for your future and it's also good to know that many
people still don't know what they want to do even in their twenties. I am pleased to hear about your
input on the Selkirk Engineering Program. I was aware that it's a male dominated field and sometimes
that stresses me out, but I've learned to not restrict my interests due to a slightly stressful
start. I actually was put in a class of only guys for my metalwork class. I was lonely at first but
I eventually found my place and a few friends. In the end, I built a go kart from scratch. My dad
acts like it's his instead of mine sometimes. He's a bit a large child and that fact often leaves my
sister and l laughing while he races up and down the street in front of our house. Some more
questions of mine: Do you have any studying tricks that help you? I was also wondering what you did
for your capstone project (if you had to do one). What things have you heard about the trades
programs at Selkirk? What jobs have you done and what do you do now? Thanks for all you quick
responses! It has tea helped me with completing my assignments to go along with this program. Have a
wonderful week! EliseMentor 2021-10-29, 15:04: Hi Elise! That's great to hear. I think it's very
important that women are encouraged to go into STEM, even though it continues to be a male dominated
field. My sister is an engineer now and I think she enjoys it (she is a Civil and environmental
engineer). As for taking metalwork - that sounds like a lot of fun. I know some girls that took it
when I was in high school too and they really enjoyed it I think. And it's such a great thing to be
knowledgeable about in the future. As for studying tricks, I am honestly not the best at studying to
be completely honest. That being said, one of the things I have found most is effective is the
Pomodoro Technique where you do 25 minutes of work, and then take a 5 minute break and then repeat.
The hardest part for me is definitely getting started, but this technique keeps me on track. I have
also found that pressure helps me start things. I think everyone is different when it comes to what
works for them, so there is a bit of trial and error when it comes to figuring that out. I honestly
don't think I had to do a capstone project in highschool (or I don't remember doing one anyways). I
did have to do Grad Transitions but I also don't entirely remember what that entailed - sorry about
that! I haven't heard much about the Trades programs at Selkirk as it is at the other campus. In
highschool I did have some friends that did the Aceit program (not sure how it's spelled) where you
do a trade alongside grade 12 so you graduate with both. I know people who did the hairdresser
program as well as someone who did the mechanic I think. They are all still working in the trades
that they learned, so I would take that as a good sign! I can't really comment on what it's like,
but if you're interested I'm sure you could email the various departments for more info :) Here are
the jobs I have done: - Starbucks Barista from July-Oct 2015 (right after highschool) - Au Pair
(nanny) in rural Ireland from Nov-June 2015/2016. - Janitor at a dental office for ~2 years while I
was at selkirk - Summer Student at Teck in 2018 - Summer Research Student at the Jewish Research
Hospital in Laval, Quebec I an current unemployed right now as I am doing an online Doula course and
would like to finish it before getting a job for the year! I'm not sure where I want to apply
entirely, but it would be really great if I could use my Biology degree for it lol. I think Biology
on its own is hard to get a job without a masters. sorry for a bit late of a response. Hope you have
a lovely weekend. All the best, Madia :)Mentee 2021-11-02, 12:35: Hi Madia! Thanks for your quick
response as always. I have been having some trouble stay focused on schoolwork due to some personal
reasons, but I think I'll try your technique tonight. I'll let you know how it goes! I also looked
into the Ace-it program last year and I couldn't decide if it was for me or not. As for my annoying
questions 😂: What was your summer job at Teck like? Who did you work with? What did responsibilities
did you have? Would you do it again? What is a Doula course? Why are you taking it? What are some of
your current goals? How have your goals for life changed since high school graduation? Thanks a
million! Sincerely, EliseMentor 2021-11-05, 15:19: Hi Elise I hope that technique works for you.
Everyone is different so you never know, but it's nice to have some tools that you can use when you
need them. And your questions are not annoying, don't worry lol. I am very happy to answer any
questions you have :). My summer job at Teck was pretty great. It paid very well, which definitely
helped with my tuition and other school costs. It could be pretty exhausting at times, so I didn't
really do much during the week, other than work. It was also interesting working in a very
industrial environment, but I was very lucky with the people I was working with. I was one of four
summer students, and I really lucked out with who I was working with. My best friend (since we were
4!) and Evelyn worked with me, and that was very nice. It made work really fun, and we also hung out
outside of work. Our responsibilities varied a lot because we were ""floor crew"" which basically
meant we did a lot of cleaning, but also anything else they wanted us to do. We also got to operate
bobcats and forklifts, which was fun. At some point I got the role of safety checker, which meant I
had to go around the plant to check all the eyewash and shower stations to make sure they were
operational. I also changed HVAC filters around the plant. I think I would do it again, but I don't
think I can because I am not in full time school right now - which you are supposed to be in to
apply. Towards the end we did have a bit of a negative experience though because we had issues with
one of our collegues (not a summer student). I won't really get into it, because it wasn't really to
do with the work (it was more of an interpersonal conflict). Overall though, I still really enjoyed
it, and it was a summer well spent and I was very lucky with the other summer students I was working
with. The Doula course I am taking is an online certification program so that I can become a
certified labour and post-partum Doula. Doula's provide emotional and informational support in a
number of areas. As I mentioned, the 2 I am learning about are labour and post-partum. Once I am
certified I can work as a Doula to help people that are giving birth, and also help people
afterwards with their new babies. I am taking it partly to help with my midwifery application,
partly because I find it interesting, and partly because I think that the interpersonal skills that
I will learn will be helpful in any sector of healthcare (as I am hoping to get into medical school
or midwifery). I hope that all makes sense. My current goals (from short-term to long term): -
Finish my Doula Certification course - Submit my school applications for next year (due in Dec) -
Get accepted into Midwifery, Medical School, or maybe Pharmacy (if I end up applying - I am still
deciding on that one) - Finish building the tiny house with my partner - Save up with my partner to
buy property and move our tiny house All of these goals (except the last one) I am hoping to do by
next Sept. I don't have many very long term goals, just vague ideas. I would like to end up close to
home when I am done my schooling, and would obviously like to find a job I enjoy. I would also like
to not work entirely full time. I want time to enjoy life outside of work in the future. I would say
my goals have changed since highschool in that I know more of what I want to do. When I graduated
high school I didn't really know what I wanted to do at all so I took a gap year. Now I know that I
want to do something in healthcare and I have based my goals around that. I think I have also
discovered what is important to me now, which has also changed my goals for the future. I know that
I want to be close to family, and I want to have ample ""time off"" to be able to enjoy life with the
people that I love. Thanks for the great questions! I think that I am supposed to be ""unlocking""
other conversations but I am having trouble doing so. Usually theses a navigation wheel I can click
on but its not showing up. We are supposed to be doing these conversations: Studying, Well-being and
self care, Entering the job market, Career Considerations, Post Secondary Considerations, and Paying
for school. Are you able to access these conversations? If not, I will email someone and try to
figure it out lol. Hope you have a nice weekend. :) MadiaMentor 2021-11-05, 15:44: Oops, ignore the
last question in my message! I figured it out yay. Sorry about that. I have opened up the ""Studying""
conversation, but let me know if there is one you would prefer to start on. :) It sounds like they
want us to do 4 conversations. And it also sounds like you can choose whichever ones you want now.
Below is the list of conversations that were ""required"" at the beginning. Studying, Well-being and
self care, Entering the job market, Career Considerations, Post Secondary Considerations, and Paying
for school. But again, I think you can choose any 4 from the entire list of conversation choices
(listed at the bottom of the page) now. Let me know where you want to start and I'll open that
conversation up. Thanks :)Mentee 2021-11-15, 14:06: Hi Madia! Thanks for your quick response. I
remember a few things that Evelyn told me about the Teck Summer Student Program and I'm thinking
applying next year. I was told a little bit about the issue that occurred. I'm sorry that happened.
I'm glad your course is going well. That sounds exciting and it looks like you have a nice flexible
plan. Plus, helping with the delivery and arrival of babies sounds exciting. I was a little unsure
as to how to open those conversation modules you mentioned, but I found a check list at the bottom
of the page and checked off a few. Can we start with the Rural to Urban Module? Thanks so much as
always! EliseMentor 2021-11-15, 22:27: Hi Elise! I would definitely recommend applying. Most of my
experience was great, and the issue that happened was a one off thing and luckily I was working with
Evelyn and Sarah and we could be there for eachother. The majority of people working there were
great! My friend actually met her husband the summer we worked there! I have lots of great memories
and the money I saved came in very handy. Yeah I am not sure if I will start working as a Doula or
not yet, but if I do I am very excited to see some babies. My brother and his wife just had their
first baby in July and its been so wonderful. He is adorable. I will open the Rural to Urban module
right now! :) Looking forward to starting it. Hope you're having a nice start to your week Madia",,,,"Mentee 2021-12-06, 13:28: Hi Madia! Thanks for the quick response. Here is my response to this
section: What do you think the director of the film was trying to communicate about the relationship
between living in the country and living in a city? I think the director was try to show different
snapshots of life in both areas to highlight that they are both ways of living with slight
differences. What, if anything, did you relate to in the images presented in the film? I didn't feel
much of a connection except for the kayaking part because it was something I used to do with my
grandpa. How did you feel while watching the video? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to
create those feelings in you? The video actually made me quite stressed due to the music because I
was expecting it to be a quiet film. I was also a bit curious as to what exactly the film was trying
to portray. In what ways does your emotional response to the film match – or not match - how you are
feeling about possibly moving to the city for post-secondary schooling? I think my response
perfectly matches my feelings towards moving because I am both curious and stressed. Can we move on
to the ""Well Being and Self Care"" section next? Thanks for your time! EliseMentor 2021-12-08, 20:40:

intentional choice. I will open up the well-being module now! :) Hope you are well, Madia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-12-08, 20:42: Hi Elise, if you could submit this form to complete the conversation that

interested to a fair extent, I just dont know too much about the specifics of these careers. Ive
also been interested in philosophy, but career options appear to be rather narrow, so Im considering
it as a minor or to have it contribute towards my buisness ""career"". Good qualities that i believe i
possess for these would be my independency and determination. I dont often rely on others for
needing work done, i like having control over whats important, I do think a management position
would be well fitting but i would enjoy accounting aswell as id also like to say Im good with
numbers. IM unsure how to find out whether these position(s) are in high demand for the area, but my

ready to move on. I have opened up the ""Studying"" conversation for us to start with. Why don't we
begin by going over what you currently do to study and prepare for exam and projects etc. I remember
you mentioning previously that you struggle with procrastination. What is it that causes you to
procrastinate? Examples I've previously struggled with are: - Overwhelmed - Cell phone or other
electronics - Not feeling motivated - Innadequate study space Thanks, LMentee 2021-10-20, 03:20: Hi
Lauren! For studying I often review a ""review"" sheet or a ""study sheet"" made in class, if not I will
often compile my notes into either flashcards, a study sheet or any other efficient form of
studying. My phone Id have to say is one of my biggest distractions. I have definitely gained better
control as I've gotten older, however I love to constantly stay in touch with people. I guess it
provides a sense of fulfillment? Keeping up to date socially is quite reassuring. The odd time it
can also be a good studying environment, being at home I tend to get distracted with various home
activities. I would love to think of a way I could study with friends in person, but I can't
guarantee productivity haha DestinyMentor 2021-10-22, 13:18: Hi Destiny! Those sound like a very
good basis for studying! Based on what you've said a lot of your studying techniques are based
around memorization of the material. One thing I found very helpful during my time in highschool was
re-writing material in multiple different ways. As an audio-visual learning I found taking the notes
I had written during lectures/lessons and adding in any missing details along with any notes I'd
taken from any assigned readings really help with my comprehension of the material. It sounds like
you also really struggle with focus and motivation? Living in a busy home I can understand that it
can sometimes be difficult to focus with the other activities and noises around. A few thing I'd
done to help with this is I invested in some good quality noise cancelling headphone. Whether I'd
decided to listen to something or not I found them extremely helpful to prevent background noise
becoming distracting. During times where I felt that I still couldn't concentrate at home I would
often leave and go to a coffee shop or library, I've found that getting a change of scenery can be
very helpful. As for your struggles with staying connected i found that downloading an app that
prevents you from accessing the apps that prove to be distracting can be helpful. I've also found
that working for smaller bursts of time with more frequent breaks easier on my brain to handle. If I
work for long periods of time I tend to start feeling discouraged in my work and getting more easily
distrated. When it comes to assignments and projects are you one who tends to like to get them done
early? On time? or are they often handed in late? Are you aware of what style of learner you are?
Visual, auditory, or kinesthetic? If you aren't sure I'd be more than happy to provide you with some
resources to learn this and we can try and come up with some learning and studying techniques based
around that? LaurenMentee 2021-10-25, 12:38: Good morning! My apologies for the late response, quite
the busy weekend! Noise cancelling headpones was one of my most valued purchases for sure haha,
music is one of the few things that can get me on track. When it comes to projects and such, I often
get them in on time, but this year theres definitely been a couple overdue. Ive been bit more
focused in my academics rather than careers, so its tough to find balance. In terms of motivation,
if I enjoy the idea of the project it will often be done earlier as I tend to ""push off"" things I
dont find relevance in. I believe I am a auditory-kinesthetic learner (according to myblueprint,cant
assure its accuracy), but I know that I can retain more knowledge when its hands-on learning.
Recording notes off of slides and studying them really isnt the most efficient for me, but
unfortunately that seems to be the way we are taught a majority of things.Mentor 2021-10-25, 19:11:
Hello Destiny, That's more than alright I know life can sometimes become overwhelming. As an
auditory learning I do understand that recording notes off slides isn't always easy I find it much
easier to retain information that was told to me. Some learning techniques that I have found helpful
over the years would include looking up videos on topics that you're learning about. I found youtube
a very important asset during my highschool years. As I remember you previously saying flashcards
are very useful in remembering terms and definitions. You can also adapt certain projects to fit
your needs with the teachers permission. During my time in highschool I often struggled with
projects that needed to have a creative aspect such as posters or pamphlets. However, I really
excelled in powerpoint and essays, so with teacher permission I adapted the assignment to fit me in
order for me to learn the material best. Obivously some teachers would not be so accomodating so
you'd still need to be willing and able to do the ones you're less comfortable with but I found that
very helpful. What would be some things that could benefit you in terms of studying and learning the
material? Do you know of any other studying tips for audio-kinesthetic learners? LMentor 2021-10-29,

therefore I'd consider myself a bit clueless on those topics. DestinyMentor 2021-10-15, 17:48: Hey
Destiny! I am in total agreement with you! I enjoy fall but this is a bit cold for me as well. I
just had a look and I do see your preferred topics. Is there one in particular that you'd like to
start with? Lauren",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-01-10, 20:30: Hello Destiny, Welcome to part 2. To start I'd like you to watch the 2
videos above, and considering the questions posted above those. Once you have completed those I'd
like you to consider the follow questions: 1. What are some of the values expressed by the speakers
in the two videos and how did those values shape their career choices? How do these values align
with your own? 2. In watching these two videos, did you realize something new about what might shape
your own career choices? How might these realizations change your career goals? Please let me know
if you have any questions. LMentee 2022-01-13, 23:54: Hi! I watched both videos and reflected on the
questions in class today, Am I suppose to next complete the activity and send it back to you?Mentor
2022-01-14, 11:34: Hello Destiny, How did your reflection go? Do you have any questions in regards
to this? Did you answer the questions asked in class? Thanks, LMentee 2022-01-14, 15:39: It was
okay! I still get quite nervous thinking about my future so I find trouble having confidence when
discussing my future plans. Other than that, it went rather well though. I seem to have my thoughts
organized but one thing I did want to ask is should money be a serious consideration when looking
into careers? or should i focus more on my interests?Mentor 2022-01-14, 16:08: Hello Destiny, It's
totally okay to be nervous when discussing the future. I have found it becomes easier with time. In
terms of money, given our economy it is an important discussion to have, but should not be the sole
factor in your decisions. It's important to find a job you enjoy, but you need to make sure you're
able to take care of yourself, pay your bills, buy groceries, etc. Often times that means working up
to your dream job. For example, I've worked multiple jobs in my time but have never worked my dream
job as I still need to pay for the school to achieve that goal. The point being money must always be
taken into consideration, but ultimately being happy is the most important thing. What has you so
nervous about the future? LMentor 2022-01-25, 12:36: Hello Destiny, I'm just following up.Mentor

too, too busy for you these days! Yes, of course we can get started on a Conversation if you are
ready to dive in! I have unlocked the ""Post-secondary Considerations"" Conversation since it was
along the lines of what we were already talking about. Looking forward to connecting with you about
your responses to the exercises in this Conversation! Talk to you soon, EssieMentee 2021-11-25,
13:52: hey Essie, While I was looking through the education planner BC, I found that UVIC offers a
social work program. This program interested me because I have always been very passionate about
helping people. especially people in need of help. I do not think that the salary of the job I have
when I am older doesn't matter, as long as I am able to live comfortably, and not have to worry to
much about income. I think it is important to take the highschool courses that will benefit you
later in post secondary, however if you struggle with some classes I do not think that is ruins your
chances of going into the field you would like to go into. How have you managed with hard classes in
university and highschool? DayaMentor 2021-11-28, 18:45: Hi Daya, I hope that you are having a great
weekend! Thank you so much for your thoughtful response to these questions. Your commitment to
helping people through your work is awesome - we need more people like you! The social work program
is great because it doesn't take as long to finish as something like law, where you need an
undergraduate degree first before you take the 3-year program. This means that you are out helping
people and making a big impact in your community sooner! You are totally right: struggling in some
classes will absolutely not hurt your chances of getting into a field that you care about because
you have so many options. Some programs need a certain grade average from highschool (it might be
calculated from just some of the courses that you take in highschool, but this depends on the
program or insitution), so this is something to keep in mind. However, if we look at social work
programs as an example, this program at one institution might have a very different grade average
requirement than a similar program at another institution. This means that there will basically
always be an opportunity to do something that you care about! In high school, I used a lot of online
resources to help me understand material from hard classes. I love, love, love Khan Academy! There
are also great series on Youtube that are awesome for explaining complicated things in a way that is
easier to understand. I really like the ""Crash Course"" series - I used it recently for a university
class on statistics! Have you used any online resources to help you with your classes? If you have
any recommendations I would love to add them to my list of resources! At university, a lot of your
classes have ""teaching assistants"" who are senior students that work with your professor to teach
classes or tutorials. When I had hard classes, I would go and talk to them about the material often
and that was really helpful. At first I felt like I was asking too many questions or maybe wasting
their time, but they really are there to help and they want you to understand, so I stopped feeling
awkward about it. This was good because it was actually SO helpful! Maybe you have done something
similar by talking to your teachers about your hard classes? I also found that organizing and
reviewing my notes after class was helpful because then I could make sure I understand things before
next class or prepare questions that I want to ask in class if I need help understanding something.
I really appreciate your thoughtful answers to the prompts on this Conversation, Daya! There is a
second part to it if you click on the blue ""next"" arrow at the bottom of the text - I will leave you
a comment over there too, so it is easy to find! :) EssieMentor 2021-12-22, 15:16: Hi Daya, I just
wanted to send you a quick note to check in and wish you a happy holiday season! Hopefully you are
able to celebrate all your hard work this semester, and take some well-earned time to relax. May you
enjoy spending a special time with your family, however you are able to connect this year. Looking
forward to connecting soon! With very best wishes, EssieMentor 2022-01-04, 14:23: Hi Daya, Happy new
year!! I hope that you had a special and festive time with your loved ones! I've been informed that
your school break has been extended and that this program is now optional for the rest of the
semester. Hopefully this makes things a bit less stressful! I just wanted to let you know that I
will still be around as your mentor if there is anything at all that you want to chat about :) Also!
Since no specific Conversations are required any more, if there is any topic that you want to
explore they are all available now! With best wishes, EssieMentee 2022-01-05, 00:50: Hey Essie,
sorry I haven't gotten back to you in a while, it's been a very odd winter break. Lots of new
changes and stress happening. Two of my cousins and uncle got Covid over Christmas, and with the
extended break it felt a lot like back in March 2020, which I did not enjoy. Hopefully things will
get better now because Covid is not making my mental health any better. Thank you for checking in
every couple of week! I hope you had a really good holiday, and hope that your new year is filled
with positivity!!! -DayaMentor 2022-01-07, 00:58: Hi Daya, It is so great to hear from you! That
really sucks that you had a challenging and stressful winter break - that's the last thing that you
need at the end of 2021!! I do hope that your cousins and your uncle are feeling better. I totally
know what you mean about how COVID ramping up again is just so bad for our mental health. Are you
finding ways to manage okay? Hopefully soon it will warm up again and we can at least spend some
time outdoors in nature... I always find that helpful for my mental health. I also want to thank you
so much for your kind words of encouragement and positivity! You really brightened by day!! I am
sending you all the good vibes for the new year and wishing you lots of happiness and health :) Talk
to you soon, Essie",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-26, 21:49: Hi Daya! My name is Essie and I am a first-year law student at Dalhousie
University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I noticed that you are also interested in law and that you want
to specialize in social justice and supporting women who have experienced domestic violance - we
need more peolpe like you! It looks like you are interested in the University of Calgary, too!
Although I am not currently studying there, I did my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at UofC so if
there is anything in particular that you wanted to know about UofC, or if any questions come up
during the program (about law, UofC stuff, applications, or really anything!), please send them my
way! :) I am so excited to go on this journey with you and to learn from your experience and your
ideas as we go through these activities! I really hope that this can be a meaningful experience for
you and that we can accomplish all of the things that you were looking for in this program. For our
activities for this section, I chose ""Words to Live By"" and ""Food for Thought"" - of course, you are
welcome to choose any of them that you like, they don't have to be the same! My favourite quote is:
""Not all those who wander are lost"" by J.R.R. Tolkein. The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite
series, so it is special to me because it is from one of those books but also because I feel like it
has given me hope and encouragement throughout my time in university. When I feel like I haven't
made the right choices with courses or even with my program, this quote reminds me that I may not be
lost when a path doesn't seem obvious. There are opportunities to learn and new paths that arise
unexpectedly that remind me that I haven't wasted time or made bad decisions. For ""Food for Thought""
I'll attach a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is special to me because it was the first recipe
that I mastered after moving away from home to go to university! When I moved away, I had no idea
how to cook anything and that was really challenging because I LOVE good food. I have come a long
way from burning water (yes, that did really happen to me when I first tried to make pasta!) and
love cooking for friends and feel proud that I can now make good, healthy food that I really enjoy
:) Looking forward to hearing back from you when you have a chance! Hope that school is off to a
good start for you and that you had a good long weekend :) EssieMentor 2021-09-26, 21:55: Mentor
2021-10-12, 23:47: Hi Daya! I hope that you had a restful and refreshing long weekend with your
loved ones. I just wanted to send you a quick note to check in :) You may not have had a chance to
start the program in your class yet, but I am here to connect whenever you are ready - no rush! If
you have any questions at all about getting started, please feel free to let me know. Looking
forward to meeting you soon. Hope that the school year has been going smoothly for you! EssieMentee
2021-10-12, 23:58: Hey Essie, I hope you had a great thanksgiving as well! Mine was especially good
because I got to see my granny who I don’t see that often. In class so far we have not talked much
about the eMentoring, I think mostly because we have been quite busy with other projects and
classwork. I thought it was really nice if you to send me that cookie recipe, especially since I am
sort of nervous to cook food on my own. Mostly because I tend to get distracted and forget about
things, which then leads to them excessively burning or lighting on fire. I see that you did
neuroscience and you are doing a law degree right now. Was there any specific reason why you chose
to do both instead of one or the other? -DayaMentor 2021-10-15, 16:13: Hi Daya, I am so glad to hear
that you had a good time over Thanksgiving with your Granny - that is so special! No worries at all
that your class hasn't gotten to eMentoring yet (thanks for sending me a message anyway! :D).
Believe it or not, I have definitely burned tons of stuff learning to cook (water, eggs, pies...),
but the great thing about it is that the more you practice, the more it becomes like second nature
so you just kind of KNOW when you need to remember stuff. Since you are great at sports (and so many
different kinds!) maybe you kind of know what I mean about just getting a sense for things with
practice? :) Thanks for your question! I started in Neuroscience because I wanted to be a doctor,
but the more Neuroscience I did the more I realized I liked it a lot...so I didn't want to be a
doctor any more. For example, I learned that I actually really liked writing papers and working in a
university. I did Neuroscience for 10 years, and over time I realized that even though there was a
lot that I liked about it, it was still missing something: being able to help people. Science can
definitely help people, but it can take decades to know how a discovery can do that and I really
wanted to help people around me now. That was why I wanted to do medicine in the first place. For
me, Law made this perfect connection of giving me the tools to help people around me and keeping
what I liked about Neuroscience (writing, working in a university, etc.). It was hard to change my
plans after being in Neuroscience for 10 years, but it was really important to me to be honest with
myself about how my ideas and goals changed over time as I got to know myself better. So far I think
it was a good choice - Law is awesome! Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? Have a great weekend!
Hopefully I'll talk to you more next week! EssieMentee 2021-10-20, 15:43: Hey Essie, That sounds
like a lot of school, but that's good that you changed your career path because it is very important
to do things that make you happy. I have not always wanted to be a lawyer, I wanted to do
kinesiology for a long time. It was what i was postive I was going to go to school for, but then
last year I did lots of projects on Homelessness and Drug addictions. Thats when i decided i wanted
to be involved in the legal field. However i dont specifically want to be a lawyer, i would most
likely become a paralegal, because it involves less public speaking. If i were to become a lawyer, i
would most likely become a lawyer for sexual assault and abuse, or be involved with like the
homelessness side of law. What area of law are you planning on doing in the future? -DayaMentor
2021-10-24, 01:24: Hi Daya, Thank you so much for sharing your career plans, and pointing out the
projects that got you interested in law! A paralegal degree sounds awesome! It would also be less
school than a lawyer too because I think it is 4 years at a university for the degree or 2 at a
college for a diploma. This means you will be out and helping people faster than if you do a law
degree because that is 3 years and requires that you already have a bachelor's degree. However, if
that was something that interested you, the bachelor's degree doesn't have to be in any field that
is especially law-like - it could be anything! So if you really liked kineseology, you could do that
for your bachelors and then go to law school after. I think I want to do intellectual property law
and help people get patents for their inventions! You know, even if you have a law degree and are a
lawyer, you don't have to practice law - there are tons of jobs in the government, libraries,
nonprofit organizations, consultation, etc. that don't involve lots of public speaking! When I first
came to law school, I thought it would be like on tv where you go to court and argue a case and,
although that can be the case if you want it to be, there are tons of other jobs out there for
lawyers that I didn't know about! Do you have any ideas about where you would like to go to school?
Are you still interested in the University of Calgary or have any other places caught your interest?
:) Hope you are enjoying a great weekend! Looking forward to talking to you again soon, EssieMentee
2021-10-25, 12:18: Hey Essie, University of Calgary is definitely my first choice school, unless i
end up getting a scholarship for track and field in the states. I have been talking with some NCAA
schools in colorado regarding track and field. This has been super stressful for me because i have
been tackling school and also now talking with coaches and setting up plans to call them. Even
though it is very stressful, it makes me happy that i have the chances of getting into a NCAA school
which has been a dream of mine for years now. What made you choose Calagry as your choice of
school?Mentor 2021-10-28, 16:13: Hi Daya, The University of Calgary is an awesome school - I had a
really great time there! It is a fantastic first choice school! I can imagine how tiring it must be
to set up calls with coaches from all those NCAA schools, especially if it is your dream to go
there. Interviews take a lot of energy, and I bet it can be exhausting when you have to be your best
self at all of these calls. Fortunately, it will be behind you soon and no matter what I know you
will end up at a great school! I was actually living in Calgary when I applied to UofC and I knew
that I didn't want to move away for school, and since they have a fantastic neuroscience program it
was a perfect fit for me! I am really enjoying learning about your university plans and what you are
interested in at a school, Daya, and I think our chat is super relevant to some of the
""Conversations"" that we are supposed to work through together in this program! I am super excited
for us to talk about your interests in more depth and we can dive in whenever you are ready! Have
you talked about starting the program in class yet? I think your teacher has a couple Conversations
that they want us to complete, so whenever you are ready we can start off by completing the one that
we are working (Conversation: Start Here! Anchor Text 1: Meeting Your Mentor)! Let me know if you
have any questions about how the program works or about how to tackle the exercise in this first
Conversation! :) I'm excited to work on this program together and get to know more about your
interests and goals! :) Looking forward to chatting with you again soon, Daya! EssieMentor
2021-11-08, 13:11: Hi Daya! I hope that you had a great weekend! I just wanted to send you a quick
note to check in :) How are you doing? Is everything going okay? I know you might still be super
busy with your interviews (on top of all your school!), so no worries at all about replying right
away. If you have any questions at all though, or if there is anything that I can help out with,
please don't hesitate to reach out any time! :) I am rooting for you!! Hope that you are doing well
and everything is going smoothly! EssieMentee 2021-11-18, 13:12: Hey Essie, I was wondering if we
would be able to start a conversation topic, as I need that for my first term report card. thanks!
-Daya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-28, 18:55: Hi Daya, Here is the second part of this Conversation about post-secondary
education! Once we finish this one, we are technically done this Conversation, but there are also
some ""Extension Activities"" (you can access them by clicking on the blue arrows at the bottom of the
text again) that you are welcome to explore! I don't need to unlock these for you so you can explore
them at your own pace and, of course, I am super happy to chat about anything that comes up for you
if you check them out! I am really looking forward to your thoughts about how high school might be
different from doing post-secondary education! There are a few things that come to mind right away
for me. I definitely found that there was a lot less supervision and guidance (from parents and
teachers). You have a lot more flexibility with your time which is pretty awesome because you can
choose what you want to do and when you like to do it, and also more responsibility to figure things
out on your own and ask for help when you need it. When I moved away from home for my second
university degree, I didn't think that I would get homesick but I actually did. I didn't know anyone
in this new place and it was pretty lonely for a while. It got better after a few months: talking to
my family and friends back home often helped, and I made new friends. It ended up being the best
choice I have ever made, but it was definitely hard for a while! Looking forward to talking to you
soon, EssieMentor 2021-12-10, 09:35: Hi Daya! I hope that you are doing well and looking forward to
a great holiday season! I just wanted to send you a quick note to check in and see if you were able
to access this second section of anchor text okay. No worries at all if you haven't had time to work
on it, but if you have any issues accessing the material, please don't hesitate to let me know!!

know if you are able to see it or not :)",,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-26, 12:49: Hey it's Connor, sorry I haven't checked in for awhile I've been really
busy with other classes and work. My definition of studying something is to focus and concentrate on
a subject until you completely understand the concepts surrounding it. My personal regiment when
studying is I usually end up waiting till the last night and then staying up extremely late getting
everything nailed in. I usually learn best re-writting and wording the concept in forms where I
would understand it. This is a really bad way of studying however it has worked for me being pretty
busy. I have to go so I'm just going to send this to save it then I'll continue soon.Mentor
2021-11-04, 15:39: Hi Connor, sorry I have also been busy these days and didn’t get a chance to
reply. I also tend to procrastinate and leave my work till the last minute. This worked well for me
in high school (I was an honor roll student) because the teachers teach in class as you have never
learned the subject before. When I started university, I continued doing that and found that my
grades dropped significantly. Why? Because professors expect you to pre-read your material before
class. I used to skip this because I was busy finishing my homework from last week. In this way, I
was always behind. Also, even though a semester is of four months, you only have classes for around
3 months. So, you may have a midterm of 4-5 chapters every month for all classes. That’s why being
organized is key to being on top of your schoolwork especially if you are involved in volunteer
activities or have a job. The most helpful thing for me is that I write all my due dates for the
semester on a calendar and then aim to finish the assignments 3 days beforehand. Sometimes I do tend
to get lazy and do things last minute, but the results are not always the best.Mentee 2021-11-05,
15:52: Thanks so much for your response a lot of the points you covered make sence and definitly
apply to me. I have been getting really good grades so far this year but I definitly don't think
doing everything last minute will workout in the long run. Especially not when I advance to
post-secondary. Going on what you explained it seems like you really can't be leaving things to the
last minute. My goal is going to try and stay organized and I'm going to use your strategy of
putting down all my homework at the beginning. I think this would be extremely beneficial to
me.Mentee 2021-11-05, 15:52:",,,"Mentor 2021-11-13, 01:45: Hi Connor, I am glad you found my comments for the studying module to be
helpful. Since we are done with that conversation, I have opened up Dis and Misinformation
conversation. Going forward, please let me know if you are interested in a specific topic from the
wheel above.Mentee 2021-11-22, 14:11: Misinformation and disinformation seems interesting to me.
After reading a bit about it and watching a video explaining it I now way better understand why
people do it and how you can identify it. Your emotions actually play a massive role in this
subject. Just sharing something you like or agree with can cause a chain of false information that
people think is real. I am usually not as careful as I should be when seeing information online
because it can be so easy for someone with a political or social agenda persuade you by
disinformation and slightly changing the truth to fit their nerarive. I often like to point out
misinformation with my family members and friends because I can usually tell when something is being
exagerater or fabricated just to fit a narrative. This type of thinking is extremely important in
our society today. Information is spread around so fast that one rumour could lead to a full news
story stating it's true. One problem in our society is that most people believe and trust in the
news however they usually have there own opinions and narratives that make them slightly change the
truth.Mentee 2021-11-22, 14:13: This misinformation can be extremely important to me as a student
because believing in fake news can lead me down the wrong path, believing in fake narratives and
being super influenceable by others and society.Mentor 2021-12-04, 00:25: Hi Connor, It is hard to
distinguish between fake news and real news. However, I never really thought about the intentions of
those who spread that information. The terms misinformation and disinformation got me thinking that
some people may share the information out of concern, while others are just trying to create a
controversy. In terms of being a student in high school, I was told not to rely on websites like
Wikipedia or social media for research. In university, we are told to use academic search engines or
google scholar when researching for papers because that information is verified and thus
trustworthy. Even beyond school, the only way to avoid becoming a victim of false information is to
question any information you read, watch, or listen to. The above-given video demonstrates what it
means for something to be taken out of context or the desire to catch and hold the audience's
attention (often at the expense of truth).Mentor 2021-12-04, 00:26: I have just opened the next
conversation topic, 'Career Considerations' now.Mentee 2021-12-06, 14:02: Yes, I totally agree with
all that you said. There are people with several actually reasons to spread misinformation, usually
to support their agendas however there are also people that just want to create pointless
controversy. In school I do usually end up using unreliable sources mainly because of laziness. This
is one thing that I should look toward fixing. My school even has a database with linked reliable
sources. I think everyone should use more of these to help stop the spread of misinformation.",,,"Mentee 2021-10-07, 15:44: Hi, my names Connor Nagle and im from Rossland, BC. My interests include

important to overall wellbeing. I'm interested to see what you think! Cheers, DamonMentee

2021-12-16, 12:37: Hey Christian, That makes sense, you take inspiration/motivation from your goals.
One important part of that is making your goals achievable so that there are small steps that you
can take now in order to eventually reach that goal. Some people call these ""SMART"" goals (specific,
memorable, attainable, realistic, time-bound). What're some goals aside from your post-secondary
goal that you have these days? Cheers, DamonMentee 2021-12-16, 13:23: I want to be succesful, I want

right? What's the process of getting into Junior Hockey, and how does all of that impact your
university applications? Do you have to apply separately for sports scholarships? If you do get a
scholarship, have you thought about how you might balance the demands of school versus your team?
I'd imagine you already have an idea about that since you're already doing it in high school.
Cheers, DamonMentee 2021-12-16, 19:10: Yes I am a goalie, As of right now im finishing up my last
year of minor hockey playing U18 AA. We have a few local teams around Junior B and A, I am an
affilaite player with the local Junior B team just down the road from where I live and I feel like
if I keep my game up I have a good chance of playing there next year. If I was to make It I would
still be able to attend the local collage I applied at as It is a 30 minute drive from where I live
and practices and games are at night so I feel like I would be able to balance that. Lots or
Univeristes and Collages scout the leauge so it is a well known leauge. I am still not 100% sure If
I will continue to play Hockey nect year as of right though.Mentor 2021-12-20, 19:27: Hey Christian,
That's awesome! You must be a really talented goalie to be playing AA and obviously you have a solid
work ethic. I think it's great you're planning this out now rather than later. There are also tons
of examples of varsity athletes who transition to medical school so I think it's totally reasonable
with good planning and hard work. I'd love to know the reason why you're not sure about continuing
on with hockey next year, is it to focus on school/career planning or something else? Happy
holidays! Cheers, DamonMentee 2021-12-21, 14:06: Im just not sure If I will be able to find the
balance Between school and Hockey because in Junior hockey your busy with hockey almost everyday but
Im sure I will continue on with hockey. Happy Holidays!Mentor 2022-01-03, 12:13: Hey Christian,
Happy New Year! I was on holidays for the past two weeks. Did you do anything fun during your break?
And yes I agree, to continue getting better at the level you're at it does take a lot of hard work
and consistency. On this topic of finding inspiration and creativity, I wonder do you have time for
any other hobbies or creative outlets? Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-01-04, 15:27: Happy New Years Yes
one of my hobbies other then hockey is Fishing in the summer but latley Ive really been into gmaing
with my friends over the holiday break.Mentor 2022-01-06, 16:26: Hey Christian, I wanted to let you
know that because your class had to miss a week of school, your teacher has now made eMentoring
optional for the rest of the semester. Since it's no longer required, we can actually unlock
whatever conversation or discuss whatever topics you find helpful. Regardless, I'm going to stay
available to talk for the rest of the semester if you'd like to continue our conversations. If
things are too busy for you with school and hockey I also am totally okay with that. Either way,
I'll keep an eye out and would be more than happy to talk about whatever is on your mind. Cheers,

completed, Im ready to get started with the next moduleMentor 2022-01-10, 17:27: Hey Christian,
Thanks for the update! Sure, I'll unlock ""Career Considerations"". Cheers, Damon","Mentor 2022-01-10, 17:29: Hey Christian, Let me know once you've reviewed the anchor text! I'm
interested to hear your thoughts and ideas on this topic. Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-01-10, 19:15: I
have just finished the anchor textMentor 2022-01-12, 22:12: Hey Christian, Have you had a chance to
do any of the career compass quizzes? It'd be interesting to see how they compare to what your
current career plans are and whether they give you any insights into your own strengths other career
options for you. I like that it takes into account some real-world considerations like how in-demand
the career is, what kind of salary you can expect, and other considerations like whether you'd need
to live in an urban vs. rural area. These are all super important, especially as we get older and
start to have extra responsibilities like a family! Let me know which three career options you
picked from the Career Compass quiz results and what you think about how realistic those could be
for you. Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-01-12, 23:52: Yes I was able to do two of them, the Last ones link
wouldnt work. I got a Dentist and a ElectricianMentor 2022-01-15, 13:20: Hey Christian, Nice! Not
exactly what you've been planning (ie. general practitioner) but dentist is pretty close. Seems like
you have some of the skills/qualities that are useful in healthcare professions which is awesome!
How do you feel about the electrician option that the quiz suggested? Cheers, DamonMentee
2022-01-16, 16:35: I really want to have a job in the medical field, I really like to help people
but I do have a little intrest in being an Electrician It is actually one of my backup plans. This
semester I have an electronics class and I do enjoy it but I really to want to. stick to the medical
feildMentor 2022-01-16, 19:04: Hey Christian, That makes a lot of sense, I'm glad that the quizzes
helped to show you that some of the skills and qualities you have are suited towards a career in
healthcare. It's a great idea to keep your net wide early on but still have a focus at the end of
the day to shoot for. If you don't have any more questions or topics you want to discuss within this
section, it looks like we're done our conversation topics! I'll still be checking my account
regularly and would be happy to help you at any point during the rest of this semester if you have
any questions or would like to talk more about specifics around getting into medical school in the
future. Otherwise, it was really nice to get to know you and from our conversations, I'm sure you
have a bright future ahead of you! Cheers, DamonMentee 2022-01-16, 19:26: Thank you for everything.
It sounds like you have a very bright future ahead of you to Thank you!",,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-07, 17:57: Hey Christian, I've unlocked the Studying conversation. Let me know when
you've read/watched the material and what you think! What sort of habits or techniques do you
usually use to study? Do you use different study techniques for different subjects? For me, I think
learning how to learn made a huge difference when it came to being successful at school. You've
probably heard over and over again how cramming is bad, and it's true! But at the same time it can
be hard to plan a week's worth of studying to crush that exam on Friday because it's daunting and
takes effort to follow through on, especially if all you're planning to do is re-read/highlight
chapters from a textbook. That can be super boring and exhausting. I think there's a sweet spot in
between those study habits that I found to be really useful for me. Here's some tips that I use all
the time when I'm studying for my exams: - Active recall: when I study, I try my best to actively
test myself whenever I can to almost replicate the exam before I write it. At the end of every
chapter, this might mean making my own study questions/flashcards that I can test myself on later.
This also helps me digest the information because I need to understand the material before I can
make a good question. I love this technique because it tells me objectively what I understand and
what I don't. It can be really hard to have a sense of where you're at when you're just reading the
material passively and not engaging with it. Practically, I use flashcards all the time. I use a
software called Anki to make/store my flashcards. If you're interested I'd be happy to talk more
about Anki. - Spaced repetition: basically, once I have my set of questions/flashcards for the topic
I'm studying, now it's simply a matter of testing myself. One way can be to blast through them
repeatedly the night before the exam. This works for some people, but the issue is that you tend to
forget everything you learned really soon after the exam. For subjects that you want to continue to
study in college as you work towards becoming a family doctor, it's more useful to study your
questions a few times. Rather than doing it all one day, you can make it more manageable by doing a
few every day. This cuts down on daily study time but also forces you to recall the information more
often, giving you more bang for your buck. - The basics: a healthy sleep, diet, and exercise
schedule is key to keeping your brain healthy and ready to learn new information. As a hockey player
I'm sure you have the exercise part covered. One thing I still struggle with is respecting the fact
that getting 8 hours of sleep and eating healthy is huge when it comes to studying and remembering
information. It's essential! Here's a really useful video that goes even deeper into the study
philosophy that I have: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE Looking forward to hear about
your own study techniques, and any questions you might have. Cheers, DamonMentor 2021-11-22, 22:18:
Hey Christian, Just checking in. Things must be busy during your senior year in high school, so no
worries! Connect when you can. Cheers, DamonMentee 2021-12-01, 15:35: I found trying to cram a whole
unit into one night when its the night of the test is not a good iead, you brain is not able to
obtain that much informsation in a short span of time. Instead I take 20 minutes a night the week
before a test which allows me to review certian topics of the unit with detail. I feel like the
flashcards would be helpful for me with short key points on the cards. Another one could be making
questions about the unit and awnsering them as the unit goes along.Mentor 2021-12-01, 22:59: That's
awesome Christian! To have that study philosophy so early on will be huge when you transition to
post-secondary education. It's better to instill good habits early because they have a compounding
effect! If you don't have any more questions/things you wanted to discuss about studying, how about
we move on to another topic? We can choose between ""Finding Inspiration"" and ""Career Choices"".

student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I'm currently working at Vancouver
General Hospital with the kidney specialist team. I'm excited to be your mentor for the school year!
I'm an open book so any questions you might have as you look to transition from high school to
whatever is next after graduation, I would be happy to try to answer. In the spirit of getting to
know each other, I'd love to hear about what subjects you enjoy at school, what your plans are after
graduation, and also what kind of hobbies you enjoy outside of school. Words to Live by: ""compare
yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today"". This quote really hits home for
me because it reminds me that everybody has their own unique life situation, so trying to
superficially compare yourself to others without knowing their story can lead to negative emotions
that hurt rather than help you. It is often more valuable to take inspiration from others and apply
it your own life, then thoughtfully track how you yourself are doing rather than comparing yourself
to someone else. Public Persona: someone who I grew up idolizing was the late basketball legend Kobe
Bryant. He took the quote I just mentioned to heart and worked on his basketball game every single
day, regardless of how hard his teammates and opponents were working because his motivation was his
love of the game of basketball. His discipline, grit, and wisdom really helped me to frame how I
want to live my life and approach obstacles. I hope to hear from you soon! Cheers, DamonMentee
2021-10-06, 15:44: Hi Damon!, I'm doing great how about you , at school I like Biology and
Chemistry, I'm not such a big fan of physics , I also enjoy math. After I graduate, I want to become
a General Practitioner or an MRI technician, I plan to start with a pre med program, Im just not
sure what what courses to take after highschool to achieve my goal. Outside of school I love playing
hockey , I'm a goalie for the local rep team.Mentor 2021-10-10, 23:47: Hi Christian, It's great to
hear from you! Sounds like we have a lot of the same interests. I also played ice hockey growing up
and I still do play once a week in a men's league. I'm a winger myself. Do you have any plans to
continue playing ice hockey after high school? Goalie is such an important position! Our goalie on
my men's team this year actually used to play in the WHL and bails us out pretty much every game. I
also loved biology and chemistry in high school, so much so that I majored in Biochemistry for my
undergraduate degree before medical school. I think both of your career ideas are great choices! I
have a friend who is actually a radiology technician and I think she would be happy to answer any
specific questions you have about that. As for pre-med in university, I think I can definitely help
you in terms of planning what courses to take. What grade are you in? Also, which
universities/colleges are you thinking of applying to? If you haven't gotten that far in terms of
planning, no worries! One step at a time. Otherwise, I think we can probably start the next step in
the mentorship program pretty soon. I think we'll plan to start that after I hear back from you.
Happy Thanksgiving! Cheers, DamonMentee 2021-10-18, 21:11: Hi , I have now decided I want to go to

learning about your experience, and how I should be preparing myself for the future. I just started
my senior year in highschool, some courses so far have been okay, but it's a lot more work than last
year for sure. I see you haven't sent me a message yet, so I can't wait to hear back from you.Mentor
2021-10-11, 19:54: Hi Calli, I hope you've enjoyed the long weekend so far! I am glad you started
the conversation. As you also mentioned, year by year it gets busier with university and its
workload. I am currently in my second year of pharmacy degree at UBC and I would be more than happy
to help with any question that you might have. It could be regarding the university life, choosing a
major, or just catching up about general areas. The fun fact is that along with the university, I
also have 3 jobs! of course they are not all full time but I found out the busier I am the better I
perform! Tell me about your life at school and how you manage the workload as you said it's heavier
this year :)Mentee 2021-10-21, 15:47: Hey! 3 jobs?! sounds like you got a busy lifestyle, but that's
good that it keeps you in check! school has been busy for me because I am in CLC right now, so it's
a lot of thinking about my future, finding school/job interests and such. Biology 12 has been
difficult, quite a jump from bio 11. However I;ve been doing good in pre calculus 12. I try to get
stuff done in class, but I often have a lot of homework. I work at Starbucks, whichis usually 3-5
work days a week. I find it difficult to find time for homework on heavier work weeks, but I've been
managing so far. I also go to the gym 5-6 days a week, so some days I go straight from school
8;38a,-2;38pm, work 3-7pm, then gym 7:15ish-8;30pm. I'm going to start applying to
colleges/universities next week. I've decided to go into Diagnostic Medical Sonography, and I plan
on doing both Cardiac and General. Have you heard much about this career path? I used to be
interested in Pharmacy, with the hopes to become a pharmacist, but I've shifted ideas as I think I
like the sounds of Sonography's studies and work environment better.Mentee 2021-10-21, 15:47: Mentor
2021-10-21, 16:16: Hi Calli, so glad to hear that you manage to go to gym and have a healthy
lifestyle as well as working and studying. That was were I had difficulties to manage in the past.
However, I am having a better balance now and go to gym 2-3 times each week and I'm happy about it.
it is great that you have a goal of going into the sonography path and study about it. Except that I
know BCIT offers that, I have not much of information about it. However, generally, when choosinh a
path I would suggest to be honest with ourselves. I started studying architecture when I finished my
high school. That was my passion back at that time. However, soon after I realized a couple of
things which made me change my whole career path. First, I realized to be a good architecture, I
have to have a solid background in art which I didn't. I had to be honest with myself at that time
and accept that there are others in this path with a more related background than me. Not to be
discouraged and not try new things, not at all. But I realized I am not that passionate about the
artistic side of this job and I just liked the vibe of it being an architecture! It sounded so good!
But not the right fit for me! Second, I realized the money and salary do matter to me. I realized in
the future there won't be a very high salary for this job. If I wanted to be ignorant I would have
say ok the money doesn't matter to me! But it did matter and still does! (Another section of being
honest with ourselves) Lastly, I realized how the prestige and job title also matter to me. And i
feel better when I'm involved in medical settings comparing to engineering or art. This is also
cultural related I believe. All in all, it was scary to change the path, because I was like, what if
I don't like pharmacy either??? What would happen then? What if I am not good at that too?! But I
gathered all my energy and did make the change, and after all, I'm like, why didn't I do this
earlier 😎 I am so happy with where I am now, thanks to the hard work in past, thanks to the very
very hard moment of making decisions and taking risk. Nothing is permanent, if you don't like a path
you choose now, you can definitely change it in the future, it's never late. And be honest with
yourself, set your goals and expectations and see if this career path will fulfill them😊Mentee
2021-10-26, 12:04: Hi! Thank you for the insight and advice based on your career/education path!
It's reasurring to know that there's always time to make decisions. I totally agree with you that
although happiness with what you choose to do is important, so is a stable income! I'm beginging to
apply to schools, and one of our ocnversations is due on friday in my Career Life Considerations
class, so I figure, maybe we should start with the Post Secondary Considerations topic!? What was
your experience like when applying to schools, and how did you decide which school was right for
you? What post secondary requirements did you need to get into Pharmacy at UBC? and how long did
that take you? Excited to hear back😁Mentor 2021-10-26, 12:23: Hi Calli, Happy to hear what I shared
earlier was helpful☺️ For getting into the pharmacy school, I first needed to change my whole major
from engineering and architecture to science so that I can build a solid background in science which
I didn't have back at that time. It was scary a little bit to see all who seat with me in a
classroom have a science background or at least passed some biology courses but I had none based on
my architecture background. I had tu study very hard to reach their level and compete. At the same
time I had to not only pass my biologu ans science related courses, But also haf to keep my gpa high
so I can enter the pharmacy school. for getting into the ubc pharmacy, we had to pas 60 credits with
high gpa in science with a good resume to get interview. Then those who het the interview based on
their gpa, will compete with each other in the interview and some will get acceptance aftet the
interview. through the whole process, I could have say to myself that this is hard and I donyhave
the background and I cannot compete with the other students, BUT INSTEAD! I kept telling myself that
it others were able to do this and get into the pharmacy school, I CAN DO THIS TOO🤩Mentee
2021-10-28, 15:34: hey!! that's so awesome. as I mentioned, we should probably start one of our
conversation choices, so if you could start that, that would be great :) thank you again for the
advice, let's continue talking about post secondary considerations, in the post secondary
conversation topic. some information that I think would be useful when thinking of post secondary
would be, costs, the amount of time you spend in class/online classes, do you have a large class, or
a smaller class? which do you prefer? have you gone to more universities besides UBC? how come you
chose that partcular school? what was your experience like when applying to schools? how long did it
take you to apply to schools? any advice when it comes to applying? would love to hear your advice
and feedback!Mentor 2021-10-29, 16:58: Hi Calli, Thanks for your message. I used to go to BCIT
before starting at UBC . What made me change my university was that I needed a higher variety of
courses and programs being offered to me so I can better choose among them. Although I found UBC
pricier but I decided to do this change anyway. At the beginning the class sizes were shocking to
me! We had 100-200 students in one class and we couldn't even get the chance to know each other
which was bad. I preferred smaller class sizes so that I can connect with others What are your areas
of concern before going into the university ? best, AfroozMentee 2021-11-01, 14:17: hi! that's
actually pretty smart to have a wider variety in order to help decide what's best for you. Were your
class sizes 100-200 in BCIT or UBC? also since I am hoping to go to BCIT, how did you find the
approximate class sizes there? how many days a week/hours a week is typical schooling? also what was
your experience like when applying to schools?? and how long did it take you to finish the
application process? and any advice on what information to include when applying to BCIT?Mentor
2021-11-01, 14:25: Hi Calli, The class size was smaller in BCIT comparing to UBC. However, I believe
it depends on the program. I was enrolled in a par time architecture program which was only 9 months
and I received a certificate at the end. The class size was ~30 from what I remember. The fact that
it was a part time program might also answer your other questions as it it didn't have a hard
application like a full time program might have. I was able to just apply for the coursees within
the certificate that I wanted. The staff were very helpful to walk me through everything as I was
new to Canada back at that time and was living alone. They helped me to apply for loan and
everything. That program was 3 days per week. I really enjoyed it as it was very much a hand on
experience. Is BCIT your only choice or you're planning to apply for more institutions? I belive it
would begood to have more options to choose from just in case that something happens with your first
choice. When I applied for UBC , I also applied for the Capilano university and SFU just to have
more options as back ups :)Mentee 2021-11-03, 00:07: Hi! Okay that makes sense. Yeah I am currently
applying to BCIT, but it is not the only place I am applying to. The program I am wanting to get
into reccomends post secondary education for better chances of getting in, since it's a competitive
program, but it is not an entry requirement. So, I am applying at a local college for associates of
Science Degree, and other health science courses. I am also going to apply to SAIT, and most likely
UBCO for general sciences as well, since it is the closest university to where I live. I am choosing
schooling close to home because if I don't get accepted into BCIT straight out of highschool, I
would like to stay at home for 1-3 years for my post secondary education. I want to stay home
because I still want to spend time with my family, it would be nice to be able to keep my part time
job at starbucks, and a few of my close friends are staying home for awhile too. On top of that it's
also a good option financially. At UBCO I wouldn't be able to live at home but it is still relativly
close compared to other places, and a lot of my friends go there/plan to go there.Mentor 2021-11-21,
11:47: Hi Calli, It's great to consider all the aspects when choosing among different universities.
As you said budget is one of the most important things to me too. I still live with my parents as
well. I found that they can be a good support both financially and emotionally during university. It
was also important to me to have the university close to home to save some time, however, I wasn't
lucky with that! I didn't have my own car and I had to commute with bus. That meant 3 hours of
commute every day to and from UBC! It was definitely so tiring specially in exam times, but I had no
other choice! let me know what else you would like to talk about for the next time:)Mentee
2021-11-26, 12:14: holy 3 hours!! anyways, I think it would be great for me to get some advice on
studying and time management! How do you manage your time to effeciently study and get schoolwork
done? Or do you have any certain studying remedies?Mentor 2021-11-26, 12:34: Hey Calli, Well, if I
wanna creat any pill after I graduate and become a pharmacist, that would be a study pill :))))
Planning, actually a realistic planning which is doable is the key for my. However, you might ask
what if I plan for my day and cannot finish all the tasks I assign for myself (which happens a lot
for me and others for sure). For me it was and still is very hard to stay focused while studying.
For example, I check my phone regularly, if I'm working on my laptop I open different tabs and
websites to check, etc. I realized the only way to decrease this (not possible to make it zero! at
least for me) is to realistically minimize the distractions. Forexample when I am studying with my
laptop, I cannot put my laptop away but I can leave my phone in a different room. Also, what I am
trying to do recently is to assign specific times during the day for my distractions ! and I
literally called it distraction time! So,whenever during studying, I am prompted to even think about
family problems, worrying about some stuff, or checking on something, I try to remind myself that I
have 2pm-3pm to spend for my distractions. This way you are realisticllay dealing with it because
everyone has lots of distravtions and lots of things to think about or worry about, but this way you
are even managing your time for those stuff. This way you can better check of the tasks that I
assigned for yourself to complete wether it's finishing a chapter, doing an assignment, or taking a
shower, etc. ! ;)Mentee 2021-11-26, 12:44: Oh that is smart to minimize your distractions by putting
your phone away during studt time! I do that as well cause I always end up on my phone instead of
studying if it's near me. During your study times, do you have any specific study techniques that
you use? Do you prefer active recall remedies or rewriting/speaking notes out loud? I personally
rewrite notes a lot to get it into my brain better, but I think active recall is something I should
look more into. Do you use flash cards, or flash card apps?Mentor 2021-11-26, 13:14: What I use very
frequently is the Quizlet app! I am actually using it right now :) You can make flash cards with it
and it had lots of time saving features, plus the fact that it is free! What I think about this app
is the fact that you can search a title and find other flash card to study from (if they didn't set
it as a private file), this feature saved lots of time for me as I didn't have to make all the flash
cards from the scratch :) I also do the note taking even if I do not go back and read them! I
realized that make me stay more focused and I learn in the process of note taking :)Mentee
2021-11-26, 16:32: I havent tried the quizlet app out yet but I think I should!! I didn't know you
could use premade flash cards. That could help me study a lot!! Thank you I'll definitely try that
out :)Mentor 2021-11-26, 16:34: Yes! Try it out and let me know if you had any questions;)Mentee

and we can talk about some obstacles that we may face in post-secondary! For me, exam anxiety always
got the best of me. I would know the content really well, but then I would blank out when writing

2021-11-27, 18:48: Hi Caitlin, really happy to hear from you:) I hope you are doing great and happy
the school semester is almost over and Christmas is near! For me, no one really taught me good stud
techniques either, and that was something I really struggled with throughout school until my later
years of high school. It took me some time to find studying techniques that fit my learning style
because I am a big visual and ""doer"" learner. You are totally right about how studying is when you
focus on a topic and do your best to learn the material within each topic, and your technique is a
solid one! I do the same where I need to highlight the areas on some things I need to work and
working with your friend is awesome because you are always keeping each other on your toes! Did any
of the strategies in these videos interest you? Or do you think they could help you for future
studies? You should also watch the second video in this conversation, I think it would be really
helpful for you because your own unique studying techniques for each different subject may differ
and you may have to adapt to some different techniques of studying. Let me know which strategies
would be the most useful for you and we will go from there!:) I hope to hear from you soon Caitlin,
and hope you are staying safe during this crazy weather! Talk soon:)",,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-24, 21:33: Hi Caitlin! My name is Mahyar and I am from North Vancouver and I am
studying at Capilano University right now. It is really great to connect with you, how have been the
first couple weeks back at school? I am swamped with homework this weekend, that's for sure haha.
Hope to hear from you soon:)Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:24: Hi, sorry i didn't get back to you sooner. I
have also been very busy with homework.Mentor 2021-10-27, 13:42: Hi Caitlin! no worries at all,
school must be a stressful time right now, especially being back in person again. How has your
school year been so far? For me, it has been a slow grind, to say the least haha, but exams are out
of the way and finally done until December. I bet you have been working through homework like crazy,
I hope you are getting some relaxation time during this hectic school year haha. Anyways, it was
great to hear from you Caitlin and I hope we can connect soon again and continue our conversation!
Message me anytime you are available or when you have free time!:)Mentee 2021-10-27, 15:38: Hi,
great to hear from you. yes things have been crazy busy with school and work. I was hoping we could
start with the conversation topics, specifically studying.Mentor 2021-10-29, 18:04: Hi Caitlin! I am
going to open the studying conversation topic, but it will open up another conversation thread since
it is a different subject we will be talking about. I will send you a message on that thread as soon
as I open it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

options. Give it a read and let me know if you have any questions, or want to start with anything in
particular",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-26, 01:45: Hi Brooklyn! I am Svetlana, and I will be your mentor! I am from a small
town in the Kootenays, but currently I am bouncing around BC for my electives for medical school. I
love to be outdoors with my family, friends, and dog (skiing, biking, swimming, hiking, etc). I have
recently started a new hobby (jewelry making), and I have kept up with an old hobby (singing). I
would love to take up guitar again, as that was something that I used to really enjoy. To select a
couple talking points from above, I found one of my favourtie quotes to share with you! I like it
because it reminds me to do the things that I find enjoyable, and to live life to the fullest. “Life
should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well
preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally
worn out, and loudly proclaiming ""Wow! What a Ride!” ― Hunter S. Thompson, I also thought about
sharing a song, but it is so hard to choose just one! My music tastes tend to focus around
indie/alternative/rock, with the occasional folk song. I am happy to share some songs if you are
interested, but I am curious as to what genre of music you generally listen to? Would love to get to
know you! I am open to discussing a wide variety of topics - really anything that you are interested
in or have questions about. My particular interests lie in rural medicine, but I am willing and able
to chat about anything!Mentee 2021-10-25, 13:27: Hello svetlana! it's very nice to meet you. I am
very interested to here more about what you do for school,I'm still trying to figure out what I want
to do after high school. I love being outside too, maybe not so much the hiking haha. I'm really
into country music and sometimes pop, depends on the singer. I think I wanna try listening to rock,
it's not my jam but hey it's worth a try.Mentor 2021-10-25, 13:36: Nice to hear from you Brooklyn! I
am happy to talk to you more about medical school if you are interested, but we can certainly
explore other post secondary options based on your interests. Are there any topics you would like to
focus on, or initial questions you have? At the top of the page, you should see an image with a few
solo activities for you to work through, but also a number of discussion topics for us to look into
together. Let me know if you cant see the image on your screen; I can just list out the topics if
you don't have anything in particular you want to ask right off the bat.Mentor 2021-10-25, 13:44:
There is a list of the conversation topics at the bottom of the page, feel free to check off the
ones that interest you!Mentee 2021-10-26, 12:07: I would love to hear more about what type of
medical studies that you have to travel around BC for. Although, I am interested in med school I am
leaning more toward the hairdressing programs as I have been wanting to do it for a while. But maybe
learning more about nursing or med school will convince me to switch, I would love to help people in
that way and I just don't think I have the right education for it but I sure am ready to start
talking about it !Mentor 2021-10-27, 22:38: Okay, great! I have been travelling around BC for my
fourth year electives. I went to Nanaimo for pediatric training, White Rock for emergency training,
Grand Forks for family practice training, Vernon for psychiatry training, Mackenzie for more family
practice, and then I will be in Nelson for more emergency and Kimberley for more family practice.
Not everyone does this much travelling in fourth year - you can do a lot of electives in
Kelowna/Vancouver/Victoria. I am interested in rural family practice though, so i wanted to
experience many styles of clinic and practice. Nursing is a great career as well. I did not do the
program myself, but I have friends who did it and found it very rewarding. However, some people
struggle with the shift work that is required in most nursing positions. What is drawing your
interest to hairdressing? I think that is a really neat choice - there is a lot of flexibility in
the career, and most people I meet who are interested in it are very creative/artistic Do you have
any specific questions about the medical professions?Mentee 2021-11-02, 12:21: Wow that's a lot of
travelling! I don't know if I could manage or keep up haha.I've always been interested in
hairdressing since I was little, and I really like to idea of cutting peoples hair and giving people
a new style that they can enjoy. The thing is everyone I talk to keeps telling me that the pay isn't
worth doing and that's why im now questioning myself, but I guess if I'm super passionate about it I
should go for it.Mentor 2021-11-04, 12:45: The travel and amount of work can be intense, but I love
medicine so it's worth it! That's very insightful of you to be considering your future career
options like that. Have you looked into post secondary schools for hair dresser training?Mentee
2021-11-04, 15:04: I was planning to go to Selkirk College in Nelson, but was looking at college of
the Rockies but they don't offer the level one so I'm thinking Selkirk is my best bet. I was open to
go to Blanche McDonald in Vancouver but it's really expensive and lovin there on top would be even
more money.Mentor 2021-11-08, 01:09: Those sound like some great options! Have you started
applying?Mentee 2021-11-09, 12:44: I haven't yet. but I am applying to Selkirk on the 17th, their
hosting a zoom or something and it's free admission and then I will have to apply for housing as
well because the drive from my house is a waste of gas.Mentor 2021-11-12, 14:07: That's great!
Sounds like you have a good plan moving forward. Let me know any questions you have along the way!
Also feel free to ask about any of the conversation topics on this platform and we can open the
conversation up.Mentee 2021-12-06, 13:11: Hey! I totally forgot you responded but I'd love to know
if you had any recipes that are easy and fun to make. I have to do this project for my class and I'm
making a cook book and I need some ideas of what to make. Love to know if you have any in
mind.Mentor 2021-12-09, 09:42: Hey Brooklyn, I can't say I have any off the top of my head! I do
most of my cooking without recipes, just sort of toss things together depending on what I feel like
eating. Sounds like a fun assignment though!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

student at the University of Victoria, and will be your mentor for this program. I'm here to answer
any questions you have and offer advice. Ultimately my goal is to help you achieve yours, so if
there is ever anything I can do for you let me know. I will try to respond to messages as quickly as
possible and always within three days. I can see from your profile we certainly have some things in
common like enjoying fishing, hiking, and baking. Also it's pretty cool to be matched with you since
your intrested in nursing and I'm about to graduate from nursing. I will certainly be able to give
you some valuable information about nursing school. I can see you already have some topics you want
to discuss like what are the right classes to take and about budgeting and saving. We can certainly
discuss these at some point. Is there anything I should know about you besides what's on your
profile or anything you want to tell me? Additionally, please see the list of conversation choices
below and check off the ones your interested in (check off the ones required by your teacher). I
look forward to working with you Avery and as soon as you introduce yourself we will move to the
next section.Mentee 2021-11-08, 19:03: Hey Evan, Sorry it took a while for me to respond. I want to
discuss a few things about applying for school and about choosing what to do because i don't really
know what to go into anymore. I also want to know how you like UVic because I really want to apply
there. I think it would be great to have some advice as i have no idea what i'm doing! Thank you!
AveryMentor 2021-11-10, 23:53: Hey Avery, Let's start with the ""post-secondary considerations""
module and maybe that will give you some ideas or offer some guidance. Do you have a few things
you're interested in/looking into, or do you truly have no idea? If you have some ideas, it would be
good to connect with people working in that area and to do some research. If you have no idea, I
recommend reflecting on some questions like what do you enjoy doing? What are your skills? What are
your values? How many years of education are you willing to complete? Where is the job available?
Can the job be done anywhere in the world? Where do you want to live? How much income do you need
for the lifestyle you want? What are the job outlooks? Is it a growing or shrinking area? What do
you want your work environment to look like? What does a typical day look like? Do you want to work
alone or as part of a team? There are many questions to ask yourself. Start answering questions like
this and writing them down so when you think of a potential career, you can evaluate how well it
aligns with what you want in your future. So far I have enjoyed UVic however most of my time there
has been online so I don't have a lot to say about it. If you have any specific questions I can
certainly answer them though.Mentee 2021-11-16, 12:07: Hello! I am still unsure as to what i want to
do i think i changed my mind and i would either like to be a teacher or a police officer. those are
very different areas of study but they are my most interested things i've chosen i decided i don't
really want to go into medical anymore. Do you know how the education studies program is at UVic? i
would definitely consider going to that school.Mentor 2021-11-16, 12:36: Hello, From what I have
heard, the programs offered in education at UVic are excellent. Do you know if you want to teach
elementary/middle school, or do you want to teach high school? From my understanding, if you want to
teach elementary or middle, you do the ""Elementary Bachelor of Education,"" which is a specific
degree that prepares you to be a teacher. If you want to teach high school, you get a bachelor's
degree in whatever area you want to teach and then you do the ""post-degree professional program,""
which is a 16-month program that essentially trains you to be a teacher, so you can teach content
from the degree you got. https://www.uvic.ca/education/areas-study/teacher-ed/index.phpMentee
2021-11-16, 14:13: That sounds great! i think im going to teach high school if i choose this path! i
would need a teachable degree. Do you know what a biology degree looks like?Mentor 2021-11-16,
14:42: So a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in biology is 4 years full time and has options for co-ops.
You can choose a focus of forest biology, marine biology or neurobiology. Some areas of work you can
go into with a biology degree include: Conservation officer, Dentist, Environmental educator,
Fisheries biologist, Forest biologist, Health educator, Marine biologist, Medical doctor,
Physiotherapist, Research technician, Science writer, Veterinarian, Wildlife biologist.
Prerequisites: Approved English 11, Pre‑calculus 11, Chemistry 11, Physics 11, Approved social
studies 11/12, English Studies 12 or English First Peoples 12 (minimum 67%), Pre‑calculus 12
(minimum 67%), Two approved science 12 courses. They recommend you have an average of 82-85% in your
grade 12 classes. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you get into the program
because it's reasonably competitive. Tuition is around $6,780 for two terms, and there are
scholarships available for academically outstanding students. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
under program planning and open the files for the diffrent programs to see the schedules and the
classes you would do.
https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/programs/undergraduate-programs/pages/biology.php?residency=D&amp;level=HS&amp;school=HD&amp;curriculum=BC#ipn-biology
Also, keep in mind that you can do a minor during your degree, which I believe can be a subject you
can teach.Mentee 2021-11-17, 00:31: Awesome thank you! that's awesome information!! I am definitely
going to apply to UVic. I love the campus and it seems like a great learning environment. I also
wanted to talk to you about a potential capstone project for my Career Life Connections class. I was
thinking about doing something involving health and sports for young girls and how important
physical health is, let me know if you have any suggestions about my topic or how i could narrow it
down!Mentor 2021-11-18, 20:36: Hey Avery That's great to hear. I'm sure you would enjoy UVIC
Regarding your project can you share more of the criteria/grading so that I can give you better
suggestions?Mentor 2021-11-18, 20:41: Also, let me know when you are done with the post-secondary
consideration section so I can unlock the next conversationMentee 2021-11-18, 22:29: Let's unlock
the next section! For the project we have to do a research side and a presentation side. For the
research side I was thinking about looking into how sports are good for you and what the benefits of
activity are in youth. And for the presentation side I was thinking I would make a presentation or
video about sports at our high school and go present to elementary schools in our district so they
can create an interest in sports before they come to high school!Mentor 2021-11-20, 08:35: If you
want to narrow your focus you could focus on... The physical benefits of activity/exercise and
really get into the science/biology of it (how it affects the cardiopulmonary system). How physical
activity impacts people's mental health and the role/importance it has played in people's lives
during Covid-19. If you wanted to do a video you could interview people at your school who are in
sports and then edit in some quick action clips. Sort of making a promotional video for sports at
your school talking about the many reasons they should get involved in sports (socialization,
health, fun, post-secondary scholarships ect)Mentee 2021-11-21, 12:40: that's a great idea thank
you! I think that the project will definitely help brighten everyone's perspective on playing sports
in high school. another question I had was how you budgeted and saved for post secondary school and
what things I can do to help get myself ready for school.Mentor 2021-11-23, 04:57: Good questions. I
want to do some research and give you a well thought out answer but I'm super busy until Thursday,
so I'll try to send you something then.Mentee 2021-11-23, 12:48: Mentee 2021-11-23, 12:48: awesome

?Mentee 2021-12-01, 15:48: How did you knwo you wanted to go into marine biology?Mentor 2021-12-03,
03:33: Hi Abbey, Great to hear from you! I hope classes are going well so far. In my current program
I am studying to be a medical researcher, so marine biology and scuba diving are more of a hobby for
me. However, there is a lot of overlap in the pre-requisites for marine biology and what I study so
we can definitely talk more about that. Marine biology is usually offered as a subspecialty of a
Bachelor of Science in Biology. There are programs for it at the University of Victoria and UBC (and
other schools too!). Here are some links to check out if you are interested :) UVIC program:
https://www.uvic.ca/science/biology/undergraduate/programs/marine-sciences/index.php UBC program:
https://you.ubc.ca/ubc_programs/biology-vancouver/ UBC also offers Oceanography, which focuses more
on the chemistry and physics of the ocean: https://you.ubc.ca/ubc_programs/oceanography/ Another
cool thing to check out is the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. You can take some classes here from
UBC or UVIC, and it is a really cool place to study marine life: https://www.bamfieldmsc.com/ . No
matter which school or program you are interested in, you would start out applying for the Faculty
of Science. First-year science is a little like high school in that you take a whole bunch of
courses in all different areas like math, chem, bio, physics, English etc. Then in the upper years
you get to focus more on the area that you want to specialize in. The pre-requisites for UBC Science
are ENG 12, Pre-calc 12, Anatomy 12 OR CHEM 12 OR PHYS 12. English 11, a grade 11 language, PHYS 11,
CHEM 11, and Pre-calc 11. If you are missing any classes or are not quite sure what you want to do,
you could also take some classes at college and transfer later. I have some friends who did that. In
terms of how I decided that I wanted to be a clinical researcher, it was not something I knew right
away. In fact, I didn't know for sure until I was almost done my degree! I knew I was definitely
interested in science so I started there and then tried to follow the things I enjoyed the most as
my degree got more specialized. I'm happy to chat more about this as we go. Have you thought about
which school you would be interested in going to after high school? Do you think you would prefer to
go to university right away or take some college classes first? Talk to you soon! -KatieMentee
2021-12-14, 15:05: hey katie, for the science courses, for marine biology prerequsites i saw just
said 1 grade 12 science course.Is that the case or do you have to have all three ?Mentee 2021-12-14,
15:10: also, for the the general science for first years, are you tking all courses like math and
chem, or just a little bit more specific?Mentor 2021-12-17, 02:23: Hey Abbey, Great question! For
the minimum course requirements, it depends a little on the school. UBC requires only one of those 3
(anatomy, chem, or physics) whereas UVIC requires any 2 Grade 12 Science classes. Another thing to
think about is what courses you will need to take once you are in your program. For example, most
science programs at UBC require you to take Biology 112. But, Biology 112 has a pre-requisite of
Chemistry 12 from high school, so if you don't take CHEM 12 in high school you would have to take an
extra chemistry course to learn it in university. In first year, you will most likely take almost
all the courses. A great place to browse what courses you would take for each specialization is the
academic calendar: https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,418. At the end
of the first year, you can apply to specialize in any area you like as long as you have the required
classes. I just finished my last final exam yesterday! It feels great to have that over with. Did
you have any end-of-term tests or projects this month? Talk to you soon, KatieMentee 2022-01-14,
15:47: Thank you, Katie! That is great to know because I had no idea what courses I might need. also
good to know what the first year of college is likeMentee 2022-01-14, 15:48: another question is how
did you have self care went you are studying? what did you do when you were stressed ?Mentor
2022-01-19, 16:06: Hi Abbey, Sorry for the delayed reply, the first week back at school is always a
little busy. I hope you had a good winter break! That is a great question! There are a few things
that really help me manage stress. One is to have close friends that I can talk to when I am
stressed out. If you move away for school, it is really worth the time to keep in touch with school
friends and family and to reach out to them when you are going through tough times. There are also a
lot of good ways to make friends at college like through sports or clubs (there is a club for almost
anything) and it is nice to be able to talk to people who are going through the same thing as you.
Another thing that I do is I have some non-negotiable things that I do for myself. So even when I am
super busy I will still make time for them. One is exercise, so I would always make time for
walking/running and sometimes do like a fun class through UBC rec. Another is watching TV - it is a
simple thing but I like to watch a show in the evening to de-stress and stop thinking about school.
My last piece of advice is to be patient with yourself and to not try to do everything at once.
There are tons of opportunities at university, sports, clubs, seminars, events etc. and it is really
easy to take on too much. The first semester, and really first year of uni I just focussed on
classes and maintaining balance and I think that really helped. After that I got more into other
things like hobbies - if there is something you really love doing that is great but just don't feel
like you have to do it all right away. Hope this is helpful! What classes are you taking this term?
-KatieMentee 2022-01-20, 13:02: hey katie, this is really helpful, i have struggled alot in the past

currently in the MD/PhD program at UBC studying to be a clinical researcher. I'm looking forward to
getting to know more about you! It's so cool that you are interested in marine biology, I am a scuba
diver in my free time and I was thinking about marine biology before I settled on medicine. It
sounds like you are really creative and I look forward to hearing more about your hobbies too! To
get us started (pictures to follow): Something Beautiful: this is a photo of a leather sea star that
I took while snorkeling last summer. I love the bright color and patterning on its back and it
reminds me of a happy memory from that time. Food for thought: baking is one of my favourite
hobbies. One of the things I like to make most is sugar cookies. This is a photo of the cookies I
made for Halloween this year (I know I am a little early haha). I really enjoy coming up with ideas
to decorate them :) Talk to you soon! -KatieMentor 2021-10-04, 15:54: Mentor 2021-10-04, 15:56: P.S.

cool you are doing exactly what i want to do after school! I have always been interested in marine
biology, especially octopus and sharks.Mentor 2021-11-08, 17:40: Hey Abbey, Great to hear from you!
I really like those animals too. I saw a tiger shark on a dive once, that was a really cool
experience. How did you first get interested in marine biology? Also, your teacher has asked that we
try to complete 4 of the conversation options. They are listed at the bottom of this page and in the
word cloud up top. Let me know which ones you would be interested in :) Talk soon, KatieMentee
2021-11-09, 13:41: Hi Katie, That is soo cool! I have always wanted to see a tiger shark. Where did
you dive? I first got into marine biology when the first planet, earth, came out in like 2008. there
was an episode called the deep ocean. I loved that episode, especially the Grimpoteuthis. The
grimpoteuthis is one of my favourite animals. Also, my dad has also been really into nature, so I
always learnt stuff from him.Mentee 2021-11-09, 13:43: Hi katie, I would love to talk about the

2021-11-13, 03:08: Hi Abbey! Oh my gosh I just googled the Grimpoteuthis and I am obsessed! It is so
cute! I really like octopuses in general and am always excited to see one diving or snorkeling. I
saw the tiger shark when I was diving off Kona in Hawaii. It's great that your dad is into nature
too! Do you like to go camping or hiking? It sounds like the post-secondary considerations and
career considerations might be a good place to start the program. I will open the post-secondary
considerations conversation now. You should be able to open it at the top where the word cloud is -
let me know if it gives you any trouble. We will pick up the conversation there :) Talk to you soon!

up for you. My first midterm went well, and I got to spend this morning at the beach (it was crazy
windy and wavy) for a break. How is school going? Hopefully you're not too busy! Has the basketball
season started yet? Let me know if you have any questions, Take care, JoceyMentor 2021-11-07, 15:15:
Hey Nikki, Here is career considerations opened up for you!",,,"Mentor 2021-10-26, 13:12: Hey Nikki, So I've opened up this conversation for you. There's lots of
information to read through! For myself, I was able to work throughout highschool and was good at
saving money. This helped pay for my first couple years of college. I also worked on the weekends
during college, and on my Winter and Summer Breaks. I lived at home during my first few years to
help save money. I also applied to a lot of scholarships and busaries, and I didn't get them all,
but I got a couple, which helped a lot! I apply every school year for more, which is a lot of work,
but worth it. For this year, my school tuition got a lot higher. So, I applied for student loans
through BC Financial Aid. This seemed scary at first, but I wouldn't be able to pay for school
otherwise. Also, when I applied for a loan, they gave me a couple of grants - which is money I won't
have to pay back. I think, just being careful of where you spend money is really important, and
asking people for help with applying for bursaries and scholarships! So, I am paying my way through
school through a combination of bursaries, scholarships, working, and student loans. Let me know if
you have any questions! Congratulations! Did you decide on a baby name yet? Make sure to take care
of yourself &lt;3 JoceyMentee 2021-11-05, 15:55: Hi Jocey, That seems a little stressful. Having a
job and having to do school work i can barely balance out school and basketball sometimes. i end up
having to miss basketball to do homework. My baby's name is Julio, my friend named him he was just
an egg baby though. For the next conversations can we do career considerations?",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-20, 16:27: Hey Nikki! My name is Jocey, and I'm a first year UBC medical student.
UBC's MD program has different learning sites, and I got placed on the Island Medical Program. So,
I'm currently living and going to school in Victoria, on the UVic campus! The ocean here is insane,
and I get to bike to school everyday which is super cool. Where do you live? I played softball up to
my first year of college, and now I coach! I love watching the Bluejays, and I just signed up to
play on a (very noncompetitive) volleyball team with my other classmates. I also spend way too much
money on ski hill passes every winter. Do you play any sports? My favourite meal is anything my Mom
cooks for me. That sounds crazy, but I've been moved out of the house for a couple years, and I'm
not a big fan of cooking for myself. What's your fav meal? That's it for now... I'm stoked we got
matched! Hope you have a great week :) JoceyMentee 2021-09-21, 17:28: Hi Jocey! I live in Prince
Rupert, I have lived here most of my life. I lived in Fort St. John for a year when I was younger. I
just recently started palying softball this year although I have wanted to play since I was 10
because I grew up watching my grandma play. I now play with my dad and my aunt. I used to play
soccer and volleyball growing up but i stopped playing to focus on my basketball career, some of my
friends have been telling me I should join soccer and volleyball again but i just dont have the time
lately, even though i would love to start playing again I just dont think I can balance out my
schedule at the moment. My favourite meal is definitly my dads spaghetti, and my moms shepherds pie!
I still live with my dad and his parents, my grandparents. My mom lives with her husband in Port
Simpson which is about 45 minutes from Prince Rupert so I go visit her on weeknds to spend time with
her and my little siblings. But when I'm not visiting my mom I'm visiting my step mom and my two
little sisters, but usually I go quading with my step brothers it is pretty fun!Mentor 2021-09-21,
21:40: Hey Nikki, it's so cool that you started playing softball recently! I think it's a fun sport
no matter what level you're at. I used to play Basketball during highschool, but we weren't a
competitive team (we rarely won anything). Are you playing basketball at the moment? Is it through
your highschool or are there other teams you play on? We have a quad at my family home, and a couple
dirtbikes and I love to go for rides! That's sweet you get to go with your step brothers! I grew up
in a tiny town called Salmo, and my parents still live there, so I go back to visit when I'm not in
school (it's a 11 hour drive though). I'm going to move us to the next page of this program, but
hopefully you will still be able to see this message or respond on the next page!Mentee 2021-09-27,
16:59: Hey Jocey, I am sorry it has taken a few days to respond. Yes I am playing basketball at the
moment, the season has not started yet for high school but I have been practicing for tournaments. i
have a big tournament next year during spring break and it will be my last year playing in that
tournament, it is the Junior All Native Basketball tournament. I have a small tournament next month,
I am playing for the Gitgaat Junior Girls which is hartley Bay. That is cool! we have a few in Port
Simpson, we went quading up the mountain on the weekend. My dad took us and it was really fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047541369,1047540957,9/17/2021 19:12,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-25, 23:57: Lets talk about mis-information. I feel the phrase ""fake-news"" has
recently gained a lot of traction and allows consumers of information to discount potentially valid
information because it is not in line with their views. While I do not deny there is likely some
dis-information be reported, I would argue the vast majority has some semblance of truth, it is
rather the lense the information is reported and/or the lense it is received through that makes it
seem to be ""fake-news."" The ""every man"" consumes information through simple to consume sources like
the news, facebook, twitter, or the news paper. The intellectual consumes information too from these
sources but will look at academic sources for evidence to back up the claims made in the news. An
example would be ivermectins labeling by news agencies as a ""horse de-wormer."" While that labelling
is accurate, it is not entirely true as this medicaiton has human purposes too. The intellectual
will look at research about the drug to see if it really is just used for animals, meanwhile the
""every man"" thinks people must be crazy to be taking a drug for animals. the problem however, is
academic sources like peer reviewed journals and research is written in a language that is difficult
for the everyman to understand. Additionally, sometimes to access these sources you have to pay
money! Ultimately I feel the best strategy is to self reflect. Did the information you just consume
incite an emotional response? If yes, I would be wary and consider it is likely not a valid source
of information, since things like MEME's and the news are meant to encite you to pay attention
through emotions. Before making a conclusion based on the information you have been give, I would
try and look at some academic research to see if those claims are true. Also, if someone is saying
""that is a fact,"" ""we know this for sure,"" etc etc, in my experience that is not someone who is a
trustworthy source! The person who uses phrases like ""we think it is this, but there is some
evidence to suggest otherwise,"" ""we are not entirely sure how it works, but it seems to work this
way."" Those are usually the smartest people in the room and the ones to pay attention to! So that is
may view on dis-infomration and some methods to evaluate sources and come to evidence informed
conclusions :)","Mentor 2021-10-05, 00:00: Hey man, so I believe I am supposed to start with a ""consideration
question"" after reading/watching the anchor texts/videos. So lets jump into some self-care... What
are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of
yourself???? Well, I can tell you right now I have a whole bunch of those signs! lol, my life has
been off the rails a bit lately to be totally honest. My dad is critically ill, I just moved into a
new house I bought, I got injured at work and working through worksafe to come back, I have a
horrible teacher, and than there is the added pressure of trying to get perfect grades so I can get
into medical school. The first sign is that I know I have way to much going on. Another sign is I
will avoid watching emotional movies because I don't want to sob LOL. Another sign is I get angry
and extremely reactive. For example today I spilt my entire chemistry lab sample...GONE!!!! Two
weeks of work, gone! I wanted to scream and imagined throwing computer into the wall. Of course I
did not throw anything but feeling that emotion deep in my stomach told me I need to get on some
damn self care started! So, tonight I hosted an archery night at the school. Tomorrow I booked the
gym and will also see my counsellor to work through my dad being sick and all the other chaos of my
life. Those will be my self-care practices tomorrow. So, what are your signs? What do you do for
self-care when your life hits the rails and you want the train slow down?Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:20:
selfcare - how are you managing to work on tasks and assinments everyday and still have time for
yourself. do you have time to get pysical activities? or mabye work on a personal project. how is
the sleep schedual and meal plan, what do you manage in a day to succeed in work and studies but
also keep a good mind to body connection with self care.Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:32: my life has been a
bit crazy latly with me starting grade 12. i know have alot of presure and tasks to complete to
insure that i graduate. sometimes i noticed that i can get angry or run away from my problems so i
dont have to deal with them. ive been working on getting the work done and taking a break to
meditate so that i can gather my thoughts and continue. Also the gym plays a huge part in my slef
care life, for example if i know i may get angry or am feeling uneasy i will run over to the gym to
deal with it, i see the gym as my safeplace, no distractions what so ever. i think taking walks and
getting daily pysical activities is key to hvaing a succsesful mind set and a relaxed body. btw im
sorry to hear about your dad and i hope everything works out great with your new house.Mentor
2021-10-08, 13:57: The most important part of managing tasks/life is staying organized. This is an
area I struggle with as often my mind wants to do more than there is time for in a day. My
strategies though are 1. Use a whiteboard with my weekly tasks that I cross off when done and update
every sunday 2. Use a calendar synced between my computer and my phone with alerts...multiple alerts
lol 3. Plan each day the night before, set a goal, and set the intention of doing something for
myself. 4. Listen to my body. If I am tired of reading, move on to a more stimulating task like an
assignment...OR have a nap...I like to nap on my office floor. Its uncomfortable enough I won't
sleep for too long but comfortable enough to make a 15 minute nap count. As for sleep and meal
plan... My wife does all the cooking so I really have no set meal plan. I am a snacker though..which
is a nasty habit i wish I could break, I would be in peak physical fitness if we didn't have so many
snacks in the house! For sleeping I go to bed every weeknight at 11 and get up at 7am no matter if I
have a later class. Your body wants routine. Give it some :) The most important piece though is
listening to what your body is telling you.If you feel tired, have a nap, if you're feelign
restless, go to the gym, if you are frustrated with the school assignment, stop do something
else.Mentor 2021-10-08, 14:00: In terms of being angry I can relate. My advice there is to reflect
on where that anger comes from. Often anger is a misplaced emotion, it has come from somewhere else
but we believe it to be caused by the trigger in front of us. For example, if your parents were
going through a divorce and during that time your brother borrows your gym shoes without asking. You
get angry with him and get into a fight. While it was annoying he took your shoes, it is more likely
the anger you are feeling is related to the stress of a parental divorce. So, if you are able to
reflect on the origins of your anger you can avoid getting into a fist fight with your brother.

trying but it is always tough the first couple weeks to figure out that routine, part of why I am
sitting at home studying on a Saturday night instead of having a social event. lol I see we have
some shared interests! Paramedic is the best job in the world buddy, you would have a great time
doing that career for sure. What kind of motorcycle are you riding? Hopefully something big and loud
like a Harley lol. I have done some huge rides over the years. I did Edmonton to Tofino and back,
and than another year I rode from Edmonton down the mid-west (Montana, Utah, etc), then cut across
route 66 throught the desert to LA, than up the west coast to vancouver than back to Edmonton. Me
and my brother did the ride. We camped almost every night, sometimes just on the side of the highway
with only one change of clothes. It was wicked! Talk soon bud.Mentee 2021-09-21, 12:08: hey brock,
That road trip sounds awesome, i have a sports bike (ninja 300) but yes it is pretty loud with the
after market exaust that i instaled. camping sounds fun although ive never been im hoping on going
with my family to banff for a camping trip next summer. im exited to hear more about paramedics and
all the experiances that you have to offer. josh.Mentor 2021-09-22, 21:45: Banff is a pretty magical
place. You will have a blast on a camping adventure there. It's obligatory you do some hiking as
well, ideally something like the Bee Hive would be a great one. We can certainly discuss the life
and role of paramedics. I look forward to that. what has your instructions been in terms of this
mentorship? My understanding is there are specific conversations we are supposed to work through.
Has your teacher indicated that is the case or have they developed an alternate plan?Mentee
2021-10-04, 12:10: hey brock, my teacher noticed that the convervsations were not unlocked. so i was
wondering if you could unlock the conversation so we could get started :) down below should be a

I read your message that your teacher wants us to go through the conversations below. So I assume
this is what you meant (?) :) Let me know if I got it wrong and there's a different topic your
teacher wants us to cover first, but otherwise - let's talk about this for a bit! This is one of the
more interesting ones to me - I used to be an educator and went into tech because I realized how
much the tech industry influences things in society that I care about. Fake news,
mis/disinformation, or, from a positive angle - access to accurate information, is a really big
thing for a healthy society + community, and human empowerment, and for someone like you, who's
interested in going into tech, you'll have a huge opportunity in having an impact on this (e.g.
working on social media). Of course this topic also has aspects that aren't directly related to tech
and software, but I thought it might be an interesting angle for you to think about. Let me know
what your thoughts are! I'm curious to know what ideas + experiences you have about this. -
ShayMentee 2021-10-07, 12:17: Mentor 2021-10-11, 17:53: Hey Jamie, I think there was a glitch on
this website so that our messages for this convo aren't showing under it but in a general activity
thread instead. So yes my last message was part of the dis/misinformation conversation. I hope this
one would show under the right topic thread. Also, we just got notified that your teacher is okay
with us doing whichever conversation you like, so sounds like the ""required"" topics aren't required
anymore. So after this conversation you can pick any that you like :) About the mis/disinformation
convo - I think you hit the nail right in the head for what I meant about the connection of
technology and access to accurate + reliable information. I think you're right in pointing out how
in using platforms like tik tok can be prone to bad information if you're not careful and critical
about what you see. Have you had any specific experiences with tik tok (or others) where you
realized the content you were given was misleading (intentionally or not)? I think this has a really
close connection to technology because most of how we access information today is through
technological tools - social media, internet search, apps for whatever it is you do (read news, look
for workouts...). So for someone interested in tech, I think it's really interesting to understand
how the tech people who build these things have impact on how information goes around. It's
personally one of the areas of SW engineering that I'm most interested in. There's also aspects of
it that aren't related to tech that I think are interesting - like how to tell what's reliable or
what's true, and how to talk with people who believe things different than you based on different
sources of information. I wonder what thoughts + experiences you've had with this - found out that
something you learned somewhere was actually false, talking to someone who was convinced of
something that you knew wasn't true... Let me know what you think! :)Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:48: Hi
Shay, I am sorry for not being able to talk much. I only recently just arrived back in Prince Rupert
because I flew to Brampton Ontario to attend a family wedding. About our mis/disinformation convo, I
personally myself use tik tok for entertainment, workout, and even cooking. I do see people doing
the stuff they do through tik tok and I feel like for many other users that are also younger than me
will find this information as an influence. Much like misleading information, there are also many
influences for alcohol and even drug use. I am saying this from what I see on my tik tok. I am just
stating what I feel. I am sorry that we were not able to talk more. My teacher wanted me to tell you
that next week is our last week of Careers 12... what she was thinking is that next week will be a
wrapup of our e-mentoring. We will be connecting for the last time with mentors on Monday Nov.
1Mentor 2021-11-08, 14:39: Hey Jamie, sorry for some reason I wasn't getting notified that you
messaged me... And it's too bad that we have to wrap up so quickly. I think you have super valid
thoughts about the issue of information and influences we get from different kinds of media, and I'm
happy that we got to talk about this a little bit. As for other stuff - too bad we didn't really get
to talk about it! If you are thinking about going to university for a computer-based program, I
think I might have lots of valuable intel for you which you can benefit from. I don't know if when
your class is done you lose access to this platform, but in case it is available to you and you have
any questions or want to talk about a specific topic related to pursuing a career in tech (all
aspects of this) - feel free to message me here! Other than that - I hope you have an awesome year,
stay safe with COVID and otherwise, enjoy the final year of high school and plan your exciting next
stage. Cheers!",,,"Mentee 2021-09-20, 12:25: Hi Shay, very nice to meet you. My name is Jamie, I was just reading your
profile and it looks like we both like skiing. I hope you can help me in the upcoming days. We are
currently in class and our teacher is letting us reach out. -JamieMentor 2021-09-20, 14:41: Hi
Jamie, great to hear from you! I'm Shay (pronounced like 'shy') and I'm excited about starting this
mentorship with you. I think you can see me profile for some more details about me, but the quick
version is I'm 28, I just moved from the Kootenays to Vancouver, and I just graduated from UBC,
where I studied Electrical Engineering. Awesome that we both like skiing! What kind of skiing do you
do? I mostly go in the backcountry because I like backpacking in summer and ski touring feels like
the winter substitute for that, and I love it. I also took a quick look at your profile and saw that
you're into coding. That's good news because that's also my thing - even though my degree is in
electrical engineering, I mostly focused on software engineering and machine learning, so I think
I'd be able to share with you some of my perspectives on tech, software development, university etc.
I'm sure we have more things in common that we'll find out about later, and for now we can start
with the quick task here (the categories of things to share above). Here's a link to a picture I
took last year at Mt Assiniboine while I was running a 57k ultra-marathon there. It's one of the
most beautiful places I've been to, and it wraps up many of the things that are dear to me - the
environment, taking physical challenges and being active, and beautiful things. I also like this
picture because it reminds me of this challenge that I decided to go after (doing this long run) and
how I worked hard planning and training for it and during the actual run. What's an interesting
nugget about you? Pick something from the list above to show me something cool about you :) Last,
let me know if you have any questions about the program. Our next thing up is a quick module on how
the program works so it's okay if you're not sure about everything yet, but if there's something you
want to ask or say - I'm always happy to hear it. Hope to hear from you soon!Mentee 2021-09-21,
11:56: That picture looks so good! I am getting my N drovers lisence this year so i hope to go out
more on walks and find some scenery because believe it or not, this small town has some really nice
locations for just sight seeing. Prince Rupert is a really small town that lliterally only takes 5
mins from one place to another but if you just drive 10 minutes out of town there are many trails
and places that i could explore. It sucks because I cant take myself anywhere, and i feel like
theres so much more i could find and see. About skiing, I dont actually like skiing because I prefer
snowboarding more. my first experience for skiing was very tough but snowboarding clicked right in
for me. For coding, I am currently studying this 300 hour course on free code camp. the first course
is all about html and web developing and I recieve a certificate at the end of the course. I am not
good I am only still learning, and the whole process of recieving my certificate will be part of my
presentation at the end of this term. I am really glad that i got matched with someone with the
experiences I need, Hope to hear more from you -Jamie NMentor 2021-09-22, 01:30: Hey! Prince Rupert
sounds awesome. I've had a fair share of travel around BC but I've never come up towards the North
Coast. Was supposed to spend a year in Terrace but that fell through. I hear you about wanting to go
exploring independently - it's the best - but don't worry, life is long and you'll have lots of time
to do that. And what you're saying about snowboarding and skiing sounds valid, I think it's great
that there's something you like doing outside with a high heart rate. I wonder what riding is like
around there. I love it in the Interior with the dry snow and sunny days but I bet there are some
really cool mountains around your home too. It's really cool that you're doing the coding course. Is
it part of school or in your free time? I have lots to say about anything related and I'm happy too
about being matched with someone who can benefit from my perspective. Even though we have some
topics picked out for us to talk about, feel absolutely free to ask me specific questions about tech
stuff (or anything) if you have any. Or, just let me know if there's an aspect/ topic other than
those chosen for us that you want to talk about. We can have the set discussions going while also
talking about other things on the side for stuff that comes up for you :) For now, I think the next
step is to go through the content when you click the blue 'Working Through this Program' link at the
end of the anchor text above. Let's get this out of the way and make sure we both get how the
platform works etc. Let me know if you have any questions about the program, and once it's all
clear, let me know. I also saw that you selected the conversations you'd want to have from the list
- awesome. I noticed that the 3 convos that your teacher requires are also selected, so once all the
technical stuff is out of the way, let me know what you want to start with :) I did see that we have
until the beginning of November to complete the topics your teacher selected, so just keep that in
the back of your mind to make sure we get there. Alright enough for now - shoot me a message with
any question you have! Talk soonMentor 2021-09-28, 17:38: Hey Jamie, haven't heard from you in a few
days so just wanted to make sure you received my last message :) It's all good if you're busy and
need a bit more time to get to it. Just let me know that you're getting it. Have you had a chance to
look at the stuff under 'Working Through this Program'? Talk soon :) ShayMentee 2021-10-04, 12:09:
Hi Shay, sorry for having to reply so late. Ive been a little busy but now im back. My teacher
actually wanted us to start on with the activities down below. -JamieMentee 2021-10-07, 12:25: Hi
Shay, I would say that i am still a complete novice when it comes to tech, but theres just so much
interesting things and i want to learn it. I am guessing that this topic is about disinformation and
misinformation, so here are my thoughts. I understand what you you are saying about how the tech
industry influencing thigns in society. You must know what tik tok is? I use tik tok daily to help
me learn new workouts and influence me to work harder. i really understand how using this the wrong
way could give people different impressions. -Jamie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

into inspiration and creativity, and the ideas they shared could be applicable to many different
types of work, even those that may not superficially appear to require much creatvity. An idea that
stood out to me was when Mina Shum said ""I think to partake in creation, you start with an
intention."" I think this is an important idea behind finding motivation and inspiration for pretty
much anything that one sets out to do. For example, this could be applied to school work. When
feeling unmotivated, I could remind myself of my original intention behind partaking in school (to
learn new information, to understand new perspectives, to reach my future career goals, to meet new
and inspirational people... etc). I think this could allow someone to help internalize their
reasons/take responsibility for doing something as opposed to focusing on outward forces that are
""making"" them do something. I personally find a lot of motivation this way. I try to remind myself
that each day I am accomplishing things that are important to me and my future goals.Mentee
2021-11-01, 13:48: Yeah I totally agree, I really liked the way they got inspired off of the other
photographers photos. There are definitely times in my life where I feel unmotivated like to do my
homework or go to work, and I think that what you said is a really good idea. Reminding myself of
the bigger picture, and the reason I'm doing all this is for my future! Doing this would really help
me to find motivation, and change my mindset on school and work.",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-06, 11:50: What did you think of the video and the article? I thought they provided a
really good introduction to some self-care strategies, and the article, although heavy, does provide
a realistic look into student life for many people. As someone who is interested in continuing your
education in the comming years, I think it is important to keep these things in mind, and (like the
article says) to be proactive about mental health and burnout. I have definetly experienced my fair
share of burn out, and it is definitely something that can be hard to deal with. I would like to
know, what signs in your life have you noticed that indicate that you need to take better care of
yourself? Also, how good are you at taking care of yourself? Do you take regular breaks when
working, drink enough water, fuel yourself with enough food, and get enough sleep? Let me know if
you have any additional thoughts on this topic as well!Mentee 2021-10-11, 20:42: I totally agree!
From the video, I especially liked the idea of having multiple ""Warm and Fuzzy Files"" to go to
depending on what you're stressed about, and from the article, I enjoyed learning about mental
health/student supports because they sound super helpful and I never really knew they existed! Some
signs I've noticed that indicate that I need to take better care of myself are; when I start eating
a lot of unhealthy food in one sitting because it makes me feel a bit better, and when my room's a
mess but I'm just laying in bed on my phone because I'm too lazy to clean and be productive, or when
my face still has yesterday's makeup on ;-; I think I'm okay at taking care of myself, like I often
clean my room because I literally cannot do anything until my room is clean first, I do take breaks
when I'm working but I think I take too many phone breaks... I try to drink enough water everyday,
but I eat quite a bit of unhealthy food and usually get about 6 hours of sleep every night. One
question I have is that my teacher said treating yourself to say, a starbucks drink, isn't
self-care. I thought it was, is it really not?!Mentor 2021-10-13, 16:00: It sounds like you are
really good at paying attention to signs that you need to take better care of yourself! It is also
good to hear that you have some good ideas of what you might want to work on. I like the idea of
trying to improve your nutrition and sleep qualify as these things can pay off in the long run
(physical and mental health wise), but try not to be too hard on yourself. I like to take things
slow when starting new habits. I have noticed that my habits seem to last the longest when I make
small changes one at a time (for example, just moving up my bed time a bit at first, and then more
later once the new time feels easy to hit every night). As far as your question about treating
yourself to Starbucks, I would agree with your teacher in some situations. For example, if someone
is going too often, it might later stress them out if they feel like they have been spending too
much money or consuming too much sugar or caffeine. When thinking about what is a good self care
activity for yourself, I would try to weigh the mental benefits in both the short and long term. If
you feel like treating yourself to Starbucks once in a while really will benefit your mental health
and won't cause you to regret it in the future, then I think it could be a good self care strategy
for you when paired with other strategies (for example trying to also improve sleep quality). Also,
it may be hard to generalize certain strategies to everyone. What might work for one person might
not work for another. I hope I answered your question, but let me know if there is anything else you
would like to discuss about self care! If not, I can unlock the next conversation. Is there any one
in particular that you would like to do next?Mentee 2021-10-19, 12:14: Sorry it's been a a while
since my last response! But the strategy of taking new habits slow sounds like a good idea I think I
wanna try, because I find that when I do start new habits they end pretty quickly as big changes are
pretty hard to just start. Yes! You definitely answered my question, and I see how it can be seen as
not really a form of self-care in some ways, thank you! I think I'm good with the self-care stuff
now, and I'd like it if we could start the ""Finding Inspiration"" conversation next?Mentee
2021-10-25, 12:05: My teacher wanted me to tell you that next week is our last week of Careers 12...
what she was thinking is that next week will be a wrap-up of our e-mentoring. We will be connecting
for the last time with mentors on Monday, November 1st!Mentor 2021-10-27, 18:31: Okay thanks for
letting me know. I enjoyed talking and getting to know to you, and I hope you found the program
useful . Let me know if you have any final questions for me or want to talk about anything else! I
don't know if you missed my message from last week, but I had unlocked the ""Finding Inspiration""
conversation and left a message below it. We can continue talking below the finding inspiration
content and wrap things up if you would like.Mentee 2021-11-01, 13:54: Me too! I think it was a
really fun experience, and I got a lot of helpful advice (which I appreciate very much :D). I don't
have any questions, but I just wanted to thank you so much for this. I'm really grateful to have
gotten advice from someone who's experienced that university life and hearing your tips and tricks.
Thanks for e-mentoring me for the last 10 (ish) weeks! :)Mentor 2021-11-01, 15:40: You are very
welcome Teresa! I am glad to hear that you have benefitted from our conversations. It was great
having you as my mentee. Best of luck on your future endeavours!",,"Mentee 2021-09-21, 12:10: Hi there, Rachel! Our teacher gave us some time to respond/message our
mentors so here I am :D I'm not too good with starting conversation, but I wanted to ask you what
made you choose to mentor highschool students? (or whoever else you mentor!)Mentor 2021-09-22,
16:04: Hi Teresa! My name is Rachel, and I am a third year univeristy student studying psychology. I
was born and raised on Vancouver Island, and I have choosen to continue to live at home during my
undergraduate degree. That's a great question. I am someone who in highschool, and even throughout
my first year of university, I was very unsure of myself and if I would be able to accomplish what I
wanted to do with my life. During my first year of university, I met someone who was able to give me
a lot of great advice (since they were a few years older), and they showed me how to believe in
myself. Since then, I have felt more motivated than ever to go after what I want from university/my
future career, and I now understand the impact that a good mentor can have on someone's life. I
would say this is probably the main reason I was drawn to signing up for this program, but I also
signed up because I have grown to really enjoy higher education, and I feel like I could potentially
offer some good advice about post-secondary school life. I saw on your profile that you are possibly
interested in a career in dentistry! That's really exciting to hear since I am currently trying to
complete the pre-requisites that are required to apply for dental school. If you have any questions
about univeristy/dental schools, I am happy to give you my take on it! Anyways, I would love to hear
more about you! What grade are you in? How is your school year going so far? Also, feel free to
share anything else that you would like me to know about you Take care, and talk to you soon!Mentee
2021-09-27, 13:36: Wow! That actually sounds super inspiring, and I really hope I can feel the same
way after this experience :D We actually had a school counsellor (who is also a psychology teacher)
come in and speak to us about mental health and anxiety. It was quite interesting, and I'd be
interested in learning more about it so I'm adding it to my list of possible careers! Dentistry is
still an interest of mine, but there's just so many options and I don't want to end up stuck with a
career I don't enjoy :( I'm in grade 12, and school hasn't been too bad. However, I definitely think
that my work ethic has gotten worse, mainly because of covid and online school. So that makes things
a bit tougher, but I'm trying my best! How is taking universities courses online and from home
though? I know my online classes in the second half of grade 10 were not fun at all &gt;:(Mentor
2021-09-28, 23:33: I am glad you were able to hear a bit about mental health :D I think you are wise
for not being set on one specific career path at the moment. Grade 12 is a great time in life to try
to hear about a variety of fields/careers. If you plan on going to university/college, I think your
first year is the perfect time to try a variety of classes that interest you to see if you could
imagine yourself in a field long term. In my first year, I took classes such as nutrition,
psychology, and english. I really enjoyed most of my classes, and I got a better idea of what I
would be good at in the future. I liked that the major I chose (psychology) allowed for a lot of
electives, so I was not restricted to taking only required classes. If you want to do more to try to
narrow down your interests, I would also recommend trying to set up a meeting to talk with or shadow
someone in a job that you are intersted in. For example, I have shadowed two dentists for a few
hours, and it was really cool to see what a typical day looks like for them. It really helped me
further confirm that I should continue pursuing a career in dentistry. I definitely think it is
understandable that you were less motivated with classes being online! I have heard that many
university students had a similar experience. For me, it was a bit of a struggle taking classes
online, but once I got used to it, it was okay. There were pros and cons. For example, I saved a lot
of time not travelling to and from school, and I didn't have to attend labs in person, but I also
did become less happy without much real-life social interaction. It has been so fun getting to know
you so far! Although we can of course keep chatting about any of these topics, if you are ready, we
can start working through the modules! Are there any in particular that your teacher has
assigned?Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:20: Ooh, shadowing someone sounds like a great idea :O Did you just
straight up ask to observe them work for a few hours? I've watched ""Day in the Life of a Dental
Hygenist"", videos but I think it'd be cooler to watch them in person XD That was how it was for me
too! During online school I missed actually going to school and seeing people, but now honestly I
KINDA wish we had online school again because we didn't have to call for all of our classes and I
mostly got to play games and stay up late :( I've really enjoyed getting to know you as well :D
(how'd you get the smiley face!) Oh yeah, our teacher has assigned: finding inspiration, well being
and self care, and dis- and misinformation, but she also said that we could choose our own, so I'd
like to talk about studying too if that's okay!Mentor 2021-10-06, 11:23: Yes that's basically how I
asked to shadow! If you know the dentist, you can send a professional email to them asking to
observe them at work, or if you don't know them, then I would probably recommend calling their
office or dropping by in person to introduce yourself and ask them (and bring your resume with you).
When applying to dental school (to become a dentist) they often recommend or require a certain
number of shadowing hours, so most dentists should not be surprised by you asking, and they may have
even had a student observe them before! Another great thing that you can get from shadowing is that
you can try to build a strong professional relationship with the dentist you are shadowing
(especially if they allow you to come back to shadow multiple times). This will come in handy when
it's time to apply to dental schools and you need reference letters, or if you would just like
someone to give you advice about your application or dental school in general. Okay, thanks for
letting me know. Good choice of the studying topic! Normally I would ask you which conversation you
would like me to unlock first, but in the interest of time, I will unlock one now that we can get
started on. Let me know which one you would like to do next though! Also, feel free to continue to
ask me any other questions you come up with while we work through the topics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Careers 12... what she was thinking is that next week will be a wrap-up of our e-mentoring. We will
be connecting for the last time with mentors on Monday Nov. 1 Hello:) Some questions about paying
for school is, what was the most challenging budgeting issue for you and how did you keep track of
payments? :)Mentor 2021-10-25, 14:30: Thanks for the heads up! Time sure flies by quickly. Those are
some great questions. I find what helps for most students is to create an excel sheet that plans out
their expenses for the month. Things included on the sheet would be (rent, tuition, course
materials, groceries, fast food, hydro/electricity, laundry, cell phone bill, car insurance, gas
money, parking money, clothing/supplies, gifts, entertainment/recreation, etc.). Of course, it will
differ from student to student depending on their living situation. The most challenging budget
issue I find is the cost of course materials for the semester. You wouldn't believe it but textbooks
for the four courses I am taking this semester (Sept.-Dec.) were estimated to be $600. Thankfully, I
did not pay that much because I managed to find two of the e-textbooks for free online. Then I
bought a used copy of a book from a friend. And for my last textbook, they have a copy of the text
in the math lab so I go in and take pictures of the assigned statistics questions. I actually only
ended up spending about $80. Anything as a student that you can do to save money is super helpful.
Ways to save money include applying for scholarships, living at home (w/parents permission) or
w/roomates, commuting by transit, limiting how much you eat out etc. Hopefully, some of those tips
help! Have you thought much about where you would want to go for school/what type of program you
would be interested in? I feel like once you have an idea as to where/what you want to study that
helps with finding scholarships.Mentee 2021-10-26, 12:46: It does fly by, this term is almost over
and i'm so sad :( $600?! that sounds unreal, no thank you oh my gosh. My teacher came by while I was
typing this and she said she paid $200 for a textbook and tried to sell it back and they only
offered her $20. We're doing budgeting activites right now and I knew stuff was expensive like
bills, utilities, etc. But finally adding it all up I could never have imagined this. For this
acitivity my monthly income is $3,120 and my bills and stuff came up to $1946.48. That left me
$1173.02 leftover and I just know it'll be way less than that &lt;/3 I've been looking at Douglas
College in New Westminster and that was a possibility. I'm not sure what programs yet but I have
been looking and some of the courses are interesting like criminology. I think first though I want
to stay in my hometown and go to the community college for upgrades :)Mentor 2021-10-28, 11:04:
Right! Yeah, it's crazy how some things can lose their value so quickly. In my experience, one of
the best things you can do is to plan ahead and try not to spend more than you have, of course,
there will be unexpected expenses that will arise but just be wise. I can say that Douglas College
is an awesome choice for post-secondary but then again since I go there I may be biased, haha.
Douglas College has small classroom sizes which is really nice when transitioning from high school
to post-secondary. I find the professors are all for the most part approachable, knowledgable, and
kind. It is a commuter college meaning there are no dorms on campus. Since it is a college, tuition
per course per semester is considerably less than going to a larger institution. Keeping your
options open though is wise! There are a lot of great Colleges and Universities out there. I know
that it can be a bit daunting with choosing a program but chatting with an academic advisor at your
school of interest would be super helpful. Criminology sounds really interesting! I have a few
friends who have done that route and one has gone on to be a probation officer, another into the
research field, and one works for the Canadian border services agency. There are many different
routes within Criminology to explore and to fit to your interests and skills. :)Mentee 2021-11-01,
12:40: Happy belated? Halloween!:) In exactly 1 week I will be presenting my capstone and i'm pretty
terrified but I think i'll be okay! Haha, how ironic!! For one of our projects we had to explore
different colleges and I came across Douglas College and I'm kinda liking it! We also had to search
for living spaces and I found an apartment that was only $895 a month and only 5 minutes away from
Douglas College! We had to search on craigslist so it was kinda sketchy! I am getting a little
worried about what I want to do after highschool but I am trying to keep my options open! One
question I have is, did you know what you wanted to be in your grade 12 year? (: On a sad note, this
is going to be our last few sessions before the end of the course:(Mentor 2021-11-02, 00:19: Yes!
Hope you had a fun Halloween however you chose to celebrate! My friends and I did an outdoor pumpkin
carving competition so that was cool and I realized just how bad my pumpkin carving skills are,
haha. Wow, yes, that's exciting and nerve-racking! I am confident that you will do well. What kind
of things will you be including in your capstone project? Oh yeah, $850/month is really good for New
Westminster. For sure, the pressure is real. When I was in grade 12 I was honestly unsure of what I
wanted to study. I knew that I wanted to help people in some capacity but didn't really know myself
too well and who I was as a person and the skills I had beyond my academics and volunteering which
consumed much of my life. I had thought that since I come from a family of teachers I was destined
to be a teacher so I set out initially on that route. After some time and after going to a
mentorship program I came to realize more about my personality and the competencies I have and felt
a strong calling toward a career in counseling. After walking with a friend through some really dark
times I just had this strong sense that counseling is the field I am meant to be in and so I am
finishing up my Bachelor's in Psychology and want to pursue a Masters in Counseling Psychology with
the hopes of becoming a certified clinical counselor. So be encouraged to know that you don't have
to have it figured out right away. Take some time if you can to reflect on your skills and
abilities. Ask those who are important in your life what qualities they see in you and explore how
those may fit into a future career. Lastly, awe, that is sad.:( Dang, the time has gone too quickly!",,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:12: I just finished reading and watching the well being &amp; self care
section. Some questions I have are, how might the transition to post-secondary schooling make self
care more difficult? and how easy is it for you to think about self care as something important?
:)Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:12: Mentor 2021-10-08, 12:57: Hey Julianna! :) Those are some great
questions! To answer your first question, what I think can make the transition from high school to
post-secondary more difficult is if one does not already have self-care activities prioritized in
their life. The reality of it is that there is a lot of things to navigate when making the
transition from high school to post-secondary this includes one's course load, extracurricular
activities, interpersonal relationships, job, family responsibilities, etc. It is most definitely
manageable and doable but can be quite overwhelming if one does not include prioritizing time for
themself. Whether that looks like going for a run, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy meal,
reading a book, going for coffee with a friend, etc. I think it can be easy to get caught up in
school and the responsibilities that come with adulting. It can be easy to lose sight of what Hank
Green mentions in the video should be a top priority, the responsibility of taking care of oneself.
To answer your second question, when I think about how much better I feel when I prioritize
self-care in my life it makes it easier to see self-care as something necessary. If I take care of
my wellbeing first I can then give much more of myself to my school, work, and to my relationships
without getting burned out. As you have reflected upon this, my questions for you would be: What
does self-care mean to you? What are some ways that you practice self-care?Mentee 2021-10-12, 12:30:
Those answers were very helpful thank you!! :) For your first question, self care to me means,
basically just taking care of ones self. It is very important to me. For my self care, I should be
doing more but i always get enough sleep, (as much as I can) and eat all the meals that are needed.
Self care is not only for your present self but also for your future self. It's good to take care of
yourself once in awhile. For your second question, my way of practicing self care is getting enough
sleep and eating my proper meals. As I said before I should be doing more but as of right now that
is all :)Mentor 2021-10-14, 00:03: It sounds like you have a good idea as to what self-care is and
that it is important to you. I like how you said that self-care isn't only for your present self but
also for your future self, that is so true. Over time if we are consistent with our self-care we
will notice changes in ourselves. Sleep and eating are great examples of self-care. Is there anyone
in your life who models good self-care/wellbeing practices? How might you encourage your peers to
take care of their well-being?Mentee 2021-10-19, 12:11: There are not very many people who practice
self care, my friends and I are not very well at practising self care. We usually bottle up emotions
and get stressed out over homework. I do try my best to take time off for myself but sometimes it is
very difficult. For your second question, I think ways i would help people with self care is just
check up on them and ask them questions like, ""have you had any water today?"" ""did you get enough
sleep lastnight?""..etc. :) For our next section, may we do paying for school? c:Mentor 2021-10-19,
15:24: Hey Julianna, :) I can imagine it is difficult amidst all the responsibilities life brings.
Good on you for trying your best, sometimes that's just all we can do. Those sound like some
fantastic questions to ask your peers to keep each other accountable. It might even seem like such a
simple thing like water and sleep but it is amazing the impact it can have. And yes, for sure! I
will open up the ""paying for school"" module next.",,"Mentor 2021-09-17, 17:16: Hey Julianna! How’s it going? I’m Naomi and I will be your mentor this
year. To tell you a bit about myself I am 22 years old and I am currently studying Psychology in the
hopes of becoming a Counsellor. I am attaching a photo of something that I think is beautiful!
Pictured is a place that is near to my heart that I got to volunteer at last fall and that I am
hoping to visit again soon. Fall is one of my favorite seasons, the changing of the leaves, the
crispness in the air, and everything pumpkin and apple just makes me feel so gezellig (which is a
dutch word for cozy)! What's your favorite season or your favorite place that you like to visit? I
am looking forward to hearing from you and getting to know you! This should be a fun year ahead. If
you have any questions, feel free to send them to me and I will try to answer them.Mentee
2021-09-21, 12:03: hello!! i'm doing great, how about you? Ooooo! I have a pumpkin apple hand
sanitizer in my bag, it smells so good! My favourite season is winter because of the snow and
Christmas time ! I've always wanted to go to New york during Christmas because of all the movies
like Home Alone:) You know Dutch? That's cool!! Is it hard to learn? I'm looking forward to get to
know you as well!Mentor 2021-09-22, 15:09: Hello, Julianna! I'm glad to hear that you are doing
great! I am doing pretty good as well, thanks. I know for me getting back into the new school year
can be a little stressful but I think once September is over and I am adjusted to the new routine it
will be better. Oh, that's awesome, perfect for the fall. It's funny that you say that because a
couple of friends and I were actually in New York a few years ago over Christmas. It was truly
magical! The only thing was all the people I remember Fifth Avenue being packed with people getting
last-minute Christmas gifts. However, Christmas day was a lot more relaxed and we even got a bit of
snow as we walked through Central Park! New York is definitely one of those places I would suggest
to people to visit if the opportunity arises because there is just so much you can do and see. Now
in regard to language, I know just a little bit of dutch because I have family from Holland. I think
it's a pretty neat language but maybe I am a bit biased, haha. In a way, it is kind of similar to
German. Do you speak any other languages?Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:10: Getting used to the school year
is definately stressful, I 100% agree!! That's awesome!! I love Christmas time and New York reminds
me of Christmas because of all the old movies!! I used to know Smalgyax but since here it's a dying
language my parents didn't want me learning it anymore, but since I learnt it when i was younger, it
was pretty easy to learn!! One of my friends was learning German but it was online soo not that
easy!! I've always wanted to learn Spanish or Japanese. On another note, my teacher wants us to
start the conversation choices/activites. The one I would like to start with is well being and self
care :)Mentor 2021-10-04, 23:11: Yes! Gotta love the good ol' Christmas movies! Woah, that's neat
that you know Sm'álgyax! It's cool to think just how much language has an impact on our identity and
culture. I can imagine learning a language online would be difficult but good on her for trying.
Sounds good, I opened up the ""Well being &amp; Self-Care"" conversation so we can get started on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

topic! I’m a true believer that we see the world as we are. One thing that grabbed my attention was
when Léa said that the person holding the book brought her a feeling of loneliness, but she
mentioned that the book was a friend and with that in hand, that person was not alone anymore. I got
a different experience with that picture. It brought me peace and joy. That person was having a
great time, relaxing in a beautiful park, reading her book without worrying about the outside world.
The person was fully present living that moment. I think our past experiences can bring inspiration
to generate new ideas, but if we only use past experiences, we miss opportunities to find
inspiration in ordinary days. Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to ask me questions! I’m
looking forward to hearing from you 😊 MichelleMentor 2021-10-25, 13:33: Hi Sam, Thank you for
messaging me about your teacher's update. Should we try to complete this one so we can start the
next topic on Thursday? We can complete 3 topics probably by November 01st. Let me know what you
think? Thanks MichelleMentee 2021-11-01, 12:35: The idea Im going to use is the one from Mina Shum.
I think what she is saying is that every creation, or every thing ever made was written down in
paper first, then turned into an idea. I comletely agree, I think that to start anything, an essay,
a project, you need to start with a brainstorm. My question would be to what extent would you have
to brain storm? Personally, i do brainstorm, but i know some people do entire ind maps, and numerous
pages of notes, whereas i jut like to jot down a couple ideas and go off that. I think that
personally, i could write down my ideas moreMentee 2021-11-01, 12:41: I really enjoyed this program,
I thought it was a great idea to have us highschoolers connect with people that will be going
through what we will be in a couple months. I was still wondering about how all the stress is
managed through out your week. It seems like a very stressful thing to have to work, do school, pay
bills, do adult stuff, and still study a crap ton more than in high school. Thank you very much for
taking the time to mentor me, your help was greatly appreciated. Sam CharltonMentor 2021-11-04,
11:49: Hey Sam, I really enjoyed getting to know you better. You're extremely smart, and it was a
pleasure to work with you. It is a shame that we did not have much time. It can be stressful to deal
with so many things, but it is all worth it. You get the chance to meet very nice people along the
way who will inspire way to find your own path. Thank you for taking the time to participate here!!!
Michelle",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-07, 11:35: Hiii Sam, Sorry the delay in getting back to you here. I had a couple of
Midterms yesterday (wish me luck). Let's start with Dis- and Misinformation! :) I think this is such
an important topic with social media being used so frequently. Did you get a chance to watch the
video? For some reason, the video was not working for me (an internal server error occurred). Let me
know if you had the same issue. I use social media daily to talk with my friends and family, but I’m
more careful about the content I consume. I usually try to find different sources about a specific
topic before jumping to conclusions. For example, if a friend shares false information without even
knowing, I’ll alert them and advise the correct information. Would you do the same? I believe it is
super to develop critical thinking skills especially for a student because you can express your
ideas more confidently and make better decisions. Do you have some examples of ways that you’ve used
critical thinking? Now, I’m curious, Can you tell me about a time that you believed in fake news?
How did you figure out the information was false? Have a nice day!!! MichelleMentee 2021-10-07,
12:28: Hi Michelle, No worries about the delay! Good luck with your midterms, I know alot of people
taking their university midterms as well, seems like a stressful. I did manage to see the video, I
dont know what the problem was, but it was not happening on my side. I also use social media daily,
but I watch what im reading. I usually, if the article seems unrealistic, check the sources just to
make sure it its legit. My favorite news site is probably yahoo, I find them pretty reliable. I
enjoy watching alot of far right and far left political opinions, all the contrasting opinions are
amusing. My favorite person to watch is Ben Shapiro. I dont agree with alot of what he has to say,
but he is really good at speaking, debating, and presenting his point.Mentor 2021-10-08, 14:11: Hey
Sam, Yes, midterms can be very stressful, but I prepared myself well, hoping for the best. I’m glad
you could watch the video, I don’t know what the problem was either, but that’s okay. I think it is
great that you check the sources and watch different opinions too, that’s a great way to develop
your critical thinking. You’re not just receiving the information but also comparing before jumping
to conclusions. Ben Shapiro is a famous guy, and for sure, we can’t say that he doesn’t know how to

pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for sharing
misleading false information? Happy Friday, MichelleMentee 2021-10-12, 12:06: I dont really have
much experience with disinformation, either with my own research or with other people. I usually
check my sources before presenting or saying things that seem unusual, and when I hear something
that I want to know more about, I look it up to confirm the facts.Mentor 2021-10-16, 21:20: Hi Sam,
Happy Saturday!! I know so many people that only use a single source to gather information, so I do
appreciate that you check your sources before sharing information around. I have a very
knowledgeable friend, but she is always uncomfortable in pointing out misinformation to others. It
is important to discuss with others when they have the wrong information. We can always approach
that with kindness and empathy. Feel free to let me know if you've any questions or comments here.
I’m happy to move to the extension activity now 😊Mentee 2021-10-19, 12:16: Hi Michelle, I value true
information as well. I would like to continue to the next conversationMentee 2021-10-25, 12:14: HI
Michelle, My teacher waned me to tell you tMentee 2021-10-25, 12:15: Sorry, I accidentally sent that

we will be wrapping up the e mentoring. Our last day connecting with you will be Nov. 1st",,,"Mentor 2021-09-17, 22:06: Hi Sam!😊 I hope you're doing well!!! My name is Michelle, and we will be
working together for the next couple of months. I can't wait to get to know you better. I'm from
Brazil, but I lived in New Zealand for almost 7 years before moving to Canada. I moved here in
January/21, and I'm a Post-Baccalaureate Human Resources Student at TRU. I believe your program only
starts on Monday, but I thought it would be nice to send a message introducing myself. Have a nice
weekend! MichelleMentee 2021-09-21, 12:01: Hey Michelle Living in New Zeland seems pretty cool, I'd
love to visit one day, it would be super chill to hike some of the mountains there and camp. I was
born in the US but ive lived in Canada since I was 4. Im also excited to get to know you more and
learn about the university life. Peace, Sam CharltonMentor 2021-09-22, 14:44: Hi Sam, Thanks for
messaging me. Yes, New Zealand is such a beautiful place I’m sure you would enjoy hiking there. I
went camping for the first time here in Canada, and it was such a great experience. You’re born in
the USA and moved here when you’re 4, how cool is that!! Hopefully, we will have enough time to
learn more things about each other. Feel free to ask me questions along the way I heard that your
teacher would like us to talk about the following topics: Finding inspiration, Well-being, and self
care, and Identifying and challenging dis- and misinformation. Which one would you like to explore
first? Talk soon MichelleMentor 2021-10-01, 12:50: Hi Sam, I hope you're doing well! Just messaging
you to say Hi! I'm sure you're super busy with school and everything else. Do you have any plans for
the weekend? It's a cold morning here in Kamloops today (at least for me). Feel free to message me
when you've time so we can get started :) Happy Friday!! MichelleMentee 2021-10-04, 12:03: I was
thinking we can tackle dis and misinformation first",,"Mentor 2021-11-04, 11:50: Hey Sam, I really enjoyed getting to know you better. You're extremely
smart, and it was a pleasure to work with you. It is a shame that we did not have much time. It can
be stressful to deal with so many things, but it is all worth it. You get the chance to meet very
nice people along the way who will inspire way to find your own path. Thank you for taking the time
to participate here!!! Michelle",,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:17: The story is about financial relations between US and China: Does not seem
too good or bad to be true, pretty standard for today Does confirm stereotypes about Chinese people
Does seem to confirm personal beliefs that the US and China are financially at war, even if the
majority of the public does not realize it There are many believeable details The body of the story
matches the title: 'Trade is the Biggest Source of Friction Between US and China' The story is as of
yesterday The story has named producers, and editors, all from Yahoo The guy in the video has a real
name, Josh Lipsky I have heard of Yahoo It is a billion dollar news network and internet browser
Yahoo has a contact for the public, which is very active with quick responses All the reporters can
found online or on social media The domain is ca.finance.yahoo.com, it is a well known and
legitimate news source The evidence that Lipsky uses in tyhe video can be confirmed, it is mostly
stock prices as evidenceMentor 2021-10-08, 14:14: Hi Sam, When we complete the first part

2021-10-16, 21:27: Hi Sam, Thanks for completing this activity. Did you save that to your portfolio?
I see that your teacher will access it here to check, so I thought I should mention that to you. Do

high school can be challenging and scary. Don't worry, that is why we are here! I will be guiding

ways. I think I am most similar to Denys Arcand and Roch Carrier. I like to use creativity to tell
my story in a genuine way. I also find that often the work I am most proud of happened beause
something didn't go the way I thought it would. Like if I'm cooking and burn something (I'm not a
very good cook so this happens often) then I have to come up with a creative solution quick
otherwise my dinner isn't going to very good! How do you find inspiration?Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:22:
i really like the Mina Shum quote because i feel like its true. i agree with her when she says ""why
put pen on paper and why do you even bother speaking at all"" to me te idea just makes sense. because
if i had no goal in life then i would not talk to people or do my work because it would all be for
nothing. i agree everyone has a plan and a desire than needs to be filled.Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:27:
i just saw your message and i do agree with you. i didnt really think of it in that way but you said
it so well. i think both ways are valid and they could both help me. but in my mind its mainly
becaue i have a goal in life and know where i want to be so i use that as my motivation.Mentor
2021-10-10, 13:41: True! Having a goal is a really great way to get motivation. It's also nice to
feel like you have a purpose. I think Mina Shum's quote is also relevant to any situation, not just
art in the sense that people normally talk about it. It's gets across how creativity can be applied
to everyday life. If you don't mind me asking, what are some of your goals?Mentee 2021-10-12, 12:10:
well obviously my main goal is to be succesfull but theres many things that lead to that. when i
graduate i want to become an electrician or an electrical engineer. ive already started me job as an
electrcain but i just need my schooling to get my ticket. id like to go to the okanagan college for
schooling. once i graduate id like to move out of prince rupert although im unsure of where id like
to live. and i want to finnish high school with good grades.Mentor 2021-10-14, 17:10: You certainly
have a better plan for life than I do! I understand wanting to leave Prince Rupert. What would be
your dream place to live (even if it's not particularly realistic)? That's awesome that you've
already started your job as an electrician. Is it an internship of some sort? I'm assuming that
you're enjoying it if you want to continue!Mentee 2021-10-19, 12:15: im not 100% sure where id like
to live. maybe somewhere on vancouver island. i feel like some places in the states are nice but
there more for visiting not living there. yes im doing an aprenticeship and its pretty chill. i
really like all the people that work there we all get along well which definetly helps. it definetly
seems fun im good at it and the best part is you can make good money do you have a job?Mentor
2021-10-20, 12:43: Nice! I agree with you about the states. They have some cool things going on at
some of their universities but I don't know how much I really want to live there. But traveling
through the States would be so fun (they have good climbing and that's all I care about). Your work
sounds like a good time. And making good money is always a bonus. I work for chemistry prof at my
university as a research assistant. I get to mess around with supercomputers and make simulations of
molecules in very high temperatures which I am loving. Can't say I'm making good money though... Is
there anything else you would like to talk about for finding inspiration or are you ready to move
on?Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:19: that job still sounds super fun though, as long as you like it thats
all thats all that matters. my teacher wanted me to tell you that next week is our last week of

grew up here and am currently going to Vancouver Island University to study chemistry. Outside of
school I like to rock climb, read books, and listen to music. You mentioned in your bio that you
like hockey. Do you play on a team? I'm excited to hear from you! JocelynMentee 2021-09-21, 12:01:
hey jocelyn nanimo is an amazing place i go there almost every summer to see my aunt, its so fun and
theres so much to do. i play on the Prince Rupert seawolves and used to play on BC select teams
before covid. rock climbing seems exiting, ive only done the fake walls, never on a real mountain.
what kind of music do you like best? JorianMentor 2021-09-23, 16:05: That's awesome! I've sadly
never been to Prince Rupert but I'm trying to convince my family to do a road trip in that direction
next summer. What would you recommend doing in Prince Rupert? That's super cool about the hockey
...and covid sucks Right now I'm recovering from an elbow injury so it's only fake walls for me too
but hopefully next season I'll be on real rock again! I really music that I can sing along to
(despite being a terrible singer) so right now my favourite artist is Alessia Cara. What type of
music do you like? Hope you have a good day!Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:10: hey sorry ive been out on a
hunting trip for the last almost 2 weeks now. prince rupert is a very boring place to be honest
theres not a lot too do. if you enjoy fishing you might like to book a charter. Im not very picky
when it comes to music so i can listen to whatever. how'd you hurt your elbow? that must suck. my
teacher wants us to start a project and id like to do the finding inspiration one but you have to
unlock it so we can get started. hope to hear from you soon!Mentor 2021-10-04, 19:00: It's good to

on social media and the pandemic... Is there a specific topic about dis/mis-information you wanted
to talk about? Or is there an example you have in mind? I have lots of stories to share but I want
to hear what your thoughts are first!Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:49: How much of a role do your emotions
play in what you choose to click on and share on social media? when i post on instagram, before im
posting i always make sure its something that wont start any drama, or hurt anyones feelings. i know
first had from a girl who would post on social media with passive-agressive comments about me and a
few other girls in my grade, or posting the finger on snapchat with the caption ""current mood""
whenever i did something she didnt like. (we're not friends anymore) i know that when we post on
social media, anyone and everyone can see it. Do you think you are a careful consumer of media
content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? i think that i am, i usually try to not
watch the news at all, and spend most of my time watching netflix or playing games anyways. but if
something looks fake, ill usually try and fact check it to the best of my ability. What are your
experiences of pointing out misinformation to others? Has anyone ever needed to challenge you for
sharing misleading false information? most of the time its talking about rumours in town, especially
about the port authorty here. everyone seems to know everything about it but none of their family
works there. theres very few kids in my school whos parents work there, but we usually have to shut
down all the rumours at school about How important do you think these critical thinking skills about
digital media are for you as a student? i think having critical thinking skills as a student is very
impostant because you meet lots of opinionated people in this worl who try to feed you lots of
different opinions, and i should be able to process those and form my own opinionMentor 2021-10-09,
20:43: How much of a role do your emotions play in what you choose to click on and share on social
media? Wow, thanks for sharing Allie, sounds like you went through some seriously toxic stuff with
that girl. I've had similar experiences too, some girls in high school would subtweet or post insta
stories that would obviously be about me. Social media is scary that way, it seems to give people a
false sense of anonymity and that they can get away with whatever they want. I'm so glad to hear
that you are aware of the impact that your posts can have on other people. Do you think you are a
careful consumer of media content? Have you ever been drawn in by misinformation? I think it's super
mature of you to be responsible for the material that you see! I have another take on misinformation
in the media - what do you think about seeing ""influencer"" posts in the media? like photoshopped
models or altered images in the news or on social media. It's not as obviously fake as a news story,
but that makes it all the more dangerous don't you think? It seems that you have such a grounded
sense of self, I'm honestly so impressed.Mentor 2021-10-17, 16:16: Hey Allie! Thanks for opening up
to me about the topic of misinformation! Is there anything else you want to discuss or would you
like to move on to the next conversation?Mentee 2021-10-19, 12:08: we can move on to the next
conversation! what about ""well being and selfcare""?","Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:23: What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? I
think that time management plays a big role of your mental health, because if you have bad time
management, youll be rushing to finish projects, be late for class, etc. How good are you at taking
care of the basics of self care: Getting adequate sleep? im actually good at keeping a steady sleep
schedule 7/10 Eating healthy food? it usually depends on what my mom makes for dinner but shes
always using recipes i suggest 6/10 Drinking water? i have like a 65oz water bottle 10/10 Regular
physical activity? im always going for walks with my dogs 10/10 Taking breaks from work? im not good
at this because all i do is take breaks 3/10 what about you? how good are you at taking care of
yourself?Mentor 2021-10-30, 19:08: What role does time management play in taking good care of
yourself? I've graduated from University and I'm still learning about time management and how to
balance self-care. I feel like I tend to take on more than I can chew and I end up cramming or
feeling stressed because I've misjudged my capabilities - and ultimately this makes me feel awful
about myself! I think time management also comes with learning to be kind to yourself and knowing
you don't have to be super busy and occupied to be fulfilled. How good are you at taking care of the
basics of self care: Getting adequate sleep - I work every day at 8AM so I get up at 6AM! Sometimes
I sleep late but I try to go to bed by 10PM. Eating healthy food - unfortunately I love to eat out.
Recently, McDonalds has been having a Monopoly event which I am obsessed with so that hasn't been
good Drinking water - yessssss every day with my Starbucks venti cup Physical activity - Yes! I have
a dog too omg Taking breaks - I've learned to indulge in relaxation and watch movies when I feel
stressed I want to know more about yoru dog!!! What breed is she/he? How old are they?Mentee
2021-11-01, 12:50: The smalll dog on the left is named Maggie, Shes a mini aussie mixed with a
sheltie, we dont know exaclty how old she is, but we think around 11/12. We got her from the
okanagan after her original owner had a stroke and she got stuck in the stables with angry horses
for a few days, so she has super bad seperation anxiety. And the black dog in the middle is Kassie.
Shes a rare bi-coloured sheltie. Her and Maggie share a dad, they came from the same breeder. Kassie
was the last puppy of her litter to be adopted because of her colouring. She turned 9 in june And
lastly, the big dog on the right is our husky Sitka, hes 6 and still very hyper and very much the
baby of the family. We got him from the SPCA when he was 1, from one of the reservations nearby. we
have to make sure hes in the house or on a leash at all times, or else he'll run away what about
your dog(s)???Mentor 2021-11-09, 21:42: Oh my gosh!!! I can't see the photo you've attached but you
have such an incredible mix of dogs! I've always wondered, what is it like to own such high energy
dogs? I've heard that aussies and huskies have A LOT of energy and need lots of exercise. Has that
been a difficulty at all? My dog is a boston terrier and pug mix, we got him in the Okanagan as
well! I'm having trouble uploading a picture I wonder what's going on but he's a brindle pup with
eyes that jut out the side of his head. He's super food oriented and the ultimate lap dog.Mentor

Allie, Im 17, and in my first semester of grade 12, where my two classes are Careers 12, and
Foundations of Math 12. I'm thinking about applying for a bachelors degree at Vancouver Island
University for Interior Design, but unsure if i need a education at college beforehand. Did you do
any upgrading before attending UBC? Also, did you live on capmpus? if you did, what were the dorms
like?Mentor 2021-09-22, 22:55: That is SUPER cool! I've never been the super artsy type but now that
I've lived on my own, I've been thinking about working with someone with Interior Design knowledge
in the future. I didn't do any upgrading but I really wish I did! If you feel ready for it,
definitely go to University but honestly there is no rush. I actually wish I had done a gap year
between high school and university to figure out what I wanted out of life and just experience life
you know? I did live on campus for a bit! The dorms were...... 3/5 LOL It was a really great way to
live independently and have a space to yourself but I felt like the dorms itself were kind of run
down. Is there anything from the prompts you'd like to share? If not we can move on to the next
section :)Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:06: I was thinking we could start with ""Dis- and Misinformation""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047514156,1047540958,9/17/2021 14:30,"Mentor 2021-10-26, 21:26: I believe this may be the last time we will be connecting. Firstly, I want
to thank you for the meaningful exchange. I do also want to aplogize that we didn't get through all
3 conversations; I underestimated how much time we had. But I hope I was able to answer some of your
burning questions and that you found this be a good experience. Anyway, now talking about
inspiration, I thought the activity that the filmmakers did in the video was quite interesting. It
really showcased how each individual, and individuals in general, find and define inspiration in
different ways. This really showed when I was watching the video and I too was making stories from
the pictures that were totally different than what the filmmakers had described. I related to the
first filmmaker who talked about how if it makes sense to you, to just trust yourself on that. I
think that relates back to what I said in one of our first conversation how your interest in the
topic will really help you be motivated and also I think inspire you to keep going and keep wanting
to learn more about the topic (i.e., psychology). What definition of inspiration stood out to you in
the video?Mentee 2021-11-01, 12:28: This mentor expirience really helped me out with what to expect
and what to look forward to in the future. Thank you for helping me along the way!Mentee 2021-11-01,
12:34: I thought that it was interesting thinking about how different people have different
perspectives when it comes to finding inspiration. That should be obvious, but even I had my on
interpretation on the subject and my view on the pictures being shown; which was different than the
interpretation the filmakers had. The first filmaker had the points that I agreed with more. I like
to go with what I feel is right. That in my case is my motivation from my interest in psychology in
general.Mentee 2021-11-01, 12:36: Again, Thank you for this experience",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-12, 15:41: This is a very important but also difficult topic because it is quite
person-specific, but I do agree with what was said in the video and the article. Especially those
points highlighting what you need to do for self-care depends on what works for you and the
situation you are struggling with. Also, I think it is important to highlight that once you’re in
university, there are resources available for you. For example, in my university, we have a wellness
centre where we have access to mental health professionals like counsellors. Being interested in
psychology, I am sure you’re aware of the stigma surrounding getting mental health care and the
counter-argument that just because a person sees a mental health professional, doesn’t mean there is
something wrong with that person. I think the questions about time management and self-care being
more difficult in post-secondary come hand-in-hand. Not to scare you but I think this is something I
would like to have known going into university is that there is so much more independent studying
and homework time that has to be done in university compared to high school because there is no
class time to work on assignments. With being occupied in getting good grades, it was easy enough
for my self-care to slip. In turn, time management is really important to make sure you get enough
sleep, you’re able to prepare healthy meals, and take an actual break or whatever self-care activity
works for you. I definitely struggled with it and am still struggling now because it’s easier said
than done. So another thing you have to keep in mind is it will be hard to manage it all at once
especially since you’re adjusting to both your university course-load and living away from home.
With that, another aspect of self-care is being patient with yourself and cutting yourself some
slack. Whether it be taking a well-deserved break, reconsidering a lighter course load, etc. It
really is a trial-and-error process because as you’re adjusting, you’re also going to learn about
your own warning signs and the type of self-care you need. Do you notice the role time management in
your current self-care “routine”? And do you have any specific apprehensions for self-care with
transitioning into post-secondary that you would like to discuss?Mentor 2021-10-16, 00:19: Also,
side note, I just re-read the note from your teacher. I think I misunderstood it before, so I think
we're still meant to be doing 3 conversations, but now you can choose whichever one you want instead
of your teacher having required ones that we need to do. So just something to keep in mind for
laterMentee 2021-10-19, 12:13: I thought that the video had some valid points when it comes to
taking care of your self. It can be hard sometimes with stress and lack of sleep or keeping up with
meal times and staying hydrated. Those have been my struggles lately and have been for awhile. It's
not at the point where it's bad though and i've been getting better at getting out of bad habits. I
do realize the stigma in professionals in the mental health area. Such as, mental health not being
taken seriously or people who don't trust people in the profession. Lately, i've been on a schedule
when it comes to the mornings so that i'm not stressing about it later. It makes things so much
easier for me and i'm not in a rush as much as i was beforeMentee 2021-10-19, 12:14: I think i'd
like to do ""Finding insperation""Mentor 2021-10-20, 02:27: Yes, it can definitely be hard even when
you might think they're smaller things like meals and sleep that you should easily be able to
schedule. It's not so easy when you're focused on trying to get good grades or busy working a job,
then you just end up doing the bare minimum for yourself but it's those smaller things that you need
to make sure you give time too as they will keep you at your best. So it's good right now that you
have a routine, that is definitely something that will help you once you move into post-secondary.
And good point about the other way around in terms of the stigma that the clients themselves may not
trust health professionals, especially if the person has had a bad experience or someone they know
did. But just like understanding your self-care needs, finding a mental health professional or
routine that works for you may take some time.Mentor 2021-10-20, 02:28: Was there anything else you
wanted to discuss in this topic? I know we're a bit crunched for time now, so let me know if you

2021-10-25, 12:16: *AndMentee 2021-10-25, 12:21: I was thinking of the ""Finding insperation""Mentor
2021-10-26, 21:19: Sounds good! I will complete the conversation and complete the survey (dont
forget to complete the survey yourself). I have also unlocked the 'finding inspiration'
conversation.",,"Mentee 2021-09-20, 12:25: Hello! I'm in grade 12 and trying to complete my careers classMentor
2021-09-20, 22:34: Hi there! I'm Jihanne, I'll be your mentor for the next few months. I just
finished my undergrad in psychology and I read in your profile that you're interested in psychology,
so it seems like a pretty good match What made you interested in psych? I personally got into the
program because I was interested in the connection between our brains and our behaviour. Also feel
free to ask me any questionsMentee 2021-09-21, 12:01: I was always interested in the psychological
subject. Mostly for the focus on mental health and the behaviour of the mind and such. I was excited
to hear about this program because it'd be great talking to someone with expirience. One thing I'm
curious about is how long did it take you to finish the whole psychology course or programs, and is
it hard to complete?Mentor 2021-09-21, 23:44: That's cool! It took me 4 years to finish my degree
(and I didn't take 1 summer off but I only took 2 courses during that summer semester). But the time
it takes to finish a degree really depends on the specific university's program and sometimes
yourself too. For example, I took 5 courses almost every semester but you can definitely take less.
I know some people who've been taking 3-4 courses per semester, so it's taking them about 5 years to
finish and it's not uncommon at all to take longer. Hopefully that makes sense. And in terms of how
hard it was, it was definitely stressful and hard at times. But I think if you have the interest,
that will help a lot because it will be somthing that will keep you going! And I read in your
profile you like reading and writing, and there's a lot of that in the coursework so that should be
helpful too. Weirdly enough, I prefered math, bio, and chem in high school so I was kinda suprised I
ended up in a program that was more on reading and writing. Just to continue getting to know each
other, are you involved any extra curricular activities right now?Mentor 2021-09-30, 00:37: Hey
there, just checking in. Hopefully I didn't spook you with the details I shared haha just kidding
but hopefully I actually didn't. Anyway, let me know if you have other questions.Mentee 2021-10-04,
12:03: Sorry! I was sick last week during our last mentoring day. I feel pretty confident in taking
it and the interest is just going to help me with motivationMentee 2021-10-04, 12:05: My teacher was
wondering if we could ask our mentors to unlock the ""Finding insperation"" , ""Well being and
selfcare"" ' and ""Dis and misinformation""Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:08: Apologies. Just the ""Dis and
misinformation"" pleaseMentee 2021-10-04, 12:12: Maybe ""Finding Insperation"" insteadMentor
2021-10-04, 14:01: Well I'm glad you're confident in your choice, and I'm excited for you because I
really enjoyed the program! But yes we can definitely start the conversations, you want to start
with ""Finding insipiration"" conversation?Mentor 2021-10-04, 14:09: Also I believe we are meant to be
reading through the ""Working through this program"" on our own. So I'll read through it today and let
me know when you've done that as well. Then once you let me know which conversation you want to
start with, I'll unlock it right away. Hopefully that makes senseMentee 2021-10-07, 11:55: I have
read through the ""Working through this program""Mentor 2021-10-07, 13:17: Sounds good Correct me if
I'm wrong, but did I understand correctly that we only need to do 1 of 3 of those conversation? If
so, which one would you like to do?Mentee 2021-10-12, 11:56: Well being and self care :)Mentor

done with this I can open up the ""Studying"" conversation. Feel free to ask any questions that you
may have about these topics. I'm happy to share my experience regarding the same in case that is
useful as well if you have any questions.Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:13: i did not really understand the
idea of this video and it made me feel confusedMentor 2021-10-07, 12:49: That's absolutely fair. To
take a step back, the context of the video is that various filmmakers are presented photos taken by
other filmmakers, and they are asked to describe the context of the pictures from their own
perspective. The idea that it tries to communicate is that the same prompt could inspire a variety
of different thoughts for each person. Additionally, as they talk through how they think about
inspiration themselves. One of the ideas that I found most powerful in the video is ""I'm trying to
evoke a feeling or I'm provoked by a feeling. The more specific the better. As long as it does
something for you, you have to trust that at some point it translates into something for other
people."". Oftentimes, we hold back our own creativity by putting limitations on it even before we
start exploring ideas, and I think this helps provide an insight into some of these filmmakers'
minds into how to approach the topic of ""inspiration"". Does that help clarify things a little?Mentee
2021-10-19, 12:15: Sorry i have not responded in awhile, we had a busy last week and after you
explaining the video i do get it. thank you for the explanation and may you please open the next

to be working with you over the next little while. Would love to learn more about you and what
you're curious to learn. I see that you're interested in going to business school and running your
own business one day. That's awesome. I went to UBC for my MBA and work with a lot of businesses.
I'd love to hear more about what makes you curious about business. I look forward to talking to you
more. Do let me know if you have any questions at all and I'll do my best to answer them. HariMentee
2021-09-21, 12:10: hi hari, how many years did you go to UBC for and what would you say was the most
stressful time during your years at school.Mentor 2021-09-21, 12:37: Hi Chase, I did my MBA at UBC
which lasted for 16 months. It was an intense program so it was all pretty hectic, but I think the
most stressful period was probably right at the beginning since I needed to get used to a new
environment, new people and a new program. Over time, it got easier as I learned more about myself,
the program and the other members of my cohort.Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:04: Hello Hari, My teacher is
wanting us to do some of the conversations down below and i was wondering if you can unlock a few on
your end such as finding inspiration, studying, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1047541305,1047540972,9/17/2021 14:29,"Mentor 2021-10-04, 14:16: Hey Mataya, Hope you enjoyed watching the short documentary on Finding
Inspiration. To reflect on the documentary, I encourage you to answer the following questions (all
of these are generally listed above as well): 1) What idea stood out to you from the documentary? 2)
How do you feel after watching the documentary and thinking about an idea from it? 3) Do you have
any questions about the idea in the documentary? 4) How does the idea from the documentary relate to
your future? Feel free to share anything that resonated with you from the documentary! For myself,
an idea or phrase that stood out to me was when one filmmaker said “if it does something for you, it
does something for someone else.” When I first entered post-secondary, I was very hesitant to try
new things or push myself outside my comfort zone. What I learned was you have to try new things to
find inspiration. The more opportunities you take part in, the more you get to learn about yourself
and learn from others. When I first started volunteering with students, I did not realise that they
would have such a huge impact on my life. But they do… students will learn from you but you also get
the opportunity to learn from them and their stories and experiences. So, going back to that quote I
mentioned, these students have had such a huge impact on my life and I have that same impact on
theirs as well. If I did not push myself outside my comfort zone and try new things, I would not
have discovered my love for working with students. I listened to a podcast in which the speaker said
the people that are most successful are the ones that try new things and build a variety of skill
sets. I believe that finding inspiration is something we do throughout our lives. We only continue
to grow and become more knowledgeable. I can guarantee you that you will learn so much after high
school, and a much of your learning will be from your experiences. So, don’t be afraid to try new
things and explore your interests when the time is right.Mentor 2021-10-11, 20:48: Hey Mataya, Hope
you get the chance to go over ""Finding Inspiration"" soon! As your teacher mentioned, you are allowed
to choose any 3 coversations of your liking. So let me know if you would like to choose a different
one instead. Talk soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-19, 14:03: Hi Mataya, I'm your mentor Gurkirat! I know my name is a little tricky but
it is pronounced gur-key-rit. I am a university student at Simon Fraser University and 20 years old.
I am finishing my degree this year to become a secondary school social studies teacher. Just a
little bit about me...I love going for walks and exploring new places. Also, I have a major sweet
tooth and will eat ice cream all year around. I am excited to get to know you better. What are some
of your interests? What classes are you taking this semester? Feel free to tell me anything you'd
like or ask any questions you may have about the program. Since you will be choosing from two
options above so I get to know you better, I thought I should do the same. For the first option, I
chose to share my grade 12 yearbook quote with you - my quote was the following...""Will you
struggle? Yes, you will struggle; no way around it. You will fall many times but who's counting?
Just remember there's no such thing as a smooth mountain; if you want to make it to the top, there
are sharp ridges that must be stepped over. - Unknown"" For the second option, I attached a photo I
took of a sunset during a drive home. I love sunsets as I find it so relaxing to watch the different
colours belnd together in the sky. Excited to hear from you and read your introduction! Talk to you
soon!Mentor 2021-09-26, 20:02: Hi Mataya, Hope you are doing well and your classes are going well!
Just wanted to check in and let you know that I am still looking forward to reading your
introduction and getting to know you better. Super excited to start a conversation with you soon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

keyboard when I was reading the conversation choices and it accidently clicked on the ""finding
inspiration"" convo lol. If you don't mind, we can start with this one and you can choose the order
of the rest of them, OR, I can ask to go back and we can choose another one to start with? Up to you

uni. Yeah we can start with this one its all good.Mentor 2021-10-07, 16:42: Hey, Haha yeah, super
believable, I know... and not all uni's allow that but it's crazy what people sneak in too sooooo
lol Aaaanyways, I'm glad you're up to go through this conversation! It's an interesting one. I
thought the idea behind the documentary, that they take pictures and pass them off to eachother to
provide someone new with inspiration and motivation was really cool. It shows that different people
see things differently and that is what makes each of us unique and special. Personally, I related
most with Denys' idea of inspiration in that the creative process should come from inside of you and
not be influenced by what you think people want you do or create. Only when you are personally drawn
to something, will it feel fulfilling to you. It's just like when considering your future education
and jobs, only if you learn and work at something that inspires you (and not what other people
suggest you should do), will you be happy. What did you think about the video and what I said about
it? which of the people in the video did you relate the most too when it came to the way they found
their inspiration? Also, I know that pro gaming is something that interests you in the future; can
you see what inspired that decision from seeing how these people in the video were inspired? I know
that might be a lot to read and a lot of questions, thanks in advance for your response :)Mentor
2021-10-15, 21:04: Hey Nathan, You're probably pretty busy killin' it in Valorant haha but I'm
excited to know what you think about the anchor text video :) If you have any questions, let me
know! Hoping to hear from you soon!Mentee 2021-10-25, 12:13: Im sorry i got my wisdom teeth out and
i was off school for awhile, I also liked the idea of the pictures and passing them on for new
motivation, i feel like its exactly what some people need especially if theyre lazy or unmotivated
(me). I also liked denys idea because i let people influence me to much and my opinions on things
which isnt good lol. I also believe you should follow whatever career path you would enjoy and not
let people like your parents influence your choices and possibly ruin your plans in the future. Btw
my teacher wanted me to tell you that next week is our last week of careers 12, what she was

time with mentors on Monday Nov. 1st.Mentor 2021-10-28, 22:06: Hey, Don't worry about it! I know
you've probably been quite busy and I'm glad you got around to it. I totally agree that it is really
hard not to let other people influence you so much but at least you know that about yourself and can
work on it . Wow, okay that was quick haha. Well if we go fast, I'm sure we can go through one more
conversation before we wrap things up! which conversation would you like to do?Mentee 2021-11-01,
12:42: Yeah I feel like its a problem that a lot of people have though, pretty common. Well this is
the last time ill be on ementoring right now so we won't be able to get through another post sorry.
Sorry about the week I missed but it was still a fun experience to talk to someone in college and
speak to someone with more experience. I wonder if they will ever update ementoring so it will be
easier to communicate like a live chat in 1 go or something. Either way it was fun thank you for
taking the time out of your day and schedule. Thank you, Nathan.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-17, 18:27: Hey there Nathan, I hope you’re having a great day 😊 My name is Eric and I

start off with you telling me a bit about yourself such as, what classes you are in? What are some
of your favorite things to do in your free time? And anything else you would like to share! You may
have learned a little about me from my bio but if not, or you have any other questions about my
experiences, feel free to ask 😊. I’m hoping we can really get to know each other throughout this
program and if you have questions about anything at all during our time together, please send them
my way and I will help you the best I can!Mentee 2021-09-27, 13:32: Sup Eric, Hope you're doing
fine. The classes I have right now are careers and math. Most the time I'll be playing valorant or
apex during my free time, sometimes i stream aswell. I used to play around 5 different sports but i
ended up quitting all of them, I was in hockey for 10 years but quit at the start of gr 9. What
sports and what video games do you play? Have a good one Eric.Mentee 2021-09-27, 13:32: Mentor
2021-09-28, 03:57: Hey Nathan, I'm glad to hear from you! So you're an FPS kinda guy eh? I tried to
get into Valorant but I was getting destroyed lol definitely not a noob-friendly game.... Apex, on
the other hand, I was addicted to for a bit cause it was easier to get into. However, I mostly play
RPG's like the dark souls games and right now I've been putting too many hours into RTS games like
starcraft 2 and civilization. I also played many sports when I was younger but gave most of them up
when I went into highschool. The only sport I played till college was soccer. If you dont mind me
asking, why did you drop hockey after all of those years? did you not find it fun anymore or
something? Also, if at any point you are ready to move on from our introductions just let me know
and we can start working through the program. Otherwise, I'd love to hear more about you and your
experiences :)Mentee 2021-10-07, 12:16: Yeah mostly FPS games, ive been playing cod since i was
around 7 years old so I have a lot of experience lol. Valorant is kinda hard at first yeah its a big
learning curve but so was apex. RPGs are also fun tho, skyrim was probably the most fun RPG ive
played though. Yeah i dropped hockey because it was just getting repetetive every year it wasn't fun
and it took up to much time, espeically waking up at 6am every morning sucked lol. Yeah we can start
working through the program whenever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chose to talk about Eating healthy food? Drinking water? Regular physical activity? I think its very
important to eat healthy food regularly especially for someone like me who needs healthy foods to
stay strong. Drinking water is extremely important for everyone. If you dont drink it you die, if
your drink it you live. Regular physical activity is good for self care but it's somtimes hard to
find the motivation to do it, but a bad day in the gym is better than not going at all.Mentee

Avery! i dont have specific program that i follow but i do do the push pull legs split. I only
change exercises when they stop builing muscle or i need to hit a different muscle. I do have a gym
partner but i also work out alone. What programs do you follow? Im interested in being a fisheries
officer just because i get to be out on the field and in the outdoors rather than in an office most
of the time. Id imagine health care is pretty scarce in such an isolated part of Canada. Are you
planning on going up there after you grad?Mentor 2021-09-29, 23:26: Hi Kendall, It sounds like you
really know what you're talking about! I played volleyball throughout university so I was given a
weight training program that we would follow for both team and individual workouts. I love being
outside so I completely understand the appeal of getting to go outdoors for your career! A very
close friend of mine is a wildlife biologist and he is in the field nearly every day looking for
rattlesnakes and birds. For our first conversation, we have a couple of different options: finding
inspiration, well-being, and self care, and challenging dis and misinformation. Which of those 3
appeals to you the most? We'll start there. Look forward to hearing from you soon!Mentee 2021-10-04,

writing this for the second time because I tried to look at your profile and it erased all that I
had written. Anyways, I was eating a delicious ham and cheese sandwich, but now I have finished it.
I apologize for my lack of thoughtful answers to my profile questions, but honestly I was more
interested in playing clash royale on my phone. When did you decide you wanted to become a teacher?
did someone inspire you to the point where you were like ""damn, I want to be a teacher"". I thought
about being a history teacher but me personally, I could not deal with kids without losing my mind.
Alright I sending this without reading over it, so bear with me.Mentor 2021-09-22, 17:48: Hello
David, I am so excited to have you as my 'first' mentee ever in my professional career. This makes
connecting with you so special and honestly speaking, so rewarding and a good learning experience
for both of us. Isn't it? Thank you so much for reaching out with your very simple, honest, genuine,
and funny message. I enjoyed reading it, and I got to know so much about you. I read through your
profile answers to the questions. It looks like you want to become a Waterslide Tester. I did not
know that such a job exists in the world. I had to google search and I found out that it is a
well-paid job that does not require any technical qualification but depends on the person's
personality, outlook, observation skills, intelligence. And looking at your profile answers and your
message, I feel that you have all of these qualities from now itself as you are preparing for your
future University higher learning, and career in the future. You wrote that you are a person who
likes Video Games too much. I guess we all need some passion, time-pass activity, and a stress
buster, and something that gives us satisfaction and happiness. I am sure video game is a wonderful
activity for you that keeps you sane, active, and above all, happy. :-) You also wrote about the
electrical trade. That is interesting for me as I do not have much expertise in electricals. I guess
you can teach me something in this area. How about that? I observed that beyond your fun and funny
side, you are also a philosopher where you are looking to find answers to the Universe. That is
profound. So profound. I am sure if you will continue to be on your good path of living, learning,
gaining experience, someday you will have all of the answers with you. I would encourage you to ask
me any philosophical questions, and we can have some interesting or debating discussions. :-) I also
see that you are an independent person. You are doing a part-time job of Pita bread at Pita Pit. I
haven't been to Pita Pit and I am sure it must be a good food restaurant, and of course, you must be
an awesome Pita Chef. :-) I love Pita bread, and I have been thinking about learning how to make
Pita bread. I hope you could teach me? :-) Now, let's talk a little about your message. Thank you
for taking the time to re-write your letter to me. Just so you know, you can feel free, and write to
me about anything, any questions, or doubts that you might have. Be sure that I will always be a
non-judgmental mentor and I will always support you with your decisions, choices, and perspectives.
I surely would give you advice that might help you move forward with informed decisions/choices. I
love sandwiches. When you wrote that you were eating Ham and Cheese Sandwich, I felt happy. We share
something in common.:-) I also like different wraps. Burrito is one of my favorite wraps, which is
healthy and filling. Clash Royle. Hmmmm. As a middle schooler, I used to play video games in the
game centers where we had to insert a coin in the slot and we will have three lives to play a game.
I remember spending a lot of money into those video games, but there was a time when I realized that
draining out money like this is not helping me, and I gave up playing video games. But I do often
play some easy video games on my phone or computer. I don't know if you know the game: RodentRush,
and Mario Bros. I used to love them and sometimes do play them on my phone. As for me, I always
wanted to become a University professor, and I did all of my university education like Masters in
Geography, Masters in Population Studies, Master of Philosophy in Population Studies only to become
a university professor. But you know, life is not easy as it seems. There were many candidates who
had connections with the selectors and they got selected but I did not. Hence I thought I need a job
soon, and since I like teaching, I could teach at school too. That's when I did my Bachelors of
Education degree and became a high school teacher in Geography (Social Sciences). I worked in India,
Indonesia, South Korea, and finally moved to Victoria to do my Masters in Special Education. I love
to work with children with disabilities or learning disabilities. That is why I chose this Masters
course at the University of Victoria. I hope to finish this course and become a Resource teacher and
support children with learning disabilities or special education needs. A little about me, that I
moved to Canada in June 2021 with my family: my wife, who is also a teacher. She teaches high school
English. I have two daughters: 9 years (Grade 3) and 4 years (daycare). I also have a Maltese dog
who is 5 years old. He is white in color and he is super cute and an intelligent yet silly dog. I
call him my Son. His name is Mill. I will write more to you soon once I get a reply from your side.
Take care David and I am eager to know more about you. :-) Write to me anything about that you like
or dislike. Have a good day and evening! Best wishes, ArvindMentor 2021-09-27, 15:12: Hello David, I
hope you are doing well. I messaged you 5 days ago, and I was hoping to get a reply. I know that you
must be busy with school work and your part-time job as well, so no need to rush, but do know that I
am looking forward to getting your reply. I would like for us to get into some conversations about
life, academics, future goals, etc. Feel free to write about anything and I will try my best to get
some good responses from my side. Take care and have a great and blessed week ahead. ArvindMentor
2021-10-02, 20:17: Hello David, How have you been? I was wondering how have you been doing? I am
sure you must be busy with studies, your part-time job, and your family. But just so you know, I am
here if you need help, guidance, and suggestions if any on any issues that you are dealing with or
struggling with. I hope you have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead. With care, Arvind",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will be your mentor this year. I am an international student from India. I am 21 years old and I
am a 3rd-year university student. I am doing my major in Computing Science and I am specializing in
Artificial Intelligence. I checked your profile and it turns out we have a lot in common, we share
gaming and robotic as common interests. Maybe we can plan to play few rounds of the games together
and you can tell me more about yourself. Looking forward to hearing from you. Stay safe! Cheers,

you? sorry for the short messageMentor 2021-09-20, 12:41: It's alright, glad you are going well. By
the way, I started recently as a mentor and you are my first mentee.Mentor 2021-09-20, 12:41: *
meant doing wellMentor 2021-09-20, 12:52: Nicolas, I want you to rank the topics according to your
priority. So, we will start with the topic that concerns you the most.Mentee 2021-09-21, 11:59: Nice
to know that i'm for frist mentee I'm really looking forward to this exprince. as for the topics I
don't really care that much of the order so i guess Finding Inspiration, Well being &amp; Self Care
then Dis- and Misinformation. Also i would love to play a coulp of games with ya. And one more thing
are you on pc or a consloe? I'm on pc for one (my pc is gardge ho)Mentor 2021-09-24, 09:54: Hi
Nicolas! I apologize for replying to you so late, I was busy with some University work. So, I think
I would like to start our discussion with Well-being &amp; Self-care as it is the most important
aspect in an individual's life. It is important to stay healthy and fit both mentally and
physically. In my first year as a university student, I have felt a sense of anxiety, homesickness,
and stress. Being an international student it is sometimes hard, whenever I do not perform up to my
expectations I get anxious or depressed. But in this kind of situation, I always try to talk to
someone, it could be anyone teachers, friends, family, any individual you can trust or government
mental health helpline. You can talk to them and share your concerns with them and try to find a
solution. I usually talk to mental support health at my university, they give me good suggestions to
distract myself, or I talk to my parents or friends about it. I find it very relieving and makes me
feel better and comforting. Sometimes you can try some workout, listen to music or do whatever you
love or have an interest in, I guess that is gaming, as it is for me to feel better. I would like to
know about your experiences if you have ever witnessed a mental breakdown, stress, anxiety, or
depression and how did you deal with it? In response to the previous message, I also use my laptop
for gaming. I won't say my laptop is garbage but it is also not the best. Although I support mostly
all games. Currently, I am playing AOE, Shogun 2, GTA 5 online, and Brawlhalla. Do you play
Brawlhalla? I find Brawlhalla kind of childish but it's fun to play.Mentee 2021-10-04, 12:10: sorry
for such a late message i thought i sent on last week but i forgot to hit send, but i'm 100% ok with
doing well-being &amp; self-care frist and i think it's good to do it frist as just thinking about
collage/university stress me out quite alot (even more so since i have to save up for it). i mainly
play apex my self but i'm probaly going to switch that with halo infinte when it comes out. i have
played brawlhalla but it's not really my thing (as i suck at it and at fighters in genral).Mentor
2021-10-08, 21:26: Hi Nicolas, I was traveling from India to Canada that is why could not reply to
you on time. I would like to learn more about things that make you feel stressed about
college/university. I will see if I can clear your doubts and answer your questions.Mentee
2021-10-12, 12:06: uh so my teacher said that you need to unlock the part of the course (idk how you
do that ho) as for stuff that has been stressing me it would mainly be money, school, what i'm going
to be doing after school. For collage/university it would mainly be money as my parents are telling
me that they won't pay for any thing so i have to take a gap year of working (which i really don't
want to do as i want to get into a school as soon as i'm out of high school.Mentor 2021-10-13,

care of yourself. For each proposed change, describe the concrete plan you have to make that change
part of your daily schedule. Hopefully, these new actions will become habits. To help support these
changes, you may want to check out the Solo Conversation: Setting Goals and Building Habits. Check

studying biology here at the university and look forward to our conversation! I was wondering if you

hobbies you like to do? I’d really appreciate that! If you have any questions, do let me know and
I’ll try my best to answer them. Thanks!Mentee 2021-09-17, 16:18: Hello Eashan! I have work
experience in the morning, where in I will be working in a local cafe. My other class is Career Life
Connections to which I am building a sort of buisness plan. I want to open a business that supports
the LGBTQ+ community because Prince Rupert dosn't have a place that people can go and hang out. I
have a job at Walmart, but when I am not working I love to read Books by James Patterson or listen
to music, but when I'm not doing that, I'm most likely watching Greys Anatomy. In the next five
years I want to open a buisiness, so right now I want to know what to expect to go to college and
how much money I will need.Mentor 2021-09-20, 15:27: Hey Cheyenne, That's great to know! I also
really like to read books, I've read a few of James Patterson's books too. There are quite a few of
them, are there any that you really liked? I like music too and sing when I can. How about you?
That's really great that you have a plan for what you want to do and have a job! We can further
discuss that and the other points you mentioned like financial planning in our conversations once we
get there. Do you want to choose a couple of options from the ones given in the list above to share
and discuss? I'd really like to see your thoughts on those. As always, if you have any questions,
feel free to ask me! ThanksMentor 2021-09-29, 13:38: Hey Cheyenne, How's it going? Been a little

used these websites for planning my schooling! BC Education Planner is especially awesome. Take a
look and let me know what thoughts and questions come up for you. Here are a few more questions that
helped me when choosing a school. Some of these were actually from a mentor I had in high school!
Feel free to use/ignore any of these questions :) - how far am I willing to travel for school, do I
want to be close to family? - Is the school in a town/city that interests me? (It will be your home
away from home after all!) - What does the program outline look like? - Do I want to be at a big,
busy school or a small and quiet school? Hope your week is going well, let me know if ya need
anything :)Mentee 2021-09-17, 16:20: I have been thinking about PG or Vancouver for
college/universityMentor 2021-09-18, 00:20: Cool! What drew you to those spots? Have you looked at
the school websites yet? Most schools have a specific nursing program page with lots of admission
info for prospective students. I find college/university websites are almost never user friendly so
let me know if I can help you find anythingMentee 2021-09-20, 15:03: Prince george is so i won't be
far from family and Vancouver is far but i still have family there. I did look at the
colleges/university sites in prince george and i want to know what program to start withMentee
2021-09-20, 17:36: I also need to ask what your last name is for my capstone project becuase i need
first and last nameMentor 2021-09-20, 21:44: Sorry Teanna, we actually aren't allowed to share last
names as part of the eMentoring privacy policies. Could you speak with your Capstone teacher and see
if you can have an exception? Maybe showing her that you are registered in the eMentoring program
will be enough to prove you aren't making me up? If you get to make up a last name for me, please
make me sound cool…like a Marvel villain or something :) Let me know if you run into issues - I am
happy to work with you to find a solution!Mentor 2021-09-20, 21:45: As for your program question...
:) It’s good that you know staying near family is important for you. I did a lot of travelling back
and forth between home and school during my degree, for both the home-cooked meals, and the moral
support while I sat screaming at my computer trying to write a paper. It was great! The
EducationPlanner is a helpful site when deciding which program to start with. Schools have specific
Bachelor of Nursing or Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. To look at RN-specific programs,
here are the steps: Click the Workbc CareerCompass link in the text above type in ‘registered nurse’
and click the popup text for RNs (#3012) scroll to the very bottom page and on the right hand side
there is a little box for Education Planner BC this will bring up a list of all the RN programs you
can take in BC (you can click the PG and Vancouver schools) explore each program page (admissions,
course outlines, unique school-specific experiences offered…) and compare/contrast to make a list of
1st, 2nd choice etc. You will want to apply to multiple schools. Some important notes to consider:
Look at all of the admission requirements IN DETAIL from top to bottom of the page (I have made the
mistake of missing important details until last minute…haha…not fun!) what are the prerequisite
courses to be admitted? Have you completed the required Math, Science, English courses listed? (Note
that UBC-Van requires you to start in a different university degree program before going into
nursing) what is the average admission grade? There is usually a minimum average required to apply,
and an “competitive average” from previous years (ie you may need a GPA of 70% just to apply to the
program, but an average of 90%+ is what most applicants have). Nursing can be a tough program to get
into so it is good to know what you are up against and start prepping :) If you identify as
Indigenous, some programs have reserved Indigenous seats so keep an eye out I hope this helps.
Please let me know if I have answered your question or if I am overwhelming you with too much info!
Take care :)Mentee 2021-09-21, 16:37: Thank you that actually helps a lot. And any studing
tips??Mentor 2021-09-23, 00:33: Awesome, glad to hear it! How's your semester going so far? And I am
more than happy to share some study tips :) I see that you checked off the studying Conversation as
one of your choices and we could do that one next? I do want to make sure we cover everything you
need in this post-secondary section before moving on. I find it's easy to get carried away talking
about something else and then all of a sudden realize we didn't finish talking about something
important! Do you feel confident with - reading college/university websites to understand the
program - understanding admission requirements, and going through admission process - meeting the
admission requirements (taking the correct gr.12 courses and getting high enough grades in your
classes to qualify and be competetive) - knowing who to contact at prospective schools if you have
an issue/question about your application/program (hint hint, Academic Advisors are good contacts to
save. They have saved my butt many times) Happy Wednesday!Mentor 2021-09-23, 00:44: Oh! Also! The
EducationPlanner website is how I did all my application stuff (you enter all your info into the
site and then click on the schools you want to apply to). Makes the application process much easier
becaue you don't have to type out your name and address 400 times for each application. I would
definitely recommend it!Mentee 2021-09-23, 15:52: Actually i would like to talk about the admission
requirements, and going through admission processMentor 2021-09-25, 01:59: Sounds good :) I would
recommend making a word doc or have a designated notebook where you record all of your post
secondary planning. For schools, this could be the admission requirements, required documents, and
important dates. It really helps to keep organized. Do you have any specific questions? Maybe you
can have a look at the programs and start to go through the application process for one of them, see
how far you get, and we can work through it together if you get stuck? I realize this may be an
early start but actually going through the process might be more useful than talking hypothetically.
And better early and slow than late and panicked lol. Happy Friday!Mentor 2021-09-28, 20:10: Hey
Teanna :) Hope your week is going well. I know school and life can get crazy so let me know if
there's anything I can help you with (school applications or otherwise)!Mentee 2021-09-29, 01:28:

next conversation? (And let me know which one you want to do next!)Mentee 2021-09-29, 23:08: We
could move onto another conversation. We could do studying tips",,,"Mentor 2021-10-01, 13:47: Hi Teanna, I am just at work but I have unlocked this module now just in
case you wanted to take a look before we get started. I will review the conversation starters this
evening :) Happy Friday!Mentor 2021-10-02, 00:51: OK! I have had a chance to look through so here is
my bit :) - I always thought of studying in the context of ""traditional"" school, where we are taught
something, then we try to memorize it for a test. This changed A LOT in nursing school, as we
transitioned to a more drawn out version. It now looks more like Prereading notes before class &gt;
class for discussing the topics you should now know &gt; study study &gt; apply to real life people
in practicum &gt; test on how you apply knowledge I found this relly challenging beacause all of a
sudden it wasn't enough to just know a fact, I had to know how to use this fact to inform my nursing
practice (ie I couldnt just know the biology around heart failure, I had to know how it would affect
my patients and what I would do to help those patients) The most effective study strategy was
whiteboards and reteaching. My friend and I often stayed at school after classes to re-write out
concepts from class and then we would teach each other. This was a great way to review the material
multiple times, and by teaching each other and asking each other questions, we were able to pick out
areas that we needed to work on more. I also 100% agree that thinking of real-life applications is a
great way to remember things - there were soooo many times in exams where I couldn't remember my
notes about a disease, but I remembered a patient I had worked with and it helped me to answer the
question! What are your thoughts? See if you can answer some of the questions from the anchor text
above, I'd love to hear your thoughts because everyone always has a different idea :) Have a great
weekend! ""see"" you next week!Mentor 2021-10-06, 11:43: Hey Teanna! It seems weird to take time away
from studying so you can study how to study...but when you get the chance to look over this module
let me know if anything stands out as helpful. Or feel free to ask any other study-related questions
:) Happy Wednesday - half way there!Mentee 2021-10-06, 18:40: I have been really sick these past
couple of days why i haven't answered yet but i will look over them:)Mentor 2021-10-10, 00:13:
Sounds good! Maybe as you study you can think about how you go about your review etc. Identify what
works and where you struggle when it comes to keeping info in your brain. Let me know if you need
any help :) Have an awesome long weekend!Mentee 2021-10-12, 15:47: Ok thank you. I haven't looked at
the videos yet but i will right now :)Mentor 2021-10-13, 01:06: Sounds good! I imagine you have
other things going on so thanks for taking whatever time you can to work through this program :) I
won't move on or change anything without you so just let me know what I can do to help and we'll see
if we can become study pros by the end of this moduleMentee 2021-10-15, 16:26: I just finished
looking at the videos and wrote down some strategies that might be good:)Mentor 2021-10-18, 01:09:
Awesome! Any thoughts or questions? Do you have a favourite tip or study routine?Mentee 2021-10-18,
17:06: i usually just re-read my notes or write out the important parts on a different peice of
paper that really helps meMentee 2021-10-20, 17:43: What about studing while in college/university?
when i am in college how would i fit in studying with my life outside of school like work, family,
exercise, chores, and other things. I know it is best to stick to a schedual but it's very hard for
me to stick to a schedual sometimes. I usually have like a check list and i do those things when i
have time but i think that will not be a good thing to keep following when i go to college, would i
need to do some of the things less important and do them when they are needed to be done? Any
Tips?Mentor 2021-10-21, 03:56: Rewriting notes is a great way to help solidify information in your
brain! I find I take notes in such a rush sometimes, taking time to rewrite them and organize is
always good And these are great questions! I think what is important is to know what works best for
you. Knowing that lists help and you have trouble keeping a schedule are 2 very important things to
keep in mind! Personally, I think lists are great. I found keeping a day planner or semester chart
was even more helpful so it was more of a timeline of assignments rather than just a list of
everything on my phone or something. At the start of the semester you will get a list of all the
assignments in each class so I really recommend taking time to organize early! I liked to colour
coordinate my planner and put %s next to the assignment too (so Id put ""Professional Practice Paper
due - worth 20%, Critical Reflection due - worth 5%) and this helped me see which assignments I
should prioritize because Id rather spend a lot of time on the paper worth 20% of my final grade and
risk having less time for the 5%. Maybe I start the paper 3 weeks early and do the reflection a
couple days early ya know? You will also get a sense of which classes will be more work and which
classes you can put at the bottom of your priority list :) As for keeping up with studying, I
relate. I struggled and still do... so I like to do all of my work at school or a coffee shop. I
cannot for the life of me focus at home! So for keeping a schedule, I would often plan to go
straight from class every day to a private study room or stay in the library and not go home until I
was done. I also liked having a classmate to go with so we could share ideas, share snacks, ask
questions and support each other - very helpful! Once I got into that habit it made a HUGE
difference. It was also a good way for me to balance school and life because I knew when I left the
library I had finished with my school responsibilities and did not have to feel guilty about doing
other things. Do you have a favourite spot to study? Favourite study snack? And do you work better
solo or with a study buddy?Mentor 2021-10-26, 12:39: Hey aTeanna :) Another thing to think about is
how you study before a class. Each class will have pre-readings that you do before going to the
actual lecture. Sometimes these readings can be entire chapters (like 100+ pages) so it's important
to be strategic to save you time. A few things people in my class have tried: - split up the
readings with a friend and share notes (google docs is very helpful for this!) -each week the
syllabus (course guide) will have the main concepts you need to know written out. so use these to
guide your studying and note taking. This will help guide you tk make sure you are studying the
important things. 5his will also help you use the textbook readings more efficiently because you
knkw what info you are looking for and what info you can just skim quickly - read the intro pages,
tables, headers, and conclusion in a textbook chapter to get the main ideas and concepts. Then do
the other assigned readings (like papers or blog posts) and only go back to text book for extra info
as you need it. This is helpful if you find the readings overload with details that just confuse
you. Better to get the main ideas down and only look at the little details once youve got the big
ideas down. Let me know if these make sense or if im speaking gibberish. Its hard to explain through
text! :) Happy TuesdayMentee 2021-10-27, 16:23: I do not have a favourite study spot becuase i can't
stay after school to actually find a spot since i have to take a ferry to get to school which is
only about a 15 minute ride, but where ever i study my favourite study snack is just anything i have
in my bag or anything i bought to eat and i usually like to work solo but i find it easier when i
study with a partner. I do get what you are saying it is very helpful imformation, thank you:) Also
i am not very active because i have been busy with grad stuff and have been visiting family and i
have some homework from chem 12 when i missed some school.Mentor 2021-10-30, 23:57: No worries! And
these are all great things to think about as you are settling into your new routine at school :) you
will get the hang of things and find what works for you. I changed something about my routine every
semester! Let me know what other thoughts/questions you have for this section and when you are ready
to move on to the next. Best of luck with grad stuff and chem - I remember both of those being A LOT
of work so be sure to take care of yourself whenever you have a spare 2 seconds!Mentee 2021-11-01,

2021-11-02, 01:35: Ok! Which one do you want to do next?Mentee 2021-11-02, 14:48: How about
different ways of knowing. Like how did you know you wanted to be a nurse? Becuase i am having
second thoughts about being a nurse since all these speakers came in to speak about different
careers i have many different ones in mind now.","Mentor 2021-11-05, 12:19: Hey teanna :) Ive unlocked this conversation for you to have a look at. I
will have a look as well later today once I have my laptop (it's hard to see this website on a phone
haha) and am happy to chat about why I chose nursing. Chat soon!Mentee 2021-11-05, 16:30: okMentor
2021-11-06, 01:17: I realize this question is a bit different than the anchor texts but I'll answer
it first:) I chose nursing in 12th grade. I had been watching videos and news updates and while
watching I was so disheartened by all the terrible stories that I decided I wanted to be a part of
something positive in my lifetime. That's when I started looking for careers that would allow me to
work closely with people and I came across nursing. It is very cheesy I know but really I had not
considered nursing at all before that. I was a sudden idea and I went with it. So it was more than
just choosing a job for me, it was about choosing something that aligned with my values and what I
wanted to be a part of big picture (helping people through some of the really tough times in life).
As for your second thoughts, that is totally normal. I considered other jobs before I chose nursing
and honestly still wonder about other careers. I am still trying to figure out what area of nursing
I want to work in because there are so many and my interests seem to change so often! That was
another reason I chose nursing - because it is one degree and it can take you so many places. There
are A LOT of jobs out there so of course you will have many interests. Can I ask what other jobs you
are thinking about? There is no right or wrong...I think considering what is most important to you
as a person, writing out your values/beliefs/hopes and comparing each career choice can be really
helpful. Again SO cheesy but at the end of the day doing something that is meaningful to you is what
will make your school and work enjoyable! And nothing is ever set in stone, theres always a way to
rethink your career in the future either by going back to school or getting other forms of training
through work!Mentee 2021-11-11, 17:41: Other careers i am intrested in are the RCMP becuase when
some poeple came in to talk to my class about there career it really interested me and since i go
the gym and go for runs i think i would be good in that job and another is to stay where i am and
learn more about my culture and teach others about it.Mentor 2021-11-15, 10:44: Those are also
really interesting choices! Maybe you could make a list of the pros and cons qnd compare them? And
you could think about what you hope to get from your career (what is most impotant to you when you
think about life after high school, do you hope to stay in one job for a long time or use each job
to gain experience then try something new?). And you could watch videos about each of those jobs to
get more information and help you decide! It can be tough to choose especially when each idea is so
different so do your best to have fun with exploring these ideas :)Mentor 2021-11-18, 23:55: Hey

sister helped me apply to different universities for nursing school using the BC Education Planner.
The programs I was most interested in were from Camosun College, and UNBC. I still haven't decided
which school I want to attend in the fall of 2022. Since you study at Camosun I was sondering what
are some of the things you enjoy about your program/campus? Are there dorms provided by the school,
or do you rent your own apartment. Is there a food plan for first year students and how is the
quality of the food? How does the location of your school affect your day to day life?(grocery
stores, restaurants, businesses nearby) My sister is a 3rd year BioMed student at UNBC so I'm
already pretty familiar with her university. She has showed me around her campus/dorm a couple times
and I have seen what her day to day looks like. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond to my
questions, as they will help me make important decisions in the future!Mentor 2021-09-23, 14:01: Hi
Sarah, So Camosun is a split program with UVIC. You spend 2.5 years at Camosun and then 1.5 at Uvic.
The Camosun-Uvic stream has the most practicum hours out of any other school in Canada. So as a
graduating nurse, you will have a ton of experience and be more prepared than other schools. Camosun
is a community college, so it does not have any dorms, nor does it have a food program (I don't
think, atleast I never heard of it). They just built a new building for the nursing program, and it
is very nice with a lot of open concepts. Not a ton of places to study, but you can always study at
a coffee shop too. The rest of the campus is pretty old though. It is about 10 minutes drive from
grocery stores and such. Uvic does have a dorm and food program, and the campus is quite large. It
is an older campus with some newly renovated spaces. The buildings are beatiful and the green space
is lovely with some hiking trails around. It is about a 5 minutes drive from grocery stores and
such. I hope I answered all of your questions! Please let me know :)Mentee 2021-09-27, 17:33: Thanks
for answering all of my questions, but I still have a few more. Without dorms at Camosun college do
most students live with their parents or have their own apartment? If I were to move to Victoria I
would have to find an apartment close to the college that is at an affordable price range. This
would probably be a dealbreaker for me when deciding what post-secondary school I want to go to.
What is your living situation like? Do you have your own apartment or share rent with your friends?
I wouldn't be able to go to Camosun College without an adequate place to live that is close to the
school, grocery store, or restaurants. This wouldn't be a problem for me at UNBC because my sister
already has a dorm there, and I could apply to live with her. They also have a meal plan for first
year students. Plus the dorms are a short walk away from the main buildings. If you were in my
position which option would you choose? Also how did you decide your living situation when you went
off to post-secondary school?Mentor 2021-09-28, 11:58: Hi Sarah, There are a lot of things to
consider when going to school. Nursing school is hard, and if you have never been away from family,
then being close to your supports can be very important. However, some people find going to a new
school and area exciting! but 4 years is a long time, so youll have to see what is most important to
you! Camosun does have several restaurants and you can charge a pre-paid card, so that is like a
meal plan I suppose. Most people either rent a room in a house. There are lots of student who will
split a house. Victoria has a lot of rentals, and for students specifically. There can be a lot of
interest in rentals, but I don't think you'll have a problem. There are buses that run frequently,
and you can always bike as well! I currently live with my partner, but previously I rented a room in
a house. I enjoyed it as I like meeting new people and living with other young people. It sounds
like family &amp; convenience is very important to you! Maybe you could write a pro and cons list. I
personally LOVE victoria. It is beautiful and the outdoor scene here is great. However, I have never
been to your neck of the woods, and I am sure it is beautiful as well. I hope this helps!Mentor
2021-09-28, 12:08: Oh, also, Victoria snows usually only a week or so, so getting around on the bus
is not hard, but it does rain quite a bit rather than snow, haha.Mentee 2021-10-08, 17:43: Hey
Jacqueline! Based on some of your advice I made a pros &amp; cons list to help me decide on which
university to go to. Right now I'm leaning more towards UNBC since I think I would get homesick
really easily. Having my sister there to help me adjust to life at university would be a big help. I
like how the class sizes are small compared to other universities since I sometimes get anxious when
in large groups of people. Lastly, my parents would be able to afford to put me through UNBC as I
don't want to put them through any financial stress. Camosun College/UVIC Pros Leave my town and
explore a big city. (rural to urban) Brings up new opportunities living in Victoria. Meet a
diversity of new students. New building for nursing was just built. Look for my own place to live
when I’m older/have my own apartment. Sisters boyfriend also goes to UVIC so our families would be
connected. Cons More expensive option. No meal plan or reserved housing for students. Farther away
from home/harder to get in touch with family. Finding housing would be hard and also expensive. Most
likely would have to work part-time job. Hard to return back to my small town if my whole life is in
Victoria. UNBC Pros Meal plan for first-year students. Housing reserved for students with kitchen,
bedroom, shared living room/bathroom, and laundry area. I could live in the same dorm as my sister.
Family could drive from my town to Prince George to pick/drop me off. Smaller campus so it’s easy to
go from dorm to class. Can apply straight to nursing program from high school. Cons Sometimes can
seem like a “boring” campus. Dorm can be small and depressing. Have to live with 3 other roommates.
Food served in meal plan can be limited/unappetizing. Snows a lot in Prince George and gets very
cold. Very bad air quality because of mill. Not a big fan of Prince George.Mentor 2021-10-11, 22:37:
Hi Sarah, I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving! Thank you for sharing your pros and cons list with me.
Did you find it helpful to see it on black and white? It seems like you are figuring out that being
close to family is most important for you. That is very understandable! One more thing on top of you
pros and cons list I would suggest. Tag a number beside each point to represent level of importance
to you. For example: 1 = not very important, 2= important, &amp; 3 =very important. Then add all of
them up! So, for the cons list, it would actually minus the numbers, but for the pros it would add
the numbers! Sometimes when we write a pros and cons list it leaves out the fact that some things
are more important than others! Just a thought anyhow. Let me know if you have questions. If you
feel ready, we could move on to the next section: ""what to expect in post-secondary"". However, still
feel free to share with me more on your pros and cons list with the numbers, or if you have any
other questions!Mentee 2021-10-12, 16:05: Hi Jacqueline, I think I am ready to move on to the next
section. Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions about post-secondary. By giving me
insight into what your life is like as a nursing student, I am now a lot more confident in what my
future career will be. You must be busy with school and being an online mentor so thanks again for
all your help!","Mentor 2021-10-25, 12:34: Hi Sarah, I thought this an appropriate conversation to open up because we
just finished discussing money with our last activity. Oh Sarah, I forgot to ask. What pronouns do
you prefer? My pronouns are she/her :). Will your parents be helping you with tuition? Will you be
taking student loans? Will you work a part-time/casual job? Oh! If your parents do pay for your
tuition, you can always take student-loans out and put them in a TFSA and invest them, and then at
the end of your degree, pay the money back and keep the interest you earned. Some friends of mine
did that because they had their parents help, and were able to make a little money. I use
WealthSimple for my investing needs. I keep one for long term investing and I just put 25$ down
every month, and then I have another where it is more ""short-term"" savings account where I put 100$
down every month. And, if I run out of money, I have that as a backup. Also, you should still apply
for bursaries! That is free money and so much of busaries dont get used up every year. I am very
open about money and finances. I believe our society is so hush hush about it, but that keeps the
conversation closed about money and finances. Whereas we should be open about it so we can talk to
our peers and learn and provide/receive advice! I did not have help from my parents, so I will have
about 70,000$ student debt unfortunately, but luckily with nursing, you can work in rural areas and
get debt-forgiveness. Which I believe where you live may be considered rural! So that is a bonus for
you :)Mentee 2021-10-26, 00:38: Hi Jacqueline, My preferred pronouns are she/her. Some questions I
have about paying for school are... What is the cost each year to attend Camosun College? (breakdown
of expenses, tuition, books, fees, rent, food, transportation, utilities) How do you manage the
stress of having a job and being a student? How much time do you put into studying and school,
compared to work? How many hours do you have to work each week in order to make enough money to
support yourself? What is your main source of income? Did you win any scholarships or bursaries or
did you take out a student loan? What do you do to limit your spending? (budgeting, coupons, student
discounts) Personally, I plan on paying for my post-secondary school with scholarships and
bursaries. My older sister has most of her university expenses paid with awards/scholarships so she
can help me apply for these too. My parents are also helping to pay for my first degree. After that,
if I decide to still go to school I would have to take out a student loan or a part-time job to help
with my expenses.Mentor 2021-10-29, 15:53: Hi Sarah, So, after food, housing, transportation and
such, the cost for school for me was probably around 15-20k a year. As for housing, transportation
and utilities break down, that is something you will have to figure out as those depend on your
lifestyle, as they can vary widely. Working has been something that I have done throughout my
schooling. however, It has varied throughout my time in school. I did not work very much in 1st and
2nd year. Those years I had to study a lot. However in 4th year, I have been working twice a week,
and it has been manageable. Also, I make sure to spend a lot of time doing activities that I enjoy
like mountain biking and climbing to keep me happy. My main source of income is student loans,
bursaries, grants, and work. I have ADHD, so I get grants from the government which help a lot, and
I apply for bursaries every semester, and I always get something, which is helpful. I try to make my
own meals, and bring my own coffees and such, and I watch what clothes I buy. And I try to haggle to
get lower cellphone bills etc. Usually when you start a new school, they have entrance scholarships
which are very helpful :) definitely check those out!Mentee 2021-10-31, 20:22: Thanks, Jacqueline
for the information on how you earn/manage your money in post-secondary school. My parents believe
that it is important for me to be able to support myself, instead of always relying on them for
everything. I already have an entrance scholarship based on grades lined up for one of the
universities I plan to attend. I'm still in the process of accepting the scholarship but hopefully,
that will be done by the start of next year. I'm also going to apply for more scholarships since
there are so many of them available for students in my community. Last year my teacher said that
barely any of the grad students actually applied for scholarships/bursaries so they had to extend
the deadline for applications. With fewer applications, it's almost like they are giving out free
money to students. Another way I plan to earn money for university is to work as a nursing student
when I come home from school. Not only will this make a decent amount of money, but I'll also gain
experience working as a nurse.Mentor 2021-11-01, 14:07: Yea! Employed Student Nurses are great job!
I am on my second one now. I think it is very valuable experience. I think it is great your parents
want you to support yourself. It seems like so many peopple have their parents pay and do a lot of
stuff for them. I have met quite a few people who don't know how to support themselves, and it is
kind of scary, haha. Have you finished all of the activities? Do you want to try to make a
budget?Mentee 2021-11-02, 16:18: Hi Jacqueline, I think I have finished all of the assignments and
would like to move on to creating a budget. In my careers 12 class we have already started to make
simple budgets for post secondary school using the website myBlueprint. Here are some screenshots of
my budget. Are there any other things that you would recommend that I add? Are there any parts of my
budget that you don't think are realistic? I also need to figure out how to earn more income so that
I can add it to my budget. I'm going to talk to my parents about what they are willing to pay for
and how much money I need to come up with. Thank youMentee 2021-11-03, 16:32:",,"Mentor 2021-11-03, 16:40: Hey Sarah, The screenshots werent loaded from your budget! I couldn't see
them anyways. Would you like to try them again? Also, How do you study? what concerns do you have
around studying? Would you like some tips?Mentee 2021-11-04, 00:01: Hi Jacqueline, Sorry, my
screenshots didn't load I'm not familiar with using this program to send images. I tried to save the
screenshots of my budget to my portfolio, but I don't know if you have access to it. Studying has
been something that I've had to learn and work on throughout high school. My main problem is that I
tend to procrastinate until the night before an exam to start studying. This is mainly because I
either don't want to study, or in the past have gotten away with not studying at all. Now that I'm
in 12th grade I realize that I actually have to put in the time studying if I want to do well in
school. One thing that I really like to do to study is to find a journal that I can rewrite all my
notes in. I like to summarize everything I've learned in class into easy notes that I can reread and
understand. I use this for courses where I need to remember a lot of info for example biology,
chemistry, and french. I find that actually writing something out with pen and paper helps me
remember things easily. Another thing I like to do is make flashcards for terms I need to study or
facts I need to remember. This way I can put my cards on my nightstand and go through them before
bed. I also like to bring them to class and go through them when I have nothing to do or I'm on
break. The last thing I like to do is help my peers with their homework. For example, I'm in
chemistry right now and I'm usually done my worksheets on time and have all the answers corrected.
If I see someone having a hard time with a question I'll offer to help them with it. For some reason
simply explaining topics to others helps me gain a better understanding of them. What are some of
your favourite ways to study? Do you have any tips or tricks that you could share with me?Mentee
2021-11-04, 00:02: Mentee 2021-11-04, 00:03: Here is the second screenshot of my budget hopefully
you can open it this time!Mentor 2021-11-07, 20:14: Hi, Sorry for the late reply! That looks great!
Your budget seems realistic. Writing out flash cards and making notes look nice is helpful, but you
may find in nursing school it takes too long to do that. My pathophysiology teacher taught me to
just use a whiteboard and scribble things down as much from memory as possible. Or even a scrap
piece of paper. Sometimes I would re-write things over and over until I could do it by memory. A lot
of the patho stuff is memory, and also doing it helps you figure out how it works! I found my
friends who took a lot of time making things look nice, did worse than I did, and they spent longer
on things. That is my advice for that! Otherwise, all of the things you do sound good! Have you ever
used a timer when studying? It is a good idea, but I do struggle with using it, haha. I tend to just
sit down for as long as I can and hope the time goes by quickly, haha.Mentee 2021-11-08, 16:43: Hi
Jacqueline, Thanks for taking time to respond to me. I understand that you're busy with school right
now combined with other things in life. My older sister who is in her third year of university
doesn't have time to talk to me as much because she is busy with midterms. I have a chemistry final
this Friday so I plan on using your timer method to help study. I find that I get easily distracted
and end up wasting time if I don't have someone or something forcing me to actually study or get my
work done. I feel like I could set a timer for two hours, then take a fifteen-minute break and then
study some more. This would make studying a bit more manageable and easy for me.Mentor 2021-11-10,
12:21: That sounds like a great idea! There are apps for you phone that have timers. They generally
suggest setting the timer for 25 min then taking a 5 min break and then keep doing that, but is 2
hours works for you then that sounds good too!",,,,"Mentor 2021-10-19, 17:19: Hi Sarah, I like these questions that they suggest. If you want, you can
share them with me, or journal about them! How easy is it for you to think about self care as
something important? What role does time management play in taking good care of yourself? Do you
have people in your life who encourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do
to take care of themselves? How might you incorporate some of what they do into your own life? What
are some signs you have noticed in your own life that indicate you need to be taking better care of
yourself? (This is really important! Try writing down some ""red flags"" so when you say, stop making
your bed, or stop doing the dishes, or stop meditating in the morning, you can check in with
yourself!)Mentee 2021-10-20, 17:37: Hi Jacqueline, Taking care of my mental health has been a skill
I've had to learn at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I value my mental health just as much as my
physical health, if not more. I feel like mental health is especially important as teenagers since
we are transitioning into adulthood. Effective time management has been something that has helped me
keep up with my mental health. For example, planning times throughout the week to spend time with
family, hang out with friends, explore hobbies, exercise, etc have all helped me. Without this
system my life becomes a blur going through the same routine everyday. It can be very depressing at
times. Wake up, school, eat, homework, sleep, repeat. I have a couple people in my life that
encourage/model self care. One example would be my mom who regularly asks me how I'm doing mentally.
She can notice changes in my mood that others wouldn't be able to pick up on. One of the things that
my mom does to take care of herself is to go out to town to grab food or go shopping. We usually
spend time together in her car talking or blasting our favourite songs. Another thing we do together
is buy ice cream and drive down to the water to watch the sunset if it's a nice day outside. I have
gotten very good at picking up on the signs that I need to take better care of my mental health. One
of the earliest signs would be that my room gets extremely messy, and I just can't find the time or
energy to clean it. Another sign is that I'll become very sleepy and if I'm having an extremely
tough day I'll try to sleep the day away. The last sign is I will have a decreased appetite. I won't
be able to finish usual amounts of food, and my favourite foods will seem unappetizing. When I'm
down, food won't bring the same joy that it used to. Thankfully I haven't experienced any of these
signs in a long time, and I hope that if I ever do I'll know what to do or have someone trusted to
talk to. Even just writing about my mental health and experiences has been very refreshing.",,"Mentee 2021-09-14, 16:51: Hi Jacqueline thanks for being my mentor! Hopefully we can have some
meaningful discussions in the future about the topics I have selected.Mentor 2021-09-15, 13:18: Hi
Sarah! Nice to meet you! Here are some words I like to live by: ""You are enough, just the way you

not sure if I will continue when I am done school, but we shall see! Where do you want to go to

career! You will make a great nurse. :)",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-22, 14:24: Hi Sarah, Wow, I wish I was an insightful as you are when I was your age!
It sounds like you have a very good idea of what mental health looks like for you and those around
you. I like that you already have an idea of sigs or ""red flags"" that indicate to you that you need
to talk to someone or do something healing. I appreciate so much what you shared with me. It made me
think about things that help me feel grounded. One of my favourite things is to go to the ocean and
do some deep breathing and listen to the waves. I have never found anything as calming as that.
Okay, so moving on to this section, could you do the activity, and share with me what you wrote? (if
you feel comfortable of course). Even though you may think of changes, actually writing it down can
help it seem more real, and solidify your plan! It doesnt have to be big, or school/work related.

sharing! I like that you had realistic steps to get to your goals. You are probably already doing
the things you wrote down, which is great! Sometimes on my to-do list I will write down things I
have already done and cross it off. It helps me realize that I am doing the things I need to do, and
it feels more fufilling! Thanks for sharing! If you do pursure nursing, SMART goals are used a lot,
not only in school, but once you are done nursing as well. As a nurse, you have to make ""Learning
Plans"" to show that you are continuing to grow and work on your practice. SMART goals are an
important part of that. You have to make goals that are attainable, realiistic and timed. Meaning
usually for learning plans you have to put ""By this date I will have done these things..."" It gets a
bit tedious, but I think its good to set goals! And it is nice that they kind of ""force"" us to do
it, haha.",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-10-12, 16:13: Hi Sarah, Great! So this is the next part. Did you complete this already?

steps to gain experience and confidence Grocery Shopping Yes! I regularly go with my mom grocery
shopping, and she shows me what to buy and how to get good deals on groceries. Cooking healthy meals
Yes! I really enjoy cooking meals as I find it very relaxing. Most of the time I cook healthy food
but I also make desserts too. House keeping/cleaning Yes! I clean my room at least once a week and I
also help clean around the house. (sweeping, doing dishes, taking out the trash) Getting around town
– using public transit Not yet My mom usually drives me around so I rarely take the bus. I could
talk to my grandma who uses public transit to gain more experience using the bus. Finding a doctor,
dentist, etc. and making appointments Not yet I could listen to my parents when they are making
appointments over the phone. I could also try booking my next dentist or ortho appointment myself.
Paying bills Not yet I could ask my mom who is in charge of paying the bills on what she does each
month. Doing household repairs/calling for repair services Not yet I could ask my dad to teach me
how to do simple repairs around the house since he has a lot of tools and experience. Banking –
making e-transfers, money order, bank draft, writing a cheque Yes! I manage my own money since I
have my own job/ bank account. Apply for a job Not yet I've had a job in the past but my mom is the
one who got it for me. I could ask her what she did to help me apply for jobs in the future. Driving
car Not yet I'm still learning how to drive. I could ask my driving instructor for tips on better
driving and what I can do to improve when I'm at my next lesson. Hi Jacqueline, After finishing this
activity I was wondering what was the hardest skill for you to learn while transitioning into
adulthood? Are there any skills that you still struggle with? ThanksMentor 2021-10-25, 12:22: That's
great! I think it's wonderful that you have recognized areas you are confident in, and areas you
need some experience in. I would definetily get in on learning to do repairs from your dad! And also
learning about money management and bills and such is so important! Definitely hit your parents up
on that before you move out, haha. Hmmm, Areas that were hard for me to transition to? Well, money
was one. Learning to spend money appropriately and budget was/has been difficult. I am at a point
now in my life where money seems okay for me, and I don't have to watch everything I spend anymore.
Which is very nice. However, when I first moved out, it was a struggle. Phone companies and internet
companies will take advantage of you, but I have learned that there are internet companies that
offer the same service for cheaper, and phone companies can be haggles. One thing you can't really
get away from though is rent and groceries. Those things are just expensive. Atleast in southern BC.
Sorry, I feel like I went on a tangent, haha. Another thing I struggle with is motivation for
school. That's why I make to do lists, and go to coffee shops and study beside friends to keep me
motivated. Another thing I struggle with is isolation. Luckily I live with my partner, and he is
wonderful, but before then I lived with roommates, or by myself, and I got very lonely, and would
sometimes isolate. So, to combat that, I would make more of an effort to see people who ""fill my
cup"". Meaning, people who I love and trust who can fill that lonely feeling. Additionally, I would
meditate and journal and I have always stayed very active. I like to rock climb and mountain bike,
so those things are inherently social. It kept me busy, kept giving me happy endorphins and kept me
connected to people. I hope those answered you questions! If not let me know. I will open up another
conversation!.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the Job Market. Did you read the Resume Skills article, above? If so, please tell me about your
transferrable skills from both high school and electrical work. If you can think of examples for the
categories above, that would be great :)Mentee 2021-10-28, 15:55: Hey Georgina, I would say my
transferable skills from school are Listening and following instructions, being efficient,
presenting info in a understandable way. What I learned from fishing and electrical is how to work
withought being told what to do, how to get work done when you really dont want to, how to get along
with the people you work with and become good friends. You defienetly learn how to act proffesional
when you need to and when you can goof off in all these jobs.Mentor 2021-10-28, 18:38: Those are
awesome transferrable skills! I love the mention of presenting info in an understandable way.
Communication skills are so important for literally any job you could get. Knowing your audience and
changing how you present different ideas so that they are understandable to who you're talking to is
a skill you'll need forever. Whether that's explaining something to a little kid or speaking with
your supervisor. Knowing how to get work done when you really don't want to is a great skill too.
Pushing through something challenging or even boring is another necessary part of life at times. I'm
going to click ""The Job Interview"" now and go into the chat there.",,,"Mentor 2021-10-13, 11:38: Hello! I totally agree with you regarding the close community and access
to nature that is found in rural areas. I am rural at heart. That is a really long way to travel for
just one game of rugby. My partner had to do that too for his high school rugby team haha. My
hometown was southern and suburban, about an hour east of Toronto. Even though it was probably
equivlant to Abbotsford or something else in the lower mainland, it still felt small and we had no
where to hangout other than McDonalds or the movie theatres haha. So I feel you there! The biggest
city I've ever lived in was Vancouver. We moved there last September and stayed until May of this
year, when we moved to the island. We did a couple things to find rentals there. I joined a bunch of
rental facebook groups for Vancouver, and looked on Craigslist. Because we were looking for
roommates (the price of living on our own wasn't worth it), I posted in the facebook groups and
Craiglist with a little about us and what we liked to do. I had many people contact me directly, and
we kinda got to choose the best option for us. Making friends was for sure harder in Covid times.
Being enrolled in school helped because there were people in my partner's program and mine of
similar age/life phase that we could ask to go on walks, or have a campfire with, or grab coffee
with. So, starting with coworkers or school mates is always a good thing I think. If we were there
longer and if Covid was less of a factor, I would have volunteered more. We're volunteering in
Cumberland for things now and it's an awesome way to meet people that have similar interests as you.
Also, joining clubs for sports or board games is another great way to meet people. Facebook pages
are a good way to find out about local events or groups. It's definitely harder to meet people as an
adult, but if you're moving to a city for school, I think that can help in the pursuit of friends.
Do you have any more questions? Or shall we move onto the ""Between Worlds"" link above. There's a
small video to watch there that the Rural eMentoring staff would like us to watch and talk about.",,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-09-15, 15:41: Hello Georgina, I'm Owen. Your job sounds very interesting and I am

basements don't sound as nice as forests, but I'm sure you're working hard and learning lots! I'd
love to start talking about well-being and self-care. I've thought about that subject a lot lately.

we can get into the Wellbeing and Self Care stuff.Mentee 2021-09-16, 17:17: Hey Georgina, Rupert is
pretty awesome except fpr how much it rains here. Ive been to Williams Lake and stewart too such
beautiful areas. I was wondering about how you got through post secondary education while still
enjoying it? Ive been straying away from looking into going to a college or university because i
really dont enjoy school and i know college is a lot tougher then highschool. During school to keep
my self sane I like too go on walks, workout, do yoga and do breathing practices which is really
helpful for me too keep away stress. I read through the working through this program link and think
i understand this mentoring thing. If you see im doing something wrong though just let me know,
thanks.Mentor 2021-09-17, 14:15: Good morning Owen! I think I would find the rain hard in Prince
Rupert. I spent my first winter in Vancouver last year and found the long stretches of grey, rainy
days quite challenging. My partner and I just moved to the island though! We're in a bit of a rain
shadow in Cumberland, and its got a ski hill close by and lots of forested trails to use too.
Hopefully I can escape into the snow a lot this winter! Do you ski or board at all? The post
secondary question is a hard one, because sometimes I was not enjoying myself. A large part of that
was because I was not taking enough time for self care, and another part was that it was a tough
adjustment and school can be a grind at times! Your self care routine sounds amazing though. I've
just strated using different breathing practises to reduce anxiety and they help a lot! What really
got in the way of self care in my uni experience, was way too much socialization that involved a lot
of alcohol. I stopped having time or feeling up to going on hikes and getting out into nature, which
I've since found out is so important for me. I also did not give myself enough alone time or down
time to be physically/mentally healthy. It can be hard when you move to an area and there's a bunch
of people your own age getting access to a lot of freedom all at once. I just wanted to see everyone
and do everything! Taking the time to get enough sleep, drink enough water, eat healthily and do
what you need to do for school is soooo worth it. That doesn't mean not socializing at all, because
I think a big way I stayed sane in uni was the great people I surrounded myself with. Do you feel
like you know what you need to feel happy and healthy? Do you get recharged through alone time or
socializing? What are some signs in your life that you need to take better care of yourself? For me,
feelings of grogginess and sadness/anxiety or even getting a cold have indicated to me that I need
to be taking care of myself better. In regards to college and university being tougher than high
school, I think that depends on the person and what program you choose. Yes, it's probably going to
be more work, but if you choose to study things you find genuinely interesting and passionate about
(for me, that was wildlife courses, mapping courses, climate change courses, gender studies,
ecology, forestry etc), it feels a lot better than high school. In high school you have limited
choices in what you can take, whereas in post secondary you can really chart your own path. I would
love to help you find some programs that would spark some passion for you! Here are some I thought
you might like from your bio: Selkirk College (go to school in the Kootenays!!! So cool)
https://selkirk.ca/program/rfw University of Northern BC (Prince George is getting a lot nicer these
days!) https://www2.unbc.ca/wildlife-fisheries BCIT (Burnaby is cool if you have a desire to try out
urban living for a while)
https://www.bcit.ca/programs/fish-wildlife-and-recreation-diploma-full-time-7930dipma/ Anyways, take
a look at those when you can! I'm interested to hear your responses from the self care questions.
It's so cool that we're talking about this, because I think I would have been happier in uni if
people told me to prioritize taking care of myself and gave me tips on how to do it. Also, please
let me know if this messaging schedule is working for you! We can always pick a time where we're
both able to chat (for example, a couple nights a week) if you wanted to have more of a quick reply!
Hope you're having a great day, GeorginaMentee 2021-09-20, 16:38: Ya the rain in Rupert is terrible
I havnt seen the sun in about a week. I love skiing so much and cant wait for the hill to open. I
feel like I know what I need to do to be happy and healthy but it is hard sometimes when the normal
in highschool is to go out and drink every weekend. I really enjoy socializing but i also need some
alone time every day. Some signs that I need to take better care of myself is usually when I havnt
left the house all day and am feeling sad or if im hungover or am not getting much sleep. I only
recently discovered breathing practices but im glad I did because they make me feel so good. The
Selkirk college in the kootneys looks so awesome, it looks like such a beautiful place to live. I
will definetly do more research on the course there because its really interesting me. I think Im
all good in this conversation topic if you are, I was thinking we could talk about the entering the
career considerations topic next, because I know i want to get a job in the wilderness but im still
unsure of the options that are out there.Mentor 2021-09-20, 19:00: Me too. I just got new (used)
skis last winter and they're so much better with powder than my old ones. The old ones were from
Ontario where I grew up, and there's next to no powder there. The new skis changed my experience of
skiing in BC entirely! That does sound like a tough weekend routine to change. I struggled with that
in high school and university too. Some of my friends loved to party and go out every weekend. It
was always tempting to be out as much as they were. But I know when I stopped going out as much and
focused on making time for activities that were good for me, I felt so much better. The constant
socializing with alcohol can make you groggy and less motivated to get outside, eat healthy, do well
in school etc. All of those things, at least for me, make me feel proud of myself and happy when I
do them. It also feels a lot better to be fully ""with it"" when doing something you love. Seriously,
if I could go back and tell my younger self that the more time I spent getting good sleeps and going
outside with friends would make me feel happier and healthier, I would. What do you try to do when
you are noticing those signs that you need self care? Do you make plans to ski or do yoga? Do you
have some alone time or take a nap? These will be super important things to remember, because while
post secondary is exciting and an amazing opportunity, there will likely be more stressful times and
you'll have to focus on taking care of yourself well. If you don't mind, please brainstorm how you
hope you'll handle bad mental health signs when/if you're far apart from people you love and know
you very well. And then we can move on to Career Considerations. I'm pumped for that conversation
because I've come across some awesome outdoor jobs in my time. I'm so happy that you are interested
in Selkirk too. I know of someone who went through that program, and they apparently really enjoyed
it. GeorginaMentee 2021-09-21, 15:54: I also just got new skis and they are quite the game changer,
makes it so much more fun. When im noticing I need some self care like when my back hurts or im
sleepy or just sad ill always do yoga. I make time to do yoga everysingle day along with deep
breathing/meditation. Some days even after yoga I still feel off, those are the days i take a bike
ride or hike by myself to get my body moving. I have spent a lot of time by myself, this summer i
worked a full time job and before that I was going to a college for my level 1 electrical in a
different town so I had no friends there and last summer I worked on a tuna boat and was off land
for 50 days. When I have been alone like this I always just work really hard at what im doing and
socialize with the people around me. like when I was at the college I went on hikes everyday, when I
was working electrical I put all my effort into work and when I was tuna fishing I put everything
into helping out on the boat, in all these different experiences in my life I have made lifelong
friends. I am super excited to hear about your outdoor job experiences because I know there is so
much variety out there and want to hear about some of the best parts. OwenMentor 2021-09-22, 11:10:
Good on you for being disciplined and making yoga a priority! It sounds like you know what you need
to do when you start to feel down, and that is such an important knowledge to have at this age. Wow!
I love hearing about your background in work and school. You've had such cool experiences. It is so
important to put your all into something when you choose to do it, and it sounds like you do that!
What was it like being on the ocean for that long?! Did you feel isolated or lonely when you were at
electrical school and didn't know anyone? I just moved to the island and I'm already trying to
volunteer a lot so that I can meet friends hahah. Especially after covid, I can't wait to make new
human connections with different people. Hiking every day sounds amazing. I get out frequently too,
and my dog really makes me stick to a schedule with it! So, I had my first purely outside work
experience this past summer, but I've worked in the environmental field for a while now. This summer
I was back in Williams Lake collecting field data for my masters project. I had to learn how to do a
""field protocol"" which is basically just collecting data to answer a question. Mine was a lot of
counting and measuring sticks and other wood on the ground, and doing a bunch of tree measurements.
It was awesome. I got to hike around forests all day. One opportunity for you may be to apply to a
research assistant position with a university. I had 3 research assistants who came out into the
bush and helped me take the measurements I needed to learn about the wildfire risk in that area! If
you're interested in field season (summer) work of any kind, keep an eye out for job postings from
December - April! It helps a lot if you're currently a student, because lots of work experience only
has funding to hire someone enrolled in post secondary school. That's just one option though. My
boyfriend worked wildfire for 11 years, and during the winters had work with the BC government doing
wildfire rehab, or worked for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans to monitor salmon
populations in the Fraser River. More job opportunities are available through BC Parks, and Parks
Canada. I worked for Ontario Parks a few years ago, and even though I had primarily an office job, I
hiked after work all the time, got to spend days canoeing and doing park maintenance sometimes. It
was awesome to just be in a beautiful park for work. My sister has worked for Parks Canada in Banff,
the Gulf Islands, and now she's up in the North West Territories in the arctic circle. These jobs
could be a great way to get into the field, and help you figure out what where you want to spend
your time. They could all lead to lead term careers, but you'd start at the bottom and that's a
really fun and stress free way of working for those organizations. Tree planting is another job
opportunity you could pursue. I hear it's the best and worst time of my friend's lives haha. You
don't make a tonne of money your first season, but as you get better at it you start making lots and
some people live off what they made during the summer all winter. Same with wildfire. My partner
LOVED wildfire. There was a lot of people around his age with similar interests and great community
there. Does any of that catch your eye? What would you like to hear more about? Also, please check
out the anchor texts for Career Considerations. You can take a quiz that might tell you about what
jobs match up with your interests, and how many of those jobs exist/what they pay. Pumped to hear
back from you! GeorginaMentee 2021-09-22, 17:02: It was awesome being out on the ocean. I was with 2
other guys and they were sweet so it made the experience really enjoyable. I loved it cause you dont
have to worry about everyday problems only boat problems which was really nice. I never really got
lonely at the college just bored sometimes, i made friends in my electrical class which helped a
lot. Meeting different people is great you can really learn a lot from people. That sounds awesome
hiking forests for a project, that would definetly be a cool experience to get a summer job doing
some work in the wild. How does a tree planting career work are you your own boss or do you work for
someone? Working for BC Parks would be neat too also wildfire intersts me quite a bit as well. I did
the career consideration survey and got a lot of agricultural jobs which interest me alot, ive
always wanted to learn how to farm but it would be pretty hard to do it in Prince Rupert, I think it
would be really cool to get an indoor hydroponic farm going, I could probably use my electrical
knowledge for that too. Excited to hear back from you OwenMentor 2021-09-23, 22:56: People really
make the work experience eh? That and location really helps haha. If you're with great people in a
beautiful place, work can be a lot of fun. With tree planting, you're hired onto a crew by a crew
leader working for a company! It's usually a lot of young people and the social aspect keeps people
going. It is really repetitive work and your body really feels it, but you get to go to beautiful,
remote places and plant our future forests! BC Parks hires Junior Rangers for each summer. You could
definitely google how to get involved with that program. They do stuff like trail maintenance,
community outreach, wildlife surveys etc and get out to some spectacular parts of BC for work. Have
you worked on your resume recently? Or practised writing a cover letter? They really help in getting
noticed during a hiring process. Wildfire is a super cool choice. It's hard work and long days, but
you're surrounded by other people your age with similar outdoors interests. Skiing and yoga and
hiking would make you fit in well. It requires a lot of discipline but from the sound of things, you
put your all into whatever work you get. Like I said, my partner loved it. You get out to super
remote areas and up in helicopters, and get to help protect communities. It's great you got
agricultural job suggestions. I know some people get work seasonally with farms and lots of people
enjoy ""woofing."" That's just when you move around from farm to farm living there and working for the
farmers. I have heard there's good opportunities in the southern interior and the island for
woofing. There's a cool sustainable ranching and agriculture degree at Thompson rivers university in
Kamloops. That may also be something to look into. I met a bunch of students from there through my
old job, as they visited SXFN territory to see some grassland stewardship and grazing methods. Would
working with cows interest you? Or is it more crop production? I had to google what hydroponics are.
So cool. Your electrical skills would fit in well just about anywhere in life (such a practical
skill), but for sure if you got involved with a hydroponics operation. I would encourage you to
google stuff like ""hydroponics in BC"" to learn about if and where they're being used. I grew up on a
small hobby farm in Ontario. We had chickens and horses and sometimes kept our friend's cows when he
didn't have room in his pasture. We also hayed one of our fields and had a big veggie garden and
some fruit trees! I would love to have some animals and a big garden again in my adult life. Would
you like me to ask my friends who've tree planted about it more? I can also get some questions
answered about wildfire from my boyfriend. Let me know if you have questions about those or anything
else and I will do my best to help you with them! It's my goal to open up all these path ways as
possibilities for you. No one ever really suggested them as options to me when I was recently out of
high school, and I wish they did so I could have started looking for this type of work earlier! Have
a good night, GeorginaMentor 2021-09-27, 12:20: https://wwoof.ca/hosts/search This is the Wwoof
program that I mentioned! I think people have mixed experiences with whatever farm they're working
with, but fortunately this website rates the farms on how others felt their experience went! There's
lots in BC if you wanted to get into farming. I don't think this is a great way to make money, but
its a great experience and I think farms normally house and feed you in exchange for work.
http://hardcoretreeplanters.com/copy/treeplanting-companies/ This website lists different tree
planting companies in Canada. Also cool to check out! Again, I've heard that its hard to make a lot
of money during your first season, but if you come back anohter year you can make more and more.
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/employment-and-contracts/employment/wildfire-fighters
This website tells you about the application for BCWS or contract fire crews. There are no details
yet about the 2022 season, but work normally starts in March-April and ends in Sept-Oct. There's
lots of overtime and standby pay, so fire fighters usually make a lot of money during a busy season.
I'm sure its less in your first season, but still more than other places of employment! I would
check job postings for 2022 in Dec/Jan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F1SjQmmOUQ&amp;list=PL98F546CAAFA58723&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=ProvinceofBC
https://bcparks.ca/employment/student-ranger/ That youtube video is a promotion for the student
ranger program for BC Parks! They haven't posted 2022 jobs yet, but it looks like applications are
usually due in February before the season. You would have to be a full time student to get these
jobs. Are you still a full time student? Will you be after the 2022 summer? Anyway, you can work all
over the province and they get a bunch of unique work experiences.
https://alis.alberta.ca/junior-forest-rangers/ The government of Alberta also has an incredible
program for 16-18 year olds. They get fire fighting experience, along with forestry experience and
other natural resource type jobs. If you're over 18, there's always the crew leader positions! I
think you'd learn a lot. Also, my best friend is in the Fish, Wildlife and Recreation Program at
BCIT this fall. She's doing the 2 year program, and hoping to work at Parks Canada during the
summer. She really loves it so far. They're learning a bunch of plant ID and get so much time out in
the field. I think later this winter they'll be tagging salmon in the Harrison River. I know I
already mentioned this program to you, but it's super exciting and I thought I'd bring it up
again.Mentee 2021-09-29, 17:47: Hey Georgina, Hydroponics really interest me I dont think I would
want to farm animals i think i would be more into having a garden i wouldnt have to look after full
time and i could grow veggies as a hobbie and if i really enjoy it i could make it a business.
Wildfire sounds awesome I think it is something i would really enjoy and have some amazing
experiences with. This is pretty random but I think it would be sweet to learn how to fly
helicopters for wildfire because I could even use it to get to cool islands or mountains so easily
in a helicopter, I think it would be hard though because I am very colourblind and I heard you need
good eyes. BC parks in terrace were hiring rangers last summer but I wasnt that into it because my
friends didnt want to do it and i believe it was minimum wage and I already had a better job offer.
I did make my resume this summer for my electrical job but I could defiently add some experience on
there now. The fisheries and wildlife course in the kootneys still really intrigues me im just
unsure what job I would want to aim for when I finish the course. The alberta firefighting course
would be sweet just to get some training in that field as a crew leader. I am a full time student
right now but will be working as an electrician full time next summer. BC parks would be pretty fun
I think. Im definelty gonna check out the firefighting contract crews it sounds awesome the
experiences are probably so insane. Did you say your boyfriend use to do wildfire? If so why did he
quit and what did he not like about it. Woofing sounds like something id be very into i bet youd
meet some incredible people and have some awesome experiences. Defiently lots to process here thanks
for all the information though, this is awesome.Mentor 2021-09-29, 18:57: Hey Owen, I hope you're
well. There's a massive storm ripping through the island right now and it's raining/blowing pretty
hard here right now. Growing veggies for sale would be awesome. I don't know much about becoming a
helicopter pilot, but I know it takes a lot of time and money. It's really cool what you can do with
a license though. I'm not sure if your colour blindness would affect your ability to become a pilot.
Definitely worth looking up if you feel passionately about it. Ya, minimum wage kinda sucks. If
you're able to realistically make living on minimum wage work, the experience in Parks would be
awesome. Do you already have a job lined up for this next summer? Or are you just currently planning
on working full time as an electrician next summer? You may want to look at the link for the Selkirk
Fish and Wildlife course. They may have a section on their page about what their grads are doing now
for work! Wildfire is awesome, you should definitely check it out. Great networking for other
natural resources jobs too. So many of you supervisors and colleagues will be working in a bunch of
different fields. My boyfriend fought fire for 11 years! He started while he was still in high
school in Williams Lake. He was on an initial attack crew (a group of 3 that go out and action new
fires ahead of everyone else), and became a crew leader after about 3-4 years being a crew member.
After a few years of being a crew leader, he worked as the supervisor for all of the Cariboo Fire
Centre's initial attack crews for two years. So he was in charge of 13-15 three-person crews. One
year he transferred to the Yukon and ran a First Nation's fire crew near Dawson City, which made him
fall in love with the North and make good connections up there. He loved the community he made with
his coworkers, many of whom are now his closest friends. He loved helping people and working with
fire. A lot of people find the work hours a lot, but he loved it. Sometimes you work 16-17 hour days
during a busy fire season. You make really good money working that much overtime, and sometimes
you're paid just to chill at home in case a fire starts (that's called standby). He would fight fire
during the summers, and then work other natural resources jobs, travel, or go do his undergrad
degree during the winters. His last season was 2019. He quit so he could go get his masters and
become a forester. He's now got his masters and is working for a forestry consultant company on the
island! But, he really misses fire and is even considering taking a leave from his job next summer
to go back and fight fire in the Yukon again. I think the biggest thing he didn't like was never
knowing when/if he would be called away on a fire. It means that you can't plan for much during the
summer. However, he misses the money and the people in fire. let me know if you have more questions!
I have yet again given you a lot of information haha. GeorginaMentee 2021-10-04, 16:03: Hey
Georgina, The weather has been insane, so windy and rainy it sucks. I am planning on working as an
electrician full time this summer, I think I'll work as an electrician for about a year see how I
like it, make some money then explore some of my options. I'll check out the selkirk course page,
its such an intriguing course to me. fighting fires sounds pretty awesome definetly something I
wouldnt mind checking out, Im pretty use to long hours of work fishing too except when I was fishing
I barely made any money, so anything would be better then that. Thanks for all this information
Georgina it is a lot to think about. I am not too sure which conversation topic to do next hahha
maby the urban to rural oneMentor 2021-10-04, 17:02: That sounds like a great plan! All the best to
you in the electrical field next summer. Hopefully the other options get you thinking about what you
could pursue in the future. Yes, lets do rural to urban! I have unlocked it now. We're supposed to
start by you telling me: Three things you like about living in a rural area. For each, explain why
you like it. Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. One question you
have about living or moving to the city Looking forward to hearing from you, GeorginaMentee
2021-10-12, 15:30: I like living in a Rural area because everyone knows everyone which makes it feel
like a big family, it is impossible to get lost so you can walk everywhere and we are surronded by
nature which is awesom, I would hate to be stuck in a big city away from wildlife. One thing I dont
like is how far we are from big cities like kamloops and vancouver because everytime our rugby team
goes on trips we have to travel 15 hours just to play 1 game of rugby, its pretty silly. Also I dont
like how we dont have any fun hangout spots in our town so there isnt much to do in our town. One
question I have about moving too a big city is how do you find a place to stay and make friends
there? OwenMentee 2021-10-12, 16:54: Hi you two! Please click on ""From rural to urban"" on the
navigation wheel above to view the anchor text for this Conversation. Then you can use the 'send
message' box on that page to have your discussion. Let us know if you have any questions about this!
Thanks, ManagementMentor 2021-10-12, 21:08: Sounds great! I'll see you in the Rural to Urban
conversation, Owen!",,,,"Mentee 2021-10-13, 17:18: I think the director of that video was trying to show that living in the
country you are more on your own and have to do everything yourself and you work for yourself doing
things that benefit your situation, when you live in a city you rely on government and society for
everything and you have to work for someone else in most cases doing a job that doesnt give you any
skills or benefit you in any way. The images in the film made me think of how much worse living in a
city is and how living in the wilderness is how we were made to live and got me thinking about how
life in a city is not even that real compared to the realness of catching your own food and building
tools and transportation devices. I felt kinda sad watching this video because the filmaker showed
people living life in the wild like we were made to do, then he cut to people working dangerous jobs
for coorporations making me sorta sad at how different those to lifestyles are. My emotional
response matches how im feeling about going to a post secondary because if i do happen to go to a
college or university its gonna be right next to some wildlife and nature. OwenMentor 2021-10-13,
20:49: Wow, I love hearing your thoughts on this! I agree, I think this video makes life in rural
areas look a lot more fulfilling and exciting. And I think that is how I feel in real life too haha.
However, I do think that life in the city has its perks. There's usually a lot more young people,
and a lot more to do. There's great food choices, and sometimes you get more access to art and
theatre and other forms of culture and entertainment. I also personally love to go out dancing and
there are way more places to do that in a city than in a rural area hahah. Even if you know the city
is not somewhere you want to end up long term, it could be cool to move to one and give that a
chance for a little while. I think it's important to try new things when you're in this phase of
life. I really loved your point about how much more reliant you are on society in an urban setting.
That's so interesting and I've never thought about it like that. I think we need community wherever
we go, but you're right. There's a lot more formal, government created systems to make living with
so many other people work well. I will say that I disagree about ""doing a job that doesn't give you
any skills or benefits you in any way."" Maybe the skills are different in a lot of city jobs, but
there's still food production, carpentry, metal working, and a lot more socially based jobs that
would benefit you and a lot of other people! I think what's cool about living around so many other
people is that you're kinda forced to learn to communicate well and be understanding and kind. Those
are important skills to have, throughout pretty much every aspect of life. I hear ya though, I was
out of Vancouver as soon as I could be. Covid made our time pretty rough there. Pretty much all the
benefits of being around so many other people ceased to exist when trying not to be around so much
other people haha. I think there's lots of cities in BC that have a wildland urban interface. That
means they have wilderness just outside of city borders. I think a place like Kamloops has a lot of
important ammenities, but you can still escape for the outdoors easily. That's a happy medium I
think. Even though most post secondary schools are in a larger city, some cities may be way more up
your alley than others.Mentor 2021-10-13, 20:53: How do you feel about moving away from home and
family? Are you nervous, excited? What are you most excited about? What are you most worried
about?Mentee 2021-10-18, 17:25: I am excited to move away from home and kinda sad to be leaving
friends and family. Im excited because I am gonna move somewhere sunny and i havnt seen the sun in
ages, I am also excited because it will be full of new experiences. Im probably most excited for the
people I will meet and fun experiences we will have. I'd probably say im most worried about not
meeting awesome people and missing my friends and family from home. I'd also be worried about
failing whatever it is I am there to do.Mentor 2021-10-18, 19:08: I laughed out loud at your ""I
haven't seen the sun in ages"" comment, but then felt bad because it sounds like the rain in Prince
Rupert is no joke. When was the last time you had to meet new people? What's your go-to strategy for
breaking the ice and trying to become someone's friend? I missed family and friends too, but found
that we picked up right where we left off whenever I'd see them again. I'm sure it will be the same
for you!Mentor 2021-10-18, 19:09: I laughed out loud at your ""I haven't seen the sun in ages""

2021-10-19, 17:17: hahahah ya the rain here is so annoying especially because of how much I love the
sun, I always feel so good after being in the sun I even sleep better. The last time I had to meet
people was for my job as an electrician and I had to meet all the people on the job site and they
were all mostly awesome people and we got along well. Usually when I meet someone i shake there hand
and introduce myself, that is usually a pretty good icebreaker because I find its super akward if
you meet someone withought it being formal or acknowledged that you've never met them before. I also
like joking around with people I find that helps alot to start a friendship. Im really hoping
wherever I go there are people that are nice and have similar interests as me.Mentor 2021-10-19,
19:55: It sounds like you know how to break the ice well and connect with new people. I definitely
recommend pursuing education that is related to the outdoors if you want to meet like-minded people.
If you have to move before doing that though, joining hiking or climbing clubs, or ecological
restoration organizations could be another way to meet those people! Do you think we have anything
else to go over for this module? Or do you want to move on to another? GeorginaMentee 2021-10-20,
16:01: Oh ya I feel like if I pursue something I am even kind of interested in their will be someone
with similar intersts. A hiking club would be sweet Ive never even thought about that. I think I am
all good on this topic and think we could move on to the next, I was thinking maby we could do the
entering the job market conversation.","Mentor 2021-10-28, 19:11: Hey Owen, What did you think of that video? Frankly, I think it was not
really geared towards the work that you and I are interested in... Some of those tips are of course
important, but I think you have to adapt your ""vibe"" and outfit choices based on the type of work
you're applying for. I'm usually quite nervous for interviews, but I always try to look at the job
ad's requirements and the duties of the job in order to prepare my responses. One time, I brought a
little portfolio of mapping projects I had done for a mapping job with the government. That went
over really well! I think job interviewers also really like if you have questions for them about the
position, and like the video said, examples of applicable skills from other experiences. How do you
think you do at interviews? Have you had many?Mentee 2021-11-01, 15:37: Hey Georgina, I thought that
video was okay it did point out a lot of obvious points about what not to do like ""Dont be rude"" was
a pretty basic one. I definetly agree with most of the points but I agree you have to adjust the
vibe to whoever your talking to and whatever type of work your doing. I actually have never really
done an interview except for the interview to get into my level 1 electrical, I wasnt nervous
because I personally knew the interviewer. I brought questions to ask to look proffesional and i
told them about my past experiences working, it seemed to go well.Mentor 2021-11-01, 23:28: That
sounds like a pretty chill interview that you were well prepared for! Do you have any other
questions about the interview process, or getting a job? I can recommend that job sites like
WorkCabin, Indeed, or GoodWork are good places to find environmental jobs! I sign up for email
alerts for job ads that are entry level environmental for all of BC. Indeed is where I found my last
job near Williams Lake!Mentor 2021-11-09, 19:40: Hey Owen! Just found out that the ementoring is
ending this week. Thank you so much for coming into this with so many questions. You made my role
really interesting and exciting! I especially hope that you keep that program at Selkirk College in
mind after you're done your electrical job. I think you'd love it and you'd meet a bunch of
likeminded people. I hear it's especially sunny in the southeast too hahah, so a chance to leave the
rainy coast for a while! Hopefully we get to touch base before Friday, but if not, all the best to
you! I know you have the skills to pursue anything you set your mind to. Georgina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

splitting the cost for things like text booksMentor 2021-10-04, 21:07: Ya that made a big difference
for me! Also just waiting until after syllabus week to buy textbooks... a lot of times profs will
say that a textbook is mandatory in the syllabus but it will turn out to be optional. In my first

priority! What is your experience with self-care like? Do you think it will be affected by going to
university next year?Mentee 2021-10-15, 00:09: Self care is definitely something that is easily
forgotten especially with me because I have such a busy schedule. But I definitely find ways to fit
it in whether that be getting a massage (I have arthritis), or going for a walk or hike or even just
taking a few moments too myself. And I'm pretty sure next year it may be difficult to make time for
self care but I'm sure I'll figure it out, it just may look a little different than it does
nowMentor 2021-10-15, 18:45: Nice! I definitely find hiking to be a form of self care as well. I had
kind of an interesting experience with self care in my first year of university... at the beginning
of first year, I didn't know anyone yet and was hard on myself for not making friends super quickly.
At that point, self care was really about giving myself grace and realizing that relationships take
time to form. Later on in university when I found a good group of friends, my definition of self
care changed and it became more about taking time for myself and knowing that it was okay if I
didn't go to every social event. I've really come to appreciate that self care looks different for
everyone and can change in different phases of life! It sounds like you already have a good grasp on
self care and the fact that it can change - I'm sure you will adjust well to university!Mentee
2021-10-16, 15:18: Mentee 2021-10-16, 15:21: Yeah that makes so much sense. I feel like (well from
what heard) making friends after high school is so different then trying to meet people and form
relationships in high schoolMentor 2021-10-17, 20:13: Yes there are definitely some differences! But
everyone's in the same boat : ) Is there anything you've been wondering about the transition from
high school to university?Mentee 2021-10-18, 16:53: I was kind of curious as to what it was like not
going to school with the same people youve grown up with. Also what was it like having to to be
independant and not having to rely on family like you would be used to.Mentor 2021-10-20, 01:03: It
was definitely an adjustment moving out and being with a whole new group of people! I didn't know
anyone going to UBC Okanagan from my graduating class in high school so I was really nervous about
that at first. To be completely honest, first semester of my first year was challenging because I
felt pretty lonely and missed my friends from high school. When I looked around, it felt like
everyone else already had friends and it was intimidating. Now that I'm in fourth year, I know that
so many people felt the exact same way I did at the beginning of first year. I think there can be a
lot of expectation put on the 'university experience' and sometimes that makes it worse when things
aren't super fun and social. There are definitely some people that make meaningful friendships early
on in university, but just know that it's totally normal and okay if it takes time to make friends!
Those relationships will happen - you just have to be patient! And if you miss friends from home,
make sure you reach out to them : ) Living independently was (and is) very different from living at
home, but I really enjoy the independence! I'm not sure if you are planning to live on or off campus
for your first year, but I found living in residence was a really smooth transition from living at
home. I lived on campus for first year and then moved off campus second year, which I think was a
good decision.Mentee 2021-10-20, 23:22: That's actually super relieving to hear! And yeah I think
I'm planning on staying in dorms post secondaryMentor 2021-10-22, 18:52: Yeah I think that's a good

talk about an idea. It made me think how sometimes as a student can feel overwhelmed or crushed by
all the expectations of school and even sometimes crushed by comments from friends. But even though
the can is crushed it still has worth because you can take it to the recycling depot and get 10
cents. When we are down sometimes, we are still special and mean a lot to our family and friends. I
think that is important to remember. What did this video make you think about and what do you think
about my comment? Have a great day :) -IsabelaMentee 2021-10-20, 08:40: hi isabela, yes it was

they used some pictures to base off some of the things to be said the video. i also like what

makes me think why some of those things don't have anwsers to why they are here or how it was

to his message because of what has happened recently in Kamloops. It was shock and disturbing to
learn that the bones of children were found buried. It just brought into focus for everybody the
reminder of how colonialism impacted and devestated a culture and its people. Just like the video
showed, you can live on a land and not know the truth about the history of that land. I can see how
Science and tradition are in conflict. Science is based on fact, numbers and its so technical
whereas tradition is all about emotions and the history of actions and behaviors and beliefs. They
don't jive together. I have an example. My moms friend gave her the bark of a tree to boil and make
a tea. It was to soothe her coughing. Science would say take cough syrup but it didn't help my mom.
The tea stopped her coughing after one day. Her friends culture believes in using nature for
healing. What do you think? Do you know where using nature heals a person? When you watch the video
maybe you have a question for me? Have a great day, we will chat soon :) -IsabelaMentee 2021-11-08,
01:01: hi isabela There's so much history about the land we live on. I love getting knowing more
about all the history of the past. It was very saddening to hear about all the bones of the children
that went to residential school were found. I couldn't imagine how all of those families of those
children that were found felt. My great grandma went to residential school. I don't know much about
her story because it's a very senstive topic for her. My great grandpa also went too, he is very
open about his story with the people he knows but also very senstive for him also when he tells his
story. I think using nature as healing is a great idea. All natural things are better for you and
your body. I honestly would love to go and harvest for my own medicine it would be a great
experience on getting to know more about what in nature you could use as a medicine. you have a

anxious all the time about performing. For one course, I almost quit right away, but I had support
from friends and family encouraging me and so I kept at it. And was I ever glad! The musical
performance I had to do in front of the class showed me that I could achieve anything if I put my
mind to it. I got lots of compliments about that performance and it boosted my confidence in myself.
How are you finding your courses?Mentee 2021-10-08, 16:28: hey isabela i wrote you kind of a long
response but the wifi at the school is super slow lolMentee 2021-10-08, 17:15: hi isabela thats
great to hear that you got accepted into that , onto new beginnings. i've been kind of struggling
lately with school and other things at the moment thats why i havent replied to anything i wasn't at
school for the past couple weeks. im trying best to come back to school more. my courses are sewing
and careers. in sewing im almost done this hoodie im making just need to add a few things to it so
its done. careers isn't my favorite i haven't really done a lot in that class. sorry for the late
reply i will try answer more often :)Mentor 2021-10-18, 13:11: Hi Kendra, so sorry to hear that you
are struggling. When I have been down about school, I have always been told to hang in there, that
it will help me get a better job. So I pass onto you, ! Hang in there! Thanks for sharing. I hope to
hear from you soon that you are ready to take part in this course. -IsabelaMentee 2021-10-18, 17:18:

Every summer I would go to the lake and I loved it because it was a very peaceful place. The woods
were across the cabin property and I could walk through the paths for an hour and not hear any city
sounds. I loved it because it was a quiet place for me to relax and to forget any worries I was
thinking. 2. Second Picture- Dog

Another comfort for me and a way for me to relax is to spend time with my puppy. The thing I love
about a pet is she loves me unconditionally. If I am feeling lonely or kind of down, she is right
there to give me cuddles. It is amazing what a great feeling that gives me. 3. Third Picture- Hiking

Sometimes I like to go for a hike behind the property where I am living. I love the fresh air, the
smell of the trees, and the tranquillity of being in the woods. I like to walk at a quick pace
because the exercise takes any kind of tightness out of my body. At the end of the hike, I feel more
rejuvenated. How about you go on google and find three pictures that interest you? Tell me what they
make you think of? -IsabelaMentee 2021-10-27, 20:53: first picture- trail in the woods

this picture reminds of when i was younger my friends and I were about to go into the woods to play
manhunt and tag. at the entrance of the trail on the ground was this big slug it was as big as a
small watermelon. I didn't notice this slug at first becuase I wasn't looking down but one of my
friends screamed at me to watch out. i turned back to ask her why and she just said look down and i
did there was a big slug i screamed so loud. that was probably the grossest thing ever second

This reminds of all the times driving home to see my family or for family things. The drive up is so
beautiful I love the scenery and how calm it is. It's honestly my place where I go to recharge from
everything and where I go to find myself again. The last time I was there was at the end of august,
I don't think I'll be going up till christmas next. third picture- nature walks

I picked this picture becuse it makes me think of all the walks my friend and I take everyday. Most
of the time we don't know where we are going to walk and we remember all places we used to play by
as kid so we'd go there and remember all the things we used to do there as kid. We also try find new
places to walk because we don't like walking in the same place we did before. We're always on a new
adventure each day.Mentor 2021-11-03, 19:01: Hi Kendra! Nature is always a great place to reconnect

begin it with this quote by Mina Shum: “I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in
creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you
bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” This
definitely resonates with me because I like to list and plan out my goals on a piece of paper. By
writing them down often, it motivates me even further to pursue my goals. I definitely believe we
have an underlying intention/motivation with everything we do in life. For example, what is your
intention with attending school? Thanks, Aziz",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2021-09-14, 16:16: HiMentor 2021-09-15, 21:04: Hi Jon, Great to hear from you! My name is

character."" This quote has really helped me push through some tough times in life. I am sure you've
also had some tough experiences in life where something hadn't gone how you wished it did. It's very
important to not allow any challenges or unsuccesses from stopping you to move forwards. When we
fail or experience a difficult challenge, that is when we learn the most in life, so take it as a
learning opportunity and move forwards :) Hope to hear from you soon, AzizMentee 2021-09-16, 17:20:

Sorry we kind've have to rush through these last few conversations. What inpsires you about what
your schooling? Do you work any jobs now? What insipres you there?Mentor 2021-11-03, 15:54: I work
part-time in a lab, but it's not that inspiring... Ultimately the things I work on will (hopefully)
end up improving quality of life for people. For example, in the final year of engineering, you get
to do a ""capstone project"". A capstone is where a company comes to us and asks us to design
something- my group is working on quality control for a type-1 diabetes cure. We are working on a
very small part of a massive project. It's not flashy. But it's inspiring, because I know we are
uniquely suited to do the project, and it might end up improving a lot of lives. That being said,
inspiration doesn't always have to have a ""life-saving motivation"" behind it. I get inspired when I
know I can use my unique skills or experience to provide something people appreciate &amp; respect.
For example- maybe you are a clear communicator, and calm under pressure. Being a pilot might be
inspiring because you know you can apply your unique skills to being an incredible pilot.
Essentially- think about the things that make you special. Find a niche where you can use those
skills to excel.Mentor 2021-11-03, 16:15: Okay I'll try to explain that a little more clearly: For
me- and probably for you as well- there's no one specific thing I find inspiring. What's inspiring
is working in a place where you feel like you specifically are making a difference. The best way to
truly feel like you are making a difference is to work in a job that you feel uniquely suits you. A
job that you are, or feel you could eventually be good at. If you feel like absolutely anyone could
do your job just as well as you, you probably won't find the job inspiring. Does that make
sense?Mentor 2021-11-05, 01:04: Let me know what topic you want to do last, I'll open it up right
away! EricMentee 2021-11-05, 16:10: Maybe let's do general discussion so we can talk about whatever
in there for the last weekMentee 2021-11-05, 16:12: and yes, makes sense","Mentee 2021-09-20, 16:07: Hey Eric, Did the quizzes in the anchor text. Reccomendations are all over
the place. Lots of ""contractor or supervisor"". I do enjoy managing people and organizing the work.
But sometimes thats stressful. I'm thinking just get my helicopter pilots licence out of highschool,
because that doesnt require university degree, same with going into trades. But law has always
interested me aswell. Lawyer or police officer. So many options...Mentor 2021-09-23, 02:46: Hey
Issac, In a way it's a good thing that you have lots of career recommendations. I was the same way.
It means that a) you have lots of skills, because you're smart, and b) you have leadership skills-
every sort of career needs a leader in some way. The best bet to make is on yourself; if you work
hard, and be persistent, eventually you will succeed. You should never feel bad about not knowing
exactly what you want to do coming out of high school. It's almost impossible to know without
trying. Sometimes it feels like you're throwing a dart at the board and hoping it sticks, somewhere
close to the centre. Some questions for you: 1) Are there classes you really like, or are good at in
school? If you go to university, you'll have to spend a lot of time studying, so it's important you
like some of the classes. For example, going to law requires a) 4 years of school and b) doing well
in classes 2) Where do you want to live when you're older?Mentee 2021-09-23, 15:32: Hey Eric, After
I'm done highschool my parents and I plan on buying a house with my parents on Vancouver Island, and
will live with them for awhile. Most likely take a gap year if I'm going to university but if i get
my pilots licence I'll go straight to that. I'm naturally really good at math, but I don't
necessarily enjoy it. Law 12 was porbably one of my favourite classes. English is okay too. I'd like
to get my helicopter licence, or maybe even just a pilots licence, because its just such a unique
skill and you can take it anywhere, plus great starting wages. Then I hope to just save all my money
and invest in stocks and real estate, or crypto.Mentor 2021-09-26, 23:34: Hey Issac, Funny you say
that about math- I'm also the same way (I'll do it, but only because I know it's useful). Just
wondering in terms of university, what average are you applying with ( from grade 11)? Vancouver
Island is super nice if you haven't been before? Where on the island are you headed? Are your
parents getting new jobs there? I've heard there is a lot of competition for heli jobs, and much
more opportunity in fixed-wing. Have you researched the job options coming out of a pilot licence
versus heli licence program? Be careful about investing your money in crypto. It's extremely risky.
For every person that succeeds, there are swathes of other people who fail, and you never hear about
them. You have much better odds by putting a small portion of your money - say 10-15% each month-
into something like an S&amp;P 500 index. These grow better than the vast majority of actively
managed mutual funds, which are done by professionals. Side note: if you are interested in
engineering, I can tell you a lot about that. Most engineering degrees have something called co-op,
where you alternate school and work terms. You can offset a significant portion of your tuition
during your work terms, and also line up a job after graduation.Mentee 2021-09-29, 17:07: Hey, In
math I'm usually an A average. We are planning on going to Campbell River, for the sole reason is
that its closer to the ski hill than Victoria... I was down their for a month during the summer. My
dad does offshore drilling, so it doesnt matter where he lives. He just will travel to where ever
they need him for 4 weeks. My mom is a drug and alcohol counselor, so she says she already has a job
lined up. There is a helicopter training base in Campbell River, but yeah I've been looking at fixed
wing and the pay seems better. But I think helicopter would be much more interesting, especially
flying for coast guard. Yeah I know crypto is risky, still very new to a lot of people. But my mom
always says dont pu all your eggs in one basket. I invest in more stocks and only do a small chunk
of my money in crypto. Bitcoins growth over the last 2 years is over 900%, compared to the SPY,
which is 18% in the last 3 years. But yes you are right. Much more volatile and you buy at the wrong
time you can lose a lot of money. My dad and I bought some a few years ago, and just slowly have
been building our portfolio. Anyways, I think a trade would be cool too. I'm just looking to find a
high paying job with minimal effort then just save and invest. Like pilots licence usually only
takes a few months to get and is usually like 10k. What do you mean about the engineering?
IssacMentor 2021-10-02, 15:27: Hey Issac, That's super close to Mt. Washington! Check out Moat Lake,
I hear it has some good cliff jumping &amp; skiing if you're into that. Are there any pilots you
know that you could talk to? Getting your license would be a big commitment, and you want to make
sure it's something you're interested in, and that you won't get bored down the line. I mentioned
engineering in case it's something you're interested in. If you are thinking about heading to
university, the best strategy is to find a school with a""co-op program"". A co-op is like a paid
internship for a university student. Co-op programs alternate study terms with work terms. Lots of
different degrees have co-op, including engineering, business and computer science. The co-op office
will help connect you with employers and provide access to different jobs through their portal (
though it's still up to you to get a job). There's a few advantages to being in a co-op program: 1)
It helps you offset the cost of university. For example, at UBC, the average co-op wage is about
$3,000. After 16 months of co-op, you'll have $48,000, all made while working in a relevant field.
This helps offset the cost of tuition, which might be ~ 7,000 a year 2) It helps you figure out what
you are interested in. You can take a few different jobs at different companies. 3) Lots of co-op
employers will often hire students they have worked with full time after graduation.Mentee
2021-10-04, 15:33: Hey, My dad is really close friends with a helicopter pilot. I wish there was a
way to try flying before having to just go straight for my licence. Yeah if I dont go for my
licence, I'd just like to get into a trade and save money. I hope to get my real estate licence
aswell. Lots of opportunity in the housing market. But regardless of my career I still plan on going
to get my real estate licence. And if none of that works out law has always intrested me. I'm just
having a hard time narrowing it down to what I want to do. Maybe if I started trying things out it
could help me make up my mind. Not sure how to try them though without actually having the necassary
requirements.Mentor 2021-10-08, 02:56: Hey Issac, Sorry for the late reply here. You're totally
right- it's hard to know these things without trying. Definitely sit down with your dad's friend. He
is a gold mine of information &amp; lessons that take a lifetime to learn. Ask him what his
day-to-day is like. Ask him how much time off he gets, and if he can balance his hobbies. If you
want to be a pilot, go for it!! Do what makes you happy. If you're stuck doing something miserable,
you'll lose the energy to get out and practice your hobbies. You might not choose the right path off
the get-go. That's okay. You have to come to terms with that. When you are young its a good time to
take risks- you don't have any dependents, mortgages, or a spouse. Ultimately a university route is
a lot of work, and you have to fully want and commit to being there, working hard &amp; getting
internships to make it worth it. I would recommend applying to like one or two programs at Uvic,
just in case you change your mind in the spring. The deadline is January 31st. It will cost some
money, but I know people who didn't apply and then changed their minds later in the school year, and
it was too late. I think you're a smart kid and if you work hard you'll be successful in whatever
discipline you choose. Keep your head up and keep learning all the time. Learn at your job- about
your own role, and what other people do. You never know when it will come in handy. Dedicate time in
your day to read, or take a course about something you want to learn or are passionate about. On
another note: in an online world, it has never been easier to re-tool yourself towards a new career.
You could enroll in an online university at some point if you chose to, or take online courses at
something like https://www.edx.org/school/mitxMentee 2021-10-12, 15:27: Yeah no worries, I'll look
into some courses maybe and get in contact with my dads buddy. Should we move on to another
conversation?Mentor 2021-10-13, 15:31: Mentor 2021-10-13, 15:32: Sure- your pick!Mentee 2021-10-13,
16:42: Maybe let's try well being and self care. And before we move on could you tell me more about
these co-op programs for engineering? I've been looking into it lately and I think it may be an area
of interest. Only yhing I'm worried about is if i enter the program but then find i have no intrest
in the field.",,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-11-05, 18:03: Opening up the topic for general discussion. Feel free to ask anything
else on your mind- nagging questions about career paths/post secondary. Or other questions I feel
like you had asked me something about engineering co-op before? Were you still curious about that?",,"Mentor 2021-10-17, 00:09: Okay I've opened the ""Well being and self care"" section up, let me know if
that worked.Mentee 2021-10-18, 16:59: It worked, what do you do for well being and self care?
Probably very stressful having to study such a complex topic.Mentor 2021-10-20, 20:08: Mentor
2021-10-20, 20:20: Hey Issac, Funny this topic came up considering I have all my midterms this
week.. Here's a few things I do for self-care: 1. Always aim for excellence, not perfection. Trying
to be perfect is stressful; just aim to be really good at what you do, accepting that you may
occasionally make mistakes. 2. Exercise! If I have something to get done, sometimes I'll exercise
right before, and then go straight to doing that thing ( no phone, etc in between. I find this to be
pretty effective. 3. It's important to set aside times to do things that make you happy. When you
have a rough week, you need something to look forwards to. For me, that's usually sports or skiing.
4. Macro patience, micro speed. This means in the long term, ""big / macro"" view, you have to be
patient. For example, if your goal is to get a specific job, amount of money, etc, you need to
accept these big goals take years to achieve. Be patient in the long term, and don't be too hard on
yourself. In the short term, ""micro"", try and do things quickly. Keep moving and learning. Things
like tasks, a class, or some sort of side hustle: work fast, but don't expect long-term success to
come right away. What are the trickiest parts of self-care for you?Mentee 2021-10-28, 15:44: I work
out and play rugby which always help with stress management. but sometimes ill get super stressed at
night and dont really have anyhting to help with it. Sometimes playing video games helps P.S. we
have to finish 2 more conversations by the end of the week of Nov 8Mentor 2021-10-30, 22:25: Hey
Issac, No worries we will finish the conversations by next week. One last question for this one-
what kind of things get you stressed at night? Sometimes when I'm stressed at night I'll try not to
browse my social media within 30 min of going to sleep. It helps wind my down &amp; slows down my
thinkingMentor 2021-10-30, 22:38: You can open up the next topic you're interested in too EricMentee
2021-11-01, 15:38: At night I tend to think more because its quiet and im usually alone, so thinking
about the future and projects in school and such can stress me out. Let's move on to Finding
Inspiration?",,"Mentee 2021-09-14, 16:41: Hey Eric, I'm Issac, bioengineering, wow. Sounds like alot of work. I dont
think I could do that. What do you enjoy about it? I'm happy to hear that your into outdoor
activities. My dad got me into all of that too, but skiing is definetly my favourite. Are you into
stocks or investing? I'm looking foward to getting to know you. I'm thinking we start with career
considerations.Mentor 2021-09-14, 22:49: Hey Issac, Looks like we got lots in common, I'm glad we
matched up. I always liked to argue with people as well (I'd often spend my whole lunch hour doing
so with friends). My brother is in law, and I have a friend who works in the coastguard, so I can
tell you about both those paths! Bioengineering was a lot of work but it's finally getting a little
easier now! I like studying it because it's pretty broad, and I'm interested in a lot of different
subjects. Things in the field are always changing- kind of like the stock market- so it stays
exciting. I follow a few stocks in biotech. I usually put my savings into something similar to an
index fund- over time, even some of the best analysts struggle to beat the S&amp;P 500. Funnily
enough, when I was in 8th grade ( 2012) we had a class with a stock simulator. I put all my money
into Amazon and Google - too bad it was fake, because I would have had enormous returns... Two
questions for you: 1) Do you ski at Shames? I've always imagined it to be super deep up there... I
just started to get into ski touring and feel like it would be a cool zone to check out someday. 2)
Are you thinking about heading to university next year? Have you looked at any business
programs?Mentee 2021-09-15, 15:36: Yeah I ski at Shames, super awesome conditions here. Last year we
had a day where they had got a meter of snow the night prior. It was knee deep on the groomers. I've
been looking to get into touring, but still trying to obtain all the gear. Got some nice powder skis
last year though. Where do you ski? Personally I don't think ill be going to university. I don't
feel I could commit to school and don't want to get straight out of highschool and end up with a ton
of debt. I feel like I could just invest the money instead. Im looking to get my helicopter licence
or pilot licence though so I can get a decent job and build up my savings and investment portfolio.
I'd love to fly for the coastguard but I don't think they'll hire just anyone. What companies are
you following in the stock market?Mentor 2021-09-18, 14:45: Hey Issac, I mostly ski at Whistler! The
resort has changed a lot in the past 15 years and sadly become pretty busy- some of the lines during
COVID were are few kilometres long... I've just been following two stocks at the moment: Moderna and
Abcellera. As for considering university, your ""return on investment"" depends on a lot of different
factors, such as the field of study, where you study, scholarships/loans, &amp; if you are working
in between your school terms. We can get into all that in our later conversations. I just opened up
a conversation on career considerations, so we can get started on that conversation! Have a good
weekend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the achor text 1 (called ""Resumé Skills for High School Students"") provided some great examples of
transferable skills you can put on your resume. Most (if not, all) employers look for employees who
are depenable, able to work in a team environment and have good communication skills. The article
also mentions being a quick learner (aka being adaptable) and having technical skills. Putting
specific examples of each of these skills on your resume will absolutely help strengthen it! If you
don't mind sharing, could you provide some examples in your experiences where you demonstrated or
built one or more of those skills? Also, I noticed that this module has a resume building extension

doing the ""Wrapping up"" module by the end of the day Friday (the 12th). Of course, I don't want you
to rush with this job module...but I also think that we won't have enough time to fully complete it!
So, I think that instead of going through a resume building exercise together step-by-step, I can
help answer any (general or specifc) questions you may have about entering the job market (about
making resumes, appying for a job etc.)! How does that sound? Also, if you have a lot of questions,
feel free to put them all in one long message (I don't mind), and I'll try my best to answer them
all with detail :D Janaki",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-21, 21:13: Hello Eden! I hope your week is off to a great start :D I am SO happy that
you had such a meaninful and peaceful experience the day you spread your Papa's ashes, and that you
are feeling better mentally!! I would love to provide you some coping resources:
https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/ &lt;-- this is a great starter website when searching for specific
resources, I also think https://youthspace.ca/youthspace-resources/ has a great section on self-care
and coping tools :) I find myself going to that section once in a while when I'm feeling a little
lost! Even though these resources are great way to starting learning how to cope, I also encourage
you to reach out to a trusted adult and/or friend in your life. From personal experience, I can
understand how hard (and sometimes embarassing!) reaching out may seem, but I find that even having
a simple and small conversation can start to help a lot :) I have opened for us the wellbeing and
self-care model, and I think it would be a great idea to discuss the anchor video first! I think he
made some great points about self-care as being something we should consider as a basic part of our
life. As I have gotten older, I have realized the importance of taking care of myself because if I
don't, it seems that the responsibilites just keep piling on and I don't have enough time in my life
to enjoy it. How easy (or hard) has it been for you to prioritize self-care in your life? I find
that it is much easier for me to do self-care if I first make sure I have the basics covered (such
as sleeping, eating healthy, exercising etc.). How good are you (if you don't mind me asking) at
making sure you are covering these basics? JanakiMentor 2021-09-28, 19:08: Hi Eden! I hope you have
been enjoying the cooler temperatures :) I haven't heard from you in a while and I miss our chats!
It's been great learning fun facts about each other, and starting on the conversation modules! I
have lots of fun talking to you and hope you do as well :P I am here if you need to talk...I know
sometimes it can get really overwhelming balancing school with other things going on in life. I
wanted to check-in and ask how you are doing? JanakiMentee 2021-09-29, 17:27: Hi Janaki! I'm so
sorry I've been really preoccupied with personal issues and keeping up with in person and online
school that I've struggled to finish. I'm doing decent mentally, I didn't go to school on Monday as
one of my online friends had said that they wanted to off themselves so instead of going to school
and stressing about her I decided to stay home, help my mum, and wait for them to answer back.
Thankfully, they did answer and they're alive but I've been so busy I struggle to answer her. I've
been off the internet a lot since school started which stresses me out because I want to hang out
with my friends online and relax but I'm busy all day and then i get tired early but one day I'll
balance school and fun. In reference to your earlier questions in bold; It has been really hard to
prioritize self care for me as I've got such a busy life and as soon as im done i need to sleep, I'm
good at sleeping most days but all the other things I definitely struggle with seeing as I have a
bad habit of randomly overeating if i feel something too strongly and I don't get out to exercise
because I have much to do and little time. I would love to get more healthy both physically and in
the way I eat because i hate not being able to fit certain sizes and stuff. I hope you've had a good
week so far :} I will be home from school all week next week so I don't know how much I'll be able
to message and stuff but I will try. Thanks, EdenMentor 2021-09-29, 18:22: Hey Eden! Thank you so
much for responding, but please don’t feel like you need to apologize or feel bad about not getting
back to me immediately. I completely empathize with everything that you are going through with
school, and relationships with your friends and family. I am SO glad to hear your friend is okay,
and I am very sorry you had to go through something so scary. I hope your friend is able to get the
help they need from an adult they trust, and that you are feeling a bit better. Have you talked to
your Mom or another adult you feel safe talking to about how this experience has made you feel?
https://kidshelpphone.ca/ and https://www.crisistextline.ca/ &lt;-- these links are great if you are
need to talk with somebody else anonymously. (I am also here for you too!) :)
___________________________________________________________________ I am happy that you identified
some things you want to work on to take better care for yourself! Staying physically healthy and
having a good sleep schedule are great ways to start on your journey to self-care, (even though most
days it can feel like a chore you have to do on an already busy day 🙃). The Youthspace link I sent
in my last message also has great resources dealing with sleeping and eating issues (and so does
https://kidshelpphone.ca/) I really want you to feel better about eating, exercising, and getting a
good sleep schedule going—however, I feel that I am a bit unqualified to give you specific tips (I
will still do my very best to help as we continue this conversation though 😊), but I can definitely
try and find someone who may be able to help better, if you would like! Please, don’t hesitate to
let me know :P I think it would be great if we talked a bit more about your study schedule, it seems
that it may be a big part of what is causing you stress. (if that is okay with you--we can also talk
about other self-care topics if you are more interested in that!) I think it would be great if
before we finished this module, we can sort of figure out a loose/flexible schedule for you, and/or
work on some time management skills, so you can have more fun doing other things :D. I have been
there loads of times, so I understand how frustrating it is to not be able to see your friends
because you are too busy finishing homework. I find that doing only 2 to 3 assignments a day really
helps me minimize how stressed I feel: 1 easy assignment + 1 medium-difficulty assignment + 1
difficult/lengthy assignment. If you don’t mind sharing, what does your time management look like in
terms of self-care? WOW this turned out to be a looong message (so sorry!!—feel free to take your
time in responding lol) I am so glad to hear from you each time, and again, please don’t feel bad at
all if it takes you a while to respond, and don’t hesitate in reaching out/asking questions if you
need to—that’s what I’m here for 😊 JanakiMentor 2021-09-29, 18:26: I realize the last message I sent
you may be a bit too long 🙃 I want to make this e-mentoring experience as easy and fun for you as
possible, so please let me know if you want me to send one long message or multiple short ones for
our future chats! JanakiMentee 2021-10-12, 15:59: Hi Janaki, Last week I had to stay home from
school and help out around the house as my parents went out of town for a little get away so I was
very busy babysitting and such so that's why it's taken so long to respond. I've found out that I do
much better in person than online when it comes to school as its a scheduled thing so hopefully I
don't have to miss more :} I don't really have a study schedule as my life is changing constantly
and as soon as i get home I have to help around the house and I'm afraid of leaving my mum alone for
too long. Even when i try to make time ti study i end up getting distracted with my thoughts or
something random I find in my room, which is really frusstrating because i want to be better at
doing school work on time. SOme days I don't get to go down to my room to work on school until 9pm
and at that time I'm getting ready for bed or doing physical self care like washing my face or I
relax with some videos. So I don't get as much time to study as I wish to. My time management for
anything is horrible because I do anything I can whenever i get the chance to. Like i said before,
things at home change a lot so I don't usually make plans for anything as I know they won't work
out. Most nights i clean my face as i get really bad acne if i don't and I hate acne because
sometimes it hurts and it's very visible. I try to eat regularly but most days i sleep in late so
sometimes i don't eat at all in the morning until after school which messes with my appetite. I
don't get out and workout much even though I'd like to as my life is kind of hectic most of the time
but I'd like to at least go for a walk everyday so i know i am able to do that still. I think
multiple short messages would be nice and less stressful but I don't really have a strong preference
for either :] Thanks, EdenMentor 2021-10-16, 02:07: Hi Eden! It's great to hear from you :D Thank
you for your feedback on the message length! I'm glad to hear that you are engaging in physical
self-care and trying to go to bed on time (I had bad acne in high school too and I think that
sometimes even just washing your face before bed can really make your self-care routine something
you enjoy doing). Even though I'm not really a breakfast person, I like to eat a granola bar I
always have in my bag on my commute to school. Maybe keeping a handy snack in your bag can be
something you try next time so your appetite doesn't get too irregular? (My personal favorites are
goldfish crackers, dried apricots, and cheerios :P) It's awesome that you are going on regular
walks! I've learned that even 30min of walking a day can make a difference in health, so great job,
keep it up!!Mentor 2021-10-16, 02:17: What you said about not being able to stick to a study
schedule because life may get too hectic is completely relatable and valid. I've been in your
situation too often when family stuff came up; I also have a hard time concentrating for long
periods of time and totally understand how stressful it can be. Here are few tips I've collected
over the years for keeping my concentration :P: -study for only 15-20min at a time and take a 5-8min
break doing something in a different room. -keeping a snack with me when I study to make me feel
better about studying (lol I was doing this a lot during online school) -if possible, hop on a Zoom
session with a friend, classmate, peer so they can keep me motivated and on task -I also sometimes
used to take a 20-30min nap in the middle of my studying right when I got bored, so when I woke up
and re-started, it didn't seem as boring. I hope this list was somewhat helpful, is there a tip here
you might be interested in trying out next time? JanakiMentor 2021-10-25, 02:49: Hi Eden! Just
checking-in to see how you are doing! It's midterms-season for me right now and I think you may be
in the same boat as well with all the exams and assignments :( I hope you are still working on some
of the self-care tips we discussed together and that you are feeling more motivated and excited for
the approaching winter break!! I hope you are having a great week so far and am excited for our
coming chats :D As always, I am always here if you need someone to talk to! JanakiMentee 2021-11-01,
15:29: Hi Janaki, So sorry for not responding. I've been so distracted lately I feel like i don't
have 5 minutes to focus on myself and my heads been so full of everything I need to do that I just
can't remember everything. I have been washing my face a little more as some form of self care. I am
excited for the winter break! As much as I hate the cold, Christmas is usually a decent time of the
year. Lately I've been really stressing about my Capstone as I've had literally no time to do it and
it's due in a week and also worth half of my grade :( I've been so bad at keeping up with work in
school lately ever since I had to take that week off because my parents went out of town. Hopefully
I can figure this Capstone out and make a compromise for it with my teacher since I've been so busy.
Again I'm so so sorry I haven't been able to message you but I'll try my best to try out the study
tips you suggested because they seem like something I'd be able to do. I hope you did well on you
midterms and such :} Thanks, EdenMentee 2021-11-03, 15:30: Hi again, I've been informed that my
grade is on how many conversations I complete so I was wondering if we could do some more soon
:}Mentor 2021-11-03, 18:26: Hi Eden! It's great to hear from you! I hope your Capstone is going well
since your last message :D Also, it's awesome to hear that you might be trying out those study
tips!! It seems that you're satisfied with our work on this module so let's move onto the next
conversation! Let me know which one you would like to do next and whether you have any last question
about this self-care module you wanted to discuss! I also just wanted to let you know that I have a
lot of school-related things coming up so I will likely not be able to reply as quickly on Fridays
(I will reply near the evening though!), but I should be replying pretty quickly the other days of
the week :P JanakiMentee 2021-11-05, 17:23: Hiya Janaki, I think we should move onto Entering the
Job Market as I've never had a job before and I recently got my SIN number so I'd love to find a job
so I am able to make some money to pay for my wants and needs. It's totally alright for the late
replies! I tend to get busy at the end of a term too so I completely understand. I wish you good
luck on all your school related things! Thanks, Eden",,"Mentee 2021-09-14, 16:05: Hello, I'm Eden, I use he/they pronouns and I like snakes and frogs :) I
suck at communicating but I do try. My favourite colour is pastel or lime green :D I don't know what
else I'm supposed to write so I hope you have a good day or night! :}Mentor 2021-09-14, 18:21: Hi
Eden! Thank you for reaching out My name is Janaki and I use she/her pronouns. I am a fourth-year
psychology and health sciences student at my university! How are your classes going so far? I
completely understand the feeling of not being the best at communicating :D so it's awesome that you
are trying to be a better communicator! I love frogs and snakes too! I don't remember what kind of
frog it is, but I have attached a picture of one from Google which is very similar to a frog I saw
at the aquarium a while back that I thought was really cute :) Do you have a favorite song or type
of music you listen to? What's your favorite food? Mine is pesto pasta because it always reminds me
of summer. I hope we can learn more about each other with this program and I'll try my best to
answer any questions you have about post-secondary! Feel free to share whatever you feel comfortable
telling me, or ask any questions! JanakiMentee 2021-09-15, 16:11: Hi Janaki, I love your name :D My
classes are really nice so far! They're not too hard to get through and also not too easy. I love
that I don't have too much to stress about. I love that frog! It's so colourful :} I've never seen a
frog in real life yet but I'd love to go to an aquarium one day. I have held a huge snake around
mine and my mums neck before though. I'd love to have a snake as a pet one day but that's a huge
responsibility and costs a lot so I'd have to wait a while though. My favourite music ranges from
Corpse to Wilbur Soot to literally anything as I love many types of music :) I'd have to say one of
my favourite foods is parmesan chicken as I love cooking chicken breast and cheese things. I also
hope we can learn more and I hope I remember to ask questions as I am quite forgetful. I like to
play video games quite a lot like Valorant, Genshin Impact, Minecraft, and much more I couldn't
possibly list off. What's your favourite game? Lately I've been busy as my mother is not doing so
well so i don't have much time for my hobbies but I like drawing and cleaning when i have the
motivation to do so. As of right now, I help around the house to clean and help my mum around and
watch over my siblings and dog. I'm still not really coping with the fact that she might not make it
to my graduation so it's really weird hearing her talk about it. I would really like to get my first
tattoo sometime soon and get it matching with my mum as I love all her tattoos and I find body art
to be really cool! Here is an idea I have: If you have any ideas for matching tattoos I'd love to
see them :D! My teacher has told me to pick a conversation topic today that we can work on so I'd
like to try well being and self care! I struggle with self care as most of the day I am busy but I
would love to take better care of myself and my body this year. I hope you have an awesome day or
night wherever you are :} Eden",,"Mentor 2021-11-12, 15:19: Hi Eden! It's me again :P I hope you haven't gotten too tired of my
messages! I'm opening up this Wrapping Up module for us as it's our last day for e-mentoring! I know
we didn't cover as many topics as you had planned, but I hoped you learned a few tips and tricks
along the way! From our conversations, you seem like a wonderful person--it's always easier to be
hard on ourselves but I hope you begin to give yourself more credit!! You are doing awesome and I'm
sure you will have a terrific end to your semester! Thank you for being such an amazing mentee, I

Considerations conversation for us to discuss. Figuring out what you want to do for a career can be
super stressful, and it's something I didn't really figure out until my third year in university.
With that being said, if you're unsure of your career path, don't worry! Sometimes it just takes
some exploring different job opportunities, or taking some post-secondary classes that you're
interested in to figure out what you want to do long term. If you have some sort of idea of what you
want to do (I remember that your profile said that you like working with kids), then using these
tools is a great start to figure out which school and program is right for you. Taking the career
quiz on the Work BC page might be a good idea too! I think a good question to start off with is, did
you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these
programs?Mentor 2021-10-03, 17:53: Hi Colleen, Just checking in to see how you're doing. I hope

get there if its needed, if you could help me that would be great because I don't understand.Mentor

the SFU Early Learning Post-Baccalaursste Diploma and i dont really know what sparked the
intrest.Mentor 2021-11-06, 13:25: Hi Colleen, I'm so glad you found something that interests you! A
post-bacc diploma is something you obtain after you get a Bachelor's degree, so to get that diploma,
you would need to get a 4 year bachelor's at an accredited institution first. If you are looking for
post-secondary schooling that does not require a bachelor's degree but is still related to early
learning, I would suggest the Early Childhood Education Certificate at Douglas College. It is three
semesters long (approx 9 months). Here is the link to the program:
https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/ctece If you are wanting to do a program that is a bit longer
than a certificate (4 semesters, approx 1 year), there is also the Early Childhood Education Diploma
at Douglas College. Here is the link: https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/dpeces If you check out
these links, there is a header that says ""career pathways"" on the page. If you click that header,
you can get an idea about some careers you could have if you were to do these programs. Let me know
if you check these out, and if they seem interesting to you!Mentor 2021-11-14, 19:05: Hi Colleen,

1047512485,1047538823,9/14/2021 12:50,"Mentor 2021-10-04, 21:50: Hi Ann, I’ll start off by sharing my thoughts on the video. Ironically,
the ideas that resonated with me the most sort of contradict. The first idea comes from Mina Shum;
everything we do we plan based off of a want or desire. The second comes from Roch Carrier; what is
truly important is not planned. Planning and looking into the future is something that helps me
identify my goals and stay motivated. I think it’s really helpful to spend some time thinking about
what you actually want and what makes you happy. This seems like an easy question to answer, but it
can actually be difficult at times. What I’ve wanted has changed quite frequently throughout my
life, and I don’t think this is a bad thing. It’s just important to try to keep track of what you
want so you can make sure you’re on the track that will make you happiest and help you achieve your
goals. For example, I always knew I wanted to play university soccer, so I worked really hard during
my high school days to improve my game and reach out to lots of schools. I had moments of doubt when
things got difficult or when I just didn’t really feel into it. I found taking time to reflect on
what soccer meant to me, what I loved about the game, and why I wanted to play university soccer
helped me through these things. If I had ultimately decided that soccer didn’t mean much to me
anymore, this also would have been helpful and I could have done something else! However, despite
how much we can plan our lives, so much of what happens in life and often the most meaningful things
are what we don’t plan. Currently, I am working in the recreation department at Lakeview Long Term
Care Centre in East Van. This is not something I ever though I’d do; I was envisioning something
like a clinical kinesiology job for myself. Although this would have been amazing as well, I
couldn’t be more grateful for the role I’m in now. It may not be glamorous or what I pictured for
myself, but it is the main reason why I want to go to medical school. Spending time with these
elders shows me how much I value human connection, specifically intergenerational relationships and
connections. I have always wanted to work with vulnerable populations, but this job has solidified
my interest. I feel almost called to pursue a career where I can both fulfill my scientific
interests and also serve the most vulnerable and marginalized members of our community. Ultimately,
what may be the real key to finding inspiration and motivation for me is having an open mind. I have
surrounded my self with but also been lucky enough to be surrounded by friends, coworkers,
teammates, teachers, and coaches who are really special and inspiring human beings. I learn so much
from the people in my life and I try to learn from and get the most out of experiences that I don’t
plan, such as this job or just meeting people I didn’t intend or expect to. This is why it’s also
important to try and say yes to as much as you can, especially during university. Of course, don’t
say yes to everything as you’ll become overwhelmed with too much on your plate. But, try to say yes
to new opportunities whether they are organized volunteering, clubs, or even just chances to hang
out with a new group of people. Still be reasonable and take time to study when you need to or just
chill and watch TV (relaxing and self care are also so important!), but I found I never regretted
joining or doing something that pushed me out of my comfort zone. Was there anything different in
the video that resonated more with you? Talk soon :) Best, AnnaMentor 2021-10-10, 15:30: Hi Ann,
Hope you're having a nice Thanksgiving weekend! I just wanted to follow up on my previous message to
make sure you recieved it. No rush in responding - just wanted to check in. Chat soon. Best,
AnnaMentee 2021-10-12, 01:20: I really liked what roch carrier said “I believe that creation is
always an accident.” especially when he says “you have to work hard in the process, something
happens and this is the essence of creation.” I find that it makes the outcome more special because
it didn’t turn out the way you planned it out to be, which makes it more unique and valuable, if
that makes sense. Hey sorry i ghosted you there for a bit. It's kinda hectic trying to get this
midterm project done.Mentor 2021-10-12, 16:54: Hi Ann, I like those quotes too! It is comforting to
remember that as long as you do your best and work hard, something can be created and that result

changed at all over time? I find my level of inspiration really ebs and flows - some days I'm really
motivated and others not at all! And don't worry about it - totally get it! Best, Anna","Mentor 2021-10-24, 19:12: Hi Ann, All good - glad you are feeling a bit better. I have unlocked the
career considerations conversation. Let me know what your career quiz results are! Have a nice rest
of your Sunday. Best, AnnaMentor 2021-11-07, 16:49: Hi Ann, Hope you're having a nice weekend. I
just wanted to check in to see how you're doing. Have you had a chance to do the career quiz? Time
seems to have flown by! We have to complete the career conversation and one other one by this
Friday. Let me know what youd like to discuss regarding careers and we can move on to one more
conversation of your choice :) Talk soon, Anna",,,,,"Mentor 2021-09-20, 22:03: Hi again! I just had a look at the studying videos and wanted to comment
on the importance of starting studying early. It didn't work for me to wait until a week before an
exam to cram all my notes in. I tried to take notes on all my lectures at the end of each week. If I
had time, I would also try to review notes from the older lectures. When it got closer to the actual
exam, I started to re-type my notes and test myself. I would type out the heading of a slide or
segment of notes, and then either type out or say aloud or in my head what I knew about that topic.
I didn't try to regurgitate things word for word, but I instead tried to fully understand concepts
and make them relatable to me. I can't emphasize enough how important starting early is! Not only
does it improve retention of informaiton, but it also greatly reduces stress. Feeling pressed for
time before an exam is not the greatest feeling, and it's harder to memorize and learn under stress.
Anyway, give these videos a watch and let me know your thoughts and any questions you have! Best,
AnnaMentee 2021-10-01, 15:53: i found the videos! i watched them and i know how im going to improve
my studying. i procratinate, i usually cram some studying after school and before i go to bed. but
from watching those videos and from what you told me im going to plan out what im going to study for
a few hours then the next day ill do my math homework then the next day ill study for my capstone.
then ill keep that schedule going so i can get in the habit of not cramming everything last
minuteMentor 2021-10-02, 12:02: Hi Ann, I think that is a great idea! Procrastinating is so easy and
I've fallen into that trap many times myself. What I think might help you even further is setting
smaller goals within your overall schedule. So, for example, Wednesday after school you'll study for
capstone - but what do you want to get done exactly? I think maybe set aside a specific amount of
time, say, an hour, and then estimate what you can get done in that time. Maybe you're going to
study a specific chapter or learn 10 definitions. Whatever the goal is, I think it just helps to
have one to stay on track. I know that when I tell myself ""Oh tomorrow night I'll study for biology""
vs. ""tomorrow night I am going to study the cell chapter and have all the cell parts memorized"", I
am much more likely to procrastinate the first one rather than the second because there is no
specific goal I am trying to achieve. Also, if I tell myself I am going to study for an hour and
then see a friend, watch a movie, have an ice cream, etc. I am much more motivated and efficient. If
there is nothing to look forward to and no time constraint, I will just put things off or work much
slower than I really need to. Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or things
you want to discuss regarding studying. Have a great weekend, AnnaMentee 2021-10-04, 16:11: thanks!
those are some great tips ill note and use in the future studying &lt;3 next topic id like to talk
about is how to find inspiration.",,,,,,"Mentee 2021-09-14, 17:08: Hello! My name is Ann-Marie, but you can call me Ann. how are you? I'm
very nervous when it comes to talking with new people and if I answer is short, im sorry im not very
good with words. im looking forward to learning how you got to where you are today!Mentor
2021-09-14, 23:31: Hi Ann, My name is Anna - nice to (virtually) meet you! Don't worry at all about
the socializing nerves - I'm right there with you. I have a bit of a stutter so socializing
(especially public speaking) is really anxiety inducing for me! The thing that helps me is to just
keep throwing myself into scary situations. It's easier said than done and some days I just can't,
but the more conversations I have with people the easier it gets, and the more I realize that really
no one is socially perfect at all! I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020 and I studied
Kinesiology and played varsity soccer. I am now working in recreation in a long term care home and
enjoy connecting with seniors. I'm working towards medical school and am going to continue working,
playing soccer, and volunteering until I (hopefully) get in. I'm so excited to learn more about you
and hopefully help you get an idea of what you might want to do in the future. I read that you'd
love to get a trailer and see the sites. You can totally do that! I think you can choose a career
that allows for time off to travel and do what YOU want to do. Also really cool that you have an
interest in opening a coffee shop or tattoo parlour. Very unique ideas :) Let me know what
conversation you'd like to start on first. Best, AnnaMentee 2021-09-15, 15:34: lets start with
studying. im horrible at studying because i dont really have free time but when i do im busy either
with babysitting my niece or my family calls me then i forget all about studying, i cant read things
that doesnt intrests me then ill have to re-read everything multiple times and even then i wont
remember what i just read. i prefer a quiet space to study or if im alone studying ill play music,
but sometimes music is too distracting for me because ill end up just sitting there dancing. what
helps you study and stay focused? and how long do you usually study? what type of environment do you
like to study in? quiet? listen to music? in a public area?Mentor 2021-09-16, 16:41: Hi Ann, That's
a great one to start with. I will unlock that conversation. I think what helped me the most with
studying was finding a quiet space free of distractions. If I had a test coming up, I would write
dwon that date in my calendar and plan mini-goals for myself each week until test date. I tried to
start early so that I could study in small chunks rather than cramming the night before. I agree
with you - reading things you aren't interested in is so tough! Lucky for me, I was genuinely
interested in Kinesiology in university, so this wasn't too much of an issue, but I remember
struggling with this in high school, as many courses did not interest me. What I tried to do was
relate what I was learning to my own life to make it a bit more relevant. I would almost trick
myself into finding things interesting. If this didn't work, I would just remind myself of the
greater goal - study hard to eventually get good enough grades to get into university - and that
would motivate me a bit. I study best individually, but I have a lot of friends who need a group to
be able to study well. A group setting can be more stimulating and it is nice to be around friends
who you can collaborate with. It just depends on personal preference really. I'll unlock the
conversation and give you more advice as we go along! Best, AnnaMentee 2021-09-20, 16:47: hey! sorry
it took me a while to get back to you i had cold on thursday after i got my vaccine. but anyways im
the same i like to have no distractions because i get distracted easily and i forget what im doing
so i have to re-read the same page until i finally undrstand what im reading, but sometimes id like
someone there so if i get stuck i could ask them questions if i dont understand something. i try and
take notes too but sometimes i dont know whats important and whats not.Mentee 2021-09-20, 17:38: oh!
and i have a question, i was wondering do you have any experiance or knowledge on criminology and/or
sociology? this is what im interested in studyingMentor 2021-09-20, 21:51: Hi Ann, What worked for
me was picking a person or a few people to study with that I knew studied similarly to me. We could
go to the library together and sit quiety and work on our own for a few hours, but we still had
eachother there if we needed to ask a question. In terms of taking notes, I found going to
class/lectures really helped me prioritize what was the most important. If the teacher talked at
length about something or really emphasized a concept, then I'd take detailed notes for it. If they
just mentioned it once, I would take very minimal notes. Most of my university professors posted
their lecture slides which already had notes on them, so I would download those slides and then just
jot down extra notes that the teacher said during class. When actually studying for the test, I
would handwrite all the lecture notes and my extra notes into one document that I could study from.
I found handwriting helped make things sink in a bit more. Unfortunately I don't have much
experience in those areas as I studied Kinesiology at school; however I did take some sociology
related courses within my program. I didn't think I'd be that interested in them but I actually
loved them. I loved how it made me look at the world and society from a totally new perspective. You
can do a lot with those degrees too; social work, law, government work, academia, etc. You could try
to meet with a counsellor at school to see if crim or sociology would be the right fit for you
:)Mentee 2021-09-22, 16:53: have you ever had a hard time taking notes in class? do you know if some
teachers let you record the lesson their talking about? because i cant write fast enough to get
everything down before they go on to the next subject.Mentor 2021-09-23, 17:15: Hi Ann, Taking notes
was definitely a struggle at the beginning but I did get the hang of it eventually. I typed all my
notes during class using OneNote (a microsoft app). I would download the lecture slides onto here
and then make notes on them using this software. I only made handwritten notes when I was studying
outside of class and had time. Because I had the lecture slides downloaded, I didn't need to copy
down everything on the slide - I only made additional notes. I assume you professor would also
provide the slides. I think most professors don't allow recordings unless they provide them
themselvs, but you can always double check. I think the most important thing is to really listen to
what the professor is saying. If they are skimming over slides, don't worry about writing every
single thing down. It will just be too overwhelming. Instead, if the professor is really
highlighting something, make a few notes about it in your own words. I got way less out of classes
where I was frantically writing and learned a lot more when I just really listened and only made
notes when it seemed essential or like I would easily forget it. Especially for crim and sociology,
those subjects are so conceptual there probably won't be too many facts you just have to memorize.
You're best bet would probably be focusing on being engagned and listening to the professor. I

UVic. Its great to ""meet"" you . I looked at your profile and we seem to have quite a bit in common.
I also love to draw and paint, and let my creative side run wild. I hope to someday work with
vulnerable youth either in a school setting or in my own private office. Some stuff I would like to
concentrate in is well-being, motivation and nutrition. But for now, I enjoy focusing on myself, my
studies, and having fun. Another thing about me is I absolutely love to cook. Last night I made an
awesome meal for dinner. I baked chicken in the oven with pesto, tomato and lots of mozzerella
cheese. I would say that it is definetely my comfort food for when i'm feeling under the weather
(basically anything with cheese). Some words I really like to live by is that the key to life is
accepting challenges by Bette Davis. Those words really do resonate with me as it reminds me not to
be scared when confronted with challenging situations. These situations will only make you stronger,
regardless of how you perform. This is what has kept me going throughout my university career thus
far. And now that I am almost done, I know this quote will stick with me forever. Thank you for
letting me introduce myself. I look forward to hearing more about your and your passions. Best,

are a bunch of modules that should be a faint blue colour. Each one, once we start it, will have
some additional texts and sometimes a small assignment. All we do is pick the topics we find the
