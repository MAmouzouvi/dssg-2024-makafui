I'd like to to finish this conversation by the end of the week (as well as the Getting Hired conversation). Let me know if you have any questions or if you need help with anything!",,,,,"Mentee 2023-05-31, 13:43: Roan's comment: What do you value in life? • How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? • Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? i value my peace and quiet a lot but i also value being around friends. i contribute to my community by attending commuity gatherings on many days like orange shirt day. i contribute to the world by trying my hardest to be as respectful and as helpful as i can be to people. a therapist maybe beause they help people my dream career is a professional basketball player Mentee 2023-05-31, 13:43: Roan's comment: I dont have a strong personal interests inthis type of work but i can see myself enjoying this job and these jobs also pay fairly well so i will be financially comfortable if i was in one of these careers this carrer will give me the work/life balance i want because i will be working enough to provide and have a goof life outside work this career will give me a good financial security as a dental hygenists makes around 90k a year job security wise i feel i would be secure because dental hygenists are always in demnd in canada this job will provide many oppurtuities in the dental field for better and higher paying jobs you would need to live in a pretty well populated town or the city to find a job close to you questions for elliot: how did you choose your career and other careers in the past and do u have regrets about the careers or career you have chosen? what other careers were you considering instead of your current one and why didn't you choose to pursue it? what do you wish you knew about career choices while you were in hgihschool Mentor 2023-06-04, 12:11: Hi Roan! Below are the answer to questions from your first message. How did you choose your career and other careers in the past and do u have regrets about the careers or career you have chosen? Technically, I am still in school so I don't officially have a career yet but my current plan is to become a Paleontologist. I chose this career because I love learning about and researching ancient life, as well as spending time in nature. I also felt like Paleontology/Earth science combines all the sciences, which I appreciated. I don't have any regrets for pursuing Paleo, but I also haven't started in the job yet so I cannot fully answer that question. what other careers were you considering instead of your current one and why didn't you choose to pursue it? Before Paleontology, I wanted to be a doctor because of my interest in human biology. I decided against this after I took physics and chemistry, as I realized that I really enjoyed these subjects, and would like a career that combined all of the sciences. what do you wish you knew about career choices while you were in high school? I wish I was more aware about the range of possible careers. I feel that, after university, I have learned about so many careers that I didn't even know existed. Mentor 2023-06-04, 12:29: Below is a response to your second message. I noticed from your bio and your answers that you enjoy spending time in nature and with people. There are quite a few stable careers in British Columbia that involves work with nature and people, such as jobs in Forestry, Geology/mining, and Parks.",,,"Mentee 2023-05-31, 13:41: Hello Roan and Sasha, This is Parvaneh from eMentoring team. As I explained already in my email to each of you, I'll transfer all Roan's comments to this relationship page, so you can continue working on them together. Here is Roan's first comment. I will post other comments on the related activities. So please check out all of them. Roan's comment: warning signs that i need some self care: low energy, irritated or feeling tired activities i enjoy: basketball, playing guitar, playing videogames, target shooting how have you navigated challenges in your mental health during secondary amd post secondary school Mentor 2023-06-04, 11:17: Hello Roan, My name is Sasha, and I am currently studying Geology and Biology at the University of British Columbia. I love learning about nature including rocks, fossils, insects and plants. Let me know if you have any questions about this or my area of study! A couple questions for you: 1. Do you have a favourite suject? 2. Is there a particular area or career you're trying to pursue? 3. Are there particular days of the week that you use eMentor? 4. Is there a particular topic in the above wheel that you would like to discuss (excluding the following: Getting Hired, Well-Being and Self-Care, Confronting Discrimination, Career Exploration)? If not I can chose one for us. A couple of other notes for you: It looks like we have three more conversations to get through before your school year ends. I'm thinking we can do one per week, for the next three weeks (starting the week of June 5th). So the schedule will look as follows (I will also send reinders at the beginning of the week as well): &gt;Week of June 5th: Getting Hired &gt;Week of June 12th: Well-Being and Self-Care &gt;Week of June 19th: A conversation of your choice - answer to question four above (if you have no preference I can choose one, just let me know) Also, I am in the UK for the first part of June, so you may get these messages at odd times (because of the time difference) so I apologize for that! But I will always try to answer your messages as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing your reply and getting started! :)",,,"Mentor 2023-06-05, 13:59: Hi Roan! I've just opened this conversation, called 'Getting Hired'. Please try to have your responses done by the end of the week, and let me know if you have any questions! Mentor 2023-06-13, 08:37: Hi Roan, Just wanted to follow up on my last message, hopefully you can work through this lesson soon! Let me know if you have any questions.","Mentor 2023-06-20, 21:25: Hi Roan, I'm opening this conversation, called Agency in the World. Please let me know if you have any questions.","Mentee 2023-05-31, 13:44: Roan's comment: microagrssion: small agressive behavior that cant be easily noticed but still effects other people individual racism: being racist as an individual to someone of a different ethnicity privilege: having the ability to do soemthing that a lot of people cant institutional racism: racism that is caused by the governments and other people in a position of power implicit bias: an unintentional bias that effects your judgements and your own decisions question for elliot: what efforts at your job have you seen to minimize discrimination agaisnt certain people Mentee 2023-05-31, 13:44: Roan's comment: In what ways have Dr. Nadine Caron’s experiences with discrimination shaped her as a doctor? • What do you think of Dr. Caron’s response to the ignorant and hurtful comment her fellow surgeon made? Were you surprised by what her other colleagues did? What would you have done if you had been in her position in that moment? What would you have done if you had been one of her colleagues in that moment? • Why do you think it took the surgeon so long to apologize? What makes it difficult to admit our mistakes? Is it especially hard to admit when we do things that are hurtful and discriminatory? dr. caron is shaped to be a very accepting doctor she has helped an elderly indigenous woman feel more confortable in the hospital i think dr. carons response was well done and done calmly. i wasnt that suprisied that at least one of her colleges said something racist to her. i would have been a lot more loud about the racist remark thats why i think dr. nadine has handled it well because she got her point across calmly and walked away. if i were one of her colleges in that moment i would have called out the racist remark. i think it took the doctor a long time to apologize because he became more educated and gained more expierence around indigenous people. pride and not understanding a certain point of veiw can make it hard ot admit to our mistakes. it is especially hard when we make hurtful or discriminatory mistakes because we dont want to feel the shame while apologizing i feel lke i may relate more if you are not indigenous because i am and i kinda understand how she feels Mentor 2023-06-05, 13:23: Hi Roan! Below is a repsonse to your first message (some of my answers to the questions) What do you think of Dr. Caron’s response to the ignorant and hurtful comment her fellow surgeon made? I really appreciated her calm and intelligent response. I fell like it robably forced the doctor who made the racist comment to think about what he said. Were you surprised by what her other colleagues did? I was a little suprised but glad for their support. What would you have done if you had been in her position in that moment? Honestly, in that moment, I likely would not have responded. Mentor 2023-06-05, 13:57: Below is a response to your second message (this question: what efforts at your job have you seen to minimize discrimination agaisnt certain people). As I mentioned earlier, I am still in education so i cannot fully answer this question. However, in all of the jobs I have had as a student, a training in fighting discriminiation/bigotry is almost always requred."

I'm in the Bachelor of Science + Master of Management Dual Degree, so I'm both in the Faculty of Science and Sauder at the same time. I love playing sports, listening to music, watching YouTube, going on social media, and talking to people in my free time. I see on your profile that you are really into business and sports. That is pretty cool! I also like the idea of real estate, and I used to play competitive tennis back in high school. What sports do you like to play? Have you taken any action or steps for your business ideas?",,,,,

Just going by the guiding questions, what sort of warning signs do you have when you start to feel stressed out? And what do you do to relieve that stress? I saw that you like sports, going for runs, handing out with friends, woodworking -- that is all great stuff! Mentee 2023-05-02, 13:14: yes hi james sorry for the late reply all that saounds like my kind of jobs i'd want to do also my week was fun Mentee 2023-05-03, 10:45: so how was schoolfor you back in the day Mentor 2023-05-03, 19:24: Hey Francis, High school back in the day? Haha. That makes me sound old. Parts of it came easy, parts of it not so much. Personally I found the social side of high school trickier than the science and math, for example. But I found university was a great fit for me. So what are you thinking about life after high school? Work or gap year or go to trades or college or something? Also, let me know what other module you want me to unlock for you. We have 4 opened and I think we're supposed to tackle 5. James Mentee 2023-05-04, 09:03: well after school im thinking of a job and stay with my parents for a lil bit then try get in to uvc or some where else if i change my mind and im still thinking on who will be my room mate but who knows i'll plan more some time",,,,,"Mentor 2023-06-09, 12:49: Glad to hear you had a good weekend! Sounds like you do fun stuff - going to dances and sports and helping out your family. That's great. All the stuff about job interviews and resumes is still super useful, so if you need to go back to learn about resumes or job interviews, there's good info on this website. Also this link: https://www.liveabout.com/resume-skills-for-high-school-students-2063767 Mentor 2023-06-09, 13:10: What if we start a new module -- Career Exploration. For starters, just think about what you might want to do 5, 10 years from now. It's totally fine to not know, but good to have a general idea of what you want to do. There's some good videos and discussion questions above on this page. Then, why don't you answer these questions. Don't need to write anything long, the goal is just to get you thinking about this stuff What is really important to you? In other words, what do you value most in life? What are some of your strengths you could use in your future job?",,,"Mentor 2023-04-11, 13:00: Hey Francis, my name is James and I'm your mentor for this program! A bit about me -- I live in Prince George right now and just finishing up my first year of med school. Before moving up North, I went to UVic and did some other stuff like working at a sawmill and working in some outdoor jobs. For fun, I like basically anything to do with the outdoors (camping, hiking, climbing, biking, etc.) When you get the chance, how about you let me know a bit about yourself -- wahtever you want to share. Hoping to keep this mentoring thing pretty chill for both of us. Mentor 2023-05-06, 13:21: That sounds like a good plan! Sometimes it's good to take a break from school and figure out what you want to do. It's a bit cliché but it's actually true that you learn about yourself more and more after high school. I also stayed with my parents for the year after high school. I worked on that time and realized that I wanted to go to UVic which ended up being a great time. In first year I had a roommate who was a complete starnger but it worked out in the end. You learn a lot living with different people haha Do you have a sense of what job you might look for the upcoming year? Bit of a plan to put money away for school? Mentee 2023-05-09, 10:49: well i was thnking about working at boston pizza to be a server or work with some of my family at the band office but i dont like metings but ik we all have to do some stuff that we dont like Mentee 2023-05-10, 11:19: is kinda like i really hate geting up in the mornings and yesderday i missed the bus Mentor 2023-05-10, 16:24: That's great that you have some ideas for next year. No one needs to have everything in their future totally figured out, but it's usually good to have an idea for a direction like you do. That's awesome. And nothing wrong about hating meetings, haha. Not sure if anyone actually likes those... About your comment today, how you doing? Did you catch another bus? Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:08: ha yea that day was so busy i had soccer parctic and i did run walk traning also if evan dont do anything on a day i still cant get up in the morning idk why Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:13: also did you have any time to do anything? just asking because i'd still want to do some stuff that i like something like workout or soccer evan make music ive been thinking about that Mentor 2023-05-12, 12:34: Do you mean did I have time to do fun stuff outside of school when I went to university? Yup, I sure did. I sort of like that saying of ""work hard, play hard."" Got to have fun to keep yourself sane! But you have to do your work too. At UVic, I did things like intramurals, running and biking, sometimes going to the beaches on weekends, etc. Hey - since you are looking at getting a job next year, have you thought about making or updating your resume? What might you put on it? Hope your Friday is good. It's gonna be a hot weekend!! Mentee 2023-05-16, 08:50: in my class we are working on cover letters and resumes. im inclooding soccer and my band Mentor 2023-06-27, 15:16: Hey Francis, just letting you know this mentoring program will come to a close. Let me know within the next few days if you'd still like to stay in touch otherwise I'll let the ReMBC staff know to close our accounts. All the best! James",,,"Mentor 2023-05-16, 11:42: Good to hear that you'll include basket and band on your resume. I think your employers would like knowing who you are and what you like to do. When it comes to a resume, what do youb think are your top 3-5 skills? In other words, if you're in a job interview what would be the top thinks you want to 'brag about' yourself? If it helps, you can share your resume with me and I can give you some feedback on it? Up to you! Mentee 2023-05-18, 13:56: ahh ok well my top 5 thing im good with peaple and responsible and teamwork i can clean but i hate it and respetfull Mentee 2023-05-18, 13:57: how old are u Mentor 2023-05-21, 07:23: I'm 26. Time moves fast! Sorry for the slow reply this time. Okay, so you said your top skills are working with people, being responsible, cleaning, teamwork, and being respectful. Those are all great! Say you are having a job interview, would you be able to give examples about how you demonstrate those skills (e.g. maybe for teamwork you could talk about being on a basketball team, or other sports team) -- what about for the other 4 skills? Also, if you want to send me a link to your resume or copy and paste it here, I'm more than happy to help you with it Mentee 2023-05-29, 09:30: does it depend on what kind of skill?? Mentee 2023-05-30, 08:45: if it is thing i can stay on task and deal with peaple who have anger issuses and can sometimes wake up on my own and on the worst day i can cuntrol myself Mentee 2023-05-30, 08:46: i think thats more then 4 HAHA Mentor 2023-06-03, 10:12: I think we're on a good start thinking about what a resume should include. Here's a great link for more on resumes. Also, here is a link for template resume, so you could just use your own words to replace the words on this template resume. The main parts of the resume are: Your name &amp; contact info at the top Qualifications or Skills that we've been talking about - give examples of how you show these skills! Education (what high school you went to, maybe talk about any classes that you did well in) Life Experiences (maybe being on a basketball team, helping out in the band office, etc.) Does that make sense? Hope so, let me know if not. Mentor 2023-06-03, 10:13: Hope you are having a good weekend man! Almost done school, a few more weeks until summer Mentee 2023-06-06, 12:37: weekend was fun i went to a dance and someone asked me about work then they asked if i wanted to work at they'er band but i would't have a ride sadly but ill work with my step dad Mentor 2023-06-21, 18:34: Hey Francis, I guess you are wrapping up school soon, way to go! You are an honest and down to earth guy, which are awesome qualities. I enjoyed our chats and hearing about what you get up to apart from school. I hope you got something good out of the program.

So cool that you are intested in being a Veterinarian:) My sister graduated from University of Saskatchewan Vet school about 2 years ago and has been working in Northern BC as a rural vet for the past two years. I've learned quite a bit about her process to Vet school and can answer any questions that you might have. (My brother's fiance is also starting Vet school in Prince Edward Island this fall). I also noticed that you had some questions about living on your own/living with a partner/having a child/getting married. That is so great to be thinking about already as the transition out of highschool is a very big life step/change! I got married quite young and you're welcome to pick my brain, however, I'm just going to preface that everyone's relationships are completely different, so you'll have to take anything I saw with a grain of salt:) After meeting eachother and sending a few messages back and forth, I'm supposed to open up a conversation. Are there any particular conversations that sound interesting to you? You can also read anything about me in my profile (I believe that it is quite up to date). Lindsay Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:22: hello Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:27: I'm sorry it took me so long to reply, I have been busy for awhile since my parents want to move out soon Mentee 2023-05-25, 08:46: oh ok well i think im free to talk more now, but i have to figure out what my password was for this account first, because i forgot what it was. i hope you have fun in ireland. Mentor 2023-05-25, 09:18: Passwords can be the worst! Let me know if you don't have access to the conversations, and hope the move went okay for your parents:) And thanks! I'm super excited. Mentee 2023-05-25, 09:24: the move was a lot to deal with since there are so many things going to storage, and our cat ran away as we were getting him in the car. but we have him back now. my parents said we wont be at the place we're currently at for long since its only temporarily. I think things are going ok now though. I hope things are going well with you Mentee 2023-05-25, 13:52: i think i know what topic i want to talk about first next time you have time. and i think i figured out my password for this account. so i can maybe talk more later if i can sign in on my other laptop at my house. Mentor 2023-05-27, 07:11: Of course! Let me know the topic so I can open up the conversation. Also, feel free to ask questions whenever (they don't need to be related to the topic, this is very casual. Things are going well with me:) I'm currently exploring what being a doctor can look like in small towns. It's been very fun! I'm glad you found the cat!! Mentee 2023-05-29, 08:54: I'm kind of curious about college, what do they usually look for in a student when they transfer there? should I even bother going to one? Mentor 2023-05-29, 21:40: What a great question! Each College/University is going to be very different in what they look for in a student. Most will look at grades, extracurricular activities, awards, etc. Some may be more competitive or expensive than others, so it is helpful to talk to an advisor (if you have one at your school). You can start thinking about: - how much you want to pay - if you want to move (what location) - what you want to study - how it contributes to your future goals/career etc. To answer your second question, ""should I even bother?"" I think this is completely up to you! It depends on what you want career you see yourself doing and if going to college will help you get there. I hear lots of great points from people who didn't go to college because it didn't apply to them, and other great stories of people who learned so much about themselves from completing a college degree. Does that make sense? There is an overwhelming amount of information online, but it doesn't hurt to start thinking about what you want to do and different options of getting there:) If you don't know what you want to do, its worth it to explore options, but there's also no rush! Some people work for a few years before they decide. Others go to college without knowing and might figure it out during their studies. Long story short. There is no right answer:) Mentee 2023-05-30, 08:52: Oh ok, thanks:) I really wish I could have replied sooner. this account is starting to annoy me. I changed my password but its still sayng something is wrong, and I cant even unlock it because I dont have my school email on my phone. Mentor 2023-05-30, 13:15: I'm sorry! That sounds challenging.

I was about to try and make a new account lol. but my account is fixed now I think. I hope everything goes well for you well youre traveling. Mentee 2023-06-02, 17:18: Whenever you have time, I have another subject in mind to talk about. do you know if veterinairian schools are strict or not? I know some colleges are strict about education, but are colleges worse than highschool? was it hard to get degree in veterinary college? I'm just kind of scared I wont get into one in the future because I feel like I won't be accepted because of my grades.I think I'm going to try to be better next year though, but its not going to be fun knowing my friend won't be there. Shes's moving away to victoria, and I will remain here away from her, in port alberni. I'm really going to miss her but she did add me on facebook, its still not the same though, because she isnt going to be in the same school as me. she was my only friend, so I'll be lonely next year. anyways, next year is going to be hard but I'll try to manage all the work they're going to give me and Ill try my best. Mentee 2023-06-02, 17:22: I'm sorry thats a lot to read, I tend to have a lot on my mind. Mentor 2023-06-09, 23:29: Hi ! I apologize that I've been so busy! Ireland has been amazing, but I haven't been able to get wifi for long periods of time. I'm sorry to hear about your friend. It is always tough when important people in your life move away. I hope you can keep in touch and maybe have a few road trips to see eachother. I think it depends on how hard univeristy is to highschool. I think that it can be challenging in many ways as you might have to relocate, adjust to life with a roommate or on your own, manage money, learn how to manage your time as teachers expect you to be organized and keep track of all the assignments and due dates, and the content that you learn will likely be more complex than what you learned in highschool. But highschool is supposed to prepare you for this! It's very normal for university to sound scary. Because it it! It's a whole lot of new things. But, it can also be the best few years of your life. It's a great opportunity to try new things, make friends, and figure out who you are as a person and what you want to do with your life. Veterinarian schools are typically quite challenging as it is a second degree (but don't worry about this until you finish your first degree). What this means is that you need 3-4 years at university before you can even go to a veterinarian school. I totally understand your worries about getting accepted to a veterinarian school as they are quite competitive. However, they shouldn't need to look at your highschool grades. Typically they assess grades from university. They also will look at extracurricular activities such as music, art, sports, community work etc. This helps the school decide if they think you would be a good fit, and if you can manage the demanding schedule. It sounds like you're already thinking about your future and making the changes to do what you want! That's great:) Mentor 2023-06-09, 23:30: Let me know if you have any other questions. Or if I didn't answer one of your questions well enough. Mentee 2023-06-12, 08:54: thats great to hear that you're having fun in ireland! I have not been feeling the best lately. It kind of feels like my favorite friend is starting to get bored of me, I kind of started crying just the thought of that, but I think I'm starting to get over it now. I have not seen her for a few days so I hope she's ok. I can see by your message that you're doing really well, I'm really glad that one of us is happy these past few days. Mentee 2023-06-12, 08:56: would you have a recommendation for the best univerisities to go to before going to a veterinarian school? I know it probably doesn't even matter but I'm curious to hear what you have to say Mentor 2023-06-19, 01:10: Hi Raelynn, I'm sorry to hear about your friend! Friendships can be so hard to navigate, especially in highschool. I've definitely had my share of anxiety with friends/what the future might look like. Hang in there, it will get better:) Regarding schools, I think it's best to pick a University/College that: - is in your budget - makes you feel comfortable - is in a location that you want - is able to offer all the courses and opportunities related to your area of interest It shouldn't matter which school you go to before Veterinary school. They are just looking to see that you can handle a full course load, have experiences that relate to Vet work, strong community involvement, and involvement in extracurricular activities. After your 3-4 years of University (we call it undergraduate or undergrad) you can apply to Vet school. In Canada, I believe University of Saskatchewan is the school that takes students from BC. However, that could all change by the time that you need to apply (in 3-5 years). So it's best to stay updated on requirements and see how they change. What Colleges/Universities are you interested in? Do you want to stay closer to home or travel a bit further? I apologize for the late reply again! Just on the train to Dublin, and heading home soon:) Mentee 2023-06-20, 09:02: Thank you, yeah I'm really going to miss my friend, i dont think she knows I'm going to miss her. I think the university I want to go to is the University of Guelf in Ontario, because it just looks so fun, and I looked at the courses they had and I really want to try veterinary medicine and veterinary technology. I'm really going to miss seeing my friend, because she was my favorite out of all the friends I had, and I might not see her again after high school. I still have contact with her, but she doesn't talk a lot on social media:( I kind of feel like she will probably forget about me, because she has bad memory, but I will always remember her, and I know she could easily replace me because she can make anyone like her, she's just so sweet like that:) Anyways, its ok, I don't really mind late replies anymore. Mentor 2023-06-24, 07:47: The University of Guelf sounds great! Thats exciting to be thinking of schools already:) I think there are lots of opportunities around Guelf related to Vet Med. That's awesome. Again, I'm sorry to hear about your friend:( I hope you two can stay in touch and that you are able to make another friend in the meantime. How are you feeling about making friends in University? How are you feeling about moving away? Have you ever had to move that far before? In Medical School we don't get much time off, so lots of people say that the summer after our first year is one of the only long breaks we will get! So I'm packing it full. I have my sister and brother-in-law visiting this week and we hope to do some camping. Then, I'll be heading to Michigan to visit my partner's family. That being said, I will probably still be sending some late replies. Hope that's alright! Mentee 2023-06-27, 09:50: yeah my friend has not been responding to my texts mainly because she has a really old beat up phone from her sister so her notifications and meeages dont always show for her. at first i didnt believe her but then how broken her phone was, im surprised she still bothers to use it, but i guess its because its all she has and her mom cant get her a new one. I am kind of nervous about the university no gonna lie. I'm kind of worried they might not exept me for my grades, but there is lots of time before i worry about that, I'm gonna try to do better next year and for year 12. I can't wait to meet new people there, i heard you could meet a lot of new people and make lots of friends. I still dont know which one i want to go to, because there is more than one university of guelf. I want to go experience a university in a small town, but i also want to go to a city. there is lots of time to think about it though. I have not moved that far before, my parents said if i were to move anywhere out of our town they would come with me. i dont know if they will feel the same way when the time comes, my parents can be very forgetful. moving that far away feels kind of exiting but also scary because im going to be on my own, literally, because i have no family members in ontario. so i dont know if my parents still want to come or not. thank you for telling me about how you get no break in medical schools, its nice to have a mentor who knows quite a few things about this stuff, because i would probably not trust you if you knew nothing about medical schools haha. of cource its ok to send late replies. it is summer. and its nice to hear that you have stuff going on in your life instead of just being like me, just sittinng around the house haha. Mentor 2023-07-11, 11:33: Hi Raelynn, I just flew back home last night so trying to respond as quickly as I can:) I'm sure your friend still appreciates hearing from you even if she can't always respond on time! Is there a school counselor or advisor that can help look over your grades and see how they can best support you going to your favorite schools? Hahah, that is fair enough. Glad you can trust me haha. I got an email from ReMBC that they are going to be ending mentor relationships. If you feel like you have asked all the questions that you wanted then I can let them end the program. However, if there are any more questions on your brain or you want to continue chatting then I'm happy to send messages as I can:) Just let me know in the next few days as I think they will be finishing up the program soon. Enjoy summer:) Go get outside or be creative. You'll miss all this free time later on in life, trust me! Mentee 2023-07-11, 18:29: Heyy, so I figured out how to see my grades, you just go on my blueprint. Also I think I'm just gonna stop talking to my friend for awhile, after all she will be busy this month cus she is moving away very soon. I wish I didn't reply so late, I had some more questions to ask. But I won't have the time since I'm currently on the canoe journeys. I'm going to be really busy this month, I have to get the canoe ready to use for next week. We're going to paddle to America, I'm currently in Canada in a little rez called hut springs, I'm not sure how to spell it properly but I believe that's how you pronounce it. I will try to enjoy life and make memories as I go on with life. I know it's not always going to be easy, but good things will come eventually, you just have to wait. It was nice talking to you Lindsey:) Mentor 2023-07-13, 10:01: Enjoy your trip! It was so nice chatting with you:) Best of luck with your future goals and plans.","Mentor 2023-05-16, 14:29: Hi Raelynn, No worries about the late reply. I'm sorry for my late reply as well, I think my computer was having a few troubles with notifications! Hope school is going well! I've opened up the from rural to urban conversation as I know other students have enjoyed this one. However, if there is a certain conversation guide that you would prefer then I can definitely open that up. Just let me know:) I also wanted to keep you posted that I will be away from June 6-20. I'm going hiking in Ireland and will have limited access to the internet, so if I take longer to reply that is why:) I'll be sure to tell you about it when I'm back. Lindsay",,,,

I see you like working with kids, we have that in common! I used to be an Au Pair overseas (like a live-in nanny) and loved it. Kids are so fun and surprisingly can teach you a lot. I always love seeing the world from their little eyes. Do you have a favourite age range you'd want to teach? When I was a nanny I looked after 1.5-5 year olds. I enjoyed photography in highschool too. It's a nice change from the writing or math heavy courses, hey? I remember making these cardboard box/pinhole cameras. Do you still make those in photography? Let me know if you have any questions and then we can get started on the ""Getting Hired"" conversation! Mentee 2023-04-04, 12:45: Hi Emily, I'm interested in teaching ages 4-10.

I wasn't able to open it, so I just requested access. I'm glad your interview went well at McDonalds! Did you know someone that worked at The Home Restaurant? There have been a couple of times where I didn't have an interview at a job since I knew someone who worked there. Mentor 2023-04-11, 09:34: Which module would you like to work through first? Mentor 2023-04-11, 09:37: Also, before we move on could you send me a job you'd like to apply for? I know you already have a job, but we can discuss 4 skills the employer is looking for. We can match your skills to what the employer is looking for! Mentee 2023-04-11, 09:51: Okay sounds good my teacher said we can have all three open so the well-being and self-care, confronting discrimination, and career exploration. I did know someone at the Home Restaurant that's how I got the job so that was nice and easy. I'm happy with my job right now and being a waitress/hostess some skills I know I have and need are communication, risk taking on my own, positive attitude, and another good skill is desision making. A job I want in the future is something to do with working with kids I'm not sure what all my options are, I always hear teacher but I would like to know and explore other options in the future Mentor 2023-04-11, 10:09: I've worked in quite a few restaurants myself. My first job was hostessing at Red Robin when I was 16. I miss getting tips, that's for sure! Those are all very important skills. Yes, teaching is definitely one of the many options if you want to work with kids. There's also being a nanny/au pair, early childhood educator, summer camp director, teacher's aide, dance or music teacher, pediatric nurse, pediatrician, child psychologist, pediatric occupational therapist, or speech-language pathologist. There's more jobs working with kids than you think! I was an au pair when I was 18-21, so if you ever want to know more about it, let me know. Mentor 2023-04-11, 16:05: I just made some revisions to your resume and added a couple of comments. Let me know if you have any questions and if you end up adding your current job and want me to edit it, I'd be happy to!",,

I am a 4th year nursing student at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) in Prince George and saw in your profile that you wanted to go into nursing as well! I would love to answer any questions you have regarding nursing. I am also queer and am not a good cook either, although I do like to try making new foods. I hope you're having a great day and were able to navigate your way through MentorCity. I was wondering if there was a specific topic you would like to start with first? Mentee 2023-04-06, 13:15: Hey! I don't know if you're still here to respond. I got caught up in some medical stuff. Queers never seem to be good cooks, lol. I am super excited to hear from you! I am passionate about a ton of things. My first question is in regards to the flexibility of spare time that the program allows. I want to live my life and do nursing but I'm not sure how possible that is. How open are the living options? Can I do nursing anywhere? I am excited to hear back from you. What are your pronouns? Thank you!!! Mentor 2023-04-08, 11:59: Hi Merrill, I hope you’re doing well! My pronouns are she/her. What are yours? Nursing can be quite intense, however, with effective time management, you are able to still balance different aspects of your life. Living options are fairly open with nursing, depending on where you want to go to school. There are many options including UNBC, TRU, UVic, and UBC. However, most of these programs are primarily in person and involve clinical placements where you may need to travel. With the nursing program at UNBC in Prince George, our theory classes are in person as well as our labs. In the past, they have been online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the year, we also have clinical placements which can vary in location, especially during the summer. I was also wondering which conversation you would like to learn more about! We can start with any of the ones listed including finding inspiration, different ways of knowing, from rural to urban, strategic studying, wellbeing &amp; self-care, dis &amp; misinformation, getting hired, agency in the world, confronting discrimination, career exploration, post secondary &amp; career planning, funding your future, or general discussion. Looking forward to hearing back, Alisha Mentee 2023-04-12, 09:02: Hey Alisha! My pronouns are they/he I think I'd like to start with getting hired. I haven't had a job before. Nothing I would declare as such. I work occasionaly for 3-4 days every month or two for a logging company but that's all. Where have you worked? What kind of experiences have you've had? I want a job where I am respected and one that can support me. I feel like as a socialist, I'll never fully feel respected or supported financially in the workplace but that's ok. I just want a good first job. Over the summer I'll be staffing a military camp for 7 weeks. I'll be a government employee. After that I'll be applying for a job here in Quesnel. My nursing program is in Quesnel aswell so I won't be paying for rent or food. I'll be living at home for probably the next two years. Mentee 2023-05-02, 13:46: Hey! Been a while Alisha. I'll get you that resume soon. I've been getting stuff done and working on stuff. Miss talking to you! Talk soon. Mentee 2023-05-02, 13:48: Also the video chat! I'd love to chat! Idk if ur doing it or if it's optional but if u can let me know. Mentor 2023-05-03, 23:54: Hi Merrill, It's great to hear back from you! I hope school is going well. You can complete the resume whenever you have some freetime. In the meantime, we can move onto Anchor Text 2 and work through the information there. I would love to video chat on June 1st from 5-7pm. I believe it's through the gather town space and the link will be provided closer to the date. If you are interested, let me know and I will make sure I attend! Have a great week, Alisha Mentor 2023-06-08, 12:19: Hi Merill, It's Alisha again! I know it has been a while since we had last talked, however, I know that the the program is soon coming to an end. I have enjoyed your conversations and hope you are able to gain some valuable information from these discussions as well. I would love for some feedback on how I did as a mentor as well, either positive or negative! Finally, if you have any further questions, I would love to answer them for you. Thank you so much for everything, it was a pleasure meeting you, Alisha",,,"Mentor 2023-04-13, 11:38: Hi Merrill, It’s great to hear back from you so quickly! That sounds great! I have opened up the getting hired conversation for us to work through. Any work experience is good! It’s amazing to hear that you already have some experience with the logging company and will be working with the military camp in the summer as well. Those are great employment opportunities which will provide you with new experiences and skills. Being respected in your employment is crucial. It can be difficult at times to find a workplace that appreciates you for who you are and respects your values, but it is possible. Don’t be scared of speaking up if you feel uncomfortable. Having supportive co-workers and management can make a significant difference. Through the nursing program, you will also have many employment opportunities especially after 2nd year. I was able to apply as an employed student nurse for the summer months (June to August) which is an amazing experience that helps consolidate nursing skills and make some money on the side. Some of my previous employment experiences including working at Micheals and at an events centre during high school. Personally, I have not had many jobs either, however, jobs can be amazing experiences with the right people. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon! Alisha Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:16: Hey Alisha, Imma follow the activities? They are a little confusing. I am supposed to tell you some examples of experiences. I have been doing presentations, performance arts and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada. All of these require a good level of listening and communicating. I have been commended on all of the three and feel I have experience communicating. BBBSoC also proved my responsibility. All of my performances whether it be acting or singing in my band shows the people around me can depend on me. I have been quick to learn guitar inmy strings class when put in a good learnign environment. I feel I have proven myself as a good learner. I feel as an actor and a vocalist as well as the work I do in the cadets program, I am a good, leader, follower and team worker. Tbh I am not that good with tech lol BUT as a quick learner i could easily bring up my typing speed or whatever. I think this is how it works. Sorry for typing so impersonally. I just don't know what the program wants. I will write up a resume for you but I am not looking for a job at the moment because I would immediately be leaving for 2 months to staff my ARMI course for cadets. Mentor 2023-04-19, 16:02: Hi Merrill, They can be confusing. If you press the getting hired button on the green circle, the page reloads to show the different aspects of the conversation. For the getting hired conversation, there are two different anchor texts to review. The first one is transferable skills and your first resume. You can go through and read the article under that heading and open up the discussed questions for more information. After we discuss the first anchor text, we can move on to the next one (the job interview). Those sound like amazing experiences! You have had so many diverse experiences with different skills that you were able to demonstrate. That is valuable. Tech can be difficult at times, but being a quick learner definitely helps with that. All of these experiences sound fantastic! They are all amazing experiences to include on your resume. While you are not currently looking for a job, it is great to have a template ready for when you will be applying in the future. It makes it easier during that time, as you only need to make a few adjustments. You can include all those experiences including Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada, performance arts, and even the Cadets program on your resume. You can also include the difference skills you mentioned including effective listener and communicator, reliable, quick learner, leader, and team player. Looking forward to seeing your resume!

I think you've picked out a very cool career path to pursue, I also want to go to medical school, so hopfully I can also be helpful in that area. My roommate is doing a minor in GRSJ (gender, race, sexuality and social justice) and I'd be happy to relay any questions you have about the program that you have to her. I'd love to hear more about your interests in musical theatre. Maybe as an icebreaker you could share your favourite musicals, or any musicals you've been in or like to be in. Are you currently in any musical theatre groups with your school? The last acting I did was in seventh grade when I was in Joseph and the Techincolor Dreamcoat with my school, after that I realized it wasn't for me lol. But I do really love the musicals Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera. As for this program, I've heard that you're participating with your class and you will be completing 4 conversations. I've mentored one other student partway through this program so far, so I'm still a little new to mentoring. Will you be working through the program during your class or on your own time? As for me, I do get a little busy sometimes with assignments or midterms, but I'll let you know if I'm headed into a busy path. I finish this term in end of April, so after that I'll be much more available. I'm very excited to work through the program with you and I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

That is ok that we didn't get to start on any discussions, I not sure what the course timeline looked like for you, so I'll leave that up to you and your teacher. I just wanted to let you know that I will be checking my email often this week in case you wanted to start any of the modules this week, but I am also more than happy to work through the course with you during the summer if you would like.

I see on your profile that you like playing video games as well! What kind of games do you usually play? I’m a big fan of RPG games like Dragon age and Divinity. I recently started hollow knight but I’m absolutely terrible at it. Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be more than happy to answer!! Some other things about me - I eat a ton of Korean food. It has to be my favourite though I'm usually pretty open to trying new things. I tried beef tartar with my friends and, surprisingly, it was quite good. My friends aren't that open to ""interesting"" foods but how about you? I try to eat healthy too, but I find it a little difficult since I’m horrible at cooking. Any tips? A quote that I really like is from J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be"". I think it's important to remember that our fate is within our hands. As we grow, it's up to us to make the decisions best for ourselves. That’s the reason why I always try my best even facing obstacles. Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:16: Hopefully this works cause finally now i have a moment to reply. But my firefighting course is super interesting and i really hope i can get the spot in the blackwater crew but its pretty competitive and im not the biggest or fastest in the course and the final physical test is coming up very soon so it's pretty stressful. Even if i fail i can get into a contract crew which is only slightly different, im just doing a lot less or just as much it just depends if crews need extra help and if they do then they call contract crews. It's the only class i actaully want to do stuff in and it's also the only class i care to do good in. Lowest test result i've gotten was a 80.5%. I play a lot of video games and both in the way of hours and games. I play a lot of FPS shooters or first person shooters, like call of duty and battlefield. I also play a few extraction shooter games like escape from tarkov and hunt showdown and also games like action and open world games like red dead redemption 2 which i've sunk over 1500 hours in since release in 2018. Me and my friends play some dungeons and dragons a bit too and currently my character is like that lion species and i named myself ""Puss In Boots"" and i try my best to roleplay his voice but ususally pretty badly. Im pretty much just answering your reply back cause i don't necessarily have any questions and im pretty bad at having conversations sometimes. Though about unique foods, i've had mostly very boring food that everyone knows or have tried but i almost had moose nose but it got eaten before i could try it. Im also terrible at cooking but i can make a bomb piece of toast. I think i've typed enough but as my last thing about me is that i listen to a lot of music to help motivate me to do anything like do something very difficult in my game or homework, sometimes. And it a lot of metal and like people remixing songs and turning normal songs into metal songs. I listen to pretty much everything and my favorite song would probably be ""Ballad of Jesse James"" because it sings about the guy that im named after and i also like it. But music helps me motivate myself and only if i could bring music to school would i maybe preform better or just motivate myself better in school. Also sorry if my grammer is bad, i know you graduated with a degree of english literature and language and are probably pulling your hair out looking at my mistakes that i've probably made or, are laughing at it. Mentor 2023-04-22, 22:10: Hi Jesse! Don’t stress about responding on time. I’m glad to hear from you whenever you get the chance : ) Please do let me know how the physical test for the firefighting course goes! I wish you all the best. Personally, I wouldn’t say I’m the smartest around here but with enough perseverance, I did manage to get to secondary school. Basically, hard work is where it’s at and not being top dog in everything ahhaha. Oh wow 80.5% as the LOWEST? That’s impressive. If you get into the contract crew, you do still have a chance for blackwater crew in the future? I don’t play a lot of shooters, so I don’t know much about Call of duty or battlefield, but I do know they’re super popular. How’s your aim? Mine is horrible, which is why I don’t play shooters. I do have Red Dead Redemption, but I only have 22 hours in it. 1500 hours is insane. Is it from multiple playthroughs? My friend actually taught me how to play poker using Red Dead Redemption lol. Maybe I’m terrible at aiming in games but I guarantee I can beat all those people in poker. I’ve always wanted to try dungeons and dragons, but I don’t have friends to try it with : (. If you’re “Puss in Boots”, is there a Shrek? Have you heard of Baldur’s Gate 3? It’s apparently modeled after dungeons and dragons. I’m waiting for it to come out of early access before I purchase it. I’m happy to receive answers! I think we’re having a pretty good conversation right now. Ok, I think I have to take back what I said about being open to trying new things. Maybe you’re braver than me. I don’t know if I would eat a nose (noses are kinda weird looking). I, too, can make a bomb piece of toast. Bomber than yours? That is yet to be determined. Music is a good motivator. I also like playing something in the background while I do boring things like washing dishes or homework. I took a listen to “Ballad of Jesse James”, and I must say I thought it would be a metal song lol. Got a metal recommendation? I don’t listen to metal, but I listen to rock sometimes. Is that similar? Did I commit a sin by comparing the two? I do have a degree in English; however, my grammar is not amazing either. I like to tell people I’m not a walking dictionary - just some person who read books for 4 years and got a degree for it. You could be laughing at my mistakes too! As long as I’m having an enjoyable conversation, grammar mistakes are nothing. Alriiight. Looks like your teacher wants us to get through 4 conversations of your choice. Let me know what sounds the most interesting to you and I’ll go ahead and unlock those. If you have any questions about them, send a quick msg. I’ll get back to you ASAP. Mentor 2023-06-11, 19:28: Hi Jesse! We're close to wrapping up, but I wanted to say it was an absolute pleasure getting to know you :) I wish you the best of luck with your firefighting aspirations - it's honestly amazing. I'm here if you have any other questions, if you want to continue working on this program, or even if you want to continue chatting. I'm always open, so let me know : )",,,,,

Small town to a big city, etc. Mentor 2023-03-17, 01:04: Hey Naylene, it's great to hear from you! That's so cool that you're heading to UBC soon, that must be exciting for you (and a bit nerve-wracking too I'm sure). It was definitely a big change for me when I moved here 3 years ago from a small town near Calgary, Alberta. The biggest difference I noticed right away was there are many more people and there's a lot more diversity here at UBC. Most people at my high school didn't really try very hard in school, and a lot didn't end up pursuing higher education. Then when I came here I was suddenly around a lot more motivated people, which was refreshing. There's also a lot more opportunities of course! You're bound to find a club or intramural activity you like. Living in residence also helped me meet more people and made everything a lot more convenient in terms of committing to activities and getting to class. Do you have any idea what you want to major in yet? And do you know if you're going to be living in residence or off campus?",,,,,
1047586133,10/27/2022 16:10,1047594594,59877,,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-22, 15:32: Great to meet you, Willow! I’m so excited to be working with you as we move through different modules. Hopefully you’ll find some of the information we cover beneficial to the remainder of your time in high school, as well as your pursuits in post secondary school. We seem to have a lot in common in terms of hobbies and career goals, so if you’re ever interested in swapping recipes or trading book recommendations, please feel free! I see that you’re considering a career in social work— which is really such an important field. It’s amazing what types of changes you can inspire in people’s lives when you help them gain access to opportunities and resources, and our province really needs more people who are passionate about social work. While I myself and studying psychology, there are a lot of ever-laps between psychology, social work, and sociology, so if you have any questions about career choices, we can investigate into that together. Your teacher does not seem to have specified any particular conversations that we need to have in order for you to complete the modules, so I think the best route for us to take would be selecting the conversations that best align with your goals. Since you’re interested in attending a bachelor program in college, I think that covering “strategic studying,” “dis and misinformation,” and “funding your future” would be a good idea. You also mentioned that you want to learn more about avoiding debt and saving money. I’m really lucky to have so many universities in my home city, so I personally haven’t had to deal with the struggle of working full time while in school. That being said, anything conversations related to finance that we decide to cover will probably benefit both of us. I think that the “Post Secondary and Career Planning,” “Career Exploration,” “Getting Hired” conversations would also be great for us to cover, since they focus on the financial aspects of life that you’re interested. Keep in mind that if anything that you’re interested is not covered, we can always do some investigating ourselves. Let me know what you think of this plan going forward. You’re in charge here, so if you want to cover something other than what I’ve mentioned, or don’t want to cover one of the conversations I’ve listed, just let me know. I really look forward to getting to know you better. I hope you have an excellent spring break, and I’ll talk to you soon! Mentor 2023-04-13, 16:05: Hi Willow! I hope you're doing well and had an exciting spring vacation. I noticed that you haven't given any feedback regarding which of the conversations you're interested in starting with. I'm sure that this is a busy time of the school year for you, so if you're feeling overwhelmed or not knowing where to start, please reach out to me so I can help you out. Before I open our first conversation, I'd really like to know what subject you're interested in starting with. Mentor 2023-05-13, 14:57: Hi Willow! I hope your school year is treating you well and that you aren't finding your studies overwhelming. I've never gotten the chance to hear from you or get to know you, so I'm assuming that you have a lot going on in your personal and academic life. I do understand that this course may not be the most exciting for you, but I want to assure you that if you put aside just 2 hours a week we can work through your course requirements easily before the deadline your teacher has set. Please reach out to me when you can this week so that we can get your started on your course work. If you need help or are feeling confused don't hesitate to reach out!",,,,,

I am in my second year of undergrad studies in a pre-med program, so I am very farmiliar with the sciences and having a busy schedule. In my spare time I love playing sports, mostly volleyball and softball, and I like riding my motocycle. I grew up in a very small town and am currently studing in a small town as well so I am very farmiliar about the transition from high school to college in a small town. I am very open to speak on anything you have questions about regarding anything to do with schooling. Let me know if you have any quations and I will respond truthfully and honestly to give you the most realistic depitction of post-secondary I can give you.

Well, I’ll just start off with a quick little introduction. I am 20 years old, and currently in my third year at UBC studying Chemical Biology. My favorite subject would probably be genetics or organic chemistry. Now, I hope you could tell me more about yourself... it could be anything. What're your hobbies or your favourite subject? And of course, if you ever have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask! Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:00: this was a required assignment for my class. Mentor 2023-04-22, 07:30: Sure!

Not sure what to expect here but got lots of questions and interested in what I can learn Mentor 2023-03-16, 13:25: Hey!! Let's start off by having you tell me a bit about yourself. Also, love the energy btw :) Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:24: I moved to Canada at the age of 6 from the UK where i was born in Wales on a horse breeding farm. I've been a horse rider for most of my life, competing as a showjumper. Horses have been the main passion, again, for most of my life. I only have a few months left in highschool thankfully. After I leave highschool, I plan to take a gap year, finish the couple of online courses I still have left. Throughout the year, I will aplply to work at different barns and stables, gaining experience and to raise the funds I need for university courses. I've been looking at universities back in the Uk, down in the states, and also the only university in Canada with equine courses, Guelph university in Ontario. How about you? Mentor 2023-04-08, 00:26: Wow it sounds like you really enjoy horses! I wish I learned how to ride it seems like such a cool skill. As for me, I was born in Trinidad which is like a super small island in the Caribbean and moved to Canada when I was 3. I graduated UBC last year with a major in biology and am taking a gap year right now before hopefully going to med school. I really enjoy being outside and doing fun activities like hiking, swimming, etc. I also love travelling with Australia being my all time favorite place! Also, not too sure about equine studies in the states or UK, but my friend graduated last year from Guelph university with a EQM and said it was an amazing program! Mentee 2023-04-21, 14:54: And what's your plan for the gap year? Mentee 2023-04-21, 14:55: When you're planning for your gap, are you travelling? Or moving out to work elsewhere? Mentor 2023-04-26, 22:00: I'm pretty much just working at an eyecare clinic and volunteering at hospitals and crisis lines. Essentially, I am using the gap year to build up my med profile. I am also going to Hawaii in the summer. What do you think you'd do during your gap year if you end up taking one? Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:39: I'm definitely taking a gap year because after school breaks up for the summer, I still have several online courses left over which I still have to complete. Also I feel a gap year is important to gain experience before approqaching universities. For me, I'm taking a gap year, again, to give me the time to complete the rest of my courses, and also I plan on applying to different riding stables and breeding barns, and spend a year as a working student, aiming higher and higher before I apply to universities Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:40: When you signed up for your universities courses, did you have to deal with moving? paying your own rent and other bills? Mentor 2023-05-11, 00:31: Ya, I decided to stay on campus residence for my first year and got a meal plan (so I didn't have to cook). Being away from family was probably the most challenging part for me but it also helped me gain some independence. After my first year, I lived off campus with some friends, which was interesting. Both of us had never actually lived on our own before so we were trying to figure out how to split rent and other living costs like food. I would highly recommend just setting up an automatic payment for any monthly bills like rent, phone, and electrical/water bills since you'll never be late for them. Mentee 2023-05-16, 13:52: And how did you afford university courses, your rent and grocery bills? Did you take out a bank loan or a student line of credit? Did you work while in university? Mentee 2023-05-17, 12:12:  Mentor 2023-05-19, 19:53: I worked part time while in university as a medical office assistant. But taking out a student line of credit or loan is a feasible option especially now since interest is not going to accumulate while you are at school. Mentee 2023-05-23, 13:49: And what's your plan for your immediate leave from uiniversity? Mentor 2023-05-25, 13:20: My aim is to go into medical school and then go straight to work. School is always very stressful, especially when juggling multiple things, so I find it essential to have different ways to destress. I like to read, go to the beach, and hike. What are some ways you like to destress/self-care?",,,,,

Now we are back to school with the work (essays, tests) all out of the break. Keep your head in the school mindset after a break this close to being completely done with high school it's difficult. So far in the span of four days, I've had to write an essay, paragraph, tests, and a paper on everything we have learned for the last three months. We are doing an article in my English class and once we have finished it we publish it to a class website for the rest of the class to comment on and like. Which I find a bit scary for people to read what I wrote about. When I write in the first person I get very emotional and venerable.

Do you enjoying the classes? Another question too. How do you manage to earn enough money in order to support your needs without working sixty hours a week and not being overloaded with work? Hope this reaches you and again apologies for the late reply. Mentor 2023-04-08, 16:53: Hey Jaiden, Yes, I have now graduated and am working as a nurse. I had to do high school chemistry as a prerequisite but none in nursing school, although I do like it. For the most part I liked nursing classes, although just like with any degree, there are ones youre not going to like. I liked the biology classes and the hands on skills classes where we practice medical skills but not the theory classes. To respond to your question about money, I had to live cheaply, work a little (but not too much so my grades stay up), apply for scholarships and many people also get student loans. Having some student loans isn't a bad thing because they typically give you grants with them (money you don't have to pay back) and you don't have to start paying the loans back until 6 months after you graduate I think. Mentee 2023-04-15, 18:49: Hello Evan, Quick question again. Did you ever have to create a capstone? And if so what are some of the main ideas you had for them? I'm currently trying to come up with an idea competent enough that isn't some silly little idea that can be easily done yet is still doable. I've had many other ideas yet I can't quite figure one out that would impress the judges. Mentee 2023-04-15, 19:27:  Mentor 2023-04-16, 17:12: Hey Jaiden, I never had a capstone project in highschool but my advice would be to pick something that you are knowledgeable about, passionate about, and/or related to an area/field you want to work in one day. If you are already knowledgeable about a topic you can create something much more impressive with less effort than a topic you don't know much about. This will reduce the time you need to spend researching. If you want to impress the judges, besides doing a good job, consider how much the judges know about the topic. If it's a topic they are very familiar with, it may be harder to impress them and they will be able to be more critical of the project. Picking a topic related to a field you're interested in is a good idea, because it will help you learn more, so you can decide if it's an area you actually want to work in. Also, you could talk about your experience with admissions or an employer to demonstrate your knowledge in the field. Mentee 2023-04-16, 23:07: Hello, again Evan, After some brainstorming, I came upon this idea that I'm not too sure is alright or not. Was just wondering if this is a good topic idea that I've provided below. Why Rock Bottom Is Necessary And What You Can Gain From It Jaiden Pett Mentor: Evan, Brandon Janson Using different sources of information, and experiences from other people and myself. I plan to create a video essay on the topic of being at “Rock Bottom” in life. Curating different people's stories, and philosophical ideas such as combating loneliness, self-hatred, and other varying emotions that typically go through people as they would define as ‘rock bottom’. Compiling all information into a brief video essay on the said idea, hopefully, resonating with the judges and other individuals who have the maturity to understand the topic and give it attention, as well as making the judges really think about the topic during the judging process. Now you may be wondering ‘How does this show your excellency?’ The key part is what I gained from it. Which I will show with varying sources of information such as personal accounts from friends and family, personal narratives, and overall well-being. Mentor 2023-04-17, 00:07: Hey Jaiden, I think that's a great topic. Mental health challenges and struggle in life is something many people can relate to, but don't often feel comfortable talking about. Bringing this kind of stuff out into the open, especially with a powerful delivery method like a video essay, is a great idea. It is especially relevant in post covid-lockdown times, which had a really big impact on people, especially youth. Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:37: Thank you for reviewing my capstone project idea, it means a lot. Another question (sorry there's quite a few at this point.) What type of job or what job did you work while in school? Currently thinking about my options for summer work, and once colleges open up as well. Mentor 2023-04-17, 16:34: No problem, that's what I'm here for. During school I worked at a grocery store (superstore) for a bit, then I worked as a health care aid, because once I did a year of my nursing program I was considered to have the skills needed to be a health care aid. When looking for a job to do during school, definitely look for something that's not too physically or mentally exhausting if possible, I personally avoided fast food and cashier jobs which are pretty fast paced and instead started with a job stocked shelves which I found more slow paced, but that's personal preference. I would also recommend finding something that is flexible in terms of the hours you work and taking time off because school can be unpredictable and sometimes you may need time off for exams, a big project ect. Another idea that one of my friends did in university was he worked his butt off during the summer's landscaping (typically pays better than minimum wage), but you could do any summer job, and saved up so that he didn't even need to work during the semester which made things easier. Mentee 2023-04-20, 21:11: Are you satisfied with the current work you're doing right now? Any regrets that you had while attending college/university that you wish you could change? (you don't have to answer this one) I plan to work over the summer a fair bit just as your friend did as well, and just a good opinion on jobs that require you to drive around would be nice too. Mentor 2023-04-22, 19:18: Yes I'm pretty satisfied with the work I'm doing right now. The reality of any job is that it won't be very exciting eventually when you do it every day, but I feel a sense of fulfilment with the work I do, since I'm directly helping people. I don't have any regrets. Would probably socialize and make more friends though. I've never had a job where I had to drive around but I think that would be cool. Just make sure you have the right type of license, I would think a lot of employers would want you to have your full license and not an N. What kind of job were you thinking of? Some kind of delivery job? Mentee 2023-04-24, 10:11: I was thinking along the lines of car part delivery driver, or anything really as I got a new car and just want to do something with it, they also make better money then minumim wage so it's an idea. Mentor 2023-04-24, 22:43: Yeah that sounds like a nice job. Good to put on the resume. Have you applied anywhere yet? Mentee 2023-04-27, 12:32: Bunch of places, yet they all say they would rather hire someone who'll stick around for a few years. These are minimum wage jobs i'm applying for. Really don't know if I stay jobless until fall since nowhere seems to want employees, yet they're all seemingly 'desperate' for workers. Or if I just work an extra year (gap year) and then apply in 2024. Don't really know. Mentor 2023-04-28, 00:37: Yeah that's annoying. I wouldn’t recommend talking about how you only want a temporary job when applying. It might scare them away before they even consider you. Apply as if you plan on staying for a while and if you only end up staying temporarily then that's fine. If they directly ask you about it, I would say something like, ""although I'm currently looking for temporary work, if the job is a good fit, and the hours can fit my academic schedule, I would consider longer term employment"" I would recommend speaking directly to the people doing the hiring when possible, and not just dropping a resume off or applying online. Making a personal connection can really have a big impact. Also, leverage any personal connections of friends and family, do they know anyone who is hiring?",,,,,

I was born and raised in the interior of the province. I am going to UBCO in Kelowna next year to study political science and history. I want to have a career in local government, or a carereer in journalism after I graduate from university. I enjoy playing sports. My favourite sports are hockey and track &amp; field. I love spending time outdoors and going on walks. I am a bit anxious to leave my town and move somewhere new where I don't know anyone. I was wondering if you have any advice on how to meet people when you first get to university. Mentor 2023-03-13, 12:31: Hi Jeff, I'm Estelle! That is really exciting - congratulations on getting into and choosing a great post-seocndary program! It sounds like you've got a pretty solid idea on what you want to do which is great. On the flipside it is totally natural to feel a bit anxious about moving away from home and starting a new chapter but I can assure you that university is a really great experience all around. The advice I would offer for meeting people and making connections once starting university is just to put yourself out there (in any way you want to and feel comfortable doing). This could take form in a number of different ways such as joining clubs and sports teams (whether competitive or intramural) where you can meet people with similar interests. Since you enjoy playing sports, joining a sports team could be a great opportunity to make some great connections! I also found that university in general always has events going on and orientation is typically geared towards helping students make the transition into post-secondary education and meeting people. Although it might seem a bit daunting, a big part of university is meeting people and you might be surprised by how organically it happens! You can also meet a lot of people in your classes/conferences (I don't know if UBC is the same as where I went for undergrad but for arts classes there are typically ""conferences"" which are smaller subsections within a given class where you participate and discuss readings with a TA and you end up getting to know the people in your conference pretty well by virtue of it being a much smaller group than your typical lecture). Hope this helps! And let me know which modules you're interested in covering! Mentee 2023-03-14, 14:40: Hi Estelle! Thank you for the response it was very informative and helpful. Some modules I would be interested in covering are strategic studying, well being &amp; self care, finding inspiration, and career exploration. I am wanting to know some of the best places to study in university (dorm, library, common area, etc). I also am interested in knowing some ways to keep your well being and self care good while at university. Especially during midterm season and in the winter. I am planning on staying on residence for my first year of university as I think it'll be the best way to meet people, but I was wondering if in your opinion staying on residence is better than staying off campus after your first year. I was also wondering how many hours of studying on average should I do in a day. I want to make sure that I am doing well in my courses but also balancing out my other activities and hobbies. Mentor 2023-03-14, 14:52: Glad it was helpful! It's great that you're thinking about all of these things. When it comes to studying I think it really depends on the person. Just because you're starting university it doesn't necessarily mean you need to change your study habits (ie if you typically study in your room and that works for you then there's no reason to change that up!) but at the same time it is also a good time to experiment with different study habits if you like. Studying at the library is pretty common in university, especially when midterm/finals season rolls around. Some residences also have dedicated study rooms which are a bit more intimate than a library and you can study with friends etc. I think its great that you'll be staying in residence in 1st year - I met a lot of my good friends that way! I think regarding where to live after 1st year - again - it really depends on the person and how you feel about your first year experience. Some students end up loving living in residence and continue to do so throuhgout their undergraduate education while some others move off campus (there are also other factors to consider like finances, it can be more affordable sometimes to move off campus and live with roommates for ex or maybe you just won't necessarily want to be on campus all the time). Personally, after my first year I moved off campus with a couple of friends I had made in residence in first year. And you will get a better idea once you're in school year experiencing life in residence and meeting people! For study habits, again it really depends on the person and what you're studying. It is important to keep on top of your work but I also whole heartedly believe that university is about much more than just learning/classes and its good that you want to keep up with your hobbies and activities (those will help with maintaining good mental wellbeing and self care too!). I think first semester is really a learning curve - you will figure out what works for you in terms of how much time to put into studying, where you like to study, what study habits overall work best for you etc. Personally, I didn't change too much from how I studied in high school because that's what worked for me. I did experiment a bit with studying in the library and I would say the amount of time I spent studying did increase but not as much as I thought it would. I was nervous before starting university that I might be overwhelmed by the amount of work and being able to balance school with extra curriculars and having a social life but I really think it all ends up balancing out naturally so long as you set your priorities! I hope that was all helpful and your questions are all great and very on topic with the modules you want to cover. Let me know which module you would like to start with and we can proceed! Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:05: Hi Estelle, sorry for taking so long to respond. I have been busy with my scholarship applications. Thank you for answering my questions about studying, the information was very helpful. Going forward I was thinking that some topics we could discuss could be moving from rural to urban, well being, and different ways of knowing. Order doesn't matter to me in which topic we cover first. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day! Mentor 2023-04-22, 13:00: Hi Jeff, no worries - it's good to hear from you. I'm glad the information was of some help to you. We can start by proceeding to the move from rural to urban. Hope you have a good day as well!","Mentor 2023-04-22, 13:01: Hi Jeff, I've unlocked the rural to urban module so whenever you're ready we can get started with the 1st set of discussion questions! Mentee 2023-05-08, 11:09: Hi Estelle, I have completed the rural to urban module and found it quite useful. Here are three things I like about living in a rural area. 1. I know a lot of the kids because I've grown up with them 2. That it is quite calm and not overwhelmingly busy in town 3. That there is a ton of stuff you can do in nature Two things that I don't like about living in a rural area are 1. It is quite boring in a small town 2. There are not a lot of events that I can attend (Ex. concerts, sporting games, bars, etc.) Some questions that I have for you include... - What do you like and dislike about living in a city? - How did you find ways to make and meet friends in a new city? - How did you stay in contact with loved ones when you were away from home? Thank you for taking the time to read my response. I was also wondering if you would be able to be my mentor for my capstone project. I am writing a short story and printing it out to show to my class. I will also have a slideshow explaining how I created the story and the core-competencies I used while writing my story. If you could I'd greatly appreciate it! The nect module we can discuss could be well being and self care. Again thank you for taking the time to read my response. :) Mentor 2023-05-17, 22:09: Hi Jeff, it's great to hear from you! I liked your answers about the pros of rural living. Personally, some things I like about living in the city include east access to things generally (eating, shopping, people, various services etc), the fact that there's always things to do (concerts, sporting events etc) and that things tend to be open later than in rural areas. Some things that are less favorable about living in the city are the higher cost of living and the fact that you kind of need to plan more if you want to do something out in nature (like a hike or going skiing etc). Finding friends in a city can be challenging but I find that the University setting is highly conducive to making great long term friends. You end up organically meeting all kinds of people whether it be from classes, residence, sports or other extra curriculars! Staying in contact with friends and family when you're away at school is really important! I would say it's really key that there be mutual effort to sustain whatever level of communication you and your family/friends feel is necessary to maintain your relationship. For me I FaceTime my close friends abroad a lot and I call my family quite often too. I think it just varies on each of your individual relationships and you can figure out what works best for you but I think it's great that you're already thinking about how best to go about maintaining those relationships. It's helpful to have people outside of your university network that you can keep in touch with. I have not mentored someone for their capstone project before and I personally never did one so I can look into whether I would be an appropriate mentor for you and get back to you. If not, I can try putting you in touch with someone who might be a good fit! And I will unlock the well-being and self care model so we can proceed with it! Mentor 2023-05-25, 07:27: Hi Jeff, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that I would be happy to mentor you on your capstone project - how would you like to proceed? Let me know how I can help!",,,,

I find the stratagy from the video that I use the most would have to be spaced practice. I find it works best for me beacasue I need to let the information set in my brain before I study more. I was wondering how your experience with studing has changed or developed since you were in high school, and what have you learned from that development?

Since high school, my study habbits have changed from things like passively writing notes to doing more active recall activities.

I spend a lot of time at the beach when I visit, I spend hours swimming and combing the beach. Baking and cooking are very calming and nostalgic for me, I would bake with my nana as a child and have many fond memories of it.

Lets talk about study strategies :) Theres a lot of helpful info in this activity - let me know if you have any questions as you go through it. How do you study now? What kinds of strategies have you tried? I've tried a lot of different things through the years. One of the biggest changes I've made through the years is trying to get away from passive studying (ie reading notes, highlighting, writing notes) to more active studying (doing flashcards, quizlet, etc. Have you ever heard of the software Anki?). I think things like active recall and spaced repetition have evidence for being more effective ways to study (active recall is like when you are doing flashcards and quizzing yourself, and spaced repetition means reviewing one topic one day, then maybe a few days later you come back to that topic and review it again). All this being said, its not always easy to make these changes and depends on how much time you have to study! I see the Pomodoro technique is also mentioned above and I use that too sometimes - I find its particularly helpful when I'm having trouble focusing and have a long day of studying ahead of me. Have you ever tried it?","Mentor 2023-04-19, 06:18: Ok! I've opened the funding your future activity! A super important topic :) Lets go through the first Anchor text and a few of the discussion questions. Are there any questions you have in particular? Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:44: Thank you :) The anchor 1 test question I'd like to ask is how are you funding your education? Did you use scholarship money or just your savings? And do you think a scholarship is worth applying for and have any recommendations? Other than that I can't really think of any questions at the moment. Mentor 2023-05-07, 09:44: Yes I definitely think scholarships are worth applying for! Advice though would be to make sure to read the requirements carefully before starting to apply to make sure you meet the requirements before spending time applying :) sicne the applications can be a bit time-consuming. Is there a scholarship you're thinking of applying to? I used a combination of things throughout my education, I recevied some scholarships, I used my savings, and I was also lucky to have some contribution from my family to help. I worked through my undergrad degree (in the summers and also doing co-op job placements - through my undergrad I did a total of 24 months of work placements so that really helped with funding my studies). Then before med school I worked for a few years so that also really helped! I would definitely recommend doing co-op if your program offers it! What are your plans for funding your education?","Mentee 2023-03-13, 11:35: Hi Melissa! :) Honestly I'm pretty excited for this oppurtunity. At the moment I work at a library and I've been told by my empoloyers I should pursue the career further. However that seems a little boring in my opinion. Other than that, I'm very lost career wise and would like to be able to explore more oppurtunities and hear about the path you took. I can't wait to hear back from you, Marina Mentor 2023-03-13, 12:13: Hi Marina! Thanks for your message. So nice to e-meet you. I’m currently in my third year of studying medicine at UBC and living in PG. Before med I studied engineering at UBC for my undergraduate degree, but I originally started off in general sciences. So I've bounced around a little bit to figure out what I wanted to do. I’m excited to get to know you throughout this program! It can be so hard to know/decide what you want to do. Are there any things you are drawn to/interested in and thinking of studying in post-secondary? A bit about me - I grew up mostly in BC and have lived in a couple places around the province including Vancouver Island, the Kootenays, Sunshine Coast, Vancouver, and Prince George! Lately I'm into pottery, swimming and skate-skiing. I have a super cute cat. What kind of things do you like doing? :) Happy to help any way I can. Let me know if you have any specific things you want to talk about! Also this page has some helpful info on how the program works so let me know if you have any questions about it before we move on. I've heard you're supposed to do 4 activities of your choice from this program - let me know which ones you want to do! Mentee 2023-04-06, 13:23: Hey! It's really nice to meet you too. :) Right now I'm in the Junior Wildfire Program and I'm thinking of possibly furthering my knowlege for that field. I'm also interested in fitness and history. All of your hobbies sound awesome, especially skate-skiing! My hobbies include reading, drawing, and weight lifting. For the first activity I'd like to do strategic studying. I find it really difficult to find a study strategy that works for me and I'd love to hear about the studying habits you've developed and your recommendations. Mentee 2023-04-11, 14:02: At the moment my main study strategy is reviewing what I learned and taking notes using flashcards. Once I put the information I need to study on flashcards I test myself by getting someone else to ask me questions on it. I've never heard of the software Anki before. I'll have to give it a try sometime! I've also heard of active recall, but I haven't heard of spaced redemption. Spaced redemption sounds like a really good strategy and I'll have to try it along with active recall :) I'll also have to try the Pomodoro technique because I've never heard or tried it. Mentor 2023-04-13, 06:40: Thats great you do flashcards! Yea anki is just an online software for flashcards. So it figures out the spaced repetition part for you, and you just have to create your cards! Pomodoro is really easy to try..all you need is a timer :) I often do 25 mins of studying and 5 mins break, and then repeat! BUt you can choose any breakdown of time you want. Hope thats helpful about study strategies. Any other questions? Which activity would you like to do next? Mentee 2023-04-18, 13:51: I might try that study habit as well! I found that was very helpful and I don't have any other questions. The activity I'd like to do next would be funding my future. Mentor 2023-06-08, 10:59: Hey Marina! it's been a while since I've heard from you. I think the program is wrapping up soon for you so I wanted to check in and see if you had any more questions or things you wanted to talk about? Mentee 2023-06-13, 13:55: Hey!

My dad and grandpa have fished in that area and my mom worked in archaeology near there and also worked with the professor in the video, Dr. Dana Lepofsky, so I have heard some of their stories too. I think that scientific and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other because sometimes the people of the land don't see the scientists or archaeologists as fully understanding. I think though that it is a benefit for both to work together and that both sides need each other to find out the history, like the digs finding artifacts and the traditional people kind of validating it. I also think that the two put together can piece the story together better. Here where I live, there is a big First Nation history that connects with explorers like Simon Fraser and also into the gold rush. Most of where we live is on their traditional territory and we learn a lot about it in school and can also take it as a second language. What is your connection to the land where you live? Is it similar to mine? Thanks, Marley Mentor 2023-05-19, 22:01: Hi Marley, I really like your response, it's very thoughtful. It's very cool how deep your connection to the land is. I think my connection to the land is different than yours. My parents are immigrants from Egypt + are naturalized Canada citizens, and our family moved around Canada a lot for work when I was younger so maybe my connection is not the typical one. I feel it reflected in my identity too... sometimes I'm a little sad I don't have roots. I can't wait to find a place to live and set down roots, and start living a more stable life. On the other hand, maybe that's given me a different connection to the land.. I've lived in both major cities and rural towns across Canada and went to schools there too, so I'm very lucky to learn so many stories that have enriched my knowledge. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on the rest of the module! Zee",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-04-09, 23:10: Hi Marley, No worries. I hope you've had a wonderful and relaxing break! I've opened up the topic, so it should be accessible now. I'm excited to hear what you think, I've just skimmed through it and there's interesting stuff in there. Zee Mentee 2023-04-23, 11:18: Hi Zee, After watching the video, ""Creative Process: Where do I start,"" there were so many methods to consider. Different people with completely different processes to portray their feelings or connections. For myself, I find that objects, animals or nature inspire me. These things vary depending on where I am and what I'm doing at that moment - whether in my yard observing the birds, out in the forest admiring the trees and moss or on a city street, analyzing the architecture. The trick is putting my visual into words. Where do you find inspiration in what you do? Is it through work or your free time or even whoever or whatever surrounds you or do you go out searching? What motivates you to pursue and continue to pursue your interests? Thanks, Marley Mentor 2023-04-26, 23:18: Hi Marley, I think I find the most inspiration through people, especially the work they do. I find that in work (e.g. the design industry) and in my free time. I get especially inspired after conversations with people, especially people I may have not talked much to before. I think it's really cool you feel inspired by nature! I'm not really sure what motivates me to pursue and continuing to pursue my interests, actually, I've never really thought much about it before. I guess maybe that I would like to make an impact, even in some small way? Because I get so inspired by other people, the idea of inspiring others also motivates me (which is a far cry from how I was a few years ago — I was very solitary and didn't care for others). I see that you've completed the conversation; What conversation would you like to begin next? Zee",,,,"Mentor 2023-03-13, 12:54: Hi, Marley! I'm Zee. I'm a 2nd year graphic design student at Vancouver Island University. I graduated from Port Hardy Secondary School (rural high school on the island) in 2018, and before I was in graphic design, I spent a year and a half in engineering at the University of Victoria. I had a lot of trouble choosing what to study at uni, so I relate to that part on your profile. I see on your profile you mentioned liking reading and writing — Those are things I also like doing. What you been reading recently? What kind of writing do you like to do? Recently, I've been reading Daring Greatly by Brene Brown. I want to pick up a fiction book after I'm done, but I'm not sure what book yet. I really like creative writing and journaling... A few weeks ago, I started a little blog, and it's been a lot of fun writing and editing things for it. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! Zee Mentee 2023-03-14, 16:18: Hi Zee, It sounds like we have a lot in common. I have written a couple of adventure-interdimensional short stories. I think eventually starting my own blog would be a good idea. My future, decisions, decisions. Currently I have been reading The Pilgrimage by Paulo Coelho - it sounds like an adventure I might like to do one day. Marley Mentor 2023-03-15, 20:15: Hi Marley, Adventure-interdimensional sounds so cool, I don't think I've ever met a writer who focuses on that genre. Urban fantasy is my favorite genre to write about (though I also love good ol' regular fantasy and sci-fi). I thought the name Paulo Coelho sounded familiar — I've heard of his other book, The Alchemist, but I've yet to read it. So, what conversation do you want to start first? Zee Mentee 2023-04-06, 16:19: Hi Zee, Sorry I haven't been in touch - I was on spring break. I would love to start with the inspiration topic - as this would open up so many avenues in my opinion. Mentee 2023-05-08, 16:08: Hi Zee, My next conversation I'd like to start is, general discussion. I look forward to our next conversation! Marley Mentor 2023-05-08, 18:01: Hi Marley, I've opened that conversation but there isn't anything in there, so maybe we should open another conversation too. What do you think? Zee Mentee 2023-05-12, 07:39: Hi Zee, Ok, let's try ""different ways of knowing."" Thanks, Marley Mentor 2023-05-14, 22:47: Hi Marley, I've opened that up for you! Zee Mentor 2023-06-07, 14:22: Hi Marley! It's been a while since I've heard from you, how have you been? I know you have until June 16th to complete our modules, and I don't want you falling behind! Zee Mentee 2023-06-12, 15:37: Hi Zee, Thank you for your time. I enjoyed talking with you. Our teacher said that we aren't continuing with this e-mentoring. All the best to you. Marley Mentor 2023-06-12, 15:51: Hi Marley, I enjoyed talking with you too, it was fun and interesting hearing what you thought about things. I wish you the best of luck, and hope that the program has helped you figure out your future plans, if even a little. Zee",,,,,

Currently I am on exchange in Australia! In my free time I enjoy spending time with pets, hanging out with my friends, reading and swimming. How about you? What are your hobbies? What is your favourite subject in school? Do you have any pets? I look forward to hearing from you and starting to go through this program! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me :). Have a great day! Rhianna Mentee 2023-03-14, 09:59: Hi Rhianna, my hobbies are mostly playing games, watching anime, reading webtoons (web comics generally made in South Korea) currently a total of 79 that release a new episode weekly, and listening to music. I don't really have a favourite school subject, although I greatly enjoyed chemistry I despised doing the labs so I didn't take it for grade 12. I have 1 dog named Jackie, and 2 cats one named Cous Cous, the other named Crow. Mentor 2023-03-15, 00:29: Hey Aiden! Your hobbies are super interesting and I love the names of your pets! The webtoons must keep you busy with all those new episodes to read haha. Have you had a chance to read through the activity 'Start Here'? Which topics are you interested in completing in this program? We have to choose four :). Rhianna Mentee 2023-03-16, 11:47: Hello, yeah the webtoons keep me semi busy, I think the ones that'd be best to start with would be, Getting Hired, Well being and self care, Finding inspiration and general disscussion. I do want to warn I likely wont be responsive for the upcoming 2 weeks due to spring break. Mentor 2023-03-16, 19:22: Hi Aiden! We can definitely work on those topics! Have you had a chance to work through the whole activity 'Start Here'? After that, we can get started on 'Getting Hired'. Thank you for letting me know, I hope you have an amazing spring break :).

When it comes to my transferrable skills I have quite a few but I don't really have anything the could represent them on a resume, ie. people skills, reliability, technology skills, quick learning. I posess all of these skills but I don't really know a way to represent them. Mentor 2023-04-24, 16:01: Hi Aiden! I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner! Unfortunately I got heat stroke and was recovering. After you read the first anchor text, you can check out the discussion questions for that anchor text and answer those! So for the first one, you can write up a draft of your resume and I can take a look and give you some tips! The skills you mentioned can actually be put on your resume. Have you had a chance to read “Resumé Skills for High School Students with Examples”? It is linked under anchor text 1 and is a great resource to show the kinds of skills employers are looking for! Once you've finished with anchor text 1 we can move onto anchor text 2! Have a great day! Mentor 2023-04-24, 16:24: Just to add on, it is also a good idea to add examples that show where you have developped these skills and how you have used them before. This is also explained in the “Resumé Skills for High School Students with Examples”! Hope that helps! Mentor 2023-04-30, 17:49: Hi Aiden! How are you? Just checking in to see if you've had a chance to continue working on the 'Getting Hired' module. Please let me know if you have any questions :). Mentor 2023-05-11, 21:41: Hi Aiden! It's great to hear from you! I'm sorry to hear that things have been hectic. Overall, you did a great job on your resume! Just for clarity, I would add bullet points to separate your sentences under each job description and add a period to the end of each sentence. Under education, you can write that you were on the grade 9 honour roll, here you can also list any clubs or sports teams you have been on. The skills you listed are great, I would just add descriptions for each and experiences to further explain these skills. A great resource is the template for high school student resumes that you can access here: https://www.liveabout.com/resume-skills-for-high-school-students-2063767 Let me know if you have more questions!",,

I don't really have any big life goals or plans so instead i decided to go with just little things that i would mind getting. They don't really have all that much meaning or anything but there something i guess. The ones of most importantence woudl be getting a job and my N just some basic stuff that i would like to do pretty soon here. some other things would be to finish building my spirit deck for Magic The Gathering that i'm building but i need money for that so it has to wait and a Razer Sneki Snek wall light there is no reason i want this i just do. i don't really have any other wants i hope this is what i need to do again sorry for the late message. Mentor 2023-04-28, 19:42: No problem, there is nothing wrong with not knowing your plans or goals for the future yet. Big goals for the future can come with time, and they may also change multiple times. As for getting a job and your N, these are great goals to start with! I remember when I was looking to get a job and my N. For some reason, it was a very stressful time. I'm actually still working at my first job ever. My advice for you is to be confident in your skills. Both an interviewer and a driving tester will sense your confidence and readiness. Since MTG and the wall light will require money, you can use them as motivation towards your goal of getting a job. There are some discussion questions under each conversation that we will do, so feel free to ask if you want to. Or you can ask your own question if it isn't under the discussion questions. Mentee 2023-05-01, 13:04: I read over the questions and Where to you find inspiration to do what you do? Especially school work I find myself having trouble getting myself to get up like its not like i don't want to. Like its not like I don't want to do it I just can't physically get myself to do stuff like this. Another question i liked was What keeps you motivated to do stuff like Hobbies and what not? Mentor 2023-05-14, 22:16: Is there another conversation that you'd like to open next? Mentee 2023-05-15, 21:00: Hey sorry I just kept forgeting to watch the last video because I can't watch then at school but i watched it now and and I don't really have any goals right now besides hopefully getting a job before summer and i'm picking up a application form tommorow so i'm moving forward in that. On the habits side of thing i don't really have any that i do everyday beside washing my face and brushing my teeth every day in the morning and before bed I don't use anything fancy but its a start of a routine that i can expanded on later. What habits have you built that have helped you in reaching some of your current or past goals?",,,,"Mentor 2023-03-24, 11:27: Hi Cody, I hope you're enjoying your Spring Break! I'm excited to start the program. Whenever you're ready, let me know which conversation you'd like to open first. Lindy :) Mentee 2023-04-14, 10:06: Hello Lindy sorry i took so long to respond. I guess i'm up for the ""Finding Inspiration"" if thats not to much trouble but if there is a conversation that you would recommend we could start with that one. Mentor 2023-04-15, 22:39: Alrighty I opened the ""finding inspiration"" conversation. Let's have a look Mentor 2023-05-02, 19:02: Great question. I sometimes struggle with being unmotivated to do school work, too, it's pretty common. To force myself to do it, I set aside time in my day and create a comfortable space. I clean up my room sometimes because it helps me be less distracted if I'm doing the work in there. I make a snack and a drink, like some popcorn and an iced tea or something and set it next to me on my bed or at the kitchen table. Then I may put some music on in the background so its less boring. I find that doing tasks with music on makes it at least a little more enjoyable. As for the second question, I have a ton of hobbies and I just love doing them. I usually use them as a reward for doing a bunch of school work because they can sometimes distract me and cause me to procrastinate on my school work. I tell myself if I finish a certain assignment or project I'll then turn to a hobby like making clay sculptures for a break. I find that being creative makes me more calm and relieves my anxiety about other things in life. Mentor 2023-05-17, 08:17: One habit that has helped me in particular is waking up early. It was very difficult for a while because I am not a morning person at all. However, after a few weeks I began to wake up naturally without an alarm. Now I have more time in the day to work on school and other things that are important. Being productive is something I have improved on significantly. It has also helped with my time management.",,,,,

1047582077,9/13/2022 22:17,1047594521,59807,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-04-19, 13:49: I'm glad you chose this module, as I know how stressful and expensive it is to start university. Especially if you're planning on paying for your own groceries, housing, etc.. Since when did strawberries cost six dollars?! Alright, let's get started: Warm-up Questions I'm going to start this module off by reflecting on the warm-up reflection questions, and you can do the same if you'd like. (But you don't have to, the warm-up is optional!) One thing that I've been meaning to look at is what kind of account would be best to keep my savings in. I'm not as knowledgeable as I'd like in this area, and I feel like there might be a better route than just keeping the money I've saved for rent in another chequeing account. Definitely something I should be looking into, but I'll hold off until at least summer! Gotta get through some finals first! So, we'll start with Anchor Text One: Student Loans, Scholarships, Grants, Bursaries and Awards After reading the ""MyEducation Planner"" articles, be sure to share your thoughts with me, and I'll do the same :) My response to the article: Student Aid BC is super helpful as a starting point, and I wish I utilized this site when I was first applying. One thing to note - BC has recently made some changes to student loans. (Good news!) As of this coming August, the weekly financial assistance offered through student loans is increasing from about one hundred dollars to two hundred dollars If you apply for financial aid, you'll automatically be considered for the BC Access Grant (up to four grand per year) &amp; automatically considered for federal grants as well. No interest is charged on BC goverment-issued student loans! Also, the section ""Student Aid Estimator"" on the Government of Canada website might be helpful if you're looking to get an estimate on how much financial aid you might receive if you apply. My Tips &amp; Tricks: When applying for scholarships and bursaries, I recommend paying special attention to some of the smaller ones! Lots of people tend to apply for the bigger ones (like the Loran scholarship), and oftentimes the smaller ones have less applications — which is great for your odds of getting one! But, this isn't to say the larger scholarships and bursaries aren't worth looking at. Another useful website might be ""Scholarships Canada"". This site matches you to scholarships you're eligible to apply for, based on your personal information and identity. If you have any questions about scholarships and bursaries, or are looking for any tips, I'd be happy to pass these on to my partner who will be better equipped to answer (they were awarded over one hundred k!). Scholarships, Bursaries, and Grants (For you!): You mentioned you were planning on attending TRU, so I took a look at their funding options and I think you might want to take a look at these: TRU Undergraduate Entrance Bursaries (Deadline: May Thirty-First) Awards range from five hundred dolalrs to four grand. These bursaries are offered to students new to the university who are studying full time (nine or more credits per term, which is usually around three or more courses) and will face financial hardship even after accessing full-time government student loans and grants If this applies to you, the next step would be to contact TRU and request an application form! TRU Assurance Bursary (Deadline: May Thirty-First) Awards up to twenty-grand. To be eligible, you must be approved for government full-time financial aid, and then the bursary covers the rest! You also must have at least a seventy% average on all Grade Twelve courses. Lastly, you must attend the Kamloops or Williams Lake campus. Your Turn! Alright, now it's your turn to read through Archor Text One and answer the discussion questions! And feel free to ask any questions along the way :) Mentor 2023-04-20, 15:26: My answer to your question: I was lucky enough to get an entrance scholarship that covered my first term at SFU, and aside from that, I'm funding my schooling the same way as you. (Summer jobs are absolutely a life saver). I was fortunate enough to have my parents cover all of my needs through highschool, so I was also able to save up a good chunk for university during those years. My unsolicited advice: If you're looking to work during the school year as well, my unsoliticied advice would be to consider serving at a restaurant. The hours are great for school schedules because you can often work on weekends only — and tips help! Serving is what allows me to work only a couple days a week but still make enough to cover my expenses. However, if it's financially possible for you to not work for at least the first term, I would recommend that. I was able to opt out of working for my first term and it gave me time to adjust to the increased workload of university. My response to Anchor Text 2: Budgeting &amp; Managing Money Tip #3 is something I wish I knew coming into first year. In my first semester at Douglas College, I spend over 300$ on textbooks that I didn't need to. Your university would won't tell you this, but most of the time, you can find your textbooks for free online. Since I realized this half-way through my second semester, I have only had to buy 2 textbooks since. It adds up to a lot of saved money. Note: **I'm not offically endorsing this**, but hypothetically, you should be able to find most of your textbooks on websites such as: http://libgen.rs/ (under the Non-Fiction / Sci-tech section) (Best option in my hypothetical experience) https://www.pdfdrive.com/ (less reliable) Note 2: I've never heard of any problems with viruses on these sites, but this is my warning just in case! Use at your own risk! Tip #5 is also very useful, and something that helped me when I was grocery shopping for myself. Costco, No Frills, and Walmart are so much cheaper than Save On, Safeway, Superstore, etc. Also, this app (https://flipp.com/) compiles weekly flyers so you know what's on sale and when. It's saved me a lot of money. Your Turn Let me know if you have any questions or trouble working through the worksheet under Archor Text 2! Mentor 2023-04-27, 15:05: Hi Holden! I'll open up the Dis- &amp; Misinformation module now :) Do also remember to complete and send here the worksheet that's under Archor Text 2: Budgeting &amp; Managing Money in the Rural to Urban module! If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Also, this is how much on average I pay for utilies in Vancouver. This might be helpful in filling in the utilities section of the worksheet, as I had no idea what to expect cost-wise before I started paying them. Estimated Cost of Utilies (~400 s2f living space) BC Hydro (electricity) = ~$25 per month Water + Heat = ~$60 per month Internet = ~$80 per month Estimated Total Cost of Utilities Per Month: $165 **The cost of heating will likely be more if you live in a larger space, as this estimate is for a small 400s2f apartment. **I personally use Netflix instead of cable, so cable is not included in this price!","Mentor 2023-03-14, 13:52: Hi Holden! As you might have guessed, my name is Sam (she/her) and I'm excited to worth through these modules with you over the next few months! I noticed you're planning on majoring in psychology, and have been looking into becoming a counselor. Well, guess what? Me too! Psychology is a really fun and interesting major, and it leaves you quite a bit of room to take other courses from other disciplines. So far I've taken nine psychology courses, and I'm taking another over the summer. Also, if you're looking into teaching philosophy, you could probably add a philosophy minor as well if you're interested. I've taken two introductory philosophy courses and I really enjoyed them. I saw that you enjoy reading—so do I! My favourite book is probably either Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, The Martian by Andy Weir, or the Archer &amp; Bennett trilohy by Candice Fox. What's yours? It looks like you're most interested in talking about starting out life at university, well, I've been there and done that. By this May I'll have started in 3 different institutions, so I think I'm well equipped to talk about what it's like just starting out! Your teacher wants you to complete 4 conversations of your choice by June, so please let me know which conversation you'd like to start with, or if you have any other questions about the program :) Mentee 2023-04-05, 14:02: Hi! Mentee 2023-04-05, 14:02: Hi! Mentee 2023-04-05, 14:12: Hi! Mentee 2023-04-05, 14:23: Hi Samantha! As you can guess, I really enjoy psychology and I am greatful to know that I'm not alone. To answer your question on my favourite books, I can't say I have one. Not because I haven't enjoyed the books but because its so hard for me to pick one book and go, that one is my favourite. However there are a few that I enjoy, the most recent being a book called No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai. I'm still workign my way through it but I find it really intriguing. I am really intrigued into the change from a rural to urban area. I have lived in a rural area all my life and it something I have a lot of anxiety about. Throughout high school I never shared my interest in psychology because no one shared it and no one cared to know. This is to say that, im really curious on the change in environment and if I would be more likely to find people with similar intersts. Thank you again! All the best - Holden Williams Mentor 2023-04-05, 15:11: It's nice to meet you! Favourite book is a hard question for sure. No Longer Human is actually on my 'to-be-read' list, so I'll be sure to check it out. While I can't say I've ever lived in a rural area and transitioned to an urban one, I can say I've moved to a big new school where I didn't know anyone a couple times. And you're right — at first it's pretty nerve wracking. It took me a few weeks to really get into the swing of things, but after I had scoped out the area and eased into a routine, I got comfortable pretty quick. I'm sure you'll do the same :) Also, you mentioned you're excited about finding people who are as excited about psychology as you are. That most definitely shouldn't be a problem! One of my favourite things about starting out university was that because there's SO many more people than highschool, there's a good chance you'll find a group of people who share your interests. Even in niche things: some of the clubs at the institutions I've attended are so specific it's almost funny. As for getting started with the modules, are there are any that look interesting to you that you might want to start with? Mentor 2023-04-05, 15:11: It's nice to meet you!

Mentee 2023-04-18, 08:37: For the modules I would like to ask about funding. A massive concern I have with anything post secondary related, is paying it all. Is there any recommendations you may have, or advice on how to live cheaply? Mentor 2023-04-18, 14:09: Perfect, I'll open up the Funding Your Future module! Mentee 2023-04-20, 10:48: I plan on funding my post secondary education through a summer job, at least for my first year or two. I plan on working at a mine back home during the summers to hopefully accumulate enough money to provide for myself. Along with this I will be applying for a multitude of bursaries and scholarships to hopefully survive. I found the TRU undergraduate enterance awards, and that I was elligable for it. It contains roughly 40 awards that range from $2000 - $4000. As well as the TRU entrance leadership scholarship which is a minimum of 15 awards and they all contain $5000 each. Finally I found the facility of Arts research and scholarship award that is for people who demonstrate creative activites or research. Finally how are you funding your education? Thanks all the best Holden Mentee 2023-04-26, 13:55: Awesome! I appreicate the advice esspecially on how to get textbooks for free. Next could we do the mis/ dis information module that would be most excellent. Mentee 2023-05-02, 08:49: My Response To the Discussion Questions My experience with pointing out misinformation is quite a lot to say the least. I find that often especially in my town, there is piles of misinformation spread around facebook. Many of people who will upload deepfakes of our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau saying something that doesn't match our towns political views. Theres also the infamous amounts of general fake articles being spread through the towns facebook. When I talk with people regarding this misinformation, they often get heated as to them, Im saying that what they believe is wrong and false. So often I just let them sit with there information, so then they can sit in this bubble of what they believe. For the second part of this question I often don't share articles on my social media, when I do though I only share something that is clearly true. I often fact check to make sure that I'm not falling into the trap that many fall into. Then again I seldom ever post any articles on my socials so it has to be something that I think is important and true. Because of this I've rarely ever been challenged on the things I post and the people who do are often the kind of people who think anything remotely ""woke"" is liberal propaganda. My Question for You How prevalent is misinofmation and isinformation in your world? Is it much different from that of my own? Mentee 2023-05-04, 10:10: Hey Samantha I acciedentally sent my response for dis and misinformation to Start here! Sorry for the confusion. Mentee 2023-05-11, 10:10: Could we do rural to urban next? Mentee 2023-06-07, 14:36: I enjoy living in rural area becuase of the sense of community, specifically how connected everyone was. I also enjoyed the community events because of how everyone partipated and helped each other out. I also enjoyed how close everything was because I was always a walk away from important things. I didn't enjoy how little there was to do, aside from a bowling ally, there was nothing more really to do. While I enjoyed how connect everyone was, everyone was also incredibly nosey. How is the transition from town to city generally?

I still do it but not nearly as much as I used to. Whenever I do have I feel right at home even if its with other people. When I move to TRU I am going to try and bring this with me as much as I can. What are some tips that you could give to stay in touch with loved ones. Mentor 2023-06-15, 23:28: It sounds like we both have some breakfast themed traditions, it's great that you're making an effort to keep that with you at TRU! For some tips on staying in touch with loved ones, I would say setting time aside specifically for reaching out to friends and family has helped. For example, my dad and I send eachother the daily Wordle each morning. This is a simple way we make sure we keep in touch, even on busy weeks. Another example would be to send pictures of your day to your loved ones while you're away at school. I've found this to be great for when you missing them, but don't have anything specific you want to talk about. Cheers, Sam","Mentor 2023-05-16, 22:47: Onto the module! So, we'll start with Anchor Text 1: Taking Flight There is no video to watch or article to read for this section of the module, just a set of discussion questions! My response to the prompts: I'll answer the inverse of these questions, since I don't have experience living in a rural setting :) Prompt 1: Three things you like about living in an urban area. For each, explain why you like it 1) I love that no matter what time it is, day or night, there is always something going on. I like the busyness of my surrounding area, and that if I'm awake at 2am and am looking for something to do, there's always a cafe open or somewhere to go. It's comforting to be outside at any time and see other people moving about. 2) Convience of services. Living in an urban setting means that I have access to many services very easily. For example, I've never had to worry if a veterinary clinic was open in driving distance if one of my cats had an emergency late at night. I am very grateful for this part of urban living. 3) You can easily blend in in the city. One last thing I like about living in an urban area is that because the area I live is densely populated, I see way too many people on a daily basis to worry about the impression I leave on them. This allows me to relax in public, and not worry so much if I embarrass myself. Nobody knows who I am! Prompt 2: Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. 1) I don't like that I have a bit of distance between myself and nature. While there is many places to access nature around me, they are all normally pretty busy. This is very different than my experience visiting rural areas. One of my parents lives about 3 hours up in the interior, and when I visit I really enjoy the quiet and seclusion. 2) While I mentioned the busyness of urban areas as something I enjoy, there are some days that it can be overwhelming. I am particularly sensitive to noise, so being in a densely populated area can be frustrating in that sense occassionally. Your turn! Now that I've shared my reflection with you, it's your turn to share your reflection with me! Click on the ""Discussion Questions"" box under Anchor Text 1: Taking Flight for the prompts you will be answering. When you're done, I'll send my responses to Anchor Text 2 very shortly after, so you have time to complete this module before the upcoming deadline. Talk to you soon! And best of luck as finals near! Mentor 2023-06-10, 16:42: My Thoughts on Your Thoughts Always being a walk away from everything would be so convienient. In highschool, the only store a walk from my house was a 7/11! I can definitely see how a small town could bring some nosey neighbours. Hopefully you won't have this problem once you start TRU! My Answer I found the transition from town to city to be a great experience, as did many of my friends. I've found that the more urban I go, the better the transit system is, which is a huge help for grocery shopping, and even just for finding things to do. The busyness was a bit of a shock at first, but you get used to it! Anchor Text 2: Same But Different Again, there is no video to watch or article to read for this section of the module, just a set of discussion questions! Note that you only have to answer 1 of the 2 prompts listed under discussion questions, but feel free to complete both if you'd like :) My response to the prompts: Prompt 1: Compare places/activites from where you live now to where you want to move. I might move to Vancouver Island to do my masters degree after I graduate, so I will research activities on Vancouver Island. Remember to write the exact name &amp; location of your new places/activities! Home Place 1: Vancouver Aquarium Similar Place 1: Ucluelet Aquarium (180 Main St, Ucluelet, BC V0R 3A0) Home Place 2: Acadia Beach Similar Place 2: Cattle Point Urban Star Park (Oak Bay, BC) Home Place 3: Pacific Spirit Park Similar Place 3: Cathedral Grove Park (452 Alberni Hwy, Nanaimo, BC) Prompt 2: Plan to bring a childhood tradition to a new place One tradition that I had at home growing up was blueberry pancakes every Sunday. This isn't something I still do, but it is definitely something I could start againt to bring some 'home' with me when I move. Plus, blueberry pancakes are delicious. Your turn! Almost done your second module! Wooo! Talk to you soon!","Mentor 2023-04-27, 15:37: As usually, I'll start with the warm-up questions and my responses to the discussion prompts in Achor Activity 1. I hope the weather is as nice over where you are as it is here, the rain broke for the first time in ages over here! :) Warm-up Questions Alright, onto the warm-up! Remember this part is optional, but feel free to share if you'd like. Lots of stories I was told growing up ended up being false. I remember my parents told me that turning on the lights inside of a moving car was illegal—they were definitely just annoyed that I turned them on in the first place. I also remember, as I'm sure most do, being told that swimming after eating makes it more likely that you will drown. Absolutely a myth. So, onto Anchor Text 1: ""Fake News"" After reading both articles, be sure to share your thoughts with me, and I'll do the same :) My Response to CBC Article 1: I've seen disinformation shared a LOT, as I'm sure you have as well. Though nothing nearly as extreme as the Trudeau article, I've seen disinformation or information misleadingly presented by some individuals running for studentbody president at my school. When I see extreme claims or claims that paint another party in a shockingly bad light, I'm usually extra critical of whoever posted it—particularly if they are running for a position, as was seen in the competition for president at my school. As it turned out, the harsh claims the individual running for SFU student president made were debunked, and they didn't win. Also, if you're looking to get a kick out of some intentional (satire) mis/disinformation, you should check out ""The Onion"". My Response to CBC Article 2: This article reminded me of an event I learned about in one of my classes that shows how damaging misinformation can be. In 1983, there was a broadcast on CBC called ""War of the Worlds"". It was a satire radioshow doing a segment on alien invasion. However, some people joined the radioshow part way through, and missed the introduction stating that this was a satire broadcast. So, those who tuned in midway through and heard a broadcast about an incoming alien invasion, naturally, panicked. It's an interesting story, and there's lots of videos on YouTube about it if you're interested in hearing more. Your Turn As usual, let me know if you have any questions or trouble with the discussion questions! Talk to you soon, Sam Mentor 2023-05-08, 11:11: Hi Holden, no worries! My apologizes for the super late response, I thought I had pressed send but it looks like I hadn't. Happy May! My Response to Your Response The deepfakes people make are crazy. It's scary how accurate people can replicate voices using AI. I saw a segment on the news recently that's a pretty good example of how bad deepfakes can be: (https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/mom-these-bad-men-have-me-she-believes-scammers-cloned-her-daughter-s-voice-in-a-fake-kidnapping-1.6378564). If that was my family member on the other side of the phone, I'm not sure I can say I wouldn't acted that differently. And I absolutely understand the frustration of talking to people so set in their views. I agree that sometimes the friction of the conversation that most often than not goes nowhere isn't worth it. My Answer to Your Question I have a similar experience to the second part of your response. Many times I've seen posts shared on social media that are blatantly false and clearly only shared as a display of the person sharings' political views. I've seen this from seemingly well-meaning people as well, either sharing a cause important to them or a current event that they are trying to bring awareness to, but not sharing entirely true information. I think it's very important to fact check everything one shares, especially if trying to bring awareness. If information in a well-meaning post is false, I think it's way less likely others take the time to read and consider what is said.

A little bit about me - I'm in my 5th year at the University of Victoria studying biochemistry in my last semester of classes. After that, I'm going to be applying to med school next fall to be a doctor (again hopefully) Although school definitely takes up a lot of my time, when I'm not studying or working I love driving around exploring Vancouver Island and I'm hoping to get in some good beach campouts and bonfires this summer I saw that you were hoping to learn about working hard which I some experiance with that since I've been going to school full time while working on the side. Even though it can be tough in the begining, after awhile you being to get used to working and it gets easiler But enough about me! I hope that you're enjoying grade 12 and are getting excited about life after graduation - is there anything in particular that you're excited for post-graduation or any places you'd like to check out?

To answer your questions: My experience as a student and with courses has been all over the place so I can tell you all about it! The great thing about university is that you can choose your courses, and choose how heavy your courseload will be. The usual amount is 5 courses a semester, but lots of people take 3-4 for a lighter courseload. With that in mind, you could definitely continue boxing outside of school. As for business, it is also its own major! https://www.uvic.ca/gustavson/undergraduate/future/information/index.php There is the link for the UVic Business Program, or BComm program. Take a look at that website and you can see how the program is structured and how it works! As for this activity, please read through Anchor Text #1. When finished, type in some answers to the discussion questions and ask me questions if you have any. Also, if you have any further questions about UVic, let me know! Have a good weekend! Ava Mentee 2023-04-07, 11:33: Hi Ava, Again sorry for the late reply life got busy and we just got off spring break so I forgot to do this. Additionally I got news of my first boxing bout on the 15th of april so I have been training for that a lot. I read over anchor text #1 and breifly looked over anchor text #2 while talking with my teacher as I have already done most of this research a couple years ago in grade 10 and dont see much use of doing it again. I am wondering if we could change the topic to strategic studying as I have a chronic procrastination problem and misunderstood what this topic would be about. I have also made a change in plans and applied to the okanogan collage for the aircraft maintenance engineer - structures certificate in kelowna and recieved a conditional acceptance as long as I pass highschool which my family and I were excited to hear. This is something that I am more interested in pursuing at the moment and my family agrees will probably be a more engaging thing to study for the time being. This is only a certificate course so I will mostlikely pursue more schooling after which does connect to one of the of the anchor text #1 questions for you, have you changed programs, schools or even careers along your journey. My dadd believes many career changes are import to find someting you enjoy, what are your thoughts on that? And do you know the implacations for taking only a certificate course instead of perhaps a diploma or degree? I did also apply for the aircraft maintenance technician diploma at the vernon campus but I am on a waiting list and am unsure if I should try to go there instead.",,,"Mentor 2023-04-11, 18:20: Hi Dante, Sorry for the late reply! I just travelled home to spend Easter with my family for the weekend and am now back in Victoria studying for my finals. I have also opened the conversation for strategic studying, as you requested. Exciting to hear about your boxing and the change in your plans about applying to Okanagan College! Congratulations on getting conditional acceptance! I love Kelowna (I like spending time in the summer there), and I am sure you will have a great time there. I am glad to here it's something you're interested in. Answers to your questions: 1. I have changed programs before! In high school, I thought I was going to go into the sciences and then I took physics and really did not like it (did not get the best grades in it either), so I decided that political science and social sciences were a better fit. I changed my program in second year too! I was going to do a double major in political science and sociology and decided to drop the sociology major because it was too much and I wasn't as interested. I think your dad is right with finding something you enjoy. It can be hard to figure out what you want to do, and I am still exploring that myself for after university. I can't speak much about the differences between a certificate, diploma, and a degree but I found this website and hopefully that helps: https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/plan/start/credentials I hope my answers help! As for this module and assignment, read through the anchor texts and answer the questions. I'll be glad to answer anything about studying, as I also sort of have a chronic procrastination problem.

A little bit about me: I am a fourth-year Political Science and Global Development Studies student and I am glad we were matched, as I go to the University of Victoria! I'm originally from Calgary, so I can help a bit with tips on moving away and how to get motivated for school. I'd love to get to know you a bit more!

I'd also love to hear how you would like this program to work and what sections you're interested in--as I understand, you have to complete 4 conversations of your choice. This is about you, so let me know how I can best help you during this time. Let me know what conversations you'd like to do, and which one you'd like to start with!

I would like to start talking about Post secondary and career planning since I did recieve an email from the UVic undergraduate admissions that I am ineligable for the early conditional admission at this time. My application is on hold until a later date so I can only hope to get in then accepted later. Although I havent been accepted yet I would still like to know some more information on how the courses are set up. I see on the website buisness is only labelled as a minor so I would also need to take a degree in something like economics. What does your schedule look like well studying Political sience and Global dovelopment studies, how busy could I expect to be if I also wanted to continue boxing on the side of school. Mentor 2023-03-29, 09:44: Hi Dante! Just wanted to check in with you as I haven't heard from you in over a week. How have you been? How is school, is it busy?

As the program appears to be ending, I've opened the ""wrapping-up"" discussion and asked you to complete the survey. You can contact me through MentorCity anytime if you have any questions or want to continue our discussion. It was lovely getting to know you! The last time we talked you mentioned that you struggling to juggle school, work, and other responsibilities. It's great that you recognize the importance of well-being and self-care, especially when you're feeling stressed about your future. Taking care of yourself is crucial for maintaining a healthy and balanced mindset. Here are some tips to help you prioritize self-care: 1. Manage your stress: Start by identifying what triggers your stress and find healthy ways to manage it. This could include practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies or spending time in nature, can also help reduce stress. 2. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Make sure to prioritize your physical health. Get regular exercise, eat nutritious meals, and ensure you're getting enough sleep. These factors play a significant role in managing stress and promoting overall well-being. 3. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between your academic/work life and personal life. Allocate specific times for relaxation, leisure activities, and spending time with loved ones. Learning to say no to additional commitments when you're already overwhelmed is important for your well-being. 4. Practice self-reflection: Take time to reflect on your goals, values, and aspirations. Understanding what truly matters to you can help you make informed decisions about your future. Journaling or talking to a trusted friend or mentor about your concerns and aspirations can also provide clarity and support. 5. Delegate and ask for help: Don't hesitate to delegate tasks at work or seek assistance from classmates or colleagues when needed. Delegating responsibilities and asking for help lightens your workload and provides an opportunity for others to contribute. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to friends/family, teachers or professionals for support. Discussing your concerns and emotions with someone you trust can provide valuable insights and a fresh perspective. 6. Take breaks: Breaks are essential for recharging your mind and maintaining productivity. Incorporate short breaks during study or work sessions to rest, stretch, or engage in activities that help you relax and rejuvenate. Remember, self-care is an ongoing process and it's important to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Prioritizing your well-being will not only contribute to your current happiness but also set a solid foundation for a successful future. Take small steps each day, and you'll gradually find a balance that works for you. I'm here to support you along the way! P.S. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me anytime!","Mentor 2023-05-08, 16:27: Hello Chantelle, No worries, I completely understand that you've been busy with school and work.

And yes the books are great but so are the movies, theres a new movie coming out this year! As of now, I've opened up the strategic studying convesation. You can reply back to to me within this conversation. Our first activity is to watch the video on this page and go throught the discussion questions. After watching the video, have you ever used the study skills recommended in the video? Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Let me know what you think!

I am very excited for this opportunity, and hope to learn some skills I can carry into post-secondary. Im very excited to start working on this! Mentor 2023-03-16, 00:43: Hi Carter, I hope you're doing well, and I'm very happy that you're excited to start! To get to know you a little better I have a few questions. What's your favourite TV show? What do you like to do in your free time? Do you play any sports? Best, Simarjot Mentee 2023-03-16, 14:01: Hi Simarjot. I am doing quite well thank you! Im not one for TV most of the time, but I like to watch cooking shows with my family sometimes, and I also like Alone and Bob's Burgers. In my free time I like to draw, play video games, and read. Im not currently in any sports, but once the snow melts I hope to bring out my target and resume archery. You wrote that you like watching movies, do you have a favourite? Or a favourite book perhaps? Wishing you the best. Mentor 2023-03-19, 17:48: Hey Carter, I love Masterchef so I totally understand. I don't think I have a favourite movie (there's so many to choose from), but I do love a lot of different books. Growing up the Hunger Games was my favourite, and I've read the new book too. Are you a fan? It has archery! I do like other mystery books too. How did you get into archery? That sounds so cool. Also, I'm from Vancouver so its funny to see you say you're waiting for the snow to melt when I saw my first cherry blossoms today. Mentee 2023-04-11, 14:03: Hi! Sorry for the late reply, got very busy with scholarships. I got into archery by joining the local archery club, i used their bows at first and then got my own. I've never read the Hunger Games, but i've seen the movies. I should read the books though, i've heard they are way better. I'd also like to start working on the strategic studying conversation. I think it not only wil help me in college, but by starting now, could help me finish highschool :)",,,,,

I go to Vancouver once a year, but I don't think I would be able to live there, because it's such a big city. I grew up in a smal town in northern British Columbia, so I am used to the small city girl life. I would also like some advice on what I can expect going into post secondary, and the transition to living by yourself. Mentee 2023-03-13, 11:30: Hello Zaraah, my name is Aaleya. It is nice to meet you. I am looking forward to graduating high school. I got accepted into the Social Work UT Diploma, at the College of New Caledonia starting in the fall. Do you enjoy living in a big city? I've lived in a small town my entire life, and I don't think I could live in a big city, it's overwhelming for me. I also saw on your profile you enjoy playing badminton, I also like playing! I would like some advice on what I can expect going into post secondary.

My name is Zaraah and to answer your question, living in a big city can be fun, but sometimes it can get too busy. How is it living in a small town? Mentor 2023-03-14, 00:12: Are you on Spring Break for the next two weeks? After reading through your profile, I really admire your community service as I also volunteer my time helping others. Further, congratulations on getting accepted into your desired school! Are you looking forward to starting classes at the campus and what are you most excited about when starting college? And yes, I do like playing badminton, I'm glad you made the connection. :) Mentor 2023-03-14, 00:13: I'd like to mention that I am happy to answer any questions that you may have, such as the ones you posed in your intro.

Lastly, please choose 4 conversations of your choice that you would like to complete and please send me which conversations you would like me to open, keeping in mind that we can only open and work through one conversation at a time. If you would like to work on more than 4 conversations, we can do that as well as long as you complete 4 first.

My aplogies for taking so long to respond, I have just been busy with life lately. You mentioned I can pick four conversations, and we can talk about one conversation at a time. The four I would like to discuss with you is, confronting discrimination, from rural to urban, well being and self care, and finding inspration. It doesn't matter to me, which one we talk about first. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day! Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:15: I would also like to acknowledge your other comments. I do enjoy living in a small town, although the down side is everyone knows everyone. I do enjoy volunteering it gives me more of a understanding of things. I am looking forward to starting college, I am a little nervous. I am also sad because all my friends are going to other schools, I think it will be good to meet new people though. I also see you like to stay up later, as do I Mentor 2023-04-20, 00:09: Hi Aaleya! Thank you for your responses and it is nice hearing back from you again. Don't worry about replying late, I completely understand that life can get busy sometimes (or maybe all the time, haha). Those are some great conversations that you have chosen and since you don't seem to matter which order we do them in, I will go ahead and open the well-being and self care conversation first. I feel this is a good one to start with before moving onto the others, its always important to take care of yourself first. I hope you enjoy completeing the conversation. Once I have unlocked it, we can continue our conversation there. Also, thank you for taking the time out of your busy life to answer and acknowledge my comments, I really enjoyed reading your responses and I like how we were both able to make connections with one another.

It's been awhile and I see that you finished the Well Being and Self Care conversation and was wondering if you had any questions at all? Did you enjoy completing the activities/conversation? What were some major takeaways for you? Please take the time to reflect and answer the questions above. In the meantime, I will open another conversation for both of us to work through. I will send you a message under that conversation once I have opened it. Mentor 2023-06-13, 13:36: Hey Aaleya, I hope things are going well with school wrapping up and finishing up this program. I wanted to check-in since I have not heard from you for awhile.

Just a bit about me, I graduated with a Psychology degree in 2021. I am currently working as a research assistant (to 2 professors) and as an assistant to a psychologist with her own private practice. I'm trying to improve my resume so I can get into grad school and become a clinical psychologist. I think that the program made a great match as I saw in your profile that you are interested in Psychology as well! So feel free to ask me any questions about that. I see that you are interested in going to a university in Hawaii (which sounds super awesome, Hawaii is such a beautiful place!) so the program in the States might be different than here in Canada but I will do my best to answer them. But please do tell me a bit about yourself. What got you interested in Psychology? Mentee 2023-03-28, 11:02: I apologize for the late response, i recently just came back to school from spring break. What university did you attend? I would like to spend my first year after graduation going to my community college, did you go to university right after graduation? I have always loved helping people, giving my advice and giving tools to help people overcome their challenges. I also find it fascinating the way the human brain works and why people do the things they do. Did you have a plan B? If so what was it? Thank you for your time. -Noelani Mentor 2023-03-28, 19:45: No worries at all, we were told that you guys were on Spring Break, but I wanted to introduce myself for when you guys are back. I attended the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George. I did go to university right after high school. I feel the same way as you in terms of helping others overcome their challenges and understanding how the brain works. Those are the exact reasons I went into Psych! I didn't have a plan B for undergrad. I think I was lucky in that I knew what I wanted as early as grade 10, and even before that I was doing projects on mental health so the interest started early. And when I was actually in university, the interest just became stronger. I think now I am thinking of a plan B for grad school. I am applying to grad schools to become a clinical psychologist, and I think my plan B would be to become a counsellor. So still in the same realm tho. I'm not sure if you've thought this far yet but what career do you see yourself in? clinician or researcher? Also let me know what conversations you would like to do so we can get them started and you can continue to send your questions about Psych and uni while we complete the conversations if you'd like.

Feel free to chat with me when you've time, and I understand school should be your high priority. \ I would suggest you to follow the instructions and begin with Anchor Text 1 and answer the following questions: • What do you value in life? • How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? • Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? We will keep in touch as much as you can!

That is one thing I dont like about our world, I would really like to help the worl in anyway I can so it still looks beautiful. I could work around in the city as a job to continue keeping our worl clean and looking nice when im older by planting some nice flowers areound the town, or picking up garbage so our roads and everything stay clear. Mentor 2023-04-02, 16:04: Hi Caitlyn, I agree with you!! We have so many beautiful natural things in our world. It's a shame that not everybody takes good care of it. I'm glad we have people like yourself who cares and wants to make it better for future generations. When I lived in New Zealand, we planted 900 trees in a Conservation Reserve and it was a great experience. There are so many reforestation projects that you can volunteer. It might be a way for you to start getting involved. We finished task 1 here, well done :) Let's move on to task 2, you can complete this activity by taking the following quiz: https://careerdiscoveryquizzes.workbc.ca/#career-quizzes You can choose one of the careers from your quiz results and share your answers to the questions below (you don't have to answer it all if you don't want too, feel free to answer as many as you would like): • Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? • Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? • Will this career offer me financial security? • How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? • Where will I need to live to pursue this career path?

Something I'm interested in learning about is gettiing hired so when I do finally get a job I can get one that can really helps me out in the future so I am able to do good on my own. I would also like to learn about finding my future which is another thing that will help me. During spring break I get two weeks off of school, now I might not be on here as much since I will probably be busy doing things but I will definitely try my best to keep in touch during those two weeks. Thank you, Caitlyn! Mentee 2023-04-17, 09:05: one of the jobs I got on my quiz I did was being a nurse and I feel like that is a job I would do in the future. When I was a little girl I wanted to be a nurse for a while but then like evry kid I changed my mind a million times. I feel like the job would be able to help me achieve the work/life I want because the pay good money so I wouldnt have to worry about not getting a house and things. I could probably live on the island still to get a nursing job when im older. Mentor 2023-04-25, 20:48: Hi!! Hope you're doing well :) It took a while to get back to you here. I was out of town, but I'm back home! I loved that you took the quiz, and I agree it's so hard to make a decision like that. We have so many options, and it can feel a bit overwhelming. I changed my mind many times, so it's okay to feel uncertain about your career. The nursing career is growing fast worldwide, so it's an excellent career path. I can tell you have compassion, care about people, the planet, and your surroundings. So I believe you're on the right track. You can try to find a volunteer job at the hospital so you can get to know more about the profession. I'm happy to move forward to the next topic. What do you think about post-secondary &amp; career planning? Let me know if you agree with that so I can unlock that conversation. Have a great night, and talk soon! Michelle Mentee 2023-05-01, 09:23: to me post secondary planning is helpful. because even though i'm only in grade 10 its still nice to have something planned for after highschool when i go to college. its helpful to know where you wanna go what you wanna do before grade 12 so youre not rushing if you do wanna go to college. now you can also change your mind but again its nice to have something planned before last minute",,,,,

I took the longer route to get in but you can actually just finish the pre-requisites which would take around 2 years and apply to the program and get in that way, which is the route I recommend.

What I do to snap out of the funk without acting like there is nothing wrong is doing something that will bring me joy. It is never something big but something small like getting starbucks or watching the office. This brings me some joy and it gives me the little boost I need when im having days that I dont feel the best. My advice for time management is to make a schedule. This is what keeps me focused with school and other activites I have going on. When i can physically see what I need to do it helps my anxiety and stress as well.

I truly think that being some sort of teacher either with the elderly, or younger kids would be something that would be enjoyable and fufilling. I want to be in a job that makes me feel like I am making a differnce, and I think doing something like this would be a good option. The top career I got from the quiz was Specialist Physician. I dont really have an interest working in the medical field. Im not a big fan of science, so I dont feel like this would be a fufilling career for my future. I feel like if I was to persue this career, I would miss out on the kind of social interactions I want to have in life. I feel like tyhis job would be a bit too much for me, and I just dont think its a career that would match my interests. Pursuing this career would give me more than enough money for everyday needs. The annual salary is $256,202, which I would be able to pay bills, and get everyday necessities with. In 2022-2023, there are 3,160 Job openeings. I feel like it would be pretty unlikely for me to get one of the openings, because I would not fit what they are looking for. I could work in Port Alberni at the hospital here, but it would really depend if I was to get a job here. If I didn't, I would need to find a job elsewhere. What made you choose your career? Thank you, sorry the end got a little rushed due to class ending. I cant wait to talk to you next! Danica Mentor 2023-04-06, 22:22: Hey Danica! Wow, great work on the module! You seem so self-motivated and smart, I'm super impressed!! I love that you value kindness and happiness- I think the world could always use more kindess. I think there are a lot of careers that could help you spread kindness! Probably one where you are working directly with people, and providing them with some sort of service or help would be the most natural fit. I think you are spot on that being a teacher in some capacity would help you live according to your values. I think that your desire to contribute to your community by helping the people around you really goes hand in hand with spreading kindness. That's awesome that you have experience volunteering with people of many ages! My values have absolutely played a role in my career choices so far. I really want to work in an environment where I am directly helping people in a meaningful way that they can carry through their life. The first job that I had when I finished my first university degree was working at the front desk at a medical clinic. My favourite part of this job was interacting with so many different people and treating everybody with kindness- I had the mindset that I can never know what is going on in somebody else's life or day (which I think is especially true for people accessing health care services), so you never know how much treating them with kindness might impact them. That is interesting that the top career you got in the quiz was specialist physician! That is very fair that you don't have an interest in working in the medical field. You definitely know yourself a lot better than a quiz does. However, I would also say not to discount this field too quickly! Many people are attracted to medicine because it can be thought of as both a science and an art. In other words, just being good at science isn't enough to be a doctor- you also have to be an empathetic person, a good listener and communicator, etc. I am actually in the process of applying to medical school right now, and I didn't become interested in working within the medical field until I was 20. So you don't need to have all the answers about what you want to do in your life right now! There are a lot of different factors that made me interested in a career in medicine. Mainly, as I said earlier, I just really want to help people through my work, and I think medicine is a very obvious way to do that. I also spent a lot of time shadowing other health professionals and realized I wasn't as interested in these other jobs as I thought I might be. On top of that, my job working in a medical office made me feel a lot less intimidated by medicine (doctors are just normal people!), and made me appreciate how important the human connection aspect of medicine is. I think another important aspect of thinking though potential careers is how much school you want to do after high school, since some jobs take a lot more years of university to get there. Do you have any ideas of how much school you're interested in doing? Also what do you think might be some challenges associated with the jobs you're most interested in, like being a teacher? Hope you have a great weekend! Hailey Mentee 2023-04-26, 09:19: Hey Haily, sorry for not responding soner! I keep getting sick and needing to catch up again, and our soccer team is traveling all over the place for games. Thats so cool, that you want to help people in a way that makes you and others happy! I also enjoy talking to people and making their day better in anyway I can. I totally agree, my career choice could easily change, I tend to be very indecisive with things. I totally want to explore more careers, to see every possible one that could fit my interests. Because you are right, I could totally find something that I enjoy in the medical field, it does actually fit quite a bit of my interests. Thats true! I actually spent my Friday two weeks ago in emergency due to injuring my foot in soccer. All the doctors were so kind. Even under insane pressure they managed to treat everybody kindly. I was thinking of a maximum of four years in school, but that could totally change. Its hard to say! Have a greaat week! Danica Mentor 2023-04-26, 12:11: Hi Danica, Sorry to hear you've gotten injured! No problem for not responding sooner :) But that is super cool that you're travelling with your soccer team! Do you play other teams on Vancouver Island, or from other places in BC? That's too bad that you've spent so much time in the emergency room recently, but you're right, definitely a good way to understand what working a certain area of health care might be like! And 4 years of school is a nice number, definitely lots of options. Seems to me like you've answered all of the questions for this module. Are you ready to move on to a new module? Of course let me know anytime if you have other thoughts about careers for you or questions for me. If you're ready to move on, let me know which 3 other modules you're interested in working through, and which one you want to do next if you have a preference. Hope you have a great week also! Hailey Mentee 2023-04-28, 09:13: Hey Haily! We play some schools on the island, and others off the isalnd! We actually just played the Powell River team two weeks ago! Im hoping that in September, I will be able to join the rep team here. Our school team just got together this year and some of the kids have never played soccer beore. So its really nice for the kids who have never played before to try something new without the fear of lacking skills compared to other kids. I think I am most interested on working on ""Funding your Future,"" ""Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning"" and ""Strategic Studying."" I do not really have a preference on which one we do first, so feel free too open whatever one you would like! Talk soon! Danica :D","Mentee 2023-05-31, 08:59: Hey Haily! Sorry it has been so long since I responded. I have been trying to get caught up in all my classes. Here is my response for the second module. Often, I find it really hard to stay focused when studying. I found that what works for me is putting my phone down and not even having it with me. Also having no music. I found that I study best with silence and no distraction. I think one of the best things I can do to study is take myself to a place that is mainly for studying, like the library. This would allow me to study in silence and stay focused, because I really struggle. Here are my answers to some of the questions. I am always looking for new ways to help improve my study habits, because as it is, my studying is weak and could be a whole lot better. What kind of studying stratagies do you use to prepare yourself for tests or exams? Also, How are post secondary classes different from high school classes? Or how is post secondary compared to high school. Thank you! Danica :D","Mentee 2023-06-22, 16:37: Hey Haily! Im now working on the last module that's open. I was trying to look into scholarships that I am eligible for, but I have to book an appointment to talk to someone, which I did. But for now I can just ask you questions about scholarships. Is post secondary worth all the money? Like sure you get money through scholarships, but it still seems like so much money. I want to 100% go to post secondary, but it's just a lot of money. Do you know any good places to look into scholarships? I have tried looking for them, but they are just really difficult to find. Another thing is budgeting. I really worry for my future and about my money. I have no clue how to budget, and am really confused about it all. I don't struggle too badly with balancing work and school. What was the hardest part of budgeting for you? I want to learn all I can about budgeting so then I am able to have a basic understanding for when I need it. Also, what was one of the biggest things you learned about budgeting during your first year of post secondary? Was it hard for you? Thank you so much! Danica :) Mentor 2023-06-28, 16:45: Hey Danica! Great questions :) You're right that post-secondary is a lot of money. I think that there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to whether post-secondary is worth the money. For some people, if what they see as a fulfilling career/life doesn't involve a job that would require post-secondary education, then all the money needed for post-secondary might not be worth it. That being said, I think it also depends on how you define ""worth it"". No matter whether your career uses post-secondary knowledge, I think that post-secondary education will undoubtedly lead you to meet people you wouldn't have otherwise, to learn about yourself, to change how you think about the world, etc. For me, I see post-secondary education as an opportunity to open doors to future careers that would otherwise be inaccessible, whether or not you decide to take them. I don't have any ideas off the top of my head of where to look for scholarships, but that's great that you booked an appointment with soemone to talk about it. When I was looking into scholarships, I mainly used resources through my school (ex. counsellors) to figure out what to apply for. Budgeting is a good thing to keep in mind for sure. I unfortunately don't know if I have any super clear tips for how to budget! Here are some youtube videos I found though which might be helpful for you about personal finance/budgeting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXCvtC0HqLE&amp;ab_channel=studyquill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lHNMGoACdQ&amp;ab_channel=DebtFreeMillennials Great work on this module! Definitely an important topic to be thinking about :) I think your school year is done, so I won't open up another module for you (unless you want me to but I'm not expecting that!). It has been really great working with you over the past few months! I hope that you have a great summer break, and good luck with your next years of school! You got this! Hailey","Mentor 2023-03-07, 14:02: Hey Danica! My name is Hailey :) I am currently studying public health at university in Vancouver, and I grew up in Victoria. When I’m not working on school, I love hiking, playing board games with my friends, playing violin, and doing any sort of creative activity. When you’re able to respond, let me know a bit about you. Let me know if you have any questions for me about the mentorship program or about other topics and I’ll try my best to answer them! Mentee 2023-03-27, 00:36: Hello Haily, It is great to meet you! :D My name is Danica. I am in grade ten, and I got to ADSS in port Alberni. I have grown up in many different places, and I have gone to school in Port Mcneill, Parksville, and now Port Alberni. In school, my favourite subject is math, because I love being able to take numbers and get the answer in my head.In my free time I enjoy painting, knitting, playing board games ( my favourite is Ticket to Ride), playing soccer, walking in the forest, and hanging out with my family and friends. I tend to have little to no free time, due to school, work, and soccer, but when I do, I enjoy spending my time with the people around me! I am not quite sure what I want to do job wise, but I know for sure that I want to go to university or colledge. I have been thinking about getting into a career that involves little kids, but I am not sure what. I find it so cool that you play the violin! How long have you been playing? Just a random little question I have, If you have one, what is your favourite music artist or genre of music? Mentee 2023-03-28, 09:08: Hey Haily, I am just wondering if you could open up one of the modules so I can start working on it. No rush :) Danica Mentor 2023-03-30, 00:14: Hey Danica! Thanks for sending me a message about you! That is so cool that you've lived in so many places- I bet it has meant that you've had a lot of different experiences in all of those places. Have you found it hard moving around? We definitely have a lot in common! My favourite subject in high school was definitely also math. I agree it is super satisfying to be able to think through a problem and come to an answer. I also knit- I made my first sweater last year which was really exciting! Ticket to ride is also one of my favourite games, and I love playing soccer and spending time in nature :) That is super fair that you don't know yet what you want to do for a job yet. I am still figuring that out too! I think a career involving kids sounds really fulfilling though. There are a lot of education programs at university where you learn how to be a teacher, so that could be a cool option. Or if you want to do a LOT of school, something like a pediatrician could be a good fit. But definitely there are lots of other jobs out there that involve kids. About your violin question, I have been playing since I was 5! I was actually able to take a bunch of music courses in university, even though my degree was in science. Now I am playing in my university's orchestra which is a lot of fun! And that is a tough question about favourite genre of music or artist! I would probably say folk or indie music. My friend introduced me to the band Caamp a couple weeks ago and I really like their music. Do you have a favourite genre/artist? I can of course open up one of the modules! Sounds like you are supposed to choose 4 modules to work through, so let me know which ones you are most interested in. I'll unlock ""Career Exploration"" for now. Also sorry for the little delay getting this open, it has been a busy week for me at school! Mentee 2023-03-30, 09:51: Hello, Haily! Its all good, it has been busy for me too! I have been very behind since spring break so I have been trying to catch up in science especially. I am surprised that we have so much in common! I am currently trying to make my first sweater right now although its taking me a bit since I have been so caught up with school. Random question, What colour did you make it? That is a great idea! The college beside our highschool offers a Early Childhood and Education course that I can take in grade 12 that has no cost, so I think im definitely going to take that just in case I need it later on. That is so cool that you have been playing since you were five! I was going to be in band when I first started highschool, but then I had to do online school. Playing in the orchestra must be amazing! Do you get to perform music for plays? Even though I have lived in so many different places, its actually really nice. Moving can get tough sometimes though. Kids arent exactly the friendliest when you go back and forth from two schools. But I also think that was a learning experience for me. My family and I have kind of gotten to experiment with different schools seeing which ones are best, and so far it's port Alberni's schools. It's hard because I have two younger siblings who are still in elementry school, so we also need to find the right school for them. But overall, getting to explore different places is amazing, and I love each place for its own reason. Port Mcneill is a nice closed off town with lots of forests, Parsville has amazing beaches, and Port Alberni has a great highschool, and lots of programs. I also love indie music! My sister showed me Cavetown a couple years ago, and that was the first time actually finding an artist I loved. Right now, I am really into The Arctic Monkeys though. I kind of listen to a variety of different genres mainly being indie, and rock that is not too angressive. That is perfect, thank you! I will complete the one you opened, and then I will let you know which ones I am interested in the most! Thank you so much, talk soon! Danica :D Mentor 2023-03-31, 18:08: Hi Danica, I definitely know the feeling of trying to catch up after spring break! I'm sure you will get everything done :) That's so cool you're making your first sweater right now! My sweater was like a medium shade of blue. This is the pattern I used, it was a really good pattern for my first sweater project: https://tincanknits.com/pattern/flax That's a great idea to take the early childhood education course. So nice that it is free! Something else you could look into would be working or volunteering at a summer camp. I spent a few summers working as a camp counsellor and found it gave me a good idea of working with different ages of kids was like. A lot of the people I was working with were either in school to become teachers or have since started, so definitely a popular job for people interested in working with kids more throughout their career. That's too bad that it didn't work out for you to do band. Playing in the orchestra is super fun! Most of our concerts are just the orchestra playing on its own, but we did all of the music for an opera in February - which is essentially a musical but all the singing is opera and in Italian! That's so interesting to hear about your experiences moving around. I'm so impressed with your attitude around it! Good point about needing to find the right fit for your siblings too. I also have two younger siblings, and I have strong memories of looking out for them growing up. I think that definitely would have been accentuated if we were moving around a lot. Nice music taste!! I will need to check out Cavetown :) Sounds good about the modules! Let me know once you've had a chance to get started on it and we can discuss! No rush at all though, I'm sure you have lots of things going on. Have a good weekend! Mentor 2023-05-01, 09:23: Hey Danica, Thats awesome about your soccer! Nice that your school is getting a team going too :) Sounds good about the modules. I will open ""strategic studying"" to start. Let me know your initial thoughts on it when you have time! Hailey Mentor 2023-06-02, 13:19: Hi Danica, No worries about not responding sooner! I know it's a busy time if the year for you :) Good idea to not have your phone around when studying - I agree that can be really distracting. I'm the same as you and don't like to listen to music when I'm studying. In terms of strategies for studying for tests, I think that as you mentioned, being in a good environment is super important. I spend a lot of time in the library. Beyond the environment, how I study depends a lot on what the content for the test is (ex is it lots of memorization of facts vs understanding broader concepts, etc). If I'm trying to remember facts, I'll often make flash cards and work through those for a couple days. For understanding concepts, I try to make clear notes from the material given by the teacher and write it out or think it through in different ways. Overall, I think studying is just about exposing yourself to material over and over in a way that works for you (which will probably take some trial and error!) I would say that a big way in which high school and university classes differ is there tends to be less guidance on how to learn in the university environment. For example, in high school, your teacher probably gives you homework to do with the goal that doing the homework will make you learn a concept. In university, a professor will give a lecture on a topic and will then maybe test your understanding on a midterm or final exam, but they probably won't give you homework that you have to hand in to check whether you know what's going on before. Let me know if you have any other questions or thoughts!! Also I'll open up the next module just since we're getting near the end of your school year, but no rush to get to it. And we can definitely spend more time working through this one if you want :)",,,,,

She also said that her university really helped her get the job she wanted where she wanted it to be. In the second video the man said that he valued working in vancouver because he loved the scenery and how he could ski and kayak when he pleased. their values shaped their career choices because they knew what they wanted to do and where they wanted to do it. I think that personally my career choice will be shaped alot by my parents, and peers imput. I'm not sure what i want to do yet, but i know that i want to be around people and go to a fun school. I also want to live in a big city. In life i value my friends and family more than anything else. When i think about the world and how bad it is right now i want to contribute peace. I want everyone to be able to walk on the streets and feel safe. In my community i want everyone to have a chance to make their lives better and better themselves. My dream careers are either something to do with cooking, or something to do with English. What do you think a career would be that suits my values? How did your values shape your career? -Jenelle Mentor 2023-03-30, 13:38: For me, I went to university because I did not know what my future path would be. I mostly wanted to figure out what my career should be through university, and I would have more options when i graduate and look for a job. As for what would look good for your career choice, I can't make that decision since you already have a general idea of what you want to do, but I think you can think about doing public relations with your interest in English, and it would help when you apply for a catering company for that position since you have utilized your knowledge with cooking and the process of making the food with customers and writing emails and such, which would also involve English and speaking with people. There are many many more options for you,, that was just an example that could utilize both your career interest, and i think entering university can help you sort out whether you want to set this as a career path or if you want to look for something else when you graduate university. I think university is a great time for you to discover yourself and understand what your personality is like, what you want your future to look like, etc. There is still a lot of time for you to think over what you want to do and even when you enter a university there are a lot of resources for you to discover what you want to do or confirm what you want your future to look like :) Mentee 2023-04-03, 09:13: Hello! One of the first carreers i got matched with is a elementary and kindergarten teacher. Their annual salary is $75,499.00 which is quite a bit. The only problem with that for me is that i very strongly dislike young children. if i were to be a teacher it would have to be a high school teacher. I would love to do something with English and if i could be a highschool English teacher it would be fun. I would love to live away from home and it would give me enough money to do the things i need and want to do. When you were deciding what career path to take how did you decide what to do? Did you ever change your career path before or during school? I personally have no clue what i am going to do when im older, but really do need to start planning for the future. Get back to me whenever you can.Thanks! -Jenelle (your mentee) Mentor 2023-04-05, 12:02: i dont like children that much either so that is a big mood lol I honestly don't have a clear path of what exactly my career would be other than it involving writing, i will say if you want english to be involved in your career, an editorial job would be best without working with children at all. Journalism is a good way as a career path as well though it has a pretty heavy course load and tough working environment but it is fulfilling if you are passionate about what you write. I am still looking at what i wanted to do after i graduate, i don't have a set path yet but i think you still have a lot of time to think about your career path, and you can always look for opportunities that interest when you enter post-secondary, that's the time for you to thrive :)","Mentor 2023-06-05, 19:44: it's unlocked :) Mentee 2023-06-19, 09:46: Hey! have a few questions and stuff about studying. i find that making flashcards is super helpful for me and helps me remember things way more effectively and efficently. something that is challenging for me is that i will study for hours and then get to the test and get nervous and won't remember anything i studied. when you study for exams what strategies do you use to help you remember things and get the best outcome possible? thank you! -Jenelle Mentor 2023-06-19, 20:17: I have a horrible memory, literally atrocious, so I used to study a week beforehand to make sure I got the information embedded in my brain but it didn't really work, so I now know that I work better with practice, I do a lot of practice tests to make sure I understand the information instead of simply memorizing. Didn't have a lot of chances to do that now because some uni profs don't like doing that, but I tried :,) I don't really get nervous anymore when I take exams nowadays because I'm already so used to it, but what I used to do is to make sure I have enough sleep, at least 7 hours of sleep before an exam makes you are in your best condition when taking an exam. And sometimes you just have to remember failing an exam is never the end of the world, it may look like it but there are always more chances for you to get better and there is always another way if you failed this one path.","Mentor 2023-04-17, 11:23: It's unlock, msg me if you need or want to know anything else :) Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:18: Hey i've just read the stuff about student loans, scholarships, grants, bursaries, and awards and i found it quite interesting. I think that 3 of my top picks for scholarships would be StudentAid BC, BC Excellence Scholarship, and District/Authority Scholarships. if you don't mind me asking. How are you currently funding your future? Mentor 2023-05-07, 10:30: SO sorry for the late message, I have been busy &gt;-&lt; I'm fortunate enough that my family can fund my tuition, so I am not entirely sure what grants would be best suited for you. However, my family is only funding my education and school-related expenses, and I am living away from home so I do have a part-time job during the semester to fund my living expenses. I am also taking up summer jobs and co-op positions later on to save up before I graduate :) Mentee 2023-05-23, 09:25: Hey! i just checked out the second part of this moduel and realized that non of the things on the worksheet are things that i pay for on my own considering i am only in grade 10. i do have some questions for you though! as you are going through university what is the most challenging thing to budget for you? Also how do you keep track of all your money and all your payment dates? looking forward to hearing from you! -Jenelle Mentor 2023-05-31, 11:36: Hi!! I'm so sorry for getting back to you this late, I may have forgotten about reply to your message For me right now is managing how much i want to save. Because I want to use my own money that i earned for day-to-day expenses, and i am fortunate enough to have my parents pay for my tuition, i have to budget my income so I can not only have enough to buy groceries but also have some left to save up for the future. I think the most challenging for me and because i am quite anxious when it comes to money i write down everything I spent money on and keeping tabs on what items am i spending too much on. So tldr my struggle is how to not feel guilty if i spent a bit more than i had budgeted, and that sometimes there are things that happened unexpectedly that you just have to spend more than you planned. I do have a bullet journal where i put everything in, including my daily planning and my budget, so i would write down my expected income for the month, then write what expenses i will be making eg groceries, phone bill, etc, then plan on how much money would go to those places. Since i am living in a school residence, i don't have to pay rent every month, so i don't need to keep track on those expenses, but i do have phone reminders for my phone bill payment, so i won't forget to pay them.","Mentor 2023-03-03, 16:44: Hello Jenelle o/ I'm Renee and im your mentor!

You can watch the videos and read through everything above and then we can talk through some of the discussion questions. How easy is it for you to think about self-care as something important? Sometimes when I get busy with work and school, I kind of forget about self-care. But - I've started scheduling it into my daily agenda. Some things that really help me are to make time to go to the gym, seeing friends, and reading or listening to podcasts. When I schedule time in for self-care, it's way easier to remember to do!",,,,"Mentor 2023-04-20, 17:01: Hey Kalie! Here is the finding inspiration module! You can work through the questions, acitivities and videos above :) Mentee 2023-05-01, 09:11: To, Brookelyn I have finished the finding inspiration module. 1, Where do you find inspiration with what you want to do? I want to become a daycare assistant because I care about making sure that they have a good role model and that they are well taken care of while in daycare. I really want to get a job this year, and i also want to get into the ECE course for grade 12, along with geting an office ticket after that. 2. What habits have you built and how have these habits helped you achieve your goals? Some of my goals are: -To become better at crochet, - to get about 30 minutes of exercise everyday. - to get a job. is it okay if we do the getting hired module next? Thank you, :) Kalie Mentor 2023-05-08, 17:30: Hi Kalie! This is so great! You are so passionate about caring for kids. You also have some great goals! How have you SMART goals gone?

My name is Kalie and I am your mentee! it is very nice to meet you. I was reading about your hobbies and i think its really cool that you grew up on a farm and you were a 4H member. I also love animals. I have two cats and a dog. i also love harry potter, I am almost done the second book so i still have lots to go. i saw that you are trying to learn how to knit, i knit myself and what helped me is watching plenty of videos, practice, and paticence. do you have a career path you are thinking of? And I just wanted to let you know that am going on spring break soon, I will try to keep in touch but if you dont hear from me between the 13-27 of march then thats why. At the end of pring break, I would like to start with the ""well being and self care"" module and then ""getting hired"" module. Thank you for being my mentor :) -Kalie Mentor 2023-03-13, 15:29: Hi Kalie, I am so excited to meet you! That's amazing! My sister just got a kitten and I love her so much - her name is Penny! I can't wait to get my own cat one day :) Also super excited to hear you're reading Harry Potter and knit! Have you watched the movies? Also - what sorts of things do you like to knit? It is my dream to become a doctor! So I have applied to medical schools and am doing interviews for it right now :) What sort of career path are you interested in? I hope you have a great spring break and can't wait to start with well-being and self-care! Talk soon! Brookelyn Mentee 2023-03-27, 08:49: Hi brookelyn, I am back from spring break, sorry about the wait. I think thats awesome that you want to be a doctor. Your sisters kitten sounds adorable. I have watched the first Harry Potter movie and i am planning on watching the second one very soon. Right now, I have been working on knitting a sweater which was a big project for me to start on but i have done most of the pieces so i think it will turn out okay :) talk to you soon! kalie Mentee 2023-03-28, 09:14: Hi Brookelyn, When you have a chance, can you please unlock the well being and self care module? Thank you, :) kalie P.S i just realized i forgot to answer your question about what career path i want to take, sorry about that. I am hoping to be a teacher aid and work one on one with kids with IEPs. Mentor 2023-03-28, 09:22: Hey Kalie! I hope you had a good Spring Break! That's a great career path :) What made you interested in that? I'll unlock that module now. Talk soon! Mentee 2023-03-28, 09:30: To Brookelyn, Thank you. I am very interested in being a educational assistant because i believe that every kid deserves to have have the support and help that they need to be sucessful. all the nice educationals assistants that have helped me really made a difference for the better and i have always remembered them. And i want the kids that i help out to not have a negative experience with me as it does not feel good to have a educational assistant that doesnt help you. im really hoping i can reach this goal to help kids :) kalie Mentor 2023-03-29, 11:37: That's such an amazing goal! You are obviously a very caring and dedicated person! Mentee 2023-03-30, 09:34: Hi Brookelyn! Thank you so much! i have been looking at careers that would suit my dream and im thinking a daycare assistant would be the best option for me. thank you for setting up the module. I sometimes forget to take good care of my mental health and well being. i do believe that i need to work on getting more exercise as i love being in nature and its good for me. i do love walking and doing yoga so my goal will be to work on giving a chunk of time to that. I will watch the video now and work on those questions :) From Kalie Mentee 2023-03-30, 09:52: To Brookelyn, i finished watching the video. What do you do for selfcare when you feel burned out? how do you fix a unwanted pattern in your scedule such as sleep? From kalie :) Mentee 2023-03-30, 09:55: To Brookelyn, The three changes im going to make is fixing my sleep, execising more, and eating better :) From kalie Mentor 2023-04-04, 17:12: Hey Kalie! Great that you watched the video! When I feel burnt out, the best thing for me is to kind of disconnect from my phone, laptop, or other screens and go for a walk outside or do something with my friends. Also, listening to my body and make sure I take a rest. It's always tough when I am super busy, but I try and set a limit for myself working and once I hit a certain time of day I don't work after that. Sometimes that's not always possible if I have lots of things to do for work or other responsibilities, but I try my best to make sure I am balancing both. I find if I get burnt out, it takes me longer to do things than it would otherwise, so making sure I have rest and personal times helps me get more work done in the long run. To fix an unwanted pattern, such as sleep, I set SMART goals for myself (you can google this if you want to try) and break my bigger goal down into smaller goals that I can achieve. I also think of things that I can change which will make it easier for me to break the unwanted pattern. So, for example, recently I realized I was skipping the gym more and more often which I didn't like. So I did things link put my gym shoes, clothes, water bottle, etc. out right where I can see them so it's ready to grab and go. I also made plans to go with friends so that it would be harder for me to back out and do other things. These little changes helped me get back into my normal routine of going to the gym! Mentor 2023-04-04, 17:13: Hey! Your goals of working towards better sleep, more exercise, and eating better are so great!! What do you think you can do to achieve those goals? How will you know when you me those goals - like how much exercise would you like to do? Mentee 2023-04-06, 09:21: Hi Brookelyn, Im hoping to achive these goals by doing SMART goals or recording progress everyday. ive been able to get out of bed easier so i think ive been doing some progress. I also helped my mom make stirfry last night so eating better has been slowly getting better. i havent made myself time to exercise much unfortunetly, but I will keep on working towards it. also taking a break from the electronics for a little bit does help me, Listening to music helps me get stuff done aswell. Happy Easter! Kalie :) Mentor 2023-04-06, 12:22: Hey Kalie! That's so great to hear! Seems like you are making good progress :) It's hard to change lots of different things at once so be patient and kind to yourself :) So proud of you! Awesome to hear that you're cooking with your mom! Do you have people in your life, maybe or mom or maybe other people, who ecourage or model self care? What are some of the things that they do to take care of themselves? How might you incoporate some of what they do into your own life? Happy Easter to you too! I hope its a fun long weekend! Mentee 2023-04-17, 08:50: Hi Brookelyn, i am so sorry about the late reply, i got really busy. I will try my best to do better with that. But thank you! i have been working hard and I made myself do yoga on a nice sunny day! I hope that it gets sunny again soon so i could do that again outside. My mom really likes to go out and walk but we dont do it enough so, we could make that a goal. i also want to get her to do some yoga with me. from: Kalie :) Mentee 2023-04-17, 08:52: To Brookelyn, Also, when we are done with this module, can we work on the finding inspiration module? Thank you! Kalie :) Mentor 2023-04-20, 17:00: That's amazing Kalie! Yoga in the sun sounds like so much fun! I will open up the next conversation now! Mentee 2023-04-26, 08:57: Hi, Brookelyn Awesome! Thank you for opening the module. i will get on it as soon as i can :) From Kalie Mentee 2023-05-10, 09:15: Hey Brookelyn! That is awesome that you were able to get a job as a cashier! That buisness class you took must have helped a lot, as well as being apart of 4-H. I have tried applying for a few jobs, but i have had no luck. I am hoping to to try again soon. i have a few udeas of where i want to work so hopefully i get hired for the summer. I will work on the getting hired module :) Thank you, Kalie Mentor 2023-05-18, 14:41: Hey Kalie! Thanks so much! The business class really did help! Have you ever made a resume before? Mentee 2023-05-19, 08:56: Hi, brookelyn! I have made a few resumes and im really trying to get a job. i have applied to 3 places, i have applied to two of them twice but one of them told me that they arent hiring so im not sure to apply. also im sorry i havent gotten to the getting hired module, i will make it a priority this weekend From Kalie Mentor 2023-05-21, 13:09: Hi Kalie! No problem at all :) That's great! I hope someone calls you back :) What kind of job are you looking for? Mentor 2023-05-21, 13:21: Hey Kalie! 1 &amp; 2 ) Those are wonderful skills to have and I think you're right - they will help you get and job and when have job, especially at places like Canadian Tire and Tim Hortons! What skills did you put of your resume to describe these awesome experiences and skills you've developed through chores, working with friends, etc.? 3) Being nervous for a job interview is so so normal! I still get nervous for any interview I have. As long as you're not TOO nervous, I think that engery can help during and interview when you are trying to present yourself in the best light. I think something that's improtant to remember, is that the interviewer expects you to be nervous - especially when it is your first ever job/job interview! In my experience, they are always nice and helpful, and if I say something differently than I meant to, they understand when I rephrase something or clarify. Also, although I've never been involved with interviewing people, I have trained new hires - and I can tell you that I was also very nervous to say the wrong thing or do something wrong. I've heard from other who have interviewed potential employees that they are super nervous too! Remembering that has helped calm my nerves before interviews. 4) Honestly, my first interview wasn't really even an interview! The grocery story in my home town called me a few months after I dropped off my resume and asked me in to chat. I thought I was coming in for an interview, but it turned out that they already had my schedule ready and just needed to talk about the hiring process. I think that was because my hometown is so small that they had known me since I was born haha. My second job interview was a little more formal. I applied to work as fire watch at a near by lumber mill. It took about 20 minutes and I mostly just chatted with the person hiring me. He asked me a few questions (things like what are your skills, what's your biggest weakness and strength) also things about the job itself in terms of making sure I understood what I would be doing and if I'm still interested. He was very nice, and afterwards gave me some feedback on my resume and cover letter - how to stand out from the crowd. I ended up getting the job and worked there for a summer. I think my biggest lesson, is that most of the people hiring are pretty nice people who want to work with other nice people and to just show them who you are and why'd you'd be a great employee for them! PS - I hope you're having a great long weekend!! Mentee 2023-05-23, 08:50: Hi, Brookelyn! thank you, i hope someone calls me back as well, it has been bothering me. i was hoping to get a job as a barista but you have to be 16 so i have to wait til the near end of July. i would have liked to be a cook somewhere but my nose likes to bleed in heat and dryness so i dont think that would work until i can figure that issue out. My other option would be stalking shelves at a store and helping customers around the store. How was your long weekend? :) and, for the next module, can we please do the career exploration? Thank you, Kalie Mentor 2023-05-23, 17:11: Hey Kalie! My long weekend was great! I read a book and hung out with my family who's visiting from Vancouver! How was yours? The waiting can be tough for sure! Those are all great options - something that has helped me get calls about jobs is giving my resume right to the person who does the hiring :) Absolutely! I will open it now Mentee 2023-06-21, 08:54: To Brookelyn, i hope youre doing well. I am very sorry for not keeping in touch. i have been distracted with schoolwork. I just want to say thank you for all of your help and being patient with responsises. i hope you have a great summer. :) Thank you for everything, Kalie. Mentor 2023-06-23, 15:47: Hi Kalie, Thanks so much for your sweet message and for being such a great mentee! You have a big future ahead of you :) Have a great summer! Brookelyn",,,"Mentor 2023-05-08, 17:36: Hi Kalie! Here is the Getting Hired conversation :) I remember writing my first resume - I did it in a business class at my high school! It was a little bit overwhelming. I found that using a template for the first draft was very helpful, and then I could edit and change it to suit myself. Also, having lots of people review my resume for spelling and grammar was super helpful too. I actually got a job as a cashier at the grocery store in my town with my resume that summer! Something that I found hard was thinking about what skills I could bring to a job, especially because I had never worked before. I made a list of all my activities and thought about what I learned and was good at because of those activities. For example, in 4-H I had to work by myself as well as with club members to raise and train our pigs. I thought that a transferrable skill that came from this was the ability to work independently as well as part of a team. Mentee 2023-05-19, 09:16: To Brookelyn, Getting hired module questions: 1) I have had some experience with having good communication with friends and family, I have had some experience with being responsible with chores, and taking care of my pets, I have been in group projects, and i have experience with technology from media design in grade 9, and Career life Education 10. 2) I do really want to canadian tire or tim hortons. I havent tried at Tim Hortons yet but i have tried twice at canadian tire. I think that skills like communication, technology, responibility, teamwork, respect, and honestly might be good skills with getting a job. 3) i am going to be honest, i am quite scared to get a job interview but at the same time i really want one. I am worried that i will mess it up and say the wrong thing. 4) What was your first job interview like? how did you feel? was it as scary as it seems? Thank you, From Kalie :)",,
1047549915,10/30/2021 18:39,1047594026,59573,,,,,,"Mentee 2023-03-28, 09:23: Anchor Text 1; The more realistic career path that I researched was elementary and kindergarten teacher, in order to have this career I would need to have a bachelors degree in education, a provincial teaching certificate and past experience werking with children/volenteering in schools. The other career that i researched in pharmacy, although i don't really want to do this i thought it would be cool. In order to become a pharmacist you need to have completed a bachelor's degree in pharmacyand pass a board examination administered by the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada.To practise in B.C, you must also pass an English Language Fluency exam and have 1,000 hours of internship. I am planning on going to university because the many benfits are higher salaries, being able to study what i would like and getting a better education. Because i want to be a kindergarten teacher and working with children has always come easy to me i don't think i will face many obsticles in becoming one. I am also a very hard worker and pride myself in my grades i believe that if i put my mind to it i will be ok in university. I am also kind of looking forward to university i think it will be a cool experience. Becoming a kindergarten teacher is very attainable for me and i am quite excited. When you were chossing a career path, did the legnth of the course impact you decision at all? Mentor 2023-03-29, 23:38: Hi Sarah, That's great! Teaching is a great career path. I'm glad to hear that you are a very hard worker and do well in school. I'm sure you will get into your program of choice if you keep things up. Good question about the length of the career path. I am about to graduate from my undergrad degree this year and that is still something I worry about sometimes haha. It is something that is more of a personal thing and I guess that worry comes from a lot of external influences in my experience. I want to go to medical school and that is a very long career path. I have always wanted to be a physician, so I didn't really worry about the length of my education requirements when I was first choosing my career path. But now some of my friends are finishing their undergraduate degrees and moving on to more permanent jobs and beginning to settle down with families and I sometimes feel behind when it in a way, if that makes sense. But I have done a lot of self-reflection on this and going to medical school is something I really want. I have worked very hard in order to apply and I know I will be much happier in the future knowing that I worked towards my goals and didn't let societal expectations get to me. So to answer your question the length of the course didn't impact my decision but it was something I considered. And I weighed out the pros and cons for myself and what that would mean for me in order to make that decision. I would recommend that you do some journalling or some reflection on your long term goals when applying to schools in the future. It sounds like you want to become a elementary school teacher and if that is something you really want, then I would say go for it! I wouldn't let the fear of course length impact your decisions. One piece of advice I received was that we are all going to get older. In the grand scheme of things when you are in your late 60s or 70s or 80s, it won't matter if you took a few more years to graduate more university. What will matter will be the life you lived and whether you lived it on your own terms and doing something you loved. I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any questions and what topic you want to work on next. Best, Jasleen Mentee 2023-04-03, 09:02: Anchor Text 2: I looked into UVic and at this time i belive that this is my best option. It is only a 3 hour drive from my parents and my sister is in attendance there right now and will still be when it's my time to go to university. In order to get into the program i need basic highschool courses, the website says that it would incresase my chances of getting accepted if i had an average of 90% in all my classes. At the moment in grade 10, I do have an average of 90% so i will just need to keep this up. The main factor that i like about UVic is that it is so close to home but i still get to experience city life, along with the fact that it is a great school that both my mom and sister went to. I also may like to be involved in basketball even if it is just intramurals. I think that if i keep up my good grades and continue to be involved in the community i have a good chance at being excepted. Now that i have completed this mod, will we be working on another? Mentor 2023-04-09, 13:36: Hi Sarah, UVIC is a great school! That might be a great fit. I also did something similar. I live in the Lower Mainland, but my house is about a 2 hour drive to UBC. So I lived on campus, but it was nice to be close to home so that my parents could visit and I could go home if I was feeling home sick. Intramurals are great! I did basketball intramurals at UBC and had so much fun doing so. It was a great way to relax and meet new people. Yes! We can move on to another module. Which one will you like to open next? P.S. I'm sorry for hte delay in response! It is finals season for me so my email has been a bit crazy. Jasleen",,,"Mentor 2023-05-22, 00:01: Hi Sarah, Great I have opened that module! Jasleen Mentee 2023-05-23, 09:31: Anchor text; When i study the only method that i often use from the video is the Dual Coding method, with colours and visuals. I think i would be able to try these methods out nect time a big text is coming up, the way i study now it somewhat effective but i know it could be improved upon. I may need to try spaced practice becuase i usually only study the night before but i can see how spacing it out could be effective. I would normally just go through my notes and rewrite the important things and then reread them over and over again. What methods do you use when studying for tests/exams? And how did your studying have to change from highschool to post-secondary school?","Mentor 2023-06-07, 16:25: Hi Sarah, That conversation is opened now! Jasleen Mentee 2023-06-19, 08:47: Anchor text 1; I am planning on going to post-secondary school and there are quite a few scholarships and bursaries i can apply for. Examples are the Alberni Valley Catholic Women’s League- Holy Family/Notre Dame Church Bursary, the McMillan Family Bursary (Basketball) and the St. John Paul II Catholic School Parent Support Group Bursary. They are each $500 which would be nice to start with $1500, and it is quite difficult to find many other catholic teenagers in our school so two of those would be quite easy for me to get. How are you funding your education? Did you apply for many scholarships or bursaries? Mentor 2023-06-20, 15:47: Hi Sarah, Applying for scholarships is a great idea. I applied to scholarships in high school and got a few, but they weren't nearly enough to cover my tuition. I started working part time in the summer of grade 11 and worked throughout grade 12 and saved up my money to pay for post-secondary. I have also worked throughout university on a part-time basis to fund my studies. I won some merit based scholarships while in school at UBC as well. I would recommend starting to apply for scholarships as early as possible. Also be sure to have a set of 2-3 solid reference letters from teachers/coaches/supervisors ready to go for your applications in grade 12 or earlier so that you can apply to as many scholarships as possible. Increasing the number you apply to increases the chances of you winning. You can find many other scholarships online such as on https://www.scholarshipscanada.com/. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Jasleen","Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:19: Hello Jasleen, my name is Sarah and I'm your mentee! How are you? What career are young studying or working in now? The modules I want to complete this semester are Post secondary &amp; Career planning, stratigic studying and getting hired. Coming up next week is our schools spring break, so although my teacher said that we will be able to chat once a week during the break i will not have access to mentor city. This will be 2 weeks. Thank you for being my ementor! Talk soon, Sarah. Mentor 2023-03-13, 01:55: Hi Sarah! Thanks for reaching out. I apologize for the delay in response. My email has been spammed all week as it's midterm season at school. I am a fifth year student student at UBC studying Biology. I hope to pursue a career in medicine in the future. I am currently looking at jobs in clinical research as I am planning on taking a gap year before applying to medical school. We can definately get started on the modules you have noted. I'll open up post secondary and career planning as your first module. I hope you have a great spring break! Chat soon! Jasleen :) Mentee 2023-04-17, 08:53: Hi, no problem about the late response.

I got rid of any personal information, so if i was to hand it in to someone i would have my last name, number and email. Mentor 2023-05-12, 14:42: Hi Sarah, Thank you for sending your resume over. I think that is a great start. Some feedback I received when I was in high school was to try to use action verbs to highlight what you have done and your skills. Here is an article that describes what I mean in more depth https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-action-words. For instance, for the first entry, it could be editted to include some of the following bullet points: Provide childcare services for families with children ages 1-10, ensuring their safety and well-being while under my care. Provide regular updates and communication to parents regarding their child's behavior, accomplishments, and any concerns that may arise. Engage children in fun and educational games, activities and crafts to stimulate their learning and creativity. Prepare and serve nutritious meals and snacks for children, taking into consideration their dietary restrictions and preferences. Foster positive relationships with children, building trust and rapport through effective communication and active listening. I think it is great that you are working a summer job at your mom's school. It is totally okay to find experiences that are not directly through job listings. In fact, networking and find jobs through word of mouth is often referred to as the ""hidden job market"". Universities encourage students to network to tap into these opportunities that you might not come across through a job posting board. So it is great that you are leveraging your connections to make use of those opportunities! Let me know if you have any other questions! Thank You, Jasleen Mentor 2023-05-12, 14:43: P.S. Let me know what module you would like to work on next Mentor 2023-05-31, 09:55: Hi Sarah, I find that active recall methods work best for me. I am guilty of studying the day before exams, but find I perform best when I do spaced studying. I got away with that in high school, but that doesn't really work in unversity. I used to re-write notes in high school, but that is more of a passive studying method that I found was ineffective and often took more time while being less effective. I definately started doing more active recall in post-secondary which helped me perform better on exams. I like to use an app called ""Anki"" which is free for desktop. It allows you to make flashcards and study them in intervals based on when you will forget the knowledge. Let me know if you have any other question! Which module would you like to work on next?

Communication; If i am to be missing school for dance, sickness etc. i am very good at emailing or talking with my teachers and figuring out how i will make up missed work. Responsibility; In school i am responsible for handed in work on time and for studying for tests, quizzes etc. and this is evident when my grades turn out very good. Quick Learner; I am a quick learner and this is shown in dance class, i am able to apply corrections in order to get better and can learn a whole dance in an hour. Team Work; In school we often do group projects where you need to work together and coordinate jobs for everyone. Recently i am working on a mock interview with another student where team work is key. Technology; In many classes we use computers for research, making good copies and almost anything you can imagine so i have become quite fimiliar with computers and that sort of technology. In the summer i will be working at the school my mom is the principal of doing part time janitoring. The skills i will need is effiency, working hard and doing a thorough job. I think i will be able to do this. There is no job posting because i heard about from my mom orally, i hope that is ok. I will also email you my resume for you to review.

I just opened up the post-secondary and career planning module for ya! Have a read through and let me know if you have any questions. Jocey Mentee 2023-04-25, 10:29: For one of the jobs I wish to pursue (Heavy machinery operator) I only require the GED or a high school diploma. For welding I also need a high school diploma, but I would like to possibly get my red seal in welding which requires me to attend a tech college and attend an apprenticeship program, after that I must take the Red Seal exam prep course and after that I must become a Red Seal worker by taking and passing the exam. I will benefit greatly from attending post secondary as I would receive a Red Seal in welding, this will lead to high paying work and let me enjoy that. Learning to operate heavy machinery may be a challenge for me, as well as attending the schooling required to recieve my Red Seal in welding, as I find my self challenged in the class room at times, my dyslexia being a large factor in that. I am nervous about going to school for welding, its a big thing that will decide the rest of my life, and if I dont do well in it im not sure where I will go. I believe that I can do it, I have gotten this far in my schooling, but I do think that it will be challenging, welding is something that I am passionate about and enjoy doing, so I think that it is possible for me to pass the schooling that I need for my Red Seal. Mentor 2023-04-25, 19:14: Hi Austin, Thanks for writing so much about your plans for heavy machinery operator and welding! It sounds like you know exactly what programs and training are required for these sweet jobs, which is a great first step. I also agree that it's so important to train in something that you enjoy doing. It'll be hard and busy but worth it. Do you have any questions? Which module do you want to open up next?",,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-03, 10:24: Hey Austin! How's it going?! My name is Jocey and I'm currently in my 2nd year of medical school. My work experience includes being a Civic Worker (mowing grass &amp; painting lines!), working at a fruit &amp; veggie farm, and working at Teck Metals as a plant processing operator in the Zinc Smelter. Both my brothers are in the trades, and I'm hoping I can help if you have any questions. Also - I definitely know how to write up a good application, and apply for funding for programs after high school. I saw that you're wanting to be a welder? Do you know of any trades programs near you? Let me know if you have any questions after you read through how this platform works!! Jocey Mentee 2023-04-06, 10:08: Hello, sorry for the delayed response I havent been able make to school for a while as I have had some things going on outside of school Mentee 2023-04-11, 10:16: Hello Jocey, I am hoping to have welding as one of my major skills and I do know of a program I can do at the college locally next year to get one year towards my red seal early. I was hoping to be able to open up the ""Post Secondary &amp; career planning"" module up first.",,,,,

Please watch the video titled ""The Creative Process: Where Do I Start?"". Consider the following statement from Mina Shum: “Everybody wants something…I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” Think about what inspires you... What do you want in life? What are you passionate about and why? Share your thoughts, and try to write 5 things that you want in life, and why you want these things. They can be materialistic, experiential, etc! I am looking forward to reading your response :)",,,,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 19:29: Hey Adison! My name is Sarah, I am excited to be your eMentor this semester :) To tell you a bit about myself, I love skiing and mountain biking. My favourite food is my homemade neapolitan pizza using a family recipe that has been passed down for generations. What are some of your favourite hobbies? We have a few conversations to go through, do you have a preference with one that you'd like to start with? Mentee 2023-03-30, 08:46: Hi! Sorry its taken so long to get back to you, we had spring break for two weeks then i got busy with work. Skiing sounds so fun! i've never tried it but lots of my friends have. Im not really sure where to start with this program so wherever you think would be the best place to start is great with me. hope you have a great day! -Adison.

1047548847,10/16/2021 9:47,1047593955,59539,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-04-24, 12:53: Hi Connor, Sorry about the late reply, it seems my last response didn't go through when I thought it did. I'm glad you remember that you've read The Alchemist and that you have a favourite part. As for myself, I'd have to say that my favourite part was when Santiago realizes that his treasure was in Spain all along, and returns home from his long journey. It's great that you've come up with some thoughtful responses to the discussion questions! One thing that I might ask is: what about a ""good life"" do you value living? What would make your life ""good""? Also, you could think about how the careers you listed, all of which are great options, can contribute to you living a fulfilling life. In terms of a career which I think may fit your values, it's quite difficult to say. Any career can be fulfilling and make you feel as if you've had no regrets. It just depends on how much you enjoy the career and how passionate you are about it. As for myself, I think I chose to do engineering because of its ability to cater to many problems. There are so many ways you can help others as an engineer, whether it be by designing a newer, safer car for transportation or a new medical technology for doctors. The opportunity to make an impact in somebody's life by developing new technology is what made me choose to be an engineer. Let me know if you have any other questions! If not, feel free to move on to the next anchor text. -Rayyan","Mentor 2023-05-10, 11:11: Hey Connor, I'm glad we agree! I too did think that the coins would make another appearance, but I guess not. Just out of curiosity, are you doing any reading currently? As for what I'm learning, currently, I'm studying biomedical engineering. I do enjoy it quite a bit, so definitely let me know if you want to learn more! It's great to hear that you've narrowed down your interests! Photons and light are indeed very fascinating phenomena—you could certainly learn more about them as an engineer or even a physicist. What part about photons do you think interests you the most? Finally, as you requested, I've opened up the Strategic Studying module. Hopefully, you can learn something new, and use it to advance your studying! As always, let me know if you have any questions, either about the anchor texts or anything else! -Rayyan Mentor 2023-05-20, 08:23: Hi Connor, Those sound like quite interesting books! I haven’t read either, but I’ve heard of Marcus Aurelius before and some of his famous works in philosophy. Thanks for explaining why you are interested in photons. I agree with what you said, light is certainly going to be a key part of the future! It’s great that you’ve identified a study strategy that you have used. I also have crammed before exams; however, I find that for me, it usually does not end well. I think the most important part of my study strategy currently is to always review the content. Within 24 hours of a lecture, I try to review what I learned. This makes it easier to review during exams. When I have an exam coming up, I start by reviewing the notes that I wrote. I try to redo some practice problems that I may have found challenging. After that, I try to do lots of practice exams, where I go back and look at my mistakes to figure out what to study more. As for differences between high school and post-secondary classes, I find that the biggest changes are the pace and flexibility. You only have classes two or three times a week, so you do cover a lot of content during your lectures. At the same time, outside of class, it’s completely up to you to study and review. It might initially seem intimidating but don’t be alarmed. Everybody is in the same boat, and this does take some time to get used to. However, if you work hard, and learn to adapt to the new environment, you can, without a doubt, be successful. Sorry about all the text—I hope you can make some sense of it and maybe learn something new. As for this module, let me know if you have any other questions. If not, let me know which module you’d like to start next! -Rayyan",,"Mentor 2023-03-04, 13:08: Hi Connor! It's great to meet you! My name is Rayyan and I'm extremely excited to get to talk to you and be your mentor for the next few months. We'll be able to check out a lot of interesting topics and learn about them, which will hopefully come in handy for whatever you want to do after high school! As a brief introduction, I'm a biomedical engineering student living in British Columbia. My favourite part about being an engineering student is learning how to solve complicated problems. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and occasionally playing video games. My favourite book would have to be The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, and my favourite video game would definitely be Minecraft. Do you have any favourite books or video games that you could recommend? If you have any questions about the program or anything else, don't hesitate to ask, and I'll do my best to find an answer. And once again, I'm absolutely thrilled to be your mentor and I look forward to learning alongside you over the next few months! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:50: Hi Rayyan, It'll be great working with you aswell! I am curious as to what the course will bring, and excited. I'll introduce myself aswell, I am living in British Columbia aswell, and am still in high school. I am interested in the Engineering field, but I am worried that it'd be too challenging. How do you find engineering so far? What have you done to get where you are? In my free time, I read and play video games aswell, and I also play an instrument. My favourite books would have to be the Eragon series. I have read it 3 times, and I'd highly recommend it. The Alchemsit is on my to-read list, so when I do read it I'll tell you my thoughts on it! Minecraft is a fantastic game, and is among my favorites, but my all time favorite has to be Terraria(which I'd recommend aswell). I think we should do the 'Career Exploration' course first, as it seems like a good starting point, what do you think? Thank for choosing me as your mentee, I am excited as to what the next few months will bring aswell! Connor. Mentor 2023-03-09, 21:13: Hello Connor, It's great to hear that you are interested in engineering! I enjoy learning about engineering concepts, and I'd be glad to help answer any questions you might have. As for my first year, I found it quite memorable. Engineering was a bit challenging to adjust to at first, but I gradually fell into a routine and better understood how to manage my time and study effectively. I think that if you genuinely enjoy the field of engineering, then you should definitely be willing to take the risk and pursue it! Engineering offers a lot of challenges, but there are equally as many opportunities to learn and grow. One thing I'd recommend is to always believe in yourself. It might get difficult at times, but if you made it this far, you can certainly make it further. I'm great that you enjoy reading and playing video games! I appreciate your book recommendation. I read the Eragon series quite a while ago; since you recommended it, I can see if I can get my hands on a copy of the first book to read again. As for Terraria, unfortunately, I have never tried playing it myself. I usually don't have too much time to play video games during the school semester, but I'll see if I can try it out through a friend since you spoke so highly of it. I'm happy you put a lot of effort into your intro conversation. It seems like we have a lot in common, and it's great to see that you are enthusiastic to start. I think it's a great idea to start with the Career Exploration module. You should be able to go through some of the anchor texts and take a look at some discussion questions. As always, let me know if you have any questions! I look forward to hearing from you! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-03-27, 09:56: Rayyan, I would first like to apologize for the long response time, I just got back from spring break. It does seem like a very large challenge. Definetly something to work towards. Though, I do enjoy learning, so I'll keep you updated as I learn more about it. Thank you for the recommendations aswell! Did you like the Eragon series? Also, I have started reading Alchemist, I'll tell you my thoughts on it when I finish it, which I will probably by the time you write back. Did you try out Terraria? If so, did you like it? Sure, I am going to start it the day after I am writing this. Connor. Mentor 2023-03-29, 16:57: Hi Connor, All good, hope you had a good spring break! Let me know if you ever have any questions about engineering, and I can try my best to answer. As for the Eragon series, I remember that I did enjoy it quite a lot, so I'm sure it'll be a great read now too. I'm glad you are making progress with The Alchemist, which is a great book. Unfortunately, I was not able to try out Terraria, and I am quite busy with school right now. I'll see if I can play a little bit during my spring break. Let me know what questions you have based on the anchor texts. Hope you enjoy your time back at school! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-04-18, 09:52: Hi Rayyan, I read the Alchemist, but half way through reading it, I realized I had already read it years ago! I still finished it, as I was foggy on the details, but it truly is fantastic book. My favorite part was when the Alchemist made gold with the philospher's stone. What was yours? These are my answers for the discussion questions: • What do you value in life? - I value living a good life, that I felt I had no regrets, or missed opportunites. • How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? - I would like to contribute by making someones life easier, or improving it in some way • Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? - Engineering, Doctor (Though I'd prefer a specialist, not just a doctor), Technician, or something in the art field (preferably music). ASK: What are some ideas for careers that might suit your values. Also ask them how their values informed their career choice Thanks, Connor. Mentee 2023-05-08, 08:49: Hi Rayyan, I enjoyed that part of the book aswell! It was a very good ending, though I first expected the treasure to be the coins his father gave him for the sheep at the start of the book. What field of engineering are you going into? I'll consider my options more, and research them for a fufilling career. Thank you for your input in my situation. I think engineer may be the path I go down, as I am very interested in photons, so a field in that could be a great option. I don't have any more questions about this anchor, so how about we move on to Strategic Studying, because I have been having trouble with studying recently, and I am curious as to if it could help. Thanks again, Connor. Mentee 2023-05-18, 09:45: Hi Rayyan, I am doing some reading. I have a list of books I am reading, but currently I am reading 'The Shadow if What Was Lost,' for a fun read. Then, next I am going to read Meditations by Marcus Aurealis. I enjoy learning about photons, because I think they will be very important in the future, and it just interests me in the potential of what can be done with them. SHARE: Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? I usually use the cramming method, which has not been bad so far, but I feel that later on it may not be the best for larger units and tests. ASK: What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? Thanks, Connor Mentee 2023-06-06, 08:52: Hey Rayyan, Thanks for sharing those strategies of yours, I've tried a few out, and it does actually work well! I am excited for university, and curious as to what it'll be like. I don't have any other questions about this module, as I feel I have learned enough that I have needed to. Do you have any more book recomendations? I am curious as to what else you read. I think the module I would like to try out is the 'Different Way of Knowing Module' Thanks again, Connor. Mentor 2023-06-08, 14:09: Hi Connor, It's great to hear that you could use some of the strategies I recommended! Remember to keep evolving how you study to best suit each subject and your study style. It's also wonderful to hear that you are excited about university! As for book recommendations, I currently do not have much time to read, unfortunately, due to my summer classes. However, recently, I have started rereading one of my favourite series. It's called ""The Mortal Instruments"" with the first book being City of Bones by Cassandra Clare. There are a total of six books in the first series, and I would highly recommend reading them! Since you asked for one of my recommendations, I'll do the same. Let me know if you have any specific books which you would recommend I read over the summer. As for the new module, I have unlocked ""Different Ways of Knowing"" as you requested. Please feel free to get started. Let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues. -Rayyan",,,,,

Excited to see what you think on Monday! That sounds like a very relaxing and wonderful way to spend your break. It definitely doesn't always have to be a ""foot-on-the-pedal"" vacation, quietly spending time with loved ones is very healing and fulfilling. I hope you feel rested after your break! What new music had you been listening to? Nate Mentor 2023-04-13, 13:29: Hi Ella, So great to hear from you again. I'm so sorry to hear that you were sick recently, I hope you've been feeling better! Don't ever worry about getting busy with your schoolwork, hope it's not too overwhelming. Have you listened to the new Lana Del Rey album yet? Personally, I thought it was very interesting and it left a positive impression on me during my first listen. What are your favourite songs from Lana? Excited to hear from you again, Nate Mentor 2023-04-30, 16:09: Hi Ella, It's great to hear back from you! Always feel free to take your time with responding, don't worry if youre unable to. I like Video Games as well from Lana. Don't worry about the ""Job requirements"" tab, just read through ""Education, Training and Skills"" and it should include the job requirements in that page for the job you're looking up. Let me know if you need anything else as we start working through the discussion questions. Cheers, Nate Mentee 2023-05-01, 09:30: Hello Nate, Thank you for the help, I've found what I needed! I've also finished Anchor Text 1 here: The careers I've researched are astronomer and psychologist. The education i would need for both of them is a doctoral degree, but a masters degree is also an option for astronomy. I would benefit from attending post-secondary because it would educate me more on the career path I want to take, it would make it easier for me to get my desired job and it would help me develop more skills and relationships. Some challenges that might occur while I am trying to obtain the education I'd need for both careers are the cost of the university or college, possibly travelling somewhere else for the school I want and me having bad study habits and lack of motivation. I am looking foward to starting the education and experience I need for these careers, because I enjoy learning more about things I'm interested in, and I'm open to trying new things. I think my careers are definetly achievable as long as I focus on getting closer to them, because I'm interested in both of them, so that definetly helps with achieving them. What were some of the challenges that you had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? Thank you! Ella Mentor 2023-05-04, 20:26: Hey Ella, Fantastic to hear that you could find the right information to be able to finish Anchor Text 1! Those are both very exciting careers to consider! What parts of astronomy and/or psychology interests you? A big challenge of starting/finishing an education after highschool is definitely the fiscal costs. It may seem overwhelming starting out to look at all the costs, but there are also a lot of resources that provide you with the ability to lessen that anxiety. As you mentioned, another challenge would be sustaining motivation, especially when it's such a new environment. The challenge may also come from the fact that you would possibly be moving away from your support system, and familiar lifestyle. Nowadays, it's a little easier to keep in touch with your family/friends online but having to set out on your own is always daunting. Yes! Focus is always a good thing to have when you're looking at completing your goals. For me, I had similar issues to the ones you mentioned with starting my post-secondary education. Highschool wasn't the best place to prepare someone for post-secondary education but it's good to see that there are more opportunities for highschool students to explore and learn about their lives after they graduate (things like this program!). Beyond the initial anxiety and excitement of starting something new, life definitely can be stressful and being able to balance your life can have an effect on your mental health. I know that I definitely had issues with keeping a healthy balance in my life during my initial foray into university education. If you have any other questions about my challenges, please feel free to ask! We can start Anchor Text 2 whenever you're ready. We can start looking at what to consider when looking at potential schools. Warmly, Nate Mentee 2023-05-31, 09:30: Hi Nate! Im sorry it's been so long since I've replied, I have had a lot of work since its almost the end of the school year. I will start being more consistent with responding now, because I am more caught up with my schoolwork. The parts of astronomy that interest me are learning more about space. I'm really interested in things about space like what kind of planets and stars there are, and I think space is very pretty. I'm interested in psychology because I enjoy helping people and want to be as helpful and supportive as possible. Thank you for sharing the challenges you had with me, and giving advice for my replies! How did you deal with keeping a healthy balance in your life when you were going into university? I will be starting the second part of the anchor text this week. Thank you, Ella",,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-05, 15:25: Hey Ella! It's great to see that we've been matched up! I'd like to do a little self-introduction for you. Currently I am finishing my bachelors in psychology honours at Douglas College! I am currently in my last semester, finishing up the last few classes I require and my honours thesis (which I'll be defending come May!). I aspire to work in the helping field as a counsellor, primarily with children and family. I am keenly interested in developmental psychology and creating the best environment for future generations to grow and flourish is very important to me, whether that's through education and better resources for parents, or helping through therapy. I see that you have a lot of artistic hobbies! I would love to hear more about that, I’m not very artistic myself so I’ve always been curious about people with passion for things like painting, ceramics and the like. As for your hopes, I am always happy to talk about and explore your career interests! Always feel free to ask me about my experiences through my 20’s, how post-secondary has been, etc. as we work through the modules. Mentee 2023-03-07, 18:03: Hi Nate, my name is Ella and im your mentee! I'm still unsure on what I want to do for my future career, but I've been considering doing psychology like you, for similar reasons. I noticed that you like some of the same music artists as me! Some of my current favorite artists also include Frank Ocean and The Weeknd. I also love movies, and my favorite genre right now is horror. One of my main hobbies right now is playing video games, like yours, because my little brother likes playing with me, and I play minecraft with my friends. The modules that I would like to complete this semester are post-secondary and career planning, getting hired and funding my future. I will be on spring break for the upcoming 2 weeks, so I will not be communicating. I am also unable to attend the video chat tonight, because i have homework i need to finish, so I'm very sorry about that. Thank you! Mentor 2023-03-09, 18:47: Hi Ella, it's so great to hear from you! I appreciate that you took the time to read my profile and that you share some things in common with me. What horror movies have you watched recently? That's amazing to hear that you play with your brother, I think video games is a great way to bond with family! Okay, we can start on any of the ones that you would like to work through once you are back from Spring Break, just let me know which one you are most interested in! I hope you have a great break! See you in two weeks. Nate Mentee 2023-03-28, 17:27: Hi Nate! My break has ended, so I'm now back at school. The horror movies that I've watched recently were The Conjuring movies with my friends, which we thought were all pretty good and scary. The module that I am currently the most interested in is Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning, so I would like to start with that! Thank you! Ella Mentor 2023-03-30, 15:00: Hey again Ella, Hope your break went alright! Anything interesting happen? Oh I've watched the Conjuring movies, they're pretty creepy for sure. Let me open up the module for you and we can start discussing it the next time after you take a look. See you soon, Nate Mentee 2023-04-02, 19:43: Hi Nate, Nothing very interesting happened during my break, I mainly just had friends over, went for walks and played video games with my brother. I spent a lot of it listening to music as well. I'll look at and start doing the module on monday, thank you! Ella Mentee 2023-04-12, 09:57: Hi Nate! I'm sorry I havent responded in a while, I was sick for a bit and I've been busy working on assignments and homework. It's almost the end of our third term, so I have had a lot of assignments I needed to catch up on before the term changes. I'll start working on the module as soon as I get spare time this week! The music I've been listening to the most recently are songs from artists like Lana Del Rey, Deftones, Radiohead, and TV Girl. My current favorite right now is probably Lana Del Rey, because her songs are some of my favorites. Have you been listening to anything new? Thank you! Ella Mentee 2023-04-25, 15:59: Hi Nate! I'm sorry that it's been a while since I've replied. I have been listening to the new Lana Dey Rey album and I really like many of the songs on it! My current favorite songs from Lana are Arcadia, Video Games, Let The Light In, and Happiness is a butterfly. I was going through the second part of anchor text 1 and I've been having trouble trying to find the table of contents box and the job requirements for the career I've looked up on WorkBC, so I was wondering if you knew where I could find it. Thanks! Ella Mentor 2023-06-07, 14:45: Hi Ella! It's so good to hear from you again, don't be worried about replying late. How is the end of your school year going? Yeah, space is so mystifying and limitless, it makes you want to learn to understand it. Similarly, with psychology and people, there are a limitless amount of types of people out there (cultures, personalities, circumstances) that one can learn from and understand, and then come to help and support! I think a big thing for me when considering school/life balance is having time for yourself to decompress, and to be mindful of your state of being. I try to find time to self reflect, ask myself if I'm tired, if I'm being kind enough to myself, if I need time to rebalance everything in my life. Sounds good! I'm excited to read what you have in mind. Warm regards, Nate",,,,,

For my desired jobs, I have chosen to either be a physician or a psychologist. In order to be a physician, I need at least a doctor of medicine degree and 4 years of grad school, and to be a psychologist it says I need a doctoral degree, supervised experience, and I need to complete a 12 month internship. I would benifit from post secondary because I would have a better education, and more career options for me. I think the most challenging aspect of post secondary would be the time it takes and the cost of all the things I would need. I'm kind of excited to go to university, but overall I think I would be happier ofter It's over, as I will be able to have a more stable career. I think these career goal are possible for me because I feel as though I will be able to handle most of the workload. For a question, what were some of the challenges that you had to overcome in order to pursue a post secondary education? Mentee 2023-03-30, 09:58: hey Jham, thanks for the advice! I heard university was bad for due dates. When I was in Toronto I went to see a couple Raptor games, whinch was really fun. A few factors of univerity I would be worried about would be the location, and areas on campus to study. After researching different schools, I decided that the medical degree in UBC would be the best fit for me looking at the factors I chose. Are you familiar with UBC? And if you are, would you reccomend it? To get into UBC for this, degree you need at least an 85% average in high school and 90 credits. English is required. Biology, chemistry and biochem are reccomended. I think I'd have a decent chance of getting into UBC considering I have a 4.0 GPA and am planning to take those prerequisites. Lastly, do you have any advice for being admitted to a university? Thanks.",,"Mentor 2023-04-28, 13:21: Hey Graydon! Thanks for being patient with me. I finally finished all my final exams. I am freeeee and I can enjoy my summer now. I have opened up career exploration so feel free to ask away. Mentee 2023-05-03, 09:15: Hey Jham, I wish we could have an early summer, it's been so nice out this past week. How did exams go? In life, I value family and friends. I contribute to my community by doing yardwork for my neighbors. The career that corelates with that is landscaping, but I dont really want to do that for a career. What do you value in life? Mentor 2023-05-03, 12:59: Hey graydon! my exams went well :) I don't really get summer break because I start my last semester of my undergraduate degree. There are trade jobs out there that you can possibly look into. Some of them pay well if you get your red seal and become certified. The things I value in life are also my family and friends. I try to see them once in a while because of our schedules and life never matching up. But we still try to make time for each other.",,,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 13:20: Hey Graydon! How's it going? How's school so far? I saw that you're interested in psychology. I'm finishing up my bachelor's in psychology right now. So if you would like I can share some stuff about it and my thoughts on it. What do you want to talk about in regard to post-secondary? Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:38: Nice to meet you Jham, I'm doing great and schools ok so far. How are you? I just had a few questions about psychology that I'd like to start with. First off, are there any other prerequisites other than psychology that you have to take in order to get a psychology degree? and second, how hard is getting a psychology degree from 1-10? For the modules, I would like to start with Post secondary and career planning, as im not really sure what I want to do after school, and I'd like to do from rural to urban and getting hired at some point as well. Great talking to you Jham! Mentor 2023-03-07, 13:44: Nice to meet you, I am excited to answer your questions to help you find what you want to do after high school. I have opened up post-secondary and career planning. There is some stuff there for you to look at to help you generate questions. There are no prerequisites for psychology as it will be your main undergrad degree. However, there are two different types of bachelor's (if you are planning to get one), science or arts. Currently, I am finishing my bachelor's in arts with a focus on psychology. Usually, it's your third year that you will declare your major. So during your first and second year, you are taking first-year courses (intro to psyc or intro to sociology) as you need those classes to take 300-level classes. Psychology itself isn't hard... but there are classes that you need to take that aren't psychology which can be difficult. Some classes I found difficult are the 300-level classes outside of psychology, like English (post-war English or stylistics). But there are many classes to choose from to fulfill those credits. I recommend using Reddit to find other people's threads within those classes or ratemyprof is usually helpful in terms of the professor that is teaching that class. Mentor 2023-03-23, 20:22: Hi, How was your spring break? I wish I could have a longer break, but the semester is almost over. What did you get up to during your break? I took my cousins to an escape room and mini golf during their spring break which was nice for them and for me as well. Got a break from schoolwork. :) let me know what you what to talk about when you're free or back from school Mentor 2023-03-29, 21:40: Hey Graydon, All good, I'm glad you had fun in Toronto. What did you get up to in Toronto? The last time I visited Niagra Falls, I took crazy jump shots in front of the CN tower. Anyways... Med school is long because you need an undergraduate degree, complete medical school, and residency. It is somewhat similar to becoming a psychologist because you need an undergraduate degree in psychology, and apply to get your master's degree (2 years) in a specific topic of psychology (child psychology, cognitive, behavioural, forensic, etc), then get your Ph.D. (4 years+ thesis defence). It really depends on what your interests are. If you like the science approach to things then med school should be something you should consider, but if you want the understanding part behind people's behaviour then psychology is better. The hardest part to overcome is the procrastination to get things done and the motivation to continue 4 years of my undergrad followed by a couple more years. I definitely had my moments of ""what am I going to do with my life,"" ""or is this really something I want to do for the rest of my life."" Yet I pushed through and graduation is around the corner. I think finding the balance between self-care, school work, friends, and a part-time job is crucial in finishing your degree. I definitely learned that a strong social support group will help you through the toughest time in the semester (usually during finals week and the month before the term ends) because due dates will get ya. One piece of advice is to ensure you are on top of due dates because it arrives much faster than you think it does and don't wait such last minute to get your assignments done. Mentor 2023-03-31, 11:57: Hey Graydon, Yes there are a lot of university students including me that waited a bit too long to do assignments which leads to a very stressful time. It seems that whenever you wait last minute there will be so many things due that day. As for areas to study in, most if not all spaces are for you to use. You can enter any building and find a seat and just sit there all day if you would like. There are specific areas, such as a silent study where you cannot talk at all because people use that to study for exams and such. There are also public areas to do anything; eat, study and mingle. So it will be loud. I am familiar with UBC because I am currently finishing my degree there. However, I don't live on campus but I can still try and answer your questions regarding it because I have friends who live there and I have some knowledge of the different types. I think if you want to go into medical school, UBC might be your best bet if you want to go to school in BC because they have a hospital where students will likely do their practicum in. So it is an easier transition to working instead of looking for openings. You don't necessarily jump into medical school right away, you would need to have an undergraduate prior to applying to medical school. The steps are undergraduate degree (4 years), MCAT exam (entrance exam) + interviews, medical school (4 years), residency (depending on the specialty you want to do), and final exam to prove your knowledge. With a GPA like that you can easily get in and if you take bio, and physics, chem it will be easier to take classes because you already have the prerequisites. I think doing a lot of volunteer work can make you stand out, although your grades make you stand out already, doing more volunteer work shows that you are an all-around student. Just ensure that you continue to work hard in university because if your undergraduate GPA is low it will make it harder to get into medical school, but if you have the volunteer work it will help you get an advantage. In high school, I volunteered at a nursing home and continued to do so during university as well as working at my part-time job. Thus it made it easier for me to talk about things because I could speak from experience. hope that helps! let me know if you have more or if you would like to move on to a different topic Mentee 2023-04-06, 09:34: Hey Jham, thanks so much for all that, it really helps. Right now I live in a pretty small town, but when I eventually go into university, I was hoping to get into a bigger city, so I was hoping for the next module, we could do rural to urban. Thanks. Mentee 2023-04-24, 09:23: Hey Jham, hope you have fun in Tofino, its a really cool place especially in the summer. I'm not fully sure if I'm supposed to do another module but if we are can you open up career exploration? Thanks, and good luck with exams Mentor 2023-06-04, 22:37: Hey Graydon! It was so nice to get to you know and to share my experiences with you. I wish you the best with your future endeavours and I hope that the things I shared were helpful for you. Have a good summer and good luck with everything. Just remember that college/university is meant for you to explore and to find what you like and dislike so don't be discouraged when you feel that everything is failing in your life. Keep on top of your deadlines because those come quicker than what you expect.","Mentor 2023-04-06, 20:09: Heya! I opened up the thing for you! Let me know what kind of questions you have. I grew up mostly in an urban city but I was born in a small town. I'll try my best to answer your question. Mentee 2023-04-12, 09:56: Hey Jham, thanks for opening up the module, I live in a pretty small town so I feel like this would help. three things I loike about my town is the traffic, as i just started driving and the empty roads make it easier, I like that everyone knows eachother, and I like how quiet it is. I dont like limited oppurtunities for things like sports and education, and I dont like having to travel to go to places like costco or a mall. A few questions i have are, how hard is it to find living space in a big city, how would you say your experiences in a big city have been so far, and finally, what don't you like about living in a big city? Mentor 2023-04-13, 06:18: Hey! I find that it is a lot calmer and more peaceful living in a smaller town but the big city holds so much more opportunities for me. Living in the big city is expensive. If you want to live alone that might not be ideal as rent in Vancouver can go up to 3K a month depending on where it is. If you live in the heart of downtown it is roughly around that but if you live outside of Vancouver (neighbouring cities) it will be cheaper. It is also cheaper with a roommate, but overall it is not hard to look for a place because a lot of people are renting their own spaces. However, if you want to live on campus it is about 5-15K a semester and that includes food. I have always liked the city because of the many things I can do. I live near a mall so that gives me something to do if I am really bored but lately I haven't been there since I basically worked there all of high school so it's gotten boring. Driving is also fun once in a while if everyone on the road knows how to drive... if not well then it's bad. One thing I don't like is the different people you have to deal with and encounter on a daily basis and that it is always loud. I work downtown so that alone can be frustrating because people sure are a lot of work. Mentee 2023-04-17, 09:09: Hey Jham, glad to hear driving in the city isn't always as bad as it looks! Traditions haven't always been super important to me or my family, but we always make sure we go to tofino once a year in the summer together, and when I move away, it's gonna be hard to stay with them because I might be far or because of work, but I'm gonna try to find time to make it there every year. How do you keep up with traditions when you're far away from home? Thanks. Mentor 2023-04-19, 20:32: Hey Graydon! How are you? Ooo I've always wanted to go to Tofino, but the closest I have been is Victoria, but I plan to go this summer with my friends. I don't live too far away from my parents so I see them regularly, but I do live far away from my extended family and I have not seen them in a while. But I am planning to go back home soon, after my finals I am heading there, so I am looking forward to that. In terms of traditions, I don't really have a lot of those with my parents. I guess it is just taking the time when you do go home during your breaks. I know some friends on the UBC Okanagan campus and they regularly drive back to Vancouver where they live to visit their family and friends. My friends from across the country usually stay with their family during the summer or breaks so they're never really far. Just really depends what you want to do during your break or long-extended vacation. I might not be able to respond as fast as I usually do because I have 3 finals in the coming week, but I will try my best. Best of luck with school :)",,,,

I don't have a lot of experience in building a professional gaming career, but I'll support you the best I can regardless. I'll do my best to help out as we work through the modules, and maybe help you get connected with others that can answer more specific questions. It looks like your teacher is requiring you to complete four conversations of your choice before July 17th. Some of the modules will have mandatory tasks, but otherwise I'm happy to focus on the parts that you want to. Please take your time and enjoy your break. Whenever you're ready to get started, let me know what module you want to start first, and I'll open it up.

Hope you had a good break :) The great thing about things like gaming is that it's also such a big field. If you're interested in it, there are a lot of different ways that you could make it your career. I'm not that great myself, but out of curiosity, what kind of stuff have you been playing recently? To get started with the mentoring stuff, just let me know which section you would like to start with? Since the names might not be that descriptive, I've copied the summary of each one here: Different Ways of Knowing: This conversation explores the importance of respecting different ways of knowing and the risk of getting stuck in only one way of understanding the world we live in. Anchor texts describe the ways in which a current B.C. research project is guided by connections between Indigenous traditional knowledge and settler scientific knowledge, and explore Indigenous innovations in technological advances and Indigenous values in business practices. Strategic Studying: This conversation explores some of the most recent scientific recommendations for effective study habits. It offers the mentee an opportunity to compare their current study strategies with their mentor’s and challenges them to try some new techniques. Well-Being and Self-Care: This conversation presents an important opportunity to talk about the responsibility we each have to take care of ourselves – physically, mentally, and emotionally. With the support of their mentor, mentees will learn some strategies for self-care and create their own self-care action plan. Post-secondary and Career Planning: Conversation asks mentees to view relevant Career Profiles on Work BC’s website to help them discover the level of education they would need in order to pursue a given career. Then, in the second Anchor Text, they will research schools that offer the programs they need. If your mentee needs help finding ideas for possible careers, suggest doing the ""Career Exploration"" Conversation before jumping into this one. Extension Activity – Adulting 101 (part of the "" Well-being and self-care"" module): Students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap (part of the "" Finding Inspiration"" module): Students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them.

Although I haven't played the other ones in a bit. For your class, you need to complete 4 of the ""conversations"", but it's up to you which ones. I'm thinking, for you, some interesting ones might be ""Finding Inspiration"", ""Well-being and Self Care"", ""Identifying and Challenging Disinformation &amp; Misinformation"", ""Agency in the World"", ""Career Exploration"", ""Post-secondary and Career Planning"", and/or ""Funding Your Future"". I'm thinking of opening up ""Career Exploration"" first because it seems relevant to what we've talked about so far. It covers dream careers, and can help you find what aspect of gaming careers you might want to go for. Afterwards, the ""Post-secondary and Career Planning"" activities can help you figure out how to get there. How does that sound?

1047586133,10/27/2022 16:10,1047593960,59534,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-21, 23:57: Introduction There are a wide range of effective studying strategies, all of which assist in maximizing learning outcomes when used in the appropriate context. Throughout my own academic journey, the first year and a half of my post-secondary experience was dedicated to a lot of “relearning how to learn.” I quickly realized that in both elementary school and high school, I has been presented with an increasingly vigorous academic calendar that required me to learn a greater and greater amount each year. However, I had never actually been taught how to retain this information effectively and efficiently. Throughout high school, my study regiment consisted of taking notes during lectures, reading the assigned textbooks, and then quitting myself a few days prior to exams by having a friend ask my questions throughout the textbook and responding in as much detail as I could. While these strategies were adequate for my high school curriculum, about midway through my first semester of college, I realized that I would need to make some serious changes. This past semester in uni have been my most successful by far. I do not yet have access to my grades, but during this semester I feel that I’ve been able to maintain my GPA while also cutting back on the time that I put into studying. I do this by actively engaging in my course material: • 1) I do my assigned textbook readings, but I no longer make notes as I read (with the exception of noting the definitions of key terms). Rather, I read a section within each a chapter entirely, and then will write my notes based off of my memory. I make a point of reading the text as fast as I can to avoid “dwelling” by slowly trying to “take in” the information. In this way, I force myself to take in as much information as possible as fast as possible. After I have my “blurb” of notes, I will then backtrack through the section and elaborate on my notes and/ or correct any mistakes that I’ve made. • 2) One of the best methods that I’ve tried so far for test preparation is utilizing digital flashcard platforms like Anki and Quizlet. Many academically excelling students that I’ve spoken with utilize these platforms by using flashcards as a substitute for note taking. That is, rather than taking notes from the textbook to study, they’ll make questions up from the textbook material as they read. In this way, they can test themselves as frequently as they want. Personally, I’ve still been making notes, because I feel that forcing myself to remember things and paraphrase it helps me conceptualize the material rather than just memorizing it. However, when I do use flashcards, I am able to recall key terms and basic questions much more easily. Discussion Questions 1) Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. When attempting to master a subject, I definitely believe that Interweaving is a tool that can either make or break your success. One proven concept in the science of learning (both in neurology and psychology) is that “learning” is a process of “forming associations.” For example; a dog may naturally respond to the smell of a sizzling steak by drooling. Over time, you decide to signal to the dog that steak is cooking by ringing a bell as you cook the steak. After repetitively pairing the ringing of the bell with the smell of the steak, the dog begins to drool in response to the sound of the bell. Simply put, the dog has learned that the ringing of the bell is associated with the smell of the steak. The case of the dog, the steak, and the bell may seem a bit irrelevant in relation to studying, but I hope that it can briefly highlight the importance of association in learning. As a study method, Interweaving helps students to connect topics that can seem completely unrelated to each other— or rather, it helps you to form associations between different topics within a subject. 2) Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? I’ve recently been trying to use dual coding more frequently— especially in subjects like neurology where relating theory to images can help me gain a better understanding of how things work. As someone who isn’t artistically gifted at all, I sometimes find it stressful to incorporate visuals into my notes. However, I’ve overcome this problem by typically just screen-shotting helpful images from my textbook and inserting them into my notes when necessary. Your Turn! Please see the attached file in this discussion labelled “Discussion Questions.” Scroll to the second page of the file and ask me any questions that you find interesting. I am also interested in what methods you’re currently using to study, which methods you’ve used in the past, and how you feel different methods have worked for you. Really taking the time to analyze these questions is a great way to build a foundation for efficient study habits, so feel free to ask me anything! Mentee 2023-05-01, 09:42: I just finsihed strategic studying and it helped me a bit to help improve my way of studying, i'll be trying out the different methods to see which one helps me best. The spaced practiced studying seems the best for me beacuse i'm the biggest fan on sitting down and studing cause my attention spa can't last that long so this one will for sure be strategy i'll be trying out. I think interleaving might be most challanging for me cause i find it better to stick to one topic at a time rather than switching. There isn't any studying strategies that i can really think of to add to the list. I think i might try some, i think what will get in the way of trying these it my movtivation, my attention span and remebering to try them. (i'm running out of time so i'll finish the quetsions tomorrow) Mentor 2023-05-04, 15:21: Hi Juliana! It's great to hear that you've been experimenting with the different studying methods. Just focus on finding maybe 3 that work for you and help you function optimally-- every brain is different. I also don't find interleaving to be the easiest method: from what I've studied at school, this method can be really beneficial for individuals with ADHD, because unless they're in a hyper focused state their minds' tend to ""wunder."" I'm looking forward to reading your responses. If you have any questions please reach out. Mentee 2023-05-08, 08:50: Hi Jasmine, i have one question for you when it comes to studying, what strategies do you use when studying exams? Where do you study? like for example do you prefer to study at a libary or at home, and do you study with music? i tend to studying with music that can help me focus. I'm wondering if i'm finsihed this unit because i'm ready to move onto something new. Mentor 2023-05-09, 18:15: Hey, hope you're doing well. I usually use an active-recall and summarizing system to study for exams. So as I read a chapter that is necessary content for an exam, I'll jot down key words and main concepts to elaborate on later. Then, I'll break each chapter up into sections-- after I read a section, I'll summarize it in my own words, then then write the key terms and definition of the key words. Finally, for each chapter I'll make flash cards (I usually do them online with Quizlette), and I'll just focus on using the flash cards for a few hours every day for a week before my exam. I'll also refer back to my notes. Typically, I'll have a friend ask me questions from the notes which I can orally answer. Hope that helps1",,"Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:48: Hello Jasmine, i'm Juliana and i'm your menteI'm very interested in psychology and i hope to become a counselor or threapist. I really enjoy history like the reign of monarchs like for example Queen Elizabeth I and Henry the VII as well as French Monarchs like King Louis the XIV and King Louis the XVI. I love playing video games, my favourite ones are Stardew Valley and Sims 4 as well as horror games like Five Nights At Freddys and Little NIghtmares. I also really enjoy music! i'll listen to any genre of music. I sadly can't remember what you said in your message nor can i find it so i'm really sorry about that but i'm sure we have some shared interests, again i'm really sorry. The mondules that i want to work on are studying strategic, Getting hired, funding my future, post secondary and career planning, and well being and self care (also i need help finding movtivation which i'm pretty sure i've mentioned). I'm not quite sure if i'll need any help during spring break, i'm going to say i don't though. Also just to let you know i won't be able to do the voice chat because i am really busy with tutoring between the hours we would be having the call or chat? i don't know but just know i won't be available. Anyways i'm excited to have you as my mentor, you seem really nice so i can't wait to start talking with and working with you. Mentor 2023-03-21, 11:44: Hello Juliana, it’s great to meet you! Before I get started I want to apologize for my late response to you, and being late starting our modules. I have not had a computer for the past week, and for some reason was unable to see any of your messages on my iPhone. I promise to stay up-to-date with you from now on, and help you tackle these modules. From what you’ve told me about yourself and what’s written in your bio, you seem to have some super interesting hobbies! I’ve personally never gotten into gaming because I had pretty strict parents growing up who didn’t let me be online too much, but as I’ve recently began dabbling in coding I’ve become increasingly interested in picking up that hobby. Do you have any recommendations for where to start? I found your interests in history and psychology to be quite interesting. Although you may consider history and psychology two different fields, they actually interact a lot when you begin to focus on different theoretical approaches (e.g., different methods of counselling, different philosophies within psychology). In analyzing first hand historic sources, you can also gain some pretty good insight into what kind of people these figures of the past were; what social and/ or familial factors may have shaped them into the person they were; and even make speculations about possible ways that mental illnesses were treated throughout history. For example; the first mental asylum to exist was during the dark ages in modern day Iraq, and from the methods employed at this institution, the foundation to empathetic approaches to psychology were first observed. I saw that you’re interested in covering the strategic studying, getting hired, funding my future, post secondary and career planning modules, and well being and self care. I think that these all all great choices that interact together well, and will help you settle into after-high school life smoothly. If you agree, I’d like to cover the “getting started” and “strategic studying” first, followed by “strategic studying” and “post secondary and career planning.” It isn’t really necessary to go in this order, but i think that the first three modules I listed will lay a solid foundation for anything else that we discuss. I’m going to upload the getting started module tonight, and we can move on when you feel comfortable. If you need any help, please reach out. Mentee 2023-03-28, 09:09: Hello Jasmine, i want to start off by saying how are you and that i'm excited to start these moldules with you. No need to worry about the late response I just assumed you were busy so it's all good. I'm not really a coding person so i'm not enirely sure on where you could start but i'm sure if you look something up like learning coding for beginners you would probably be able to find something.I find it interesting that history and psychology go hand in hand in way, i had feeling that they did if you consider the psychological impact like WW1 and WW2 had on soldiers and people. For soldiers a lot of them suffered from things like PTSD and Shellshock and some even suffered from something called Thousand Yard Stare which typically happened to soldiers when witnessing a traumatic event like someone getting shot in battle. When it comes to what you would like to cover i am perfectly fine with what you want to do, If you think getting started with ""stragic studying"" is something we need to start with then lets do it. -Juliana Mentor 2023-03-29, 19:21: Hello again! Thank you for being understanding about my late response, I've been doing a lot better since I kinda sorted out my computer issues and have been able to access my school work properly. I did end up finding some introductory coding courses. If you're ever interested, LinkedIn has a free day-course for introductory coding, and you also get a certificate for your resume once your done! For the modules that we're going to cover, I've opened the ""strategic studying"" conversation and written my first prompt for you. I'm quite interested in what current study methods you use and how they've been working out for you. Personally, I'm going through the process of changing the way I study to be more efficint: I want to study intensity for short periods of time, rather than dwell of material absent-mindedly. I think we can both discover what works best for us in this module. Feel free to respond to the prompts whenever you have time and share your thoughts. Looking forward to hearing more! Mentor 2023-04-13, 16:08: Hi Juliana! I hope you had an exciting spring break and are feeling rested and rejuvenated for the remainder of the school year! I just wanted to reach out so see if you need any help completing the tasks in the ""strategic studying"" conversation that I opened up for you about 2 weeks ago. Remember, these activities are meant to be ""conversations,"" so you don't have to feel pressured to answer all of the questions in an essay-format before getting back to me. If you want to take each section slowly, you can always send me a question here and there so we can work through the tasks together. Please let me know if you need any help, and have an awesome week! Mentee 2023-04-14, 08:45: Hello Jasmine, i'm good with the modules i haven't started them yet cause i have some assignments i need to do, but i'll try and start them when i can. i do have a question though, what are some of your favourite music artists? Mentor 2023-04-14, 09:23: Okay thanks for getting back to me! I don't wanna pressure you to start if you're too busy, but I do encourage you to keep a general estimate in mind of how long they might take you just so you don't have to rush last minute. Some of my top musicians at the moment are Manu Chao and La Femme-- I recently started learning other languages so I'm getting obsessed. Classic obsessions gotta be the basics like Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, and the Wailers. What about yours? Mentee 2023-04-17, 08:45: hello Jasmine, i'll try and get to the moldules as soon i can. Pink Floyd and Led Zeplin are amazing musicians, my favourite music artists at the moment are Melanie Martinez and Lana Del Rey. Mentor 2023-05-13, 15:00: Hey Julianna, I hope you're weekend is going well and that you're enjoying the heat wave! I wanted to check in and see if you're comfortable moving on to some of the other modules now, since you've pretty much finished the requirements for the ""strategic studying"" conversation. Since you were interested in the ""getting hired"" and ""funding my future"" sections, I'm thinking it would be best to start with ""getting hired"" and then proceed to ""funding my future."" Let me know what works for you and then I'll go ahead and open up the next conversation. Mentee 2023-05-17, 09:35: hi Jasmine, Sorry for not respoding, for some reason i was logged out of my account and i didn't realize it until today. i would love to start another moldule. Mentee 2023-05-31, 10:57: Hi Juliana, This is Parvaneh from eMentoring team. We noticed that your mentor, Jasmine, has been unresponsive to your messages. We understand that this can be frustrating, and we apologize for any inconvenience. We are trying to get in touch with her to ensure she can be in touch with you soon. In the meantime, you can start working on the ""Getting Hired"" activity. We encourage you to complete the activity and reach out to us in case of any questions by posting your messages here. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Parvaneh Mentee 2023-06-01, 09:14: Hello Jasmine, i read over the message you snet and i already have a resume made because my class had an assignment so i was wondering if i could just send that to you? (without the personal infoformation of course). I already found a job in my area as well that i'll be hopefully applying to soon. I have some work experience working at Cafe too. Mentor 2023-06-01, 10:17: Sure, I'd love to take a look at your resume and then we can continue from there! Mentee 2023-06-05, 09:00: Hello Jasmine, i'm just wondering on how i'll be able to send you my resume? Mentor 2023-06-05, 09:08: Hi Juliana, So, to send your resume I recommend you put it into a google doc and send me the link through the text box. If you look on top of the text box at the last symbol on the far right there's a chain link symbol. U can use that to send the link, or just copy and paste it into the text box. Mentor 2023-06-08, 19:25: Hi Juliana! I got a message from your teacher saying that your class is actually finishing this program early, so June 16th will be our last day. I was wondering if you had any final questions? If you're interested, I can send you some resources to go over on your free time regarding getting hired, post secondary preparation, career planning, etc. this wouldn't be a part of the program, but you could keep it for future reference. let me know if that works for you! P.S. I'd still love to take a look at your resume if you have the time. Mentee 2023-06-09, 08:35: Hello Jasmine, i'm not really interested in that but thank you for telling me about, also thank your for being my mentor Mentor 2023-06-11, 11:28: It was so fun having you as a mentee and getting to know you! I wish you all the best in your future.",,,"Mentor 2023-05-31, 12:10: Hi Juliana! I hope you’re doing well and aren’t too overwhelmed as the school year comes to an end. This section of the program focuses a lot on how you can tailor your unique experiences in high school, with volunteering programs, or any extracurriculars you’re involved with into a resume. An effective resume should showcase your best skills and list any relevant experience to a job that you’re applying for. I remember when I was in high school, myself and many of my friends were quite intimidated about applying to our first jobs. We had no prior work experience, and as a result, we thought that our résumé’s would just be empty. However, if you understand what types of skills employers are looking for, you’ll start to find patterns of transferability, meaning that a lot of the skills you gain in school or during your hobbies can actually make you a competitive job applicant. Some important examples of skill transferability: • Have you ever created a google slide, Canva, or power point presentation, and delivered this presentation orally in front of your class? Well, you have computer skills, digital communication skills, written communication skills, and oral communication skills. • Have you ever taken a position of leadership on a school assignment, on a sports team, or in a club? Then you probably have team-work skills and leadership skills. • Have you ever taken a class in computer skills or office software? Then you probably have entry-level office skills. In the first activity of this conversation, I’d like you to brainstorm what types of experience you have, and what types of transferable skills you’ve gained from these experiences. Have you ever tutored a peer? Volunteered in your local community? Been a team leader? Ask yourself, “what did I need to do when I worked in these positions, and what skills did I gain?” Once you’ve identified a few skills that you think are transferable, head over to a job search in your area using a search engine like Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or even a google search for entry level jobs near you. Find something interesting to you, and read through the job description. Usually, employers will include sections in the job description like “what we look for in an ideal candidate,” “preferred skills,” or “what you’ll do on the job.” Think about how the skills you’ve gained throughout high school could match the wants and needs of the employer. Using the article listed in this conversation in Anchor Text 1, use the resume template to create your first resume. You can send it over to me for advise, but please make sure to remove all personal information (e.g., please don’t include your email, phone number, or full name when you send me a copy, as this is against the eMentoring program rules). If you’d like some ideas for how to make your resume aesthetically pleasing, I can also send you a copy of mine. When you’re finished your resume, you can choose to use it to apply to jobs of interest. For entry-level jobs, I think that barista and retail positions are fun as well as educational— and you also have the opportunity to make tips in a lot of businesses! I look forward to seeing your skills and resume. If you have any questions please reach out.",,

I'm assuming that, theoretically speaking, doing the things I enjoy will help me out of a mental health ""slump"". If you are comfortable, I would love to hear what you enjoy doing to avoid hitting a mental health ""falloff"", or even what warning signs you notice before a slump. I was hoping you knew of any ways to avoid said slump, how to maintain overall good mental health, and/or if you had any tips that would help! Warning signs: - lower mood than usual - lack of motivation for activities I usually enjoy - feeling a desire to isolate myself from others - lack of focus/lack of tolerance for homework Things I enjoy: - sleeping to “recharge” - walking in nature - watching a favourite movie - playing with my dog - throwing a softball around with a friend and conversating Mentor 2023-04-05, 18:17: Hello! I hope that you enjoyed your spring break. Thank you for your effort in responding to these materials. One of the most important things that I find to maintaining my mental health is to continue engaging in basic self-care and my responsibilities, not being too harsh on myself. It's also important to notice if you're starting to get fatigued more often or your sleep schedule is becoming abnormal. Something that has helped me is writing in a journal, so I'm to express my feelings and thoughts in some manner. I also tend to lose interest in activities that I typically enjoy when my mental health is dipping, but the activities you listed are good. For example, playing with your dog or going on a walk in nature are things you do even if you're not necessarily feeling up for them, and by the end, it's possible that they may help your mood.

Mentee 2023-04-17, 09:40: Anchor text 2: self-care action plan I think that I meet my basic needs for sustaining my mental wellbeing at a certain point for long-ish periods of time. What I mean by this (or an example of this) is that if I don’t have any extra-curricular activities after school, I take a set amount of time (usually 30 minutes) to myself to unwind and unpack from the day. This allows me to let my brain relax for a bit while I listen to music, play the piano, write, draw, or tidy my room (which, oddly enough, I can enjoy sometimes). Of course, I take that time to relax before doing homework, and sometimes I get behind in class, which in turn takes a toll on my mental health. If I were to review notes or homework from the day for a bit during that relaxing period, I could make mental maps of what homework I should prioritize, and make sure I understand any notes. Theoretically speaking, this should make completing homework in the evenings a bit easier, as I could refer to the mental maps I made earlier. This could prevent me from falling behind on assignments while keeping time to myself to ""de-stress"". (I really hope this makes sense) I struggle with remembering to eat meals sometimes, even though I think a lot! I want to get my eating schedule on track to stay physically and mentally healthy. I believe eating properly is considered self-care because, if I recall correctly, it does affect energy levels and the way a person feels. Plus, it would make me happy. Maybe I could talk to one of my parents and have them remind me to pack a lunch in the evenings for the next day, or make a daily ""to do list"" that includes eating a meal, or put a tag on my backpack that says, ""There is a lunch in your bag!"". For me, socializing can be hard. I am definitely introverted and can find even the simplest conversations challenging sometimes. Not conversing can make me feel isolated or socially cut off, and not talking to people on a daily basis is pretty negative for my brain. I consider the definition of self-care to be something along the lines of: something that affects a person in ways that assists their well-being. Using this definition, I think that socializing more would be self-care, as it would make me feel so much better. Plus, communicating with others is said to keep the mind agile and, in simpler terms, make the brain happy and healthy. I rarely step out of my comfort zone, but I think it’s time to change that. When I walk down the hallways at school, I’ll almost always come across at least one person I know. I would like to make it my goal to say “hello” to at least one person in the halls every 1-2 days. This would make me feel much more confident about my social skills, and it might even positively impact who I am saying hi to! I know bad habits are insanely hard to break, but once they’re broken, it feels like a serious weight has been lifted off your back. I was wondering if you had any tips that you would like to share on breaking bad habits? Or maybe even some feedback if you can think of any :) (And thank you for all the help you’ve been!) Mentor 2023-04-19, 14:50: Thank you for your detailed response. I think that planning things out, or at least getting a little bit of work completed is helpful, but also make sure to not stress if you're unable to get that done - it's okay to have days were you only rest as well. I think that your ideas for reminders to eat work well. If you typically write out schedules or to-do lists, adding things likes meals can be helpful for remembering. I also think that your plans for socialising more are a good start - saying hi to people in the hall doesn't necessarily lead to committment to having a longer conversation or doing something with them, but shows them acknowledgement. I can only give the most typical advice for breaking bad habits, which is to make an effort to abstain from them continuously. If this is difficult, come up with an alternative to whatever the bad habit is to do when you feel compelled to engage in the bad habit. For example, even with procrastination, instead of scrolling social media like one might typically do, they could exercise, and THEN do homework. Of course, this works differently depending on which habit you're focused on. I'm glad that I've been a little bit helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions, as well as which module you'd like to move onto next so I can unlock it. Best wishes :) Mentor 2023-05-02, 18:05: Hi ! It's been a little while, and I hope you're doing okay. Please let me know which module you'd like to open next for your class!",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-05-10, 12:14: Don't worry, I just want to make sure that you're able to complete what is needed for your class and that you're doing okay. Hopefully you've been able to deal well with whatever's been going on lately. I've opened the module for you to complete when you have time. Best wishes. Mentee 2023-05-24, 13:02: Hello again! It’s been a while since I have responded... I hope you are doing well. I’ve watched the Strategic Studying video and have moved on to the discussion questions. “Which strategy seems the most useful to you?” I believe that the “spaced practice” method could be very useful. By distributing your practice over certain amounts of time, it allows more knowledge to be stored in your mind more efficiently and effectively. If you were to cram information into your brain with one study session, it is less likely to be recalled come test day, as all the information would be “messy”. When I say “messy”, I mean bunched up, unseparated, and unorganized, information piled on top of each other and crammed into a small space. By spreading the topics/knowledge out over the span of a week, it allows this information to be stored in your long-term memory. It’s far easier to retain knowledge on one topic that had dedicated study sessions over the span of a week than retaining that same knowledge when it’s been studied alongside many other topics over the span of a day. I also have some questions about the differences between high school classes and post-secondary classes. How do they differ regarding notes and tests/exams? And a bonus question if you feel up to it: what are some study habits you find helpful in your post-secondary life? I would also like to thank you for your patience and help :) Mentor 2023-05-26, 10:18: I hope you're doing well too :) Thank you for your thoughtful responses to the question prompts. Regarding notes and exams in high school classes versus university classes, I'll note that typical university classes are largely lecture-based (especially in your first year), therefore, for most of your time in class you will be taking notes on what the professor is saying. Sometimes they will upload a powerpoint that they used in class online for you to review. In my opinion, it's best to try to get the notes down in whatever manner you can, and then if you can, reorganise them when you have time to study later. There may also be ""tutorial"" sessions later on, which are smaller group sessions in which there is more discussion, and here, you likely wouldn't have to write notes, depending on how it is run (sometimes there will be a focus on discussion, and sometimes there might be a focus on explaining concepts people struggled with). For exams, I've noticed specifically in English classes, the exams might be exclusively composed of essay questions. This also depends on your professor and topic. In my experience, most English classes focus on students submitting essays throughout the semester, and the only tests/exams would be the midterm and final exam. I have also had a couple professors who have quizzes on the content of literary works we've read. For study habits, I would also reccommend regular review of your notes. It's also easy to get behind with readings in university, so I also think you should attempt to keep on track with them. While you're doing readings, it can also be helpful to write notes regarding your opinions or questions on the material, in addition to the content (though you don't necessarily need to do notes on the content if your reading is a fictional novel or something similar). It's no problem, I'm thankful that you engage thoroughly with the questions :) Let me know if there's anything else you want to do in this module or if you have any more questions, and if you don't we can move onto a different module of your choosing.

I'm Genevieve (or Gen) and I'll be your mentor for this program. Nice to meet you :) I'm a 4th year History and English student at SFU and I'm planning to become a high school teacher (hopefully for either Social Studies or English). I'm glad to hear that you also have a similar goal! What type of genres do you like writing? I also like drawing but I'm not very skilled at it. Let me know if you have any questions, and also let me know if you have any of the conversation modules that you're wanting to start with ! Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:33: Hi there, Genevieve! I’m Kate, and I happen to be your mentee. It’s very nice to meet you, too. When I write, it’s usually a poem or short story. I use writing to express ideas, feelings, or just to pass time (metaphors are basically my best friend). In some ways, I even use writing to communicate with others. I don’t necessarily write in any specific genres, however, my writing tends to be far darker than my peers’, and even my English teacher has said I have a bleak and vexed voice in my writing. I think for the modules, I would like to review/start with “Well being &amp; Self Care” and “Finding Inspiration”. Unfortunately, Spring break is coming up, and I won’t have access to a computer/proper means of communication via email for the next couple weeks (March 13th-March 27th). Thank you! - Kate Mentor 2023-03-10, 13:28: I'm glad that you've found a way to express yourself and communicate well with writing! I used to write a lot more, but I haven't lately. Maybe I should start writing again when I have free time. I typically write short stories. I hope that you've enjoyed your spring break (I'm assuming that you'll read this after it's over)! I'm opening up ""Well-being and Self Care"" so you can access it when you come back. Mentee 2023-05-09, 09:06: Hi there.

In response to the first discussion question, I've come up with some signs that I notice when I might need self care - when I get very tired, find it difficult to focus, and end up taking longer than usual to finish my tasks, this means I need to take a break. Some of the activities that I enjoy that make me feel better are: listening to music, taking a walk outdoors, reading, drawing, baking, and watching movies. Thanks, Lilly! I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts about this topic! Mentee 2023-06-02, 09:22: Hi Alexandra, Some good news! I am now a lifeguard at my local pool and will start working there soon. I'm excited to start making my own money haha The biggest sign I usually get when I need self care or I'm feeling mentally drained is burnout. I start having trouble focusing in school and don't have the motivation to finish work. I'm already really bad a procrastination, but towards the school year it gets worse. I used to struggle with my mental health and depression, especially during Covid, and while things are much better now, I still get tired of the world sometimes. Often times I bake to de-stress, and there's nothing better than lying on my bed reading a good book, but I do have unhealthy coping habits that I'm still working on. Do you have any tips on balacing school with work and free time? I'm really happy to start working soon but being a lifeguard is mentally exhausting, and I'm worried it might lead to burnout sooner. Is there anything you do to help with making sure those things are balanced? Lilly Mentor 2023-06-02, 18:17: Hi Lilly, Congratulations on landing the job!!! I'm so glad to hear the good news - it's been great talking to you throughout your application process and seeing all your hard work pay off! I think I can relate to many of the signs you've mentioned that you experience when you need self-care, and I think pretty much everyone I've spoken to has agreed that Covid has made it much more difficult to maintain good mental health these past few years, so you're certainly not alone. It looks like we both enjoy baking and reading when we need to de-stress! It's good that you've identified what helps you relax and feel better. In response to your question, balancing school, work, and free time is something I continue to work on, especially now in post-secondary. I think using an agenda and planning out which tasks I'm going to finish during specific times helps me to find balance because otherwise, it's possible for me to get carried away and work on certain assignments/projects for too long, neglecting others in the process. Setting a timer when you do homework can also help and remind you to take breaks. I know some students try to plan their schedules so that they can have one day of the week when they can relax without doing any assignments for school or working - I understand this might not be possible for everyone, but it's probably a good idea if you can afford to do so. Will you also be taking classes this summer, or just working at your new job? Thanks, Lilly, and as usual, please feel free to ask any questions you might have! Looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-06-05, 09:44: Hi Alexandra, I'm going to be mostly working this summer, but I will be travelling out of the country to go see family in Europe in August, which will be fun. Are you doing anything? Also, are there any new recipies you've learned lately that you liked? I've been making a lot of PB cups the last few weeks. I think making an agenda would probably help me, but often when I try to make one, I proocrastiate doing it. The one day off a week plan sounds like a good idea though. When I do homeowork, I often set a 25 minute timer and have 5 minute breaks in between. What are some new self-care challenges I will be facing when going to post-secondary? Are there any differences with self-care when living on campus in a dorm and living on your own in an apartment while going to school? Any tips to help with procrastination other than making an agenda? I have to stop provcratsinating doing that first haha Thanks for all your advice! Lilly Mentor 2023-06-05, 10:54: Hi Lilly, Thanks for your message! It's great to hear that you'll have the chance to travel to Europe and visit your family this August. Like you, I'm mostly working this summer - I tutor students, and I'm also helping with some historical research at UBC. I'm also taking an online course. It looks like we'll both be having a busy summer! Here’s a link to a recipe for a mug cake that I like because it’s quick and easy to make, using a microwave. I usually microwave the mixture two times (thirty seconds each time, and I check on it after microwaving it the first time) and it’s done cooking in about one minute! I'm glad that setting a timer when you write homework lets you have breaks and works well for you! I think the main self-care challenge students face when they start post-secondary is probably the workload and getting used to the difficulty of what they're learning in class. I think that making sure you have a schedule that includes breaks, or as we talked about before, maybe a day free from studying or work would help. I'd recommend also working a few hours less than you anticipate that you can handle if at all possible during the first term of post-secondary, just to get used to how your classes are. As you have correctly anticipated, depending on whether you'll be living in a dorm or in an apartment off-campus might influence how you approach self-care. For example, some dorms have shared washrooms or kitchens, so you'll have to coordinate with other students. You might also have roommates and have to share spaces regardless of whether you live in a dorm or rent off-campus, which will take some getting used to. For dorms on campus, there will be residence advisors who you can contact for help in case you have issues or questions about living in the dorm, but if you rent off-campus, you might have to be more independent. Some other tips I have other than making an agenda are maybe using an online calendar (I use Google Calendar) and setting alarms/reminders on my phone to remind me to do tasks. Or I'll plan some ways to relax (reading, going out, etc.) but tell myself I have to finish a certain number of tasks on my list before I can do them. I hope this helps - I know it's tough! Please let me know if you have any more questions! Looking forward to hearing from you!",,,,,,,"Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:10: Hi Alexandra, I have been Hearing and learning about different scholarships and awards in the past couple months. One question I have been wondering about is when do you start applying for scholarsips/financial aid? Is it once you've already been enrolled in post-secondary, or does it differ depending on what the award is? Currently I'm not elegible for anything, but I'm also only in Grade 10, but I think in the future I will be able to apply to a lot of the academic scholarships and otherwise, as I've got good grades and want to volunteer in the near future, as well as some financial grants. Did you get any scholarships/grants for your schooling? What were they and how did you apply? -Lilly Mentor 2023-05-16, 11:52: Hi Lilly, Thank you very much for your message! My apologies for the delayed reply. Your question about applying for scholarships and financial aid is a good one, and yes, the process often varies. When you're applying to post-secondary as a high school student, you can keep an eye out for different scholarships. For example, some post-secondary institutions offer entrance scholarships that they might give out based on students' applications. There are also different scholarships that you can read about and find online which you can apply to as well. Researching online is a good place to start, and the first set of discussion questions in this module invites us to try looking for scholarships that you might be eligible for in the future, which we can talk about. Students who are already enrolled in post-secondary can also receive scholarships and also bursaries. Depending on the type of scholarship or financial aid, it can be given out based on grades, community involvement (like volunteering), or financial need for example. When I was applying for university I remember applying for a few scholarships, but I had better luck during my time at university. Post-secondary institutions often have awards that they automatically consider students for if they do well (in their studies, being involved in the school community, etc.) but it is also definitely worth applying for scholarships at your school during post-secondary. Students can apply for bursaries at post-secondary, which are mostly based on financial aid. Once again, thanks for your message, Lily! Please let me know if you have any more questions! Mentee 2023-05-18, 09:47: Hi Alexandra, I didn't know about the scholarships from once you're in post-secondary, so that's good to know! For budgeting, we're currntly doing assignments in CLE on post-secondary finances, but I still have a few questions on budgeting. I know it's good to keep and track a budget, but what are some things that could be unforseeable that you have experienced. Also, how much of your income would you recommend putting into savings? Is is a percentage or just what is leftover from spending that month. Also, what do you recommend is a good time to work when balancing your classes? Also, do you know if the UBC pool has lifeguards? Thanks,\ Lilly Mentor 2023-05-18, 17:38: (I think the message I tried to send last time went to the wrong module, so I'm sending it again) Hi Lilly, Thanks for your message! Yes, I think regarding budgeting it would be best to have some funds set aside for unforeseen expenses. For example, a student might need to get their laptop repaired unexpectedly during the school year, and it's important to have a working computer during post-secondary because a lot of the assignments that students need to do are online. I often see it recommended to keep anything from around 10% to 20% of your monthly income as savings, but the exact amount suitable would probably also depend on other factors like how much you're making in a month. Maybe you can let me know more about what you're working on in your CLE assignment and we can discuss it further as well if you'd like. And yes, there are Life Guards and Swim Instructors at UBC. I've linked a website that talks about what qualifications you'd need to become a lifeguard/swim instructor at UBC here in case you're interested in learning more about it! Thanks again, Lilly, and please let me know if you have any more questions! Mentee 2023-05-23, 09:04: Hi Alexandra, In CLE we've been doing financial logs to keep track of our spening everyday. Would that be agood idea to do in university, and would you have to track every little thing or just make an estimate? We've also been estimating budget and meal plans, as well as the cost of aprtments. How much is the average cost to stay in student resident. Also, would it be advisable to get a meal plan? I know how to cook and would much rather cook for myself, but I know that a lot of dorms have small kitchens. I want to save as much as I can. What would also be a good school to work to free time balance? Is there a certain number of hours you set aside for these things? -Lilly Mentor 2023-05-23, 11:33: Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message! Yes, it would probably be a good idea to keep track of your spending during university. Whether you keep a detailed record of the amount you spend or if you make an estimate I think should be up to you. I'd probably advise keeping as detailed a record as possible but this can also depend on other factors. For example, if a student would like to start building their savings, it would be better for them to keep track of all their spending to make sure that they can save a certain amount every month. Also, it would probably be good to have some money set aside for unexpected expenses, as we've discussed before. The cost of staying in student residence varies depending on which school you go to, as well as which room you'd be staying in. At UBC, according to the university website, the ""typical cost for a room and meal plan for a new undergraduate student is roughly $12,000–$14,500"". I think whether you choose to get a meal plan depends on your budget as well and if you'd like to save money above all, it makes sense to cook on your own. However, I know lots of people recommend going with the meal plan during the first year of university when you're still getting used to the workload and might not be sure how much time you'll have to go grocery shopping and cook. The number of hours of class that you'll be taking will depend on your major and the classes that are available, too. I think most people I've spoken to take around 4 or 5 classes a semester (at UBC we have two semesters during the regular school year). I've heard people recommend working anywhere from 10 to 20 hours a week, but it depends on your courses, the time you need to commute, and other factors as well. For example, a student might also want to have more free time to join clubs instead of working or studying. I hope these answers helped, Lilly! Please feel free to ask any more questions you might have! Mentee 2023-05-30, 08:49: Hi Alexandra, I don't have any more questions about funding my future right now. I will probably take Sholarship 12 in grade 12 though. Thank you for the advice. We can move onto Well-being and Self-care now. Lilly Mentor 2023-05-30, 10:34: Hi Lilly, That sounds good! I'll open up the Well Being &amp; Self Care sections for us to take a look at. Thank you!","Mentor 2023-03-01, 21:12: Hi Lilly! My name is Alexandra and I’m going to be your mentor for the next few months! Right now, I’m a student at UBC where I study English Literature and History but one day I’m hoping to become a high school teacher. I saw from your profile that you like to bake, and it’s one of my favourite hobbies, too! I like trying out new recipes and sometimes I try to come up with my own. I also think it’s super cool that you’re interested in archaeology and anthropology! I haven’t taken courses at UBC in those subjects before, but I’ve taken human geography and history classes and I think based on your interests in the past and in different cultures you’d find those interesting, and we can definitely chat about those if you’d like to hear more! We’ll be working on four conversations of your choice, and you get to choose the conversation topics you’d like to try out from the different conversations on the navigation wheel. Just let me know when you’re ready to start and which conversation you’d like to complete first, and I’ll open it up for us. Thanks, Lilly - I’m looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-03-03, 09:25: Hello Alexandra! Thank you for being available to mentor me for the next few months. I am exited to start talking with you, especially about different courses that you think would interest me. History is my favourite subject to learn, so I hope we can chat about that as well courses you'd recommend at UBC. I will contact you sometime next week with the first module I would like to start with. Thank you again, and I look forward to working with and learning from you! -Lilly Mentor 2023-03-04, 22:44: Hi Lilly, thank you for your message! I'm glad to hear that we have interests in common, and I'll keep those in mind! There are definitely lots of interesting history courses at UBC. So far I've mostly taken courses about Canadian and European history. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your weekend! I look forward to chatting with you next week! Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:19: Hi Alexandra! I would like to start with the module on Getting Hired, and eventually go onto Strategic Studying, Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning and one other which I haven't decided on yet troughout the semester. I will log onto MentorCity about twice a week to chat with you, but my spring break starts next week and I will not be available all of next week. I will contact you once I'm not so busy anymore. I look forward to working and looking through the modules with you. Thank you, Lilly Mentor 2023-03-09, 07:43: Hi Lilly, thanks for your message! I've opened up the Getting Hired conversation for us to start when you're ready. Thank you for letting me know about which conversations you've decided on so far, and about your upcoming spring break. Thanks again; I'm looking forward to chatting with you! Mentee 2023-03-30, 08:48: Hi Alexandra, I'm sorry I haven't contacted you. I won't be able to chat in depth until next week because my school's musical is this weekend and I've been really busy with that. I am going to start working on my resume next week so I will contact you then. Thank you, and sorry about that. Mentor 2023-03-31, 23:10: Hi Lilly, No worries about the late reply! Good luck with your performance in your school's musical, I know you'll do great!! In the meantime, have a good weekend! I look forward to hearing from you next week. Mentee 2023-04-28, 09:06: Hi Alexandra, I think my interview went well! I'll be hearing back from them hopefully sometime soon. I would like to start on the module 'Funding Your Future' next. Lilly Mentor 2023-05-01, 09:04: Hi Lilly, That's great to hear! I'm glad your interview went well. Thank you for letting me know which module you'd like to start next. I've opened up the 'Funding Your Future' page for you to take a look at once you're ready. Looking forward to chatting with you soon! Mentor 2023-05-18, 17:35: Hi Lilly, Thanks for your message!

If any more come up I'll ask though. Can we move on to From Rural to Urban? Thanks! Lilly Mentor 2023-06-09, 09:18: Hi Lilly, Alright, that sounds good! I'll open up the From Rural to Urban module for us to take a look! Thanks! Mentor 2023-06-14, 17:58: Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message! It's interesting to hear about your experiences living in both the city and rural areas, and which elements of a city might make us consider it more urban compared to other places. Like you, I almost always think of skyscrapers when I think of the city! Have you visited Vancouver many times? Were there any parts of Vancouver or things about the city that stood out to you? I didn't grow up in a rural area, and until I moved to campus for university, I had always lived in the suburbs of a city in Greater Vancouver. I think one of the more difficult things to get used to when moving to a new environment would be potentially not seeing the same people you would have had the chance to see every day before - but at university, many people are in the same situation, and you'll get many chances to stay connected with and get to know other students. I think that navigating the city can also be overwhelming, but many students use public transit and find it convenient because as long as you are able to plan your commute/trip and look up potential routes online, this can alleviate much of the stress of being in a new environment. Looking forward to hearing more of your thoughts about the topic! Mentor 2023-06-23, 23:02: Hi Lilly, Thank you very much for your thoughtful message! It was great to be able to talk to you these past several months. I'm glad to have been able to chat and offer my support to you during this time - from discussing your interests in anthropology, and your participation in the school musical, to discussing your job application process and seeing you get the job - I really enjoyed hearing about it all every step of the way! I think it's especially wonderful that you are proactive, and that you like asking questions. My advice would be to keep on doing all this, they're good habits for when you're discovering what interests you and pursuing these interests, in high school and beyond. I hope you have a fantastic summer. And yes, who knows, maybe we'll run into each other in the future! Thanks again, Lilly, and best of luck!","Mentee 2023-06-14, 08:53: Hi Alexandra, I grew up in a city of around 200,000, although it never felt that big. Maybe because the city never had huge buildings and skyscrapers, or maybe it's because it was in Asia. (Fun fact I grew up in Cambodia). I moved to Canada about 2 years ago, to a town of about 17,000. It never felt like a big change beacause the city I grew up in never felt like a city, if that makes sense? It never felt as big and overwhelming as Vancouver does, and while I want to live there for university and my young adult life, I worry a little bit. Did you grow up somewhere rural? If you did, what was the hardest thing about the transition? Lilly Mentor 2023-06-14, 17:58: (Sending this message here again, because I realize it got posted on the wrong page) Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message!

Mentee 2023-06-19, 09:01: Hi Alexandra, I've been to Vancouver a lot for day trips or overnight trips, and we always fly into or out of there (I live on Vancouver Island). I've always found its size fascinating, and I love taking the skytrains and watching the city go by. I love exploring big cities because there's so much to see. I have been to the UBC campus before to go to the Museum of Anthropology (which sparked my interest in the subject) and I had a tour, and it is beautiful. I tend to adapt to new situations quickly, but I think not seeing my parents everyday will take some getting used to, and just living on my own in general. How can I make sure to stay in contact regularly with them other than just phone calls? I'm also not the best at making new friends, and social situations are not my forte, so do you have any tips on making new friends at university, because I assume it's a bit different than high school in that regard. Lilly Mentor 2023-06-19, 10:58: Hi Lilly, Thanks for your message! I'm glad to hear that you like Vancouver so much! I still remember the first time I visited the Museum of Anthropology when I was younger - it's fascinating, and there are so many interesting things to see on the UBC campus! It's also good to hear that you adapt to new situations quickly. I think that some good ways to stay in contact with family when you're living on your own would be to either make a group chat where you can send little updates and photos to each other when you get the chance, or maybe set up a time every couple of weeks to video call each other. I think the biggest difference with making friends at university compared to high school is that you'll see the same people a lot less often because there are a lot more students and they've all got different schedules. You've probably heard this at least a few times, but joining clubs can help you with making friends. I'd definitely just try to keep in touch with classmates though, even just online, especially people you know who are in your major (studying the same subjects as you). I'll let you know if I think of anything else! Please feel free to ask any other questions you might have! Mentee 2023-06-20, 14:59: Hi Alexandra, I don't have too many more questions, so we'll be done soon. Thank you for giving me insight to the topics we've talked about! What are your favourite things to do in Greater Vanouver? Any suggestions for someone who just moved there? I've been to Science World, Stanley Park, BC Place, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Rogers Arena and Metrotown, but outside of that I haven't seen that much of it unless I was in the skytrain. Are there any small shops you like to visit that are near UBC as well? Also, how much is a monthly bus pass? Also, what are some fun clubs? I'm definitely joining the UBCMTT if I get accepted, but is there anything else? Thank you! Lilly Mentor 2023-06-21, 22:22: Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message! I think you mentioned many great places to visit in Vancouver! I'd probably also add places like Granville Island, the Vancouver art gallery, the Museum of Vancouver, the PNE, the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden, and the VanDusen Botanical Garden. I can't really think of any shops at the moment, but there are many nice cafes around UBC where you can stop by. If you are a student at a post-secondary institution in BC, you're most likely eligible for the U-Pass BC Program, which means you'll be paying for a bus pass with your other student fees instead of having to pay for a bus pass every month (you just have to log in online and request your U-Pass on the 16th of every month to be able to use transit the next month). If you're interested in the UBCMTT, I think another club you might be interested in is the UBC Players Club, which is a theatre club that also designs and performs its own original plays. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any more questions! I look forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-06-22, 09:03: Hi Alexandra, I don't have anything else to ask, you've answered pretty much everything. I know I didn't really follow the module set up but I had a lot of my own questions to ask. Thank you for giving me insight to all the things we talked about, I learned quite a bit. If you have any last tips for me I would appreciate them, but if not, thank you for everything and I hope you have fun becoming a teacher. I know high schoolers can be hard. Maybe I'll see you at UBC one day? Who knows. Best, Lilly :)",,"Mentee 2023-03-22, 17:49: Hi Alexandra, Sorry I havenèt messaged you, as I said I started spring break, and I was fairly bust last week. The reason I wanted to start with getting hired is because I just finished lifeguard training a few days ago and I will be applying for a job at my pool soon. I want to talk about building my resume, and adding things such as skills, as this is my first job. The article talked about adding skills you excell in, but how would you format that, and prove that you have those skills? Would you talk about the extra-curriculars you're in, and could you reference people? I'm only in my school's musical, and I do kick-boxing once a week, so could I add those? Also, when in an interview, how could you make sure your answers are long and concise, and how would you help with your nerves if it's your first interview. I know this is a lot of questions but there are quite a few things I would like cleared for me. Thank you! -Lilly Mentor 2023-03-24, 23:57: Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message! I hope that you’ve been having a lovely spring break so far. Also, great job on finishing your lifeguard training - that’s an amazing accomplishment!! You’re asking some really good questions about applying for jobs and on the topic of getting hired. Based on the article, we can work on coming up with a list of examples of your skills/tasks that show that you can communicate well, that you’re responsible, a quick learner, good at teamwork, and/or that you’re good with technology. For my own resume, I like to put descriptions of my skills underneath specific positions/activities. So you might note that you were a cast member in your school’s musical, indicate the year, and describe below it in point form some of the skills and responsibilities you showed (like strong interpersonal skills, which would be part of teamwork, or strong public speaking skills, which would be good communication, for example - specific tasks are also good to include). The extracurriculars that you mentioned would be great to add to your resume! There are many ways to format resumes as a whole: you can type one up in Word or Google Documents, or you can find templates to fill out. I use a graphic design website called Canva which has a lot of resume and cover letter templates that users can edit. For interviews, I like to search online for common interview questions and practice how I would answer those. I would also review the job description and think about how I’d describe my abilities to fulfill the skills the job requires. When you answer interview questions, it’s nice to mention specific examples and experiences you’ve had before and how you learned from them. I think practicing for interviews helps, and make sure to be well-rested before your interview! As for references, usually, your interviewer will ask for the contact information of your reference(s) (address, email, phone number, etc.) after your interview, so it’s good to have a couple in a list. A reference is someone whom your interviewer can contact to ask about your skills and work ethic - you could ask your teachers to be your references, for example. I hope this helps! Just let me know if you’d like any clarification about any of these points or any further advice! I’m looking forward to hearing from you and chatting some more! Mentee 2023-04-06, 09:08: Hi Alexandra, I've been thinking about the different skills to put on my resume. How many skills would you recommend I put on it? What I have so far is that I am good at teamwork, as I often am in plays and musicals. I would say I am hard working, as I get straight As (I don't want to sound like I'm bragging though so I could probably word that differently), and I'm good at communicating with other people. I am also responsible and don't get into trouble. How long should explaining your skills be? I am trying to match my skills to lifeguarding currently. Also, who can you use as a reference? Currently, I only have one, and that was my trainer for my final lifeguarding course (NLP) Sorry for the wait, a lot has been happening. Lilly Mentor 2023-04-08, 20:40: Hi Lilly, It's great to hear from you! You're asking a lot of good questions! I'd say listing anywhere from five to ten skills, depending on what fits best on the layout of your resume, would work. The examples of skills you mentioned are great: teamwork/collaboration, strong work ethic, strong public speaking or verbal/written communication, and being trustworthy/reliable/responsible are all good skills and traits to have (I've included a couple more descriptive words in case they might be helpful). Based on the activities you've told me about, I think you could also easily mention leadership and adaptability-related skills. If you speak another language you could add that, too. If you want to include a note about your grades, you could write that you've maintained an A grade point average in high school. I'd suggest listing the skills on your resume in point form with a few keywords in its own section and having longer point-form sections to describe each of your activities, with the responsibilities you had for each and the ways you displayed your skills underneath each activity. It is a great idea to try to match your skills to the job you're hoping to get. Having your trainer from your lifeguarding course as a reference is a great choice. You could also ask a teacher who knows you well to be your reference since they can talk about your strong work ethic. I hope these answers help! Feel free to ask more questions! Mentee 2023-04-14, 09:23: Hi Alexandra, I've almost finished my reume, and will be sending it in this weekend. Thank you for your advice. I've also had my mom look over it and it looks good. Are there any other things about resumes I should know? Also, for job interviews, what I'm most nervous about is clamming up and not remembering things or not giving good answers. I've never had one before, so do you have any tips of calming your nerves before one? Sorry it has been taking a while to get back to you, thank you for everything, Lilly Mentor 2023-04-16, 18:58: Hi Lilly, Thank you for your message! I think you've already asked a lot of great questions and that we've covered pretty much all the advice I've also been given in the past about resume building. To prepare for interviews, I'd recommend reviewing the information on your resume so you'll be prepared to talk about it, and maybe googling common interview questions so you can practice your answers. A tip I've heard from others about answering interview questions is using the STAR method to describe your past experiences when you respond to interview questions. Let's say you want to talk about your experience with your school's musical to show how you can be a good team member. You can answer by first describing the Situation, then your Task (the responsibilities you had), then going into detail about the Action you took in order to fulfill these responsibilities or respond to a problem. The last step would be to describe the Results of the experience, what you learned from it and how these skills connect to your future responsibilities as a lifeguard. I tend to get very nervous during interviews too, but I think practicing a little bit helps! Let me know if you have any other questions, and best of luck with submitting your application! Mentee 2023-04-18, 09:44: Hi Alexandra, I've got a job interview next week! I just want to ask some final questions and then we can move onto the next module. What I know so far is that it will be a situational interview. What would be some good examples from day to day life that people could use to answer questions that would show up in those types of interviews? Also, are there any tips on what you shouldn't say/anything you learned from your own job interviews that didn't go well? I've been getting advice from counsellors as well, so these are just some small things I want to clear up. Thank you for going through the module with me, the next few shouldn't take as long. Lilly Mentor 2023-04-20, 13:06: Hi Lilly, Great job on landing an interview!! I'm glad to hear that the application process went well! I think it's likely that in a situational interview for a lifeguard position, they'll ask you how you'd behave or respond to a specific scenario or type of emergency, so it would probably be a good idea to mention points that you've learned during lifeguard training. If they ask for you to mention a situation where you showed a specific skill, you can draw from the experiences listed on your resume and explain them in more depth, or you could talk about what you learned in training as well. Also, please feel free to remind me of which module you'd like to work on next once you've decided. I wish you all the best with your interview, Lilly!",,

What were some of the challenges that you have to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. what did you do to overcome them? Mentor 2023-03-31, 11:34: Hi Ryder, No worries! Oh that's very exciting! How'd your team do? I definitely agree that your dream job is realistic. I know a lot of my engineering peers (I did geological engineering but some of my peers were environmental and civil) just did their Bachelors degree. I went right into my Masters degree after graduation because I enjoy school and research. For the most part, it seems like Bachelors is enough for most engineering jobs. That's good to know - do you need to attend college to get LEED certification? It good that you have thought about university. It can be a great time but it isn't always for everyone. If you go into it with a goal and set out to reach that goal then you will be successful. You'll have lots of fun along the way too! My biggest challenge entering university was being away from my friends. I had a close group of friends in highschool and when I went off to school, my 2 closest friends also did and they were quite far from me. A lot of my friends stayed in my hometown for ""12X"" (Grade ""13"") so it was difficult knowing that I was missing out on the fun they were having. This was especially difficult because I did co-op which meant I was at school year round. I am quite introverted so it was difficult for me to make new friends at the beginning of unversity. Eventually it got easier to connect with my peers and I ended up making some close friends, while being able to stay in touch with my hometown friends when I had the chance to visit home. My grades fell quite a bit between high school and university despite me working hard. I recognised that this is common so I didn't stress much about it. Waterloo is about 2 hours from my hometown and my dad travelled there quite a bit for work so I never felt like I was too far from home. Also with cell phones and such it was really easy to stay connected to my family and friends. We can move onto the next Anchor Text if you feel ready. Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2023-04-17, 09:15: Hey mckenna, me and my team played very well in our tournement and I was fourtunate enough to actually win mvp for the tournement. I was really sick so i couldnt respond sorry. For the factors i think it should be close to home and affordable im not trying to go to school in another province. A school i have looked into is uvic its close to home and they have the program i would like to do. For the school i want the requirments are as of 2022, admission requirements for the civil engineering program at university of victoria: • all it says is a 6.6 gpa average, graduation of high school, and 1 year of full time study. I looked everywhere for more admission requirments but i cant thats all it says. I have feeling that i will be admitited if i apply. Mentor 2023-04-17, 16:30: Hi Ryder, Great to hear from you! That's very exciting about your soccer tournament - and huge congrats on the MVP! Sorry to hear that... hope you are fully recovered! Those are both good factors to consider. Out of province schooling can also be difficult because you have to figure things out like health care, finding a place to live, etc. When it is your first time on your own, that can feel overwhelming. Staying close to home and within your home province can make things slightly easier. That's great that you were able to find some information. Do you know if the program is a general first year for engineering or do you go directly into civil (some schools have a general first year for engineering then at the end of the year you apply to your focused program of choice - civil engineering in your case)? If you are happy with what we have dicussed in this conservation, we can move onto the next. Let me know which conversation you would like to do. Your mentor, McKenna",,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 12:45: Hi Ryder, It's great to (virtually) meet you! I'm very excited to be your mentor and I hope I can share some of my post-secondary experiences with you. It is awesome that your class gets to participate in a program like this. I see that you are interested in engineering and management! That's so cool! Do you have any family or friends in the industry? What type of enginnering interests you most? I saw in your profile that you enjoy soccer! How long have you been playing? If you have any questions about what it is like being a varsity athlete in university, I'd be happy to share my experience (I raced cross country during my undergrad) and some of my friends' experiences. To get to know each other, I was thinking we could do 2 Truths and a Lie. Basically I will share 2 facts about myself and 1 thing that is a lie and you will have to guess which one is a lie. Then you will share 2 facts (and 1 lie) about yourself and I will guess the lie. Here are mine: 1. I spent a year travelling Australia after finishing high school. 2. I have never broken any bones. 3. I have a pet dog named Brooklyn. Can't wait to chat with you :) Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2023-03-03, 09:23: I dont have any family members in any of these careers. I do really find areospace engineering cool and civil engineering. for soccer ive been playing since i was 3 and i do want to ask is it alot harder doing sports with your schooling. for the truth and lie I think number 3 is a lie for sure ive never heard of a dog named brooklyn before. my 2 truths one lie is i have three cats im 6'2 ive been to mexico -Ryder Mentor 2023-03-03, 12:52: Oh cool! Areospace engineering seems like it would be really interesting. Civil engineering is also really neat, especially because you can follow a unique career path - you can specialize in construction, infrastructure, mining or a number of other things. Woah, that's a long time! Good question - it really depends on you! For me, I definitely had to make sacrifices while being a student athlete and doing my engineering degree. I found that it takes a lot of time out of your day to do sports, but I felt like it was 100% worth it. Realistically, you can't do school work all day, every day, so having a sport to fill some of your free time isn't a bad thing. It's good to get into good habits right away and find a good balance between school, sports, a social life and everything else that you want. Some weeks might be busier than others and those can be stressful, but I think that having those tough weeks helped me prepare for the real world. If I could go back and do my undergrad degree again, I would choose to continue being a student athlete because it made my experience so much better. Actually, number 1 was a lie - I have never been to Australia. My dog is named Brooklyn (my dad named her after a car race track in the USA). I'm going to guess that your lie is number 1. Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2023-03-08, 08:55: hey, mckenna for the modules can we start with post secondary and career planning. also even if being a student athlete wil add more of a challenge i think i can take i love soccer its just one of those sacrifices. i also would love to know what you plan on pusuing as a career coming out of university. -Mentee Mentor 2023-03-08, 09:11: Hi Ryder, For sure! I can open the post secondary and career planning module now. Yeah it is worth it. Good question (still something I'm not too sure about yet though)! I think I want to work in the mining industry, working on contaminated water. When a mine closes, the site is often left highly contaminated and the water on site can runoff and enter sensitive water paths, such as downstream lakes and rivers. I want to prevent this from happening or help remediate areas where this does happen. Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2023-05-03, 08:52: hello sorry for the wait ive been busy with other assignments can you please open up from rural to urban. Mentor 2023-05-03, 09:05: Hi Ryder, Sure I can do that! Looking forward to hearing back from you :)",,,,,
1047514156,10/9/2020 17:42,1047593964,59530,,,"Mentor 2023-04-03, 10:03: I really like this module, for obvious reasons haha as this is a big topic in psychology, but also I always think it's not brought up enough! As you probably already know, maintaing one's mental health is a life long thing. Sure we may eventually find a routine that works well for us but because there's so many unexpected things that can happen and affect our mental health, I feel like there is no ""perfect"" routine. I do really appreciate some of the common points provided in the article and video that at the very least being able to maintain healthy habits of getting enough sleep, food, and exercise. I personally still struggle with having such habits. Some weeks are better than others. Also knowing your own warning signs is very important. Responding to those warning signs vary. But self-care is very personal, there is no perfect recipe, we need to find out what works for us. So I think a big part of it mental health being aware of your own needs. One thing though that I do want to point out, which I'm sure you already are aware, that therapy isn't just for people who have diagnosed disorders. Therapist are available for someone to just listen and bounce ideas off of essentailly. What I really like about UNBC and I believe this is available at most schools, is that part of your student fees include mental health services so it's a resource that is easily accessible. I do encourage you to find out the mental health resources that are available at whichever school you end up going to. Let me know if you want to share warning signs and list of activities you enjoy with each other! And let me know if you have questions. Mentee 2023-04-26, 09:38: Hey! Sorry for not talking for so long, but i just finished watching the video about self care. What selfcare methods have you used throughout post-secondary? What challenges have you had to overcome mentally in post-secondary (If you don't mind me asking). As for the self-care action plan part, I definetly need better eating habits, such as not skipping meals and eating healthier, I feel is i set alarms on my phone as when to eat, i won't forget or skip over meals, and even if im not hungry i can still have a healthy snack. I also feel like i need to gety out of the house more, so i could potetally go on daily, or weekly walks with a friend to help with that. Ive also been trying to sleep better, but i think for that i should just be taking my meletonin earlier rather then at 12 when i feel like going to bed haha. Also if you have any time management tips, i could greatly appritiate those :) Other then that im done with this module. Thanks again! Talk soon Mentor 2023-04-28, 21:00: Hi there! No worries! Honestly, that is a tough question about self-care methods because I was really focused on getting good grades in university and there were many times when I know I wasn't taking very good care of myself. And I do regret not having the full university experience and the social aspects. In terms of ways I remember taking care of myself, I was very big into at home spa type things so like baths and face masks. Making food that I like was also really helpful because I enjoyed cooking. I tried to set a time for me to go to bed even when I have big things due, like I always tried to be in bed by 2am the latest, which isnt the greatest still. I think challenges I had to overcome was all kinda related to my relationship with my mom, and that actually led me to go to therapy because it was impacting my day-to-day life. So I think being able to recognize what you need is important. I think starting from the basic things like sleep, eating, and exercise is really great! because having this good foundation will help in many aspects. And self-care isnt just about treating yourself, I undestand it more as taking care of yourself! And it sounds like you have a great plan to improve on those areas! Thanks for your thoughtful response! If there's nothing more you want to discuss, I'll unlock the post-secondary and career planning!",,,"Mentor 2023-04-28, 21:04: Hi there, so I think for this one there's a lot more for you to explore and you can ask me whatever questions you have. We have previously discussed your interest in psychology, so as you probably know there are many paths you can take after completing a degree in psychology. What is your dream job and do you have a plan B? I can share my answer to this too if you'd like!",,,"Mentor 2023-03-08, 19:17: I really like this video because I think the strategies presented in the videos are very helpful! Personally, I have used spaced-practice, switching, examples, and recall. I ended up developing a routine that was effective for me but studying and how you learn is unique to each person. But I wanted share my experience just some food for thought. So my routine starts during lectures, most professors will share their lecture slides on the online platform that our university has. Knowing that I have a copy of the lecture slides, I usually focus on making notes on what the professor is saying and not what is written on the slides. Then as soon as I can, I will try to combine the lecture slides with my notes from the prof. Knowing what you need to study and what is important comes with a bit of time and experience but most times the profs tell you what will be on the tests. Some profs test on textbook material too. So if that's important I incorporate that into my notes. So I just keep adding to this document with every lecture. So this is a bit of spaced practice. What is key also here is that if I have questions, I try to get them answered as soon as that lecture is done, so that when we move on to the next topic, I have a good grasp of the previous topic, and so my questions aren't piled up close to the exam. With that too, some exams ask for examples so this is when I would also try to figure out examples to help my understanding. Since there is a lot of memorizing in the classes I took, very common in Psych courses, I relied on making flashcards. If I can, I try to make the flashcards closely after the lectures, so that closer to the exam, I already have a pile of flash cards ready. Then if possible a week or so before the exam, I start going through the flashcards and switching between topics to solidify my memory. Sometimes I would also do the recall method, depending on if I expect there to be long answer questions. This method worked for most classes I took, but not all. I tried to find ways to adjust accordingly. But definitely what is important is to try to space it out and keep up with understanding the material and not cram, as you've probably already heard many times haha What is your method of studying? Have you tried any of the methods mentioned in the video? Mentee 2023-03-29, 09:56: Hello! I have returned from my spring break and just watched the video that went with strategic studying. That video defineity helped with finding new studying techniques that i will attempt to use in the future. I personally feel like I may struggle with the switch method, but i do believe the recall stratagy would work best, but ill have to test it out to be sure. Thanks again :) Mentor 2023-03-30, 21:34: That is good that it gave some ideas and techniques on how to study more efficiently! And yes the switch method would be tough since once you get into one topic, it's kinda nice to just focus on that until you have that fully understood/memorized. But of course it still depends on you as a person if that will be effective. Did you have any other questions about strategic studying or anything you'd like to discuss here? Or would you like to move on to the next conversation?",,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 22:27: Hi there! I'm Jihanne and I will be your mentor for the next few months! I was looking through your profile and I think the program made a great match because I did my undergrad in Psychology and I am currently trying to get into grad school to be a clinical psychologist! But I unfortunately did not go to VIU so I don't know much about that university. Feel free to ask me any questions about undergraduate and graduate school or life outside of high school! And please do tell me a bit more about yourself, what got you interested in psychology and in becoming a clinical therapist? Mentee 2023-03-03, 09:09: Hi! I looked through your profile too and saw that we have the same career intrest! I have always been interested in helping people but knew i would never be able to be a docter or a nurse. In grade 7 or 8 i started to take an interest in being a counsller or theripist, but this year i discovered what a clinical phychologist was and it was exactly what i had in mind. It peeked my intrest because i have been interested in mental illnesses and disorders for quite some time now. I know that Canada needs phychologists, and they make great pay. It's not just about the money, as i struggle from my own mental ilnesses, and feel that it may help me connect better with others, as i would be able to give advice and talk through things that help me, and can empathize with clients/patients. I would love to be able to help youth speciffically, but i still would be interested in helping a variety of people. What about you? What got you into phychology? What kind of classes are you having to take? Mentor 2023-03-04, 11:43: My interest in psychology started out pretty closely to how yours started. So I think as early as grade 8 I had an interest in mental illnesses, I remember doing a presentation in Science 8 about schizophrenia when we were told we can pick whatever topic we want. I was also interested in how the brain affects our behaviour. And those interests just continued until it was time for me to decide what to take in university. I also see myself in the therapy/intervention side of clinical psychology because I also want to help people through their problems/disorders and help them understand themselves better. I also considered the points that more psychologists are needed in Canada and that it pays well. I have worked a little bit with youths in a clinical and research setting so let me know if you have any questions regarding that! In terms of classes, if you mean in high school, I ended up just taking all the sciences and math classes just in case. But since you know the school you want to go to, definitely check out their info on admissions and what requirements they have (https://www.viu.ca/admissions/admission-requirements#university). From my experience at UNBC, they didn't really have too many specific class requirements to get into the program, more so grade requirement and that we have taken a few sciences and math classes (not necessarily all of them). In terms of classes in university, again this is UNBC but could be pretty similar to other universities, but for the first couple years we only had a few courses that were Psychology and the rest were electives, so essentially anything you want. It gives you a good opportunity to explore and also learn a different perspectives. So personally I took some hard science courses like Biology and Functional Anatomy, and also some social sciences so Anthropology and I learned that there were such things as Social and Human Geography. And then more courses came in on my 3rd and 4th year. So I'm not sure if you're aware but there are multiple streams in psychology such a Biopsychology, Developmental Psychology, Positive Psychology, Social Psychology, Personality etc. So for us there was a bit of freedom on what courses you can take as long as you take a certain number at the 3rd year or 4th year level and you have the required number of credits (so pretty similar to high school). So I was interested in Biopsychology so a lot of the courses I took were related to stream. Here is what I found for Psychology program outline for VIU: https://www.viu.ca/programs/arts-humanities-social-sciences/psychology-ba And it kinda looks pretty similar to what I described as above, not too may Psych courses in the 1st and 2nd year and more options for courses come in the 3rd and 4th year Mentor 2023-03-04, 11:44: I forgot to add below, Social Work is pretty interesting and closely related too so I took some Social Work courses during my degree! Mentee 2023-03-04, 12:09: Yea, I've looked at a lot of the requirements for various schools but I've mainly been looking at TRU and VIU, as well as UVIC because I am planning on getting my doctorate there, and possibly my masters if I can't get it at one of the other schools. I do see what you mean for the 1st and 2nd year courses, I found from the schools I've been looking at they mainly say Introductory to psychology, and a few other courses that I can't think of off the top of my head. How has the work load been at UNBC? I heard their acceptance rate is pretty low, was it difficult for you to get in? Mentor 2023-03-05, 11:12: Yes so the first couple years you have a bit of freedom to choose electives outside of psychology, but there are usually breadth requirements which is really just assures that you're taking a variety of courses and have a good base. But that's really good that you already know what schools you want to attend which will make the application process a bit easier! I found the workload was manageable enough, but I do want to note that I did not have a part time job, I only worked during the semester breaks. But it isn't uncommon for people to work and have extra curricular during univeristy and sitll manage the workload. And that also depends on the type of classes you're taking. What usually adds to the workload is the labs in the hard sciences courses because it's a whole other set of assignments and such. But you definitely get into those periods where there's just a lot due all at once. So midterm and finals season are unavoidable, but sometimes the due dates from your classes just end up lining up. But I think what helped me was definitely making sure I have all the due dates listed on a calendar so that I am not taken by surprise when things are due and plan accordingly for when I want to start assignments. And then also staying on top of your lecture notes/readings that are needed for classes so that when the exams come you're not re-learning everything. Not to say that you have to memorize everything after the lecture but just making sure you have an understanding of it and so when the exam comes, you can just memorize/study it. In terms of acceptance rate, I'm actually not sure, sorry! I was quite lucky to be offered a scholarship/admission. UNBC supports students from the northern BC so they offer scholarships to high school students from different high schools all over nothern BC who have maintained a certain grade in their grade 11 year. Mentee 2023-03-07, 09:26: Hello again! Aside from the worload, how difficult would you say your classes are? I also realized that I totally just jumped into questions without really talking about hobbies and getting to know you really, so sorry about that. I noticed you said you watch brooklyn 99 in your spare time, that show is so good, definitly one of my favorties. I also saw that you play guitar, i tried learning when I was younger but nevert stuck with it. I've always had a thing for music. I played piano for a few years when i was 3, the drums, recorder, guitar, but now i play trumpet in the concert band at my school. Did you ever play any sports or do any extra curriculars? What were your favorite classes in highschool? For my CLE class we have to pick 2-4 modules to do, and i personally would be intrested in Post-secondary and career planning, Stratigic studying, and well being and self care. Doesn't matter to me which one we start with :) Another thing is, is that our spring break is coming up and I'll be in Europe for 10 days, so just so you no I probably won't be able to respond but I promise I'm not ghosting you haha Have a great day, and thank you for being my mentor! Mentor 2023-03-08, 18:43: I think the classes aren't too bad. Honestly, it kinda depends on the course and your professor and the types of assignments they give. It depends on your preferences, there is a lot of writing involved and tests. Some courses can all be writing assignments and an exam. Some can be just exams. Some can be quizzes and exams. Professors have some freedom in how they structure their course. But having that interest in psychology is really what helped me through the difficult times as I mentioned that there will be times where there is a lot due all at once. Being motivated by wanting to learn about these topics will make it a bit easier. And no worries at all! We have a limited time so definitely try to sprinkle in all your questions as we work through the required modules. Sitcoms are one of my favorite ways to unwind for sure! And That's cool though that you tried to play many instruments! I was actually not involved in extra curriculars in high school, which I do regret. I wish I had managed my time better and got involved in a sport or in volunteer work. I had a part time job and was very studious so my time was occupied with school and work. I wish I tried harder to be involved in extra curriculars since having those are nice on applications, and some even help get scholarships and bursaries. Are you in any sports as well? In high school, my favorite classes were chemistry, biology, and pre-calculus/calculus. I know a lot of people don't like math so that's probably a bit weird to hear haha but that did work to my advantage because in Psych as you probably notice there are courses related to statistics, which is different from the math we learn in high school but it was good because I was just comfortable working with numbers. How about you, what are your favorite classes? Sounds good. I will unlock strategic studying first and send a message there too! Haha thanks for letting me know! I hope you enjoy your trip! And it's really my pleasure! Mentee 2023-03-31, 08:42: I don't think I have any questions at the moment, or anything I'd want to discuss, but if there's anything you want to add then feel free too, other then that i think I'm ready to move on too the next thing :) Mentor 2023-04-03, 09:49: Okay, sounds good! I don't have anything to add either so I will open up the ""Well-being and self-care"" module and send you a message there!

It considers the different things you want in life through reflecting on your passions and interests. What inspires you? For me, my goals inspire me to get out of bed in the morning and work hard. Knowing that I'll be one step closer to achieving them motivates me. Some of my current goals include becoming more healthy, journaling regularly, and enjoying the summer before school starts in September. Looking forward to hearing back, Alisha Mentee 2023-06-14, 10:47: For me, my friends and family inspire and motivate me most. They make me excited and want to achieve all my goals in life. My mom has made sure ever since i was little to set clear goals and strive to achieve them and to maintain a postivie outlook, no matter what gets in the way. Some of my current goals at the moment are to do good on my final exams and tests before summer, be active this summer and to save my money. In life, i want to become a nurse and specialize into other things, and i will be happy.All I want is happiness, good family relationships and friends, good health, enough wealth so i can be comforable and be able to retire at a good age. These things are important to me because i feel like some of these are key factors to a good, long, healthy life. What inspired you to start the path that you are on now? Mentor 2023-06-14, 21:09: Hi Dakota, That's amazing! I am so glad that you have such a great support network that you can rely on. I love those goals! It's great to have some goals in place so you look forward to achieving them. I have similar goals for the summer including staying physically active and eating healthy as well as travelling before I start school in September. For me personally, I was inspired to start on the path that I am now because of my dad. He is a nurse who has worked in the hospital for years and growing up, I would hear all these exciting stories that I fell in love with healthcare. After I started nursing school, I started working with patients and being able to help them which inspired me to work hard and stay motivated even when things got hard. Aside from the happiness I get from helping my patients, I stay inspired by my goals. I hope to live in Vancouver one day and own a place of my own, so that motivates me to work hard. There are many ways I am able to make these goals become reality and will become possible one day, including staying committed and working on time management. Can't wait to hear back, Alisha",,,"Mentor 2023-03-07, 21:23: Hi Dakota! That sounds amazing! I love taking naps and watching Netflix in my free time as well. It is great to have time aside for self care. It is unfortunate that you haven’t been able to go outside, but hopefully the weather warms up soon. It would be nice to spend some time outside during spring break. Do you know what you want to specialize in for nursing? I have also opened up the funding my future conversation for us to work through once you’re back from spring break. There are two articles for Anchor Text 1: Student loans, scholarships, grants, bursaries, and awards. After reading through those articles, we can further discuss the questions! For the other conversations, agency in the world discusses how to persevere and overcome challenges with the help of those within our support network. Dis/mis-information is about identifying and combatting a misinformation or information that is not correct on social media and other platforms. Let me know if that helps! Enjoy your spring break! Mentor 2023-04-12, 14:34: Hi Dakota, I’m glad to hear your spring break went well! There are plenty of resources that are available to help fund your post-secondary education including different scholarships, bursaries, and awards that you can receive. The ones you mentioned are great. I have used Student Aid BC as well as applied for the BC District scholarships when I had gradated. My high school also had in school scholarships which you can apply for in grade 12 which would be a great resource! For some scholarships, you may need 2-3 references. I had to ask for these last minute, but it makes it easier if you have a few teachers, mentors, or coaches in mind who could be your reference when applying for these. Additionally, starting on the scholarship applications early makes it signficantly easier to apply, as opposed to doing them last minute! Personally, for me, I applied to the in-school awards that were offered when I graduated high school and applied to the entrance awards that are available at the universities I was applying to. I applied to SFU, UFV, TRU, and UNBC’s scholarships and awards specifically. I was fortunate to receive some awards from my high school, as well as UNBC which paid for most of my education. For my last two years however, my parents supported me financially to pay for my education which was very helpful. Scholarships Canada is another great website where you can find different scholarships you would be eligible for! Hope that helps! Can't wait to hear back from you. Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:30: Thank you, it was helpful! For budging and managing money I feel like it would be pretty good at. I am very good at saving my money and I don’t like spending it often. I have looked at a lot of different universities, so I am aware of the cost. Lucky for me, I would be able to live at home for the first few years of university, which will save a bit of money. I know textbooks can get a bit pricey, how did you purchase them? I know I will be able to get them second hand, but where do I find them? Food can get pricey, but living at home with those expensive also, I know how to make a lot of quick, healthy, inexpensive meals. What do you recommend for trying to balance a part-time job with school overload? What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you?","Mentor 2023-03-02, 09:34: Hi Dakota! My name is Alisha and I am your mentor for the program. I am a 4th year nursing student at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) and I saw in your profile that you wanted to go into nursing as well! I hope you're having a great day and were able to navigate your way through MentorCity. I was wondering whether there was a specific topic you would like to start with first? Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:17: Hello Alisha, my name is Dakota and I am your mentee. I saw on your profile that we have similar hobbies. Lately in my free time, I have been taking naps and after, bingewatching Netlix series. Sadly due to the weather I haven't been able to go outdoors and hike, but now that it's starting to warm up, I am hoping I can be out more often. I am wanting to go into nursing aswell and later on I would like to specialize. I have always I would to start on working on funding my future, then post-secondary and career planning, Well being and sekf care, but im curious, what is Agency in the World and Dis- and Misinformation? I will be on Spring Break starting March 10th, and i will probably be out of communicationfor the next 2 weeks. I hope you are having a great day, thank you! Mentor 2023-04-10, 22:25: Hi! I hope you're having a great day! I was just sending a follow up message to ensure you received my previous message. I was hoping that we could begin one of the conversations soon. Let me know which one you want to begin with! Mentee 2023-04-11, 10:09: Hello Alisha! Thank you, I had a good, but busy spring break. I have been doing research about funding my future. Just looking at the website, I didn’t know there were so many things that can help students. I have found a few scholarships and bursaries. The first one is Student Aid BC. They give student loans, grants, and other financial assistance program for those in BC. BC School Superintendents Association, which they give annual regional scholarships for students planning to pursue post-secondary studies. The last one I found is BC District/Authority Scholarships and they scholarships to recognize graduating BC students for excellence in their chosen area of interest or strength. These are only a few I looked at and if you know of any that would be great. If you don’t mind me asking, how are you funding your education? Mentor 2023-04-19, 15:41: Hi Dakota, I’m glad to hear that! Budgeting can definitely be a challenge at times, but it sounds like you have a good grasp on it. Looking at the different universities cost is a great idea. Don’t forget to consider looking at their scholarships, awards, and bursaries as well as their eligibility criteria! Staying at home is another great way to save money. Personally, for me, I moved out of my hometown so I had to pay rent in addition to the cost of tuition and textbooks. However, I found purchasing textbooks used was the best way to save money on textbooks. I used Facebook group chats as well as students from the year above to purchase books from. During school, I did not have a part-time job. However, I know many friends who did have jobs in addition to school. They were able to do this through managing their time wisely. That is the key to balancing school and work. Creating to do lists, having a planner, and trying not to procrastinate are some of the best strategies they use! One of the most challenging budgeting issues for me was paying for clinical placements that were out of town. I was not expecting to be out of town for my extended placements, therefore, I had not budgeted this into my finances. Thankfully, there was an award that I was able to apply for which allowed me to pay for most of this. Hope that helps! Also, did you want to start another conversation or spend some more time with this one (Funding Your Future)? Thanks, Alisha Mentee 2023-04-25, 11:16: Thank you, that was really helpful! I feel like i have learned a lot about future funding and budgeting, i would like to start another converstation. :) Mentor 2023-04-28, 00:05: Hi Dakota, That sounds amazing! Did you have a different conversation in mind that you wanted me to open? Looking forward to hearing back, Alisha Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:52: Hi Alisha! I don't mind what conversation we start next. Finding inspiration or strategic studying probably. Mentor 2023-06-08, 12:21: Hi Dakota, It's Alisha here. I hope school is going great, as you finish up! I was wondering if you wanted to discuss the finding inspiration activity. Thanks, Alisha Mentee 2023-06-09, 10:34: Hey Alisha! Yes that would be great!",,,,,

My name is Parsa and I am currently attending the University of British Columbia, and seeking a bachelors degree in Microbiology and Immunology in the Faculty of Science. When I'm not at school, I love to play soccer and do kickboxing (something I've noticed that you like aswell). I love the outdoors as I was raised in North Vancouver, BC and my favourite outdoor acitivities include: nature photography, hiking and paddleboarding. Your turn! Here are some questions to get you started if you're stuck on what to share: - what are your favourite past times? - how is school and outside-of-school life in general? - do you have any pets? - what do you want to gain from this mentorship program? - anything else that you'd like to share!

A quick introduction about me: I'm a second-year SFU (Simon Fraser University) student majoring in history. I like to play games and I love ramen. Right now, I'm playing the new Destiny 2 expansion, Lightfall. I saw that you also like to play games, what have you been playing recently? My friends wanted to get into D&amp;D, but no one was really knowledgeable enough to start one so we never went through with it. Also, it's cool that you want to be a chef. I've taken some cooking classes during high school and it was really fun. Is there something you particularly like to cook? I want to keep this intro message short so - just choose anyone of the topics above that interest you and we can get started. Also, if you have any questions feel free to ask me anything.

1047583816,10/3/2022 14:13,1047593969,59525,,,"Mentor 2023-04-20, 12:19: Hi, again Emily! Here are my thoughts on anchor #1. We've touched on the topic of self-care in our previous discussion, so it's nice to talk about it a bit more! Some warning signs that we may need self-care can be things like low energy or feeling tired throughout the day, having no motivation, wanting to be alone and avoiding socializing, and being irritated quickly. I know I have definitely experienced some of these before. Some things that I enjoy that help me when I feel some of the things above are: like I said before, cooking/baking, watching TV, eating my favorite snacks, spending time with my family, being around friends, and listening to music. How about you? What are some warning signs for you, and what activities do you do that help you feel better? Do you have anything specific that you do to snap out of it when you are feeling low and not like yourself? Agam :) Mentee 2023-04-25, 11:21: Hi Agam! When I am feeling low, the biggest indicator for me that I need self-care is feeling very tired and like I can't make myself do anything. I will also often shut myself away in my room, avoiding all social interaction. I have a very difficult time getting myself out of a low mood, there isn't any one thing I can do to just snap out of it. But, some things that help are getting proper and more sleep, hanging out with my mom, and just letting myself not worry about any assignments. What mental health challenges should I be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what do you do to overcome them? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-04-28, 19:53: Hi Emily, Sorry for the late response! I just had my last final exam for the term today and I'm in the process of (partly) moving back home for the summer, so things have been a bit crazy! To answer your question, post-secondary and adulthood can be stressful, but I think the best tool is a great support system. There can be a lot of hurdles to overcome and sometimes you need to step out of your comfort zone. So I've always found it helpful to have a couple of people I can talk to and spend time with when I am not feeling my best or most confident. Responding to anchor 2 in this module, I would say there are definitely improvements that I could do to better my physical and mental self. One of those would be to get more sleep (this was halted because of my exams unfortunately), and add some more physical activity like going out for walks and hikes. How about you? What things do you think you could implement into your routine/life to boost your mental and physical health? Mentee 2023-05-02, 11:24: Hi Agam! It's alright! I hope your exam went well! I think a good support system is important while in high school too, I don't know what I would do without my mom. How much sleep do you usually get? Are you a morning person or night person? Things I could do to improve my self-care would also be better sleep and more physical activity. Especially the physical activity though, I've been trying to convince my mom to go to the gym with me (because I don't want to do it alone) But she won't really give me a concrete answer. In the meantime though, I could do home workouts in my room or go on bike rides. I can't see my sleep improving anytime soon, I'm a night owl through and through. I should also try eating healthier, to do this I should probably cook my own food instead of grabbing whatever is there and convenient. Do you have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-05-04, 15:35: Hi Emily, The exams went ok! I'm so glad it's over, I can finally relax (for a bit). I aim for 8 hours (but that doesn't always go to plan). I'm a night owl as well and love to stay up. During exam season and weekends, I tend to get less sleep. It's a tough habit to break, but I think consistency is key. If you try your best to sleep early, in the days after, it will be easier. In terms of breaking bad habits, I try to break down my habits into small goals that I'd like to improve on. That way things like eating healthy for example, don't seem too scary. For instance, I would aim to try to eat a healthy fruit for a snack every day or make a healthy breakfast, instead of completely doing a 180 from my current eating habits and cutting out all unhealthy food. It's all about small steps!! Let me know which module you would like to do next if you're ready. Agam Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:07: Hi Agam! I'm glad exams went ok! I haven't had to do an exam yet, so I can only imagine how stressful they are. I think sleeping more would be really helpful, I'm going to try setting an alarm to remind me to go to bed since I don't usually even realize how late I'm staying up. I'll do small steps and try maybe just an hour earlier. I'd like to do strategic studying next!",,,"Mentor 2023-06-13, 12:50: Hi Emily, After reading some of the information on this page, here are my thoughts for Anchor text 1: After searching up what qualifications/training I would need to become a doctor (specifically a general practitioner, aka a family doctor), I found that I would need a degree, specifically an MD, then residency to practice medicine in BC. I am attending and benefiting from post-secondary because: there is so much to learn, I have grown as an individual and become more independent, and I have gotten the opportunity to explore my chosen field in more detail (ex. in a hospital setting, to see if it would be a good fit for me). There are a lot of challenges in my journey into medicine, for example, admission into an MD program is very tough in Canada, there is a lot of schooling and hard work required, and I may have to move somewhere far away. These are all very daunting and scary to think about! I have mixed feelings about the education and experience I am required to do for medicine, because on one hand, I am excited, as it is my dream career. But on the other hand, it is a lot of work, and I know it'll be stressful. I think with the right attitude, motivation, and hard work, my career is achievable. I have already begun to take small steps to achieve it, and hope I can continue to make progress towards my goal. What is your path to the program, you wanted to pursue? Have you changed your mind throughout the way? Agam :) Mentee 2023-06-19, 16:12: Hi Agam! To become an Animator (Which is my ""dream job"") certificate programs and associate degree programs in animation are available, but most employers require that animators have at least a bachelor's degree. I would go for the bachelor's degree if I persue this career. For becoming a Veterinary Technician (Which is my more ""realistic job"") I would need a diploma in veterinary technology and to pass the Veterinary Technician National Examination. I would benefit from post-secondary because it'll give me a greater sense of life satisfaction and well-being, personal skills that can be used over a lifetime, such as making decisions, independence, and confidence, and it would give greater financial and employment security. Deciding to go to post-secondary is a huge commitment, especially getting a bachelor's degree as it takes longer. I would want to take a gap year, and deciding where to go for post-secondary would be difficult, especially if I would have to move away from home for it. I don't really know how I feel about the education I would need for my chosen careers. I think I would mostly just want to get it over with, but maybe once I actually got into school for animation I would start to enjoy it. For now it all just feels scary. I honestly don't think animation is very achievable for me, it's a big commitment going to school for it and I don't know if I'll ever be good enough for it in the first place. Being a vet tech on the other hand is more realistic and achievable, I don't need to already be skilled in that area as post-secondary would teach me everything, and I wouldn't have to go for as long. I don't really have a path in mind yet, I'm mostly just trying to survive high school, and my ideas for what i want to do with my life aren't completely concrete. How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do you have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-06-20, 11:40: Hi Emily, I agree that deciding on post-secondary is a big commitment, and a gap year is a great idea! It can help you determine your next step, so you don't feel like you're rushing into things. I'm sure once you meet people who are passionate about animating like you are, the work/classes will feel much better, because of the new support system. Also, I disagree! I think animation is definitely doable for you!! In terms of being good at school subjects, I think as long as you are passionate and willing to put effort into classes/work then you will do great! It won't really matter if you are naturally good at math for example. Practice can help you become better. Specifically talking about medical school, I think it involves more than just biology. It's really a blend of so many things like math, sociology, psychology, physics, chemistry etc. So even if biology is not your best topic, you can still pursue that goal. When I encounter difficult school subjects, I do my best to reach out to professors/teachers/friends for help. Sometimes, it is good to discuss what you are struggling with with someone. As well as doing practice like I mentioned, and remembering to not give up! Every good thing takes time :) Let me know what you think about anchor text 2! Agam Mentee 2023-06-21, 20:55: Hi Agam! When I think of factors that are most important to me when deciding on a school I think of: Location of the campus, Residence and housing options, and Part-time work opportunities. The schools that I've researched are Capilano University (for a 2D Animation and Visual Development Diploma) and Thompson Rivers University (for a Veterinary Technology Diploma). When I take those factors into account - Capilano University isn't too far, has student housing, and I don't know how to go about researching a part time job. Thompson Rivers University is a bit further away then I'd like, but they also offer online courses so that is an option, and it also has student housing. Does this research look accurate? What factors did you consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once you got there? I'm gonna try to upload a document to the portfolio with admission requirements. I think I could get into Capilano University but I'm not so sure about Thompson Rivers University, there's a lot that is required (not all of it I even understand). Do you have anything to add on the document? Do you have advice on gaining admission into my desired programs? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-06-24, 16:03: Hi Emily, I agree, all of those factors are quite important when deciding on a school. Personally, I would also choose housing options, the location of the campus, and the social climate. These factors ended up being quite important. I live on campus at UBC, so I understand the importance of finding the right place. After all, this will be your new home (for a while), so it was also important for me that the housing fit what I wanted. I also found extra-curricular turned out to be more important than I had initially thought because living on campus gives you a lot of free time. So, it's a good idea to get involved around the university, because it helps you make new friends, and meet people who are interested in things that you are. Those are both great options for schools, and it seems like they have the programs to help you achieve your goal of animation! I have not personally visited either of those schools, but I know a couple of people who have attended. For Capilano University, it looks like the main requirements include English 12 (with a 60%), and 2 other grade 12 courses, and a portfolio (of your animating/drawing/art work). For Thompson Rivers University, you would need English 12, math 11, and one of the sciences courses, plus chem 11 and life sciences 11 (aka bio usually) - (have you taken all of these in high school?). They also require you to do some sort of interview of a vet tech, submit a resume, and references. This seems like much more than Capilano requires, but I think it would be worth looking into if you are considering applying. I can do my best to help if you have questions about the requirements! I am not 100% sure what the application for Capilano looks like, but it's good to show the university that you are passionate about what you want to study there (for example in an essay if they ask for one). Unfortunately, most universities base admissions mostly on grades. However, there are still great programs/other universities that you can keep as back ups if you don't get your first pick. It's important to keep your options open. (although I have faith you will get in!!) Sorry if I have asked this before, but what grade are you in? That way, I can have an idea of where about you are in your university journey! So Sorry I wrote so much and made you read it all haha Agam Mentee 2023-06-27, 22:04: Hi Agam! What kind of extra-curricular do universities typically have (Like is it just the typical ""clubs"" and stuff that high school has)? What would they be looking for in a resume and references? What do they need the resume for? I'm in grade 10, so I have not yet taken any of the rquired courses. And no worries, I love reading what you have to say! I'm sorry that I've written so little in comparison! Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-06-30, 23:12: Hi Emily, Yes universities have soooo many extracurriculars. Everything from sports, arts, dance, charity organizations, pre-medical societies, and so much more. Universities usually ask for a resume to see what kind of experiences with work/volunteer/hobbies you have. I believe they just want an overall picture of what kinds of things you are involved in outside of school. References are usually teachers, managers for work/volunteering, or coaches etc. Basically, anyone who knows you fairly well and is in a 'higher position' to you. I hope that makes sense. Thats good! You have so much time to figure things out and think it over. Are you involved in any clubs/groups you enjoy at school/outside of school? Anything related to animation? I think it would be super cool to get involved somehow in that to see if you truly enjoy it, and learn from someone who is already in the field. Agam Mentee 2023-07-07, 02:52: Hi Agam! That makes sense! Can I just ask someone to be my reference? I am in the crochet club at school, but other than that I'm not involved in much. My school doesn't have a very wide variety of clubs, there is nothing to do with art/animation unfortunately, and I don't know of any groups outside of school for that but maybe I'll start looking for something. Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-07-07, 22:10: Hey Emily, Yes, you can talk to them/send them an email, explaining that you will be applying for ___, and require a reference, and have put their name down. That way, they can confirm that they are OK providing the reference for you. That's so cool! I've always wanted to learn how to crochet. Is it hard as a beginner? Yeah that sounds like a great plan! I believe the deadline for completing the required conversations was June 26 for your school. However, I am (obviously) very happy to continue our conversation/start a new topic/talk about anything else!! Please do let me know :) Agam Mentee 2023-07-13, 18:09: Hi Agam! Crocheting is not hard as a beginner! As long as you stick with simpler things at first, I believe anyone can learn how to do it easily! You should definitely give it a try. I think that's about all the topics I wanted to go over, and I honestly can't think of anything else I'd like to talk about. It has been an absolute pleasure talking with you! This all has been very helpful, I now have at least a bit more confidence in my future, and I know a little more of what to expect going forward! Thank you so much for being my mentor, Agam! Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-07-13, 20:52: Thanks Emily! It was so great talking to you as well, and I hope I helped! I wish you ALL the best in your future studies and anything else you set your mind on. You can do it! Agam Mentee 2023-07-16, 20:50: You were a great help! Thank you! Is there anything I have to do to officially wrap this up? Emily &lt;3","Mentor 2023-03-30, 20:12: Hi Emily! I hope you're doing well. I just watched the anchor 1 video, and had some thoughts: When I think about what inspires me, it's tough to pinpoint it. It could be so many different things at different points in my life when I am doing different things! I am inspired by the people around me, especially my parents, who have worked so hard to get us to where we are today. I'm inspired by my friends who push me to do better in school and get out more! And I'm inspired by nature when I want to be creative because it has so much to offer us. When I think about what I want in life, some of the things would be: to achieve my goal of becoming a doctor, live in a beautiful city (like Vancouver), have the freedom to travel the world and experience new things, a continued good relationship with my family, and a big garden in my house (I love plants). I chose these things because they inspire me to work harder and do better, and just overall be a better person. How about you? Where do you find inspiration to do what you do? - For school/work/hobbies/career. Let me know what you think, and please let me know if you have any questions at all. Agam Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:59: Hi Agam! I'm inspired by my parents, who always push me to be my kindest and best self, and to work hard in school. I'm inspired by my best friend and cousin who I feel I can be genuine around, she has this infectious energy that inspires me to just live life to the fullest and not stress too much. And I am especially inspired by artists of all kinds, those who draw, write, make music, take photos, etc. What I want most in life is to just be happy. I want to find a job I love, preferably something that would allow me to travel. I would want to travel the world, to take my family with me to share these new experiences with my most important people. I want to persue my creative hobbies and become better at art. (I can't really think of anything else right now) What keeps you motivated when you're not feeling your best in school? I struggle with perfectionism killing my motivation, so I was wondering if you had any tips! Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-04-06, 22:25: Hi Emily, It's really great to hear that you have such a great support system around you! I definitely understand the struggle with perfectionism and how it can be draining. For me, to keep myself motivated, I remember to take breaks! I think a lot of the time, we stress a lot and continue to study until we get burnt out, and have no motivation anymore. Whenever I feel myself slipping a bit, and not feeling my mental best, I shift my focus to something positive that I love to do. Sometimes that is grabbing some coffee/a snack, watching some tv, listening to music, or going on a walk. After that, I am able to get back to work with a fresh mind. I watched the anchor text 2 video and had some thoughts. Right now, my biggest goal is to do the best I can do in school, and take the MCAT in the summer to hopefully get into medical school. To set these goals into motion, I attempt to study my hardest every day and learn as much as I can in classes/volunteering/work. And of course, like I mentioned earlier, taking breaks to let my mental state recover. What kind of habits have you built? And how do those habits help you achieve your goals? Agam Mentee 2023-04-14, 10:23: Hi Agam! My biggest goal at the moment is also to do my best at school. To do well in school I really try hard to not fall behind with my assignments, this tends to happen as a procrastinate due to my perfectionism. What you have said about how you deal with feeling drained and unmotivated has made me realize, although I take breaks from work, I'm not actually giving my mind a break because I continue to stress about work when I should be relaxing. I guess that's why breaks haven't been much help. My new goal will be to try and work on that, so that I can feel better and therefore do better in school. In a way, my habit of being a perfectionist is also a good thing. It's stressful but it pushes me to do my best. If I learn to cope with it properly it could be very useful in the future. How do the goals and habits from when you were younger compare to the ones you have now? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-04-16, 11:35: Hi Emily, I completely understand the struggle with procrastinating. It really happens to the best of us! Definitely, I think breaks are only helpful if they are proper breaks, where you give your mind and body a rest. When stressed about something, it can be tough to get your mind off it. For me, I find that 'doing two things at once' really helps. For example, I'll do some baking, and listen to music at the same time. That's a really interesting question! My goals and habits when I was younger revolved a lot around being with my friends, exploring, having fun etc. Now, I still really love to do all those things, but it's changed a bit to put more emphasis on myself. That means, taking care of myself, surrounding myself with people who make me feel good, and doing things that I love like volunteering. I hope that makes sense!! Also, do let me know which discussion you would like to get into next (if you are ready to move on). Hope you had a good weekend :) Agam","Mentor 2023-05-20, 16:17: Hi Emily, Choosing a career can be so tough! And it's something to really look within you to decide. Personally, I value helping others in any way I can, creativity, kindness, and compassion. I want to contribute to the community and the world in a way that is meaningful and helpful to others. This is why I have decided on medical school and the career of becoming a doctor. I believe that I can show my compassion and empathy in the best way as a doctor. I can help others in need and do my best to make my community a better, healthier place. Considering my values, what other careers do you think would be a good fit for me? How about your values and your career choices? Agam :) Mentee 2023-05-24, 11:28: Hi Agam! I value creativity and just being a positive, kind, open-minded person a lot. I've always loved just making things, and I love sharing it with others in hopes to lift their mood or entertain them in some way. Being able to share something amazing that I have made or helped make with the world would be a dream come true, and that is why I would love a career in animation. I want people to look at what I helped create and just feel happy. I think another career that would fit you would be a counsellor or therapist. It's along the same lines as being a doctor, just with mental health instead of physical. Kindness and compassion are definitely things you need to have for this career. What other careers do you think would fit me well? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-05-26, 10:30: Hi Emily, It's great to hear you have a career goal in mind, and I think animation would definitely suit the values that you have mentioned. I also believe other jobs involving creativity would be a good fit for you. Things like graphic designers, interior designers, artists, and a writer (something different from visual arts)! Anchor text 2: If I think about the job I have chosen, doctor, I definitely have a strong personal interest in it. I have worked/volunteered in a hospital setting before, and I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. But, I am not sure if this job would allow me to have the work/life balance I want, but I think it is still achievable, just harder. I would have financial security and job security. This job could take me to other places, especially during medical school, where I may have to relocate. How about you Emily? do you think your chosen career path would meet all of the considerations? If not, how would you fix/change that? Agam Mentee 2023-06-06, 11:04: Hi Agam! I have a strong interest in animation, though I haven't actually animated anything yet, I do know I enjoy art and love watching the animation process. For work/life balance working in animation can be very flexible, the hours you work and the projects you work on can vary greatly, so if I'm careful I think I could generally have a good work/life balance. The animation industry has been growing, there is lots work for animators to choose to do and I could make sure to choose work that pays well enough, so I think this career offers good financial and job security. This job would allow me to work from home so I wouldn't have to move anywhere. Were you ever considering a different career? If yes, why did you change your mind? (Could we do post-secondary &amp; career planning next?) Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-06-13, 12:41: Hi Emily, So sorry for the late response! I agree, I think animation would be an excellent fit for you, considering your interests and requirements for a job. I have never considered a different career, although it has crossed my mind because medicine is tough! Anyways, I will open up the next topic for us! Agam","Mentor 2023-05-10, 20:35: Hi Emily, Sorry for the delayed response! I was on vacation earlier this week and did not go on my laptop. I really liked two of the study strategies in the video: spaced practice and words + visuals. I like to space out my studying and practicing, as I have also found this to be way more helpful than cramming. For example, I start studying for midterms or final exams ~1 week before. I am also a visual learner, so it's super helpful for me to not only read but relate that reading to pictures/diagrams/flowcharts. That way, I am able to organize what the text is saying into something that makes sense to me, and that I can see visually in front of me. Do you have any strategies you use for studying and preparing for your exams? Agam Mentee 2023-05-17, 10:47: Hi Agam! I hope vacation was fun! What did you do? I liked the spaced practice strategy the most, even though it is the complete opposite of what I usually do. I tend to cram really hard the day before or day of a test. I tend to do fine on tests regardless, but I am curious how big a difference trying the spaced study strategy would make. I think I am also a visual learner? I like to learn by watching other people doing a thing. So maybe words + visuals would work well for me as well. How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and did it change how you had to study? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-05-18, 21:54: Hi Emily :) I actually went on a mini getaway to Penticton and spent the days by the lake. It was very relaxing, and a nice break from school. Post-secondary classes are much more independent. This means teachers won't follow up with you on assignments/homework/readings. So you really have to stay organized, because, at the end of the day, it's on you to complete and submit things before deadlines. Content itself is also harder, so finding a good study strategy, and a good group of friends in that class is really helpful. I had to figure this out in my first year as well, and it took me a while! I also had to become a lot more organized with deadlines and important dates. Let me know which conversation you would like to move on to next. I think this will be our last (required) conversation, but I am of course happy to talk more!! Agam Mentee 2023-05-19, 10:05: Hi Agam! That sounds really nice! I can't wait for summer vacation, I'm really just trying to power through the last few weeks of school. Post-secondary is such an intimidating thing to think about. I already struggle with deadlines and am often handing things in late, do post- secondary teachers allow late assignments or are they stricter? I would like to move on to career exploration. I would also be happy to talk more! Maybe one more after this last required one? Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-05-20, 16:12: Hi Emily, Unfortunately, deadlines are something that I have found professors strict with unless there is some sort of extenuating circumstance. But, I believe in you! You can do it! Great!! I'll open up career exploration. Agam",,"Mentor 2023-03-05, 20:00: Hi Emily! It's great to meet you! As you've probably read from my profile, my name is Agam and I'll be your mentor. I'm super excited to get to know you and work through the interesting topics throughout the course. I've lived in an urban city for most of my life (Vancouver) and I am attending UBC for my bachelor's in biology, so I'm excited to share my experiences with you and learn about your goals as well. I can definitely help with transitions to a big city, as I moved out of a smaller town into Vancouver when I started attending UBC as a first-year student. It's great to hear that you've made up your mind about what you would like to do in the future! I think animating/psychology/working with animals are all really interesting and great fields to go into. I also really enjoy art, mostly painting, and digital art. What kind of art do you like to do? Your teacher has mentioned that we need to complete 4 conversations, of your choosing. Do you have any that speak out to you? Please let me know if you have any questions so far about the course, I look forward to hearing back from you! Agam Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:51: Hi Agam! It's nice to meet you as well! I'm honestly nervous about this, but I hope to get to know you better and have fun with this course. Painting and graphite art are my faves and I'm wanting to get into digital! If you are comfortable, I would like to see some of your art! No pressure though! I would like to start with the finding inspiration first and then strategic studying. I just want to let you know that spring break is coming up next week and I will not be available during that time. Sincerely, Emily &lt;3 Mentor 2023-03-09, 14:11: Hi Emily, Aw yes, I hope I can make this course as fun as possible. I'll attach one of my digital drawings I did a while back - If I can figure out how to. Let me know if you can't see it. Yes, no problem, let me know when you are back from spring break, and we can get started on 'finding inspiration So great to hear from you! And have a super fun spring break! Agam Mentor 2023-03-09, 14:13:  Mentee 2023-03-28, 10:39: Hey Agam, I'm back from spring break! And it was a great one, I managed to convince my parents to let me get a kitten! Also, yes I can see the drawing. It's very good, that's Will Smith right? Emily Mentor 2023-03-28, 18:07: Hi Emily, I'm glad you had a good spring break! A kitten! That's so exciting. I have been trying to convince my parents to get a dog, but no luck so far. Yes! It's Will Smith - I loved the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air show! By the way, I will open up the 'finding inspiration' activity soon, and we can begin. Agam :) Mentee 2023-04-17, 15:53: Hi Agam! Doing two things at once really does work! Recently, I've been getting into crocheting, and I've found that doing that while listening to music or a podcast is a great way to take my mind off things. That totally makes sense! I think I've always put more emphasis on myself, and only recently (Since I've surrounded myself with better people) I've been trying to make more time for friends. I'd like to move on to 'Well being &amp; self care' Emily &lt;3 Mentee 2023-05-10, 20:03:  Mentor 2023-07-18, 00:04: Hi Emily, No, I think we're all good. Have a great summer! Agam :)",,,,,

But i'll answer the disscussion questions, 5 things in i want in life. I mostly just want to play in europe for a high skilled club in football(soccer but i call it football),because its been a dream of mine since i was little, i moved to a small town sadly so i don't have much of a chance to show my talent, but its ok i guess. I'd also like to have a decent job atleast one with decent pay. and i would like to also be with my gf, and grow up in life with her. a decent house and make my parents proud atleast. its not much i guess. and pretty matirealistic, but i don' t have much plans. i wanted to become a vet or biologist. still do, but i mean its kinda hard. But my real main goal was to become a professinal footballer. But its a little hard to show that, so in general i just want all of those things to atleast be something in life i guess, im not too sure myself. my question to you Amrit is what keeps you motivated to do certain things? what keeps you going ? Mentor 2023-04-04, 18:01: Hi Isaac! No problem, I hope you are feeling better now. After reading what you want in life, your passion for soccer caught my attention. I have been playing soccer since the age of 7 and I still continue to play. I hope you reach your dream of playing in Europe one day. What is your favourite team? Mine is Manchester United. Some things that keep me going especially in school is asking myself why I want to work in healthcare. For me when working/volunteering with patients it inspires me and wants me to keep pushing so I can be there for these people. Also, my parents were immigrants from India and seeing them struggle so I can get an education really pushes me to give my best effort. I want to make my family and friends proud and this really motivates to keep me going. Most of all I want to look back in 10-20 years from now and be able to say that I gave it my all and have no regrets. These are some of the things that keep me motivated. Mentor 2023-04-12, 22:59: Hi Isaac, I just wanted to check in with you and wanted to ask how is the second discussion question going. If you need any assistance, you can always send me a message. Sincerely, Amrit Mentee 2023-04-13, 10:22: Hey Armit, my favourite football team is the tottenham and Bayern munich, i also met alphonso davies before so i'm just biased to bayern. I watched the video and I think that it is smart to set smaller goals to get to your main goal so when you fail at reaching your main goal you don’t feel as bad. I have never thought of that and I wish I had. I am about to turn 16 and I want to start saving up for a vehicle. How I would reach that goal is I would set a limit on how much money I am aloud to spend each week or each month and if I go over that limit I would not spend any money for 2 weeks or 1 month for example. The question I have for you is ""What habits have you built, and how did these habits helped you achieve your goals?"" Mentor 2023-04-14, 19:54: Hi Isaac, that is a great question. Some of the habits I built during my undergrad was to spend atleast 30 mins after each of my lectures reviewing the material and spending atleast 45 mins each day exercising whether it be weight training or playing sports. I stayed with these habits because I wanted to do well in my classes while also taking care of my health. Building these habits were really important for me reaching my goals. If I did not have these habits in place, I would have struggled. These habits helped me reach my goals because I slowly worked on improving myself. I worked diligently each day and over the years this really made a big difference. I was able to do really well in school and able to take care of my health. I believe being consistent with your habits is essential. Mentor 2023-04-14, 19:57: Hi Isaac, what conversation would you like to work on next?",,,,"Mentor 2023-03-01, 23:29: Hi Isaac, My name is Amrit and I look forward to working with you!

Mentee 2023-03-07, 10:49: Hi my names Isaac, its nice to meet you Amrit. this semester i wold like to start with finding inspirtation, also a heads up im going to be on spring break for the next 2 weeks starting friday, so thats my bad if i dont answer. Mentor 2023-03-24, 23:39: Hi Isaac, I know you have been on spring break and was notified you will not reply as often. I have opened up ""finding inspiration"" so you can work on that whenever you have time. If you have any questions, I am happy to answer.

Same protocol as last time, watch the video then do the discussion question. I watched the first video, I loved that they are encorporating the world views of indigenous people into scientifc research. Interesting to think how that might lead to new discoveries. Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:02: Hey Kodie I just watched the first video i think that it would be super difficult to go and live there then to just go and study it. My question for you is ""what is your connection to the land you live on?"" Mentor 2023-05-08, 15:03: Hey Kaiden, Thats a great point, the difficulty of actually living there is probably much higher than just going temporarily. I think I have a deep and healthy connection with the land I live on. Growing up in BC and its natural envrionment shaped my interests and values. A lot of what I do in my free time is connected to going outside and being in nature or interacting with it. Can't wait to hear your thoughts on the second video! Mentee 2023-05-12, 10:22: Hey Kodie I just watched the second video and I was surprised that indiginous people created lacrosse, and the baby carrier that they used was also pretty cool. For the question for you I chose ""Which of the Seven Teachings have they struggled with, and what have they done to improve in this area?"" Mentor 2023-05-16, 00:08: Hi Kaiden, Definitely alot of interesting indigenous inventions! One of the seven teaching I have struggled with is courage. I've always been nervous and lacked courage when it comes to things like interviewing, new jobs, new schools or just talking to people in general. To improve in that area I have always just thrown myself into those situations where I am the most uncomfortable. I realize the worst thing that can happen is a bit of awkwardness but in the end it usually works out. I think forcing myself into those situations more often where I am out of my comfort zone has helped me grow courage for the next time I have to be in those situations. Unless you want to do the extension activity, which discussion topic would you like to move on to next?",,,,"Mentor 2023-05-20, 15:42: Hey Kaiden, It looks like this activity is under construction... The links take me to the same videos as the last activity we did. I guess we will have to do a different one! Which one do you want to try?",,"Mentor 2023-03-07, 12:53: Ok so it lists the activities we do to complete this activity under ""Conversation Activities."" Once you have completed the required viewings and had a look at the discussion questions you can type in your responses here. If you have any questions or get stuck, ask anytime. I am not sure if your teacher wants us to do the optional extension activities as well, but if you would like to do them just let me know. I will post my response to the first activity soon! Mentor 2023-03-18, 16:42: Hey Kaiden, I just watched the first video. It was intresting seeing how the filmmakers found insipration but honestly, I can't relate too much because I am not a very artistic person. For me I find inspiration in less artistic things like spending time with friends and family or getting outside to go camping and fishing. Mentor 2023-03-29, 13:21: Awesome! Thanks for sharing your thoughts and no worries about the response time. Before we move onto the second video there should be a big box under the first video that says ""discussion questions."" If you click on that it will give you a few questions to respond to. I think for the first one you have to list here five things you want and why. It also lists some questions and you have to choose one to ask me. Let me know if you can't find it. Mentor 2023-03-30, 13:12: It's cool that a lot of your goals are geared towards caring for and helping others. I like how you want to be good with vehicles to help friends and family. I've always wanted to be good with repairing cars but mostly for selfish reasons, I had never thought about it in a helping way. What inspired me intially was my older sister. She was pursuing law school when I was really young and seeing what she was doing interested me. Later on I realized law school was kind of hard but I knew that it would provide me a good way to make money and have good living. I prefer things like camping, cars, and sports but I wanted to be able to do/own those things in the future without having to worry about money too much. That goal is what inspired me and motivates me to continue pursuing the path I am on. Mentor 2023-04-06, 07:18: Yeah, older siblings are always inspiring! I think we can move on to the seond video. Whenever you have time to watch it, share your thoughts and jump into some of the discussion questions. Mentor 2023-04-06, 07:18: Yeah, older siblings are always inspiring! I think we can move on to the seond video. Whenever you have time to watch it, share your thoughts and jump into some of the discussion questions. Mentee 2023-04-11, 11:12: Hey Kodie sorry for not responding I was catching up in other classes and then I was camping up in Tahsis for the long weekend. I watched the video and I think that it is smart to set smaller goals to get to your main goal so when you fail at reaching your main goal you don't feel as bad. I have never thought of that and I wish I had. I am about to turn 16 and I want to start saving up for a vehicle. For my first vehicle I want a old Ford Ranger so I can go in the bush with friends and go camping and not care to much about getting a scratch or little dent on the side of a old beat up truck. How I would reach that goal is I would set a limit on how much money I am aloud to spend each week or each month and if I go over that limit I would not spend any money for 2 weeks or 1 month for example. The question I have for you is ""What habits have you built, and how did these habits helped you achieve your goals?"" Mentor 2023-04-12, 12:31: Hey Kaiden, I have never been to Tahsis, how was it? That's funny, I was just talking to someone about how cool a small old pick up like a Ford Ranger would be. So convenient to just toss stuff in the bed and go. I think that's a great plan to reach your goal! When I was younger I did something similar, I would take like 20% of every paycheck and save it towards something I wanted. Some habits that I have built is always planning out how I am going to reach my goal on a calender. For example if I am working on a paper due in a month I would write ""finish introduction"" by the end of a certain week. I also always plan exceptions to my goal, kind of like a cheat day when you're on a diet. So for your goal I might set a week where I am allowed to spend more money than usual on something to treat myself. I think if you don't make exceptions its easy to feel burned out and give up on your plan. I think we have finished all the required parts of this topic, unless you wanted to do the optional ones. If not, is there another topic you'd prefer to do next?",,,"Mentor 2023-06-01, 09:30: Hey Kaiden, No videos for this one, just have to read some short articles and do the discussion questions. I have had a bit of experience with bursaries and loans for school so I hope I will be able to provide some insight. Mentor 2023-06-19, 11:42: Hey Kaiden, Just wanted to check in how thigns are going since I haven't heard from you in a while! I heard this project got extended for you guys. I opened the funding your future module so whenever you have time have a look at the articles and discussion questions. If you would rather do another module let me know :)","Mentor 2023-03-01, 23:39: Hey Kaiden, how is the school year going so far? I saw on your profile you like fishing, what do you usually fish for up in Port Alberni? Let me know if you see a conversation topic that you're interested in starting and I can open it up for us. If you have any questions about the program, school, jobs, or anything else, feel free to ask at any point. Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:16: Hi Kodie, my name is Kaiden and schools going pretty good so far. I fish for salmon and coho up here. I would like to start with finding insperation if thats all good. Mentor 2023-03-07, 12:46: Hi Kaiden, cool I bet the salmon fishing up there is a lot better than in the lower mainland. Sounds good, I will open up the finding inspiration topic and give you a quick rundown. Mentee 2023-03-28, 11:29: Hi Kodie, sorry for not responding sooner I was on springbreak. I have just finnished watching the first video and I think its kind of cool how they found insperation, and how you said that you arnt a very artistic person and I am the exact same I like going outside and haning out with friends and family. Mentee 2023-03-30, 11:31: Yeah I had a question for you I guess i forgot to type it out. The question I wanted to ask you was ""what inspired you to start down the path you are on now?"". For the five things I want in life is, a dirtbike to go riding in the bush with friends and family. When I'm older I want to have a decent piece of land so I can build a shop and have room for my stuff that I dont use often and it wont get in the way. I also want to be good with vehicles so if there is somethig wrong with mine, friends or famillies vehicle I can possibly fix it. I want to have a good job so I can feed and shelter my family. I want to be able to let my kids do sports and activities that they want to do and be able to pay for it. Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:27: Thats cool you have a older sister that you looked up to, I am the oldest in my family and have two younger brothers who are always trying to do what I do.

Thanks, Tommy Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:31: answers.docx What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them? -leeam Mentee 2023-05-08, 11:00: answer 2.doc is there anything i should add? Mentor 2023-05-10, 14:49: Hi Leeam, Great job completing the discussion questions! It seems like you have quite a realistic idea of what you will need to do to become a carpenter in the future! As long as you keep your grades up and are passionate about the field, I think it will be a very obtainable and exciting option for you. To answer your question, the main challenge I faced in pursuing my post-secondary education was moving away from home! At the beginning of my first year of university I found it very challenging to get comfortable living away from my family back home. However, once I started to meet new people and became engaged in my community, I had a much easier time living in my new environment. In the future, if you find yourself living away from home for school, I would suggest meeting new friends and regularly talking to your family members to become more comfortable with your new living situation! Now you can go ahead and complete the extension activity - let me know if you have any questions! Tommy Mentee 2023-05-16, 10:17: about the changes in the article of the extension activity they are nothing i wont be able to get used to actually they may not be of major issue for the reason i decided collage or a trades school, they are best for me and i am also not great at using my head all day and when you entered post secondary what was it like was there a big change? -leeam Mentor 2023-05-18, 20:36: Hi Leeam, Good job sharing your thoughts about the extension activity. I think it is great that you are open to the change that might come with your trades schooling in the future. To answer your question, post-secondary was filled with life changes that were usually unsettling at first and sometimes took me out of my comfort zone. However, I had several friends from high school who went to the same university, and I also ended up forming several friendships that I was able to lean on during times of change. Great work on this post-secondary and career planning module! We will now move on to the next conversation. Tommy Mentor 2023-05-18, 20:39: Hi Leeam, We have two more conversations to complete before the end of your school term - which two activities would you like to do? Once you have selected two I will open one of the conversations. Have a great weekend! Tommy",,"Mentor 2023-03-31, 09:00: Hi Leeam, I have opened the career exploration module - please watch the first two videos and then answer the discussion questions underneath. I am interested to hear about the things you value most in life and the impact you want to make in your community in the future! Let me know if you have questions about what careers might be best suited for you and your interests, or if there's anything else I can help you with! All the best, Tommy Mentee 2023-04-04, 10:29: SHARE: with your mentor your responses to ALL of the following prompts: • What do you value in life?- all i value in life are animals(not all but most), i also value a natural world, • How do you want to contribute to your community and the world?- specifically id like to contribute one day a full comany and then what id like is to live in a cabin in the woods undisterbed. • Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? to be master craftsmen specifically in the wood work area but i am taking other craftsmen classes like metalshop. disscusion questions 1 for the selected propt Mentee 2023-04-04, 10:47: SHARE: Choose one of the careers from your quiz results or one you considered in the last anchor text*, and share your answers to each of the questions below. • Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of work? Developing the skills needed for a career takes time and dedication. yes the work i am intrested in is what i want to do i dont have a reason why, i chose it simply because i want to do it (response)..– so if you follow a career path because someone else wants it for you, or because you heard it pays well, you may not have the passion you will need to persevere. • Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? On average, you want to be able to balance satisfying work with opportunities for social connection, creative and physical activity, and simply enjoying your life.(response) personally i like to work to finish the job which means hourly pay means nothing to me, if anything as long as i always work 100% ill be happy and as long as i get weekend im fine. • Will this career offer me financial security? Although there needs to be more to career choice than money, at the end of the day, you will need to be able to pay your bills with the salary you can earn from your chosen career. • How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? Job security refers to the likelihood that there will be jobs available in this career area – now and for the foreseeable future.yeah with carpentry the lowest pay is roughly 53000$ a year so as lonjg as i have 1 roommate things should be fine i just gotta make sure i budget right.You will need to think about – and research! – whether there is a current and future need for the work you want to do. • Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Some career paths will require you to relocate, others will allow you to return to “home” to work. It’s important to think about how location will factor into career decisions.(response) see when your a carpenter making houseing as long as there is any homlessness or rich people wanting a new house the market shouldnt decline for awhile and when it dose i plan to be living in a cabin by the time that happens. Mentor 2023-04-06, 20:18: Hi Leeam, Great job working through the career exploration material! I am very glad to hear that you hope to be a carpenter/craftsman simply because it is what you enjoy and are interested in! While it might be hard work, I think it is a profession that offers a healthy work-life balance and it will always be in demand, as the need for houses will likely never run out! Also, this is a great career to choose in terms of location, as you can be a carpenter in virtually any town or city, as long as there are enough people around. Do you have any questions for me? If not, feel free to move on to the extension activity below the second anchor text! Have a great weekend, Tommy Mentee 2023-04-28, 09:54: i have my career inter veiw questions ill be putting them here which career were you most intrested in? response: forestry whats the average amount of time to earn a red seal? many courses, 2 yrs apprenticship,and challenging the red seal are there any tips for those who want to get int that trade today? a recognized provincal trade program and working for a red seal carpentar whats your tool prefrence in terms of durability and lasting years? 1 is genral in terms of machinery 2 is makita in terms of hand tools if you were to what would you pick for a career today? 1 is coffe in terms of a quick startup and cash 2 is custom furniture designer/maker in terms of money and passion this was my interveiw Mentor 2023-04-30, 11:20: Hi Leeam, Good job completing the interview!

Tommy Mentee 2023-06-14, 10:09: bursery and shcolarships for ementror.docx here is the desired work listing 3 scholorships i could apply for and how did you fund your education? -leeam Mentee 2023-06-14, 10:31: 4299_Budgeting_Activity.docx here is the completed worksheet and how did you keep track of your spending and payment dates? Mentor 2023-06-16, 16:54: Hi Leeam, Great job on your activities! I think the three scholarships you have identified are very obtainable choices, especially the one titled ""Future in a Construction Career,"" as it aligns with your desired career field very well! The requirements for them do not seem very excessive, and you should therefore have a strong chance of being awarded one of them if you put in some good work! Mentor 2023-06-16, 17:00: For your budgeting activity, I think you were quite realistic in identifying your potential expenses and income amounts. I think you might be able to save an extra $100 per month on utilities if you cut down on your water and heating use. Also, I bet you would be able to find a cheaper phone plan per month, though this depends on the amount of data usage you want. Otherwise, everything looks very reasonable, and it is great that you will have some savings at the end of the year! Good job completing this module! We are now finished all of your requirements. Is there anything else you would like to do or any questions you want to ask? Mentor 2023-06-16, 17:04: Additionally, I forgot to answer your questions. In terms of funding my education, I was lucky enough to have my parents help me out with much of the tuition costs, but I was also able to earn enough scholarships to cover about one year of my tuition, which was a big help! For spending and payment dates, I typically just used my online banking apps to track my spending and credit card payment due dates, as these applications keep track of these charges and display them quite clearly. However, I would encourage you to construct an excel sheet to keep track of your expenses once you begin college or post-secondary - there are lots of online templates. Tommy","Mentor 2023-03-04, 20:49: Hi Ieeam! I am Tommy and I will be your mentor for this semester.

I think it looks good overall and I only have two suggestions for you. Under the skills section in your actual resume, I would add the five skills that you listed in your ""q for getting hired document"". Your resume will look more substantial if you add those five skill sections (communication, tech, team, etc.) and your potential employer will be able to get an idea of your skills more easily! Secondly, I would align your resume sections to the left side of the page (I am guessing you know how to do this but if you do not, look up ""text alignment"" in the Word search bar at the top of the document and the option ""Align Left"" will appear). Be sure to complete these minor changes and send me your revised resume! After you have done that, feel free to watch the video under Anchor Text 2 and complete the discussion questions. Do not worry about the extension activity for now. Let me know if you have questions and good work on the first activity!

My feelings played no part in this I am only nervous about things, not doing things unless I can likely be injured or hurt. My interview strengths lay in my conversation, the way I am dressed and my somewhat quick response. If I had to improve upon something it would be overall the way I talk, its currently fine but I am not great at dealing with all people and the way I talk doesn’t cater to all types of people and my second is probably looking them in the eyes. Mentor 2023-06-07, 17:20: Hi Leeam, Thank you for updating your resume! In response to your interview discussion question, I have had many similar experiences to your first interview. Often times there are many candidates trying to get the same job that you're applying for and even if you answer the interviewer's questions to the best of your ability, you still may not get the job. But that is OK! Sometimes you have to go through multiple different interviews to get a job that you want, but eventually you will come across an employer that really likes you as a person and appreciates your prior experience and attributes! Having to go through multiple interviews is also great career practice and will make you more comfortable with them in the future. If one or two do not go your way, don't give up! Things will always work out in the end. Mentor 2023-06-07, 17:25: Great job completing the extension activity as well! It sounds like you have great overall interview skills but might benefit from looking the interviewer in the eyes more frequently. I think this is a great point to work on in the future! Maintaining eye contact with the person will help them to trust you, and you will also come off as more genuine. But it sounds like everything else you are doing is great! Keep up the good work in the future, and remember to prepare some responses to a few potential questions before going into the interview. Mentor 2023-06-07, 17:27: Now that you have completed the activities from this module, we can move on to your last one. Which conversation would you like to do for your final one? Let me know and I will get it started. Have a great rest of your week!

I have started the module, and the two careers that I'm looking at are therapy and forensic psychology, both of which require a doctorate in psychology. UBC would be a good fit for me because of its relatively short distance from home, my interest in psychology, and its life experience. I think I would prefer to go to the Okanagan campus,but it is only a slight preference. Some things that may get in the way of pursuing these careers could be the cost of university, the length of obtaining the doctorate, or a gap year between high school and post-secondary. Though it will be long, I am looking forward to learning more about psychology. I have an interest in the topic, so I doubt it will drag on as much as some other subjects would. I think both careers in therapy and forensic psychology are achievable for me, as I am confident in my interests and capabilities. Two other questions I've been wondering about are:How hard was it to get used to being away from home? And did you take a gap year? Thanks again, Ryder. Mentor 2023-04-16, 17:03: Hi Ryder, sorry for the delay. I was just logging in to ask how you are doing as I havnt heard from you in a while. I sent you a big message about two weeks ago but I cant find it anywhere so I guess it never went through. Sorry about that not sure what happened. Anyways, the gist of it was that for big degrees like a Doctorates or Masters, that is a good end goal, but consider your pathway on the way there. Usually people get a diploma or associates degree first, then use that as the foundation for a bachelors degree, then use that as the foundation for a Masters, etc etc.... Each degree (associates &gt; bachelors &gt; masters &gt; doctorates is another two years on top of the one before. You mentioned the cost being a possible barrier. you can always take a look at local colleges to start with your associates degree, and some may even offer a bachelor for your program. it would depend on each instittution. Psyc is pretty versatile and a common program, most colleges should offer a Bachelors or at least an associates. Regarding a gap year, I would recommend a gap semester if possible, if you would like some time off but not an entire year. the reason I say that is because after an entire year people are generally much more likely to just get comfortable and not bother with their post-secondary education, or tell themselves ""ill apply soon"" but never actually get around to it. I took a gap semester myself, and went to Australia after high school before starting college. This also got me used to living away from home, which I did not mind much to be honest. But everyones different. I will say once you realize everyone else is also getting used to being away from home things get a lot less stressful. Sorry again about the delay! Dane",,,"Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:17: Hi Dane, over the past week or so I've been keeping track of some of my study habits. Though I didn't study that much, before tests I felt that going through notes was less helpful than practicing questions themselves. I usually study in my free time during classes. Also, spacing and breaks helped a lot with really understanding the subject without it dragging on. The little things go a long way for me when it comes to studying. Do you have any extra tips for building a habit for consistent studying? Thanks a lot, Ryder Mentor 2023-05-07, 12:07: I always find practice questions helps with skill based questions like math or chemistry. Either you know how to apply and use the equation, or you dont. Going through your notes can only help so much, and this is kind of the 'laziest' way to study since you are not doing anything other than reading. When I know I have some major studying to do, I'll often condense my notes into all the main points, and condense that into a page of keywords. If I can go down the list of keywords and recall the rest of the note, I am set. This is easy for fill in the blank or true/false, but for long answer essay questions I like to have some sort of outline prepared. I'd say the best tip is know when you need to study. You should have a good understanding of your own knowledge, and if an exam is coming up and you know you dont have a good understanding of the material, you have some work to do. Mentor 2023-05-16, 16:51: Hi Ryder, just following up as I havnt heard from you in a while. All ok?",,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 13:34: Hello Ryder good to meet you. I'm Dane and im working on completing my BA of Crim at Douglas College. 5 more classes and I will be finished :). Ive been at Douglas for 5 years; I started off doing an Associate of Science but changed my mind and switched into crim. I really love it and have been working on the Bachelors degree. After that I'd like to go into crime analysis. I'm looking forward to getting to know you Mentee 2023-03-08, 10:39: Hello Dane, Im looking forward to getting to learn about and from you! I'll have to look into crime analysis as it sounds pretty interesting. My teacher has asked me to tell you my first choices for the conversations wheel. The ones that stick out to me are post-secondary &amp; career planning, finding an inspiration, and career exploration. If there is any other information you need be sure to let me know. Just so you are aware we are on spring break starting saturday the 11th and I believe we are back to class on the 26th. Thanks again, Ryder. Mentor 2023-03-28, 12:04: I've been well thanks, there is no 'spring break' for us college students :( You are right that a PhD (Doctorates / Doctor of Philosophy) is the end goal of your post secondary studies, but remember the degree 'tiers'. You start with a diploma or Associates degree which takes two years to achieve. Then you use that as the 'first half' of a Bachelors degree, which is a four year program but you would have already done the first half of it. These are known as 'Undergrad' degrees simply because the are below the 'graduate' level (Masters degree or Doctorates). Im not too sure which institutions offer MA/PhD Psychology graduate programs, but that must be one of the most common graduate programs and therefore likely to be offered at most institutions. Sure UBC/UBCO is one of them. The Masters degree takes your 4 year Bachelors, and again you do another two years. the PhD is the same way -- adds another two years. Fun fact 'PhD' means 'Doctor of Philosophy'. if you think about it, philosophy is just thinking about stuff, so it makes sense most for most areas of academia to result in a PhD degree. But there are are actually a bunch of Doctorates degrees you can get. See for yourself: https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/list-of-doctorate-degrees/ As an example, the doctors in hospitals are stuff call themselves 'Doctors' because they have a 'Doctor of Medicine' degree. That is why they will have 'M.D.' behind their name on their business cards. the term doctor is just a shortening of this credential. The 'proper' name would be physician, so as not to confuse with the many other types of Doctors. Meaning, it is appropriate to adress anyone with a doctorates degree as 'Doctor' not just those with a MD. Many of my professors have a doctorares in sociology, psychology or law, and I address them as Doctor. Anyways, there is no real issue with taking a gap year. But, this leads to laziness and sometimes people take a gap year but never go back to school. I would recommend instead taking a gap semester, if you want some time off. Thats what I did, and went travelling before I started my studies. This also helped me get used to being away from home, which I didnt really mind. It takes a little bit to get settled in, but once you realize everyone else is in the same situation as you, it gets pretty easy. You mentioned the cost also being a potential barrier. Since the Ass/Ba/Ma/Doc degrees are just a step up from one another, you can do a lower degree at a cheaper institution and transfer later on. I'm doing my entire undergrad at Douglas College, and pay $350ish per class. If I do a grad program down the line, it would be at UBC, Thompson River, or UVic as those are the institutions that offer graduate law programs. Classes there are likely double or triple the cost of what I pay here at Douglas. I would recommend looking for colleges nearby that offer Associate or Bacehelors of Psychology. Accomplishing that is a great foundation and you can probably even start looking for clinical psychology jobs then. Once you have some experience under your belt, and are ready to move on, the Masters/PhD are the next step. Mentee 2023-04-25, 10:24: Hello Dane, it seems I've done the same thing so sorry for the delay. Thank you for the message, I didn't know that you could start a degree locally then move to a new campus to continue it. A gap semester does sound like a good idea for me as I feel that I could get lazy as you said. All put together I'm starting to get a more clear plan in my head now thank you. Moving foreward, I'm thinking of looking at the strategic studying module because I need some better study habits. Let me know if you have any more suggestions. Sorry for the delay. Ryder Mentor 2023-04-26, 22:02: One good resource to use when looking at classes and programs is the BC Transfer Guide: https://www.bctransferguide.ca/. It will tell you if a class you are taking in a diploma or associate degree at a local college will transfer to another institution and program. for instance, college A might have a class ""intro business law"" and university B has a ""business law basics"" class. They are different, but essentially the same. The transfer guide will say if university B will give you an 'equivalency' for their course when in reality you completed a different course at a different institution. Study habits are something we can all work on, including myself. I'll go ahead and open the module for us to work through Mentee 2023-05-26, 10:01: Hello Dane, sorry for being so absent I've been going through some personal troubles, and have not been at school very much in the past 2-3 weeks because of it. For the majority of next week I will be gone as well since I am traveling for 5 or so days. Again sorry for the radio silence, I hope everything over there is good.

All I would like in my life is being happy, doing things that make me feel good and at peace with myself, that is why I aspire to understand completely myself: my wants and my needs. I am passionate about music, always have and always will, I love singing, dancing, play instruments even though I'm not really good at it; I am also passionate about sports, love them, I love staying active and enjoying my time with friends. I'm very passionate about the climate and very interested in the matter, I try to make a small difference in my everyday life, that one of the reason I love cycling and bikes in general. Last thing I'm passionate about is friendship and connection with people in general, I love talking with people and finding out about them. 5 things I want is life are: 1. to be happy, as said before 2. learn how to play guitar and maybe piano 3. do a road trip with my friends 4. buy a house 5. I also would like to be successful in whatever I decide to pursue as a career How about you? Where do you find inspiration and what are you passionate about? Also, I'm really curious to know what keeps you motivated to do certain things (like studying) even when you don't want to Thank you for everything, Sofia Mentee 2023-05-05, 19:37: Hi Faith, I'm sorry for not answering you earlier but I forgot my password for the account, and I couldn't log in. I've been well these past few days; I competed in a very important track and field meet and I had such a good time! How about you? Hope your exams are going well. If you don't mind my asking, what job do you do? And how do you manage to work full-time while still in college? I really enjoy the small things that life brings me, because I think that that is the key to happiness. I heard of the SMART method, and I use it quite often, especially in this class; I think it is very straightforward and useful. Looking at your goals, I found myself relating to them: I feel like I could also go to sleep earlier and take more care of myself in general, while making time for things that I enjoy doing. I find your ways to be motivated really good, as I value mental health too, but sometimes when I'm not doing anything or I'm avoiding studying, I feel really unproductive. But I will cherish your tips and try them as soon as I need them. Moving on to the second part of the module, I found the video really inspiring: I never actually thought about goals in a negative way, but now, after what Adam Alter said, I agree with him, especially when it comes to setting an unrealistic goal. From now on I will try and transform all of my goals into systems. For example: 1. Hang out with my friends at least once a week 2. Meet with my project partner every Sunday, to work on our Capstone project 3. Spend a couple of hours with my family every day as soon as I get back home What are some habits that you built, and how have they helped you achieve your goals? How do the goals and habits you had in high school compare to the ones you have now, as a post-secondary student and young adult? Talk to you soon, Sofia",,"Mentee 2023-06-13, 11:07: Hi Faith, Don't worry for the late reply, it happens to everyone :). I'm doing good, and I can't wait for summer, I'll go back to my home country and have loads of fun with my friends. Co-op programs sound really interesting, would you reccomend them to other students, even if the pay is usually not that high? I am in the track team, so I practice my sport three times a week, which keeps me moving and healthy. I don't really have workout routines, but I'd love to and maybe build some more muscle. So, let me understand, you have 3 hours per course each week, so you technically have a lot of time to study, to work or to do laboratory sessions? Thanks for the tips tho, really useful! Moving on to the ""strategic studying"" module, I watched the video and I found it interesting: it explained in an easy way the best things one could do to get better at studying and memorizing. The strategy that seems most useful to me it's the ""Spaced practice"", that can be explained witha wonderful quote from the video: ""5 hours of studying crammed in one intense session is not as good as the same 5 hours spread out over two weeks."" This teaches us the importnce of studying in an effective manner bot also the importnace of taking breaks, that not many realize it's a fundamental part of studying. I will for sure try this strategy in the future. What have you learned about studying since you were in high school? Let me know what you think of the module, talk to you soon Sofia Mentor 2023-06-18, 20:42: Hello Sofia, Thank you for your understanding, sounds like you are going to have a wonderful summer break ahead, do you have any plans in mind already? I’m sure you will enjoy your time back home, are you going to come back to Canada afterwards? I would recommend the coop program to others, it’s a great way to explore the different types of jobs and work fields. After all, experiences are more important than monetary benefits. Track is a very good sport! Keep up your good work :) 3 hours per course each week would be the very optimal situation, but most of the time there will be an additional 6 to 8 hours per week for laboratory and tutorial sessions (at least for science programs). But other than that, the workload is manageable as long as you don’t fall behind on assignments and courses. I also found that the best study strategy is spaced practice, I learned this from one of my psychology classes, which explained that most people can only perform peak concentration for a limited amount of time, and their attention span will dramatically decline afterwards. I was definitely that person who studied for 5 hours straight during one study session, but as you can imagine it wasn’t as effective as I expected. This is another reason why I promote making plans for everything, so that I can plan out my study schedule accordingly. Let me know if you want to start the extension activities or move on to another topic. Faith :) Mentee 2023-06-19, 10:29: Hi Faith, My family and I are thinking of travelling to Iceland this summer, which will be very excting since I've always wanted to go there. I'm going home in 11 days and after that I won't be back, I'll continue school in Italy. How about you, do you have plans for this summer? I'll definitely look into co-op programs. Wow, you do spend so much time in the laboratory, what do you usually do? I am too one of those people who studies everything the day before, I know I have to get better but sticking to a plan takes a lot of determination and I don't really have that, especially school-wise. I'd like to move on, maybe to the ""Post Secondary and Career Planning"" module, which looks very interesting. Sofia",,"Mentor 2023-03-02, 09:02: Hello Sofia, welcome to this platform :) This is Faith, my pronoun is she/her and I'm a fourth-year Biology undergrad student at UBC. I was born and raised in a beautiful coastal city called Dalian. I am a huge animal lover and have always been interested in the biological and physiological aspects of organisms. I enjoy painting, reading and listening to music in my free time! I will try my best to help you learn what to expect in post-secondary, make future plans, find motivation and many more. Before we start, I would like to get to know you better. What class are you in right now? Do you have a college/university that you would like to attend? If you ever have any questions, just send them to me and I will try my best to answer them? Mentor 2023-03-22, 10:40: Hello Sofia, just checking to see how are you doing recently? Faith :) Mentee 2023-03-28, 10:51: Hello Faith, Sorry for not answering earlier, but we were in spring break and I totally forgot about everyhting regarding school. My name is Sofia, my pronouns are she/her and I'm a grade 12 student. I love animals too, I have three dogs, three cats and three horses, what about you, do you have any pets? I enjoy singing, listening to music and climbing in my free time. The class I am in right now it's called Career Life Education, here we learn about our plans for the future. Being that I'm an exchange student, I would like to focus more on how to find motivation and make future plans. How did you realize that you wanted to pursue a career in biology? Have a good day, Sofia Mentor 2023-03-30, 23:06: Hello Sofia, No worries, we all forget sometimes, it's good to hear from you :) It's very impressive to hear that you have 3 horses, 3 dogs and 3 cats, is there a reason why you have 3 of each? At the moment I have 2 hamsters and a dog back in my home country. It’s lovely to hear that you have so many hobbies, have you tried climbing mountains in BC yet? It’s a great way to enjoy the wilderness for sure. How long are you planning to stay here as an exchange student? Do you like it here so far? Speaking of finding motivation, I find the most effective way is to have a goal and then work towards it to achieve accomplishment. Perhaps we can start with the Finding Inspiration module, what do you think? I chose my area of study mainly because I was always interested in the biological and physiological aspects of organisms, thus I pursued the science field. What about you? Feel free to share your current plans with me and I’ll try my best to give you some feedback or ideas. Faith :) Mentee 2023-04-04, 11:29: Hi Faith, How are you? I get how it might look like there might be a reason, but here is no specific motivation of why we have 3 of each animal, but we like it that way; our house it's never quiet. But I'm sure you get me, having many pets youself, how often do you get back to your home country? I haven't climbed in BC yet, but it'd be really fun to try, once the weather gets better. How about you, have you ever tried climbing in BC? I've been here in Canada since September and I'll go back home in July, I really like Canada so far and I've had so much fun since I've been here, discovering all that this country has to offer. I think that starting the ""Finding Inspiration"" module is a great idea, so let's do it. I have many passions and I'm still not sure of what career I'd like to pursue, but I was thinking about something that has to do with language (both foreign languages or the English language) or maybe something that has to do with Science. I'm still really unsure though Thank you for your time, Sofia :) Mentor 2023-04-09, 23:38: Hello Sofia, Sorry for the late response, it’s near the final exam session for my university so it has been a very busy time for me, but other than that I’m doing good :) It seems like a very unique coincidence that you have 3 pets of each species! It’s been a long time since I went back to my home country due to the pandemic, that's around 2 years already. But I’m currently thinking about going back this summer if my schedule works out! It’s great to hear that you are enjoying your time here in Canada, the summer is definitely more beautiful and fun than the winter, be sure to check out all the amazing places and activities. I enjoy hiking in the mountains, but not so much climbing since I’m a little afraid of heights. But I do remember the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment after climbing to the top of a hillside during one of my school field trips, it was a great experience :D I have unlocked the Finding Inspiration module, feel free to start whenever you get the chance, you can always reach out to me if you have any questions. Looking forward to hearing from you Faith Mentee 2023-04-14, 10:08: Hi Faith, I hope your exams went well, does studying take up much of your time? I'm sure that you'll find a way to go back to your country this summer, I'm sure you miss it a lot. We're having a bit of sunshine in these days and everything is definitely much better, can't wait for the summer. I am quite afraid of heights too, but I really enjoy climbing, so I try not to thik about it; it is a very fulfilling sport, indeed. I'll start the Finding Inspiration module as soon as possible, thank you for unlocking it, looks interesting! Have a great day, Sofia Mentor 2023-04-24, 11:25: Hello Sofia, How are you doing recently? I was going to reply to you but got distracted midway through the days. Thank you for asking, the exams and projects are manageable by themselves, but the thing is I'm also working full time along with other things so that adds up to my workload, thus I've been very busy lately :P I’m very admired by you for climbing even when you are afraid of heights, I tried to overcome it but only made small progress. And thank you for the amazing response, I also agree with Mina Shum's statement, I can sense that you have put a lot of work into your thoughts and reflections! It's great to hear that you are enjoying things like sports and music, I feel like these “small” things are like the brick for the foundation of our happiness. I like to use the SMART method to set goals, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Here are some of my goals for this year: 1. Contact someone that I haven’t spoken to in a long time. 2. Go to sleep earlier and eat healthier meals. 3. Schedule for a better work-life balance. 4. Schedule time to practice painting and drawing. 5. Learn horseback riding (Inspired by Sofia) In terms of motivation, I’m a result-driven person, so having a good goal or end result can help me achieve better performance and productivity. I will also try to come up with rewarding strategies, for example, going to a great restaurant after the exam period finishes. I believe mental health is very important, so I will choose to do nothing in situations where I feel down or don’t feel like doing something like studying, that will give me time to focus on resting and getting back on track later. Besides, I tend to work better under good mental and physical conditions. Would you like to continue with the extended activities in this molecule? They are also very interesting. If not let me know if you want to work on another topic :) Faith Mentor 2023-05-04, 15:24: Hello Sofia, how are you doing so far? Mentor 2023-05-20, 07:32: Hello Sofia, No worries! Technical problems are unavoidable these days. It's great to hear about the good news, congratulation on your achievements, you should be proud of yourself :) And thank you for asking, the marks are in my favour so I can finally relax and enjoy the upcoming summer. I'm currently in the coop program, thus as a coop student, I have the option to apply for full-time jobs during study terms. My current position is laboratory technician in a governmental lab. In the meantime, I also had the option to only do part-time study, so I’m taking one course during this term while trying to keep the workload manageable. If you are interested just let me know and I can give you more details. I'm glad that my tips were helpful to you, I also learned a lot from you too, your goals have given me a lot of inspiration. In terms of goals and habits, I used to set up unrealistic goals and struggled to achieve them, in the end I learned the lesson. I really liked your examples as they’re achievable and manageable, keep up the good work! One habit that I’ve developed recently was going to the gym or swimming at least once a week, this way I can stay fit and healthy. I have been practicing this habit for the past 3 months :) The big changes in habits during the transition from high school to university are lifestyle, self-care and study-life balance. For example, high school classes often run continuously with a set amount of time for breaks in between classes, and there’s a well-defined division between school and casual life. Whereas in university, classes are often scattered throughout the day, such as 2 hours in between lectures. Thus, it’s very important for students to develop a habit of utilizing fragmented time, like setting up short study plans. This would also lead to mixing school and casual life, so developing a routine and mindset that can create balance is essential for maintaining good mental health in the long run. Let me know which topic or module you want to explore next, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Looking forward to hearing from you. Faith Mentor 2023-05-30, 18:28: Hello Sofia, How are you doing recently? Any exciting news again? Faith Mentee 2023-06-01, 11:10: Hi Faith, How are you? Your job seems pretty cool, do you get paid or are you volounteering in the co-op program? Since you are studying part time, does that mean it will take you longer to graduate? I think that working out is a great way to deal take care of mental and physical health while also working towards a goal and taking a break from all the stress and the studying. Do the classes always have the same schedule or do they change from week to week based on the professor's availability? Overall, student life seems very intense, stressful and full of studying; do you have some tips to hang out with friends as often as possible? I would really like to explore the ""strategic studying"" module, since we're on topic :) Sofia Mentor 2023-06-12, 16:08: Hello Sofia, Sorry for the delay in replying, I accidentally deleted my text on another platform and had trouble recovering it, so I had to rewrite the response. Thank you for asking, I'm doing pretty good, just busy with work and a summer course at the moment. How are you doing recently? Do you have any plans for the summer break? Good question! Coop positions are paid, however, the pay is usually not that high. But it would also depend on the program, for example, programming positions are paid more than some other fields. The coop programs are typically around one year long, so students will delay their graduation according. Requirements for co-op programs can vary from university to university, so be sure to check the specifics if you're interested in applying :) I totally agree with you that working out is a great way to live a healthy lifestyle and I look forward to joining the fitness program at my residence as soon as I get back to school. Do you have any workout routines? Almost all of the courses have set schedules that run for the entire semester. A full-time student typically takes 4 courses per term, and each course is usually 3 hours per week, ranging from 2 to 3 class sessions. On top of that, science programs have laboratory sessions which add additional hours. As a result, art majors typically have shorter class times, while engineering majors are known for their heavy workloads, so which major you choose will greatly affect your school and life balance. My biggest suggestion is to plan everything, like set up study plans that incorporate assignments and exams for each course, and make sure to include times for breaks for relaxation and hanging out with friends. Once you have your plan in place be sure to execute it, sometimes it's easy to slack off, but it's important for the long run. I have unlocked the ""strategic studying"" module, feel free to start and let me know when you are finished! Also please note that we have until June 26th to complete 3 modules as per your class requirements :) Faith Mentor 2023-06-25, 22:22: Hello Sofia, I always wanted to visit Iceland as well! There are so many beautiful places to explore, not to mention the aurora :D I hope you enjoyed your study in Canada and wish you the best when you return to Italy. Not sure if Italy will have similar coop programs in university but worth looking into. As for me, I don’t have much time for a vacation trip because I have to work, but I’ll be sure to visit a couple of events and parks during the weekends! In terms of labs, the contents can be very different from course to course, for example, you can spend a lot of time in the wilderness for an ecology lab, versus performing various experiments for a chemistry lab. I can totally relate with you on finding the determination, it’s going to be a tough change but at the end of the day, it’s going to be worth it. Keep up the good work. I have unlocked the ""Post Secondary and Career Planning"" module, looking forward to hearing from you soon. Faith",,,,,

I read on your profile that you're also an artist and writer ~ I adore talking about both, so if you ever need someone to bounce ideas off of or want to know some ideas for getting your work out there I'd love to help. I'm a full time student at TRU right now and I'm taking mostly art courses and one english course. I was all set to graduate this semester but then I decided I wanted to get a minor in Visual Arts so I'm back again! I am absolutely loving it so far though. Going to university for art is so worth it if you're passionate about it. Lately I've been having so much fun with art now that I've been doing things for fun and to experiment and not worrying about if theyre ""good"". I am really enjoying doing scribbly crayon and sharpie portraits at the moment. Is there any muses that have caught your attention lately? I also read that you're genderfluid ~ I myself am trans masc, so if you ever wanna chat gender I'm a pretty open book! Looking forward to hearing from you! Hope you have a great week. Best, Dre Mentee 2023-03-07, 10:25: Hi Dre! My name is Kenneth and I am your mentee! though im guessing you already know that. I really struggle with being perfect when it come to my art, so when painting I tend to lean more toward abstract, I also try to remember one of my favourite quoets ""she didnt look nice she looked like art, and art wasnt supposed to look nice, it was supposed to make you feel somthing."" Im really trying to shrink that proffectionist that lives inside me but they just dont seem to want to leave! I havent really found my muse yet, i just blast my music and let the feeling take over me. Do you have anything planned for spring break? All i have planned is working, reading alot, and doing some art. im really excided for next year though, I miss pottery, do you enjoy doing 3D art? - your mentee kenneth P.S: you can call me Kenny if you want :) Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:24: also i would love to start the module finding insperation, I should have said that in the last email but I had an appiontment, sorry! :) Mentor 2023-03-16, 16:40: Hi Kenny!! I hope your spring break is going great!! Your plans of reading and doing art sound so lovely, but I'm sorry you had to work over break! We actually had our reading break in late february, and I was super sick throughout it -_- but that's okay! I played lots of video games hehe. That's awesome that you like abstract art! I've been doing a lot more of that lately and I find it so freeing. It can be nice to just let your intuition take over, especially when you let go of it being ""perfect."" I love that quote you brought up. It's so true. I think some of my favourite art pieces aren't pretty at all. Pottery sounds so fun! I haven't done pottery in a loong time, but I'm currently in a 3D art class at school and I am having the time of my life making little sculptures. We recently had to make a ton of castings from handmade molds, then transform the castings in some way. I made a little forest/cave/ of carved fingers made to look like stalagmites and also covered it in glitter and it was SO. FUN. I can definitely see mysefl doing more 3D art. Do you have particular music you like listening to when you make art? Lately I've been listening to Ethel Cain as I sketch. And perfect, I unlocked the ""Finding Inspiration"" module so you can start that whenever you like! If you're still on break no worries though! Enjoy your time off!! :) Best, Dre Mentor 2023-04-26, 09:34: Hi Kenny!

I leave my phone outside my room when I sleep and don't drink any caffeine 4 hours before bed. Mentor 2023-04-13, 22:50: Prioritizing self care is definitely a large step towards a healthy lifestyle so I'm glad you're thinking about it! And it seems that you are already taking some steps towards it from your habits! I find that adopting new self care routines, be it working out or eating healthy, can be difficult at first but as long as you keep up with it, you find that it is really worth the effort. This is where prioritizing self care comes in; I think you have to find your own understanding of self care and why it's important to you, a lot like finding your motivation towards a healthy lifestyle. With that, you'll ding it much easier to adopt new healthy habits that help with both self care and wellbeing.

Mentor 2023-03-08, 12:14: Oh you enjoy playing games too? I remember how I used to love playing Fortnite! How long has it been since you started? As for the modules, I am not entirely sure which 4 you would like me to open. Just let me know if you have any in mind and we can go through them one by one! Mentee 2023-03-16, 10:41: Hi Camren and Mehak, Your teacher is asking you to complete the Career Exploration, Confronting Discrimination, Well being &amp; Self care, and Getting Hired modules. If you scroll up to the top of the page you'll see the navigation wheel (the green circle), and you'll see the 4 modules I just mentioned in blue. Camren, you can click on whichever one you want to do first, and you'll see the activities for it. Let Mehak know which one you're working on. Let us know if you have any other questions (e.mentoring[at]ubc.ca) Thanks, Management Mentee 2023-04-11, 08:51: I've been playing since 2017. Mentor 2023-04-13, 22:43: Haha same here, I roughly started near then as well but my interest kind of faded off as time went by. I still remember the great times I had playing though; definitely a fun game. Still can't believe it's already been so many years Mentor 2023-04-29, 08:46: Boxing and walks? Nice! It's great to have some hobbies and I especially like how they both keep you active! I think you're already on the right path and if you want to do even more to get out of you low energy state, I would say eat a healthy diet and get a good night sleep because it's often these little things that can interfere with our mood.",,,,,

You can start by watching the 2 videos for anchor text 1:) Lmk if you have any questions or want to simply discuss something! Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:14: i thought the two videos were actually very intresting and insightful especially the second one. the videos made me think of what i can do outside my carrer to live a fun and intresting life. the doctors in the videos both contribute to their comunites and lead fulfiling lives outside of their work. in life i value my time and my impact on the people around me. in the future i want to contribute to my community by helping people with whatever degree i end up getting. a career that i think would incorporate my vaules and the impact i want to make on a community would deffiently be something in the health care / emergency services area. Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:36: i took the test and after looking over some of the options paramedic stood out to me. paramedic caught my attention becouse of its lower level of needed education to get into. this intrests me not becouse i dislike school but becouse i am not completly sure what i want to do, this seems like a good way to try my hand in the medical field without wasting my time. when it comes to the work life balance this job isint ideal becouse its long and varying hours making it hard to make plans. in the way of finacial security this job is deffinatly enough to live a comfotable life, but if i get more people who depend on this income it might not be enough especially at the starting pay. this carrer has pretty god job security becouse their is almost always a need for emergency responders. theroreticaly i could work pretty much anywere as a paramedic but if i were to pursue this as a career i would aim for a more rural city over a more populated city. when you were looking for your career how did yuo test the waters and see what you enjoyed. what other career have you considered while in university. what do you wish you had known about your career while still in highschool. Mentor 2023-03-04, 14:48: Hi John! A career as a paramedic sounds very fulfilling! One thing to keep in mind when exploring careers in high school is evaluating how much/many years of education you are willing to do to accomplish the end result (getting the job). Also, it's important to take into consideration all of the pathways to get to this end career. For example, sometimes there are easier routes that you may not be aware of, especially when it comes to healthcare careers! I think that it is a fantastic idea to go into a smaller college first if you don't fully know what you want to study as it will be less overwhelming and also give you an idea of what post-secondary workload is like. Mentor 2023-03-04, 14:59: Similarly to you, I also did not know exactly what I wanted to do coming out of high school! However, I knew I enjoyed science courses and volunteering in a healthcare setting so I decided to go into a bachelor of science. I personally struggled a lot in first year because of all of the changes that come with starting university, like learning how to study a totally different way. However, after I got settled into university I started volunteering again at a physio clinic and the hospital. I feel that the best way to explore careers is through volunteering! In high school, I wish I had done more research on different pathways/degrees instead of just going for a generic one because I have come to the realization that a Bachelor of Kinesiology would have been a better fit for me! I have honestly considered every possible career in the healthcare industry but have narrowed it down to physiotherapy because I find the courses related to it interesting and the job very flexible and fulfilling at the same time. Plus, there is only 2 years of schooling on top of a bachelor's! Mentee 2023-03-08, 14:32: thankyou for all your advice it has been really hellpful in looking for a possible carrer. sorry if i havent responded in a while my classes are coming to a end and have been getting really stressfull.",,,"Mentor 2023-02-24, 14:57: Hi John! My name is Gurleen:) I'll be your mentor as you work through eMentoring conversations. I'm currently a 4th biology student at UBC, planning on pursuing a career in physiotherapy. I love hiking, cooking, playing with my puppy, and spending time with friends and family! I would love to get to know a bit about you.

I am really intrested to talk with you through the conversation modules. i was intrested in any of your advice you might have about carrer exploration.

Also if you do one to open up another conversation, I can also do that. Mentor 2023-03-12, 20:00: Otherwise we can start the ""wrapping up"" conversation.

When I first started my university journey I didn't know exactly what I wanted to study but after one poetry class, I fell in love with English Literature. Literature and books have always been a constant in my life so it was an easy movement for me to choose English. And when I struggled with my motivation, I turned to my family and friends to support me and advise me because sometimes I just needed to hear someone else's thoughts on what was going on in my head.",,,,"Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:37: Hey Megan, I got a chance to veiw your profile and I'm honestly not the best conversation starter and don't exactly know how to start one.

I've found writing to kind of be like an outlet to me and in a way is like a coping thing but is for sure something I enjoy Mentor 2023-02-21, 14:23: Hi Hayley, It’s okay to not be the best conversation starter, sometimes I still struggle with conversations (especially virtual ones). And don’t worry about the later response, I figured the long weekend would mean a delayed response. Please don’t ever worry about messaging late, I’m just happy to hear from you at all. I also viewed your profile and loved that we have similar interests in writing and music. I too use my writing as an outlet for my mental health, and I actually often listen to music for the same reason. I’m excited to get started with you, and once you have gone through the ""Start Here"" section, we can discuss which conversation you would like to begin with!

I have opened up the Well-being and self-care conversation and I'm looking forward to going through the post-secondary and career planning with you. There is an article and a video for you to watch for the 1st part of the conversation and then we can further discuss it. Mentee 2023-02-27, 13:01: Hi Anshan. Today we started doing the activities, I read the article and watched the video. This is my list of my own warning signs. Low energy, if my mood is off, I tend to procrastinate and not wanting to get out of bed. My actions or activities that I enjoy are: going to the gym, reading I LOVE READING, painting, going for walks and deep cleaning my room. Do you have any tips on getting out of a funk? WHat tips do you have on maintaining overall good mental health in post secondary? Hope to hear from you soon! Mentor 2023-02-27, 22:58: Hi Hailey! Thank you so much for your discussion and questions! I completely understand having low energy and procrastinating. I find that they are some of my warning signs as well along with sleeping more and spending more time on my phone using social media. It is something that I deal with quite often. Personally, I find that when I am feeling like that I turn to speaking to individuals that I trust and I speak to them about how I have been feeling. Furthermore, I like to make a list of things that I need to do with a lot of breaks so I can take out time for myself to relax. I find that it helps me stay motivated and not be fatigued from school. Post-secondary can be quite busy, therefore I enjoy taking out the time to do things that I like which helps keep me motivated and also find a balance between school and my personal life. This can include small activities such as going for a walk, reading books, working on a puzzle, or taking the time to hang out with some friends. I find that these activities not only help me with getting out of a funk, but also maintain good mental health. I know that school can be quite busy and at times it can feel like that the assignments never end, but I find that those are the times where I may need to take a quick break and practice some self-care so I can go back and actually feel like studying rather than just going through the motions. I noticed that one of the question you had was how to stay motivated. Are there any specific tactics that you currently use? Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:29: Hi Aashna, I just realized that my computer auto corrected your name and it is spelt wrong! I am so sorry. Some tactics that I use right now to stay motivated is setting aside time for myself and having my mom tell me to study or remind me to study and remind me about my homework. Three changes I can make in my life right now to take better care of myself is actually going back to the gym consistently. Since my school schedule has gotten busy and I've needed to study so much and I'm so focused on school I felt like going to the gym consistently would take away from time I could be studying. I also need to focus on eating better. I forget to eat when I'm stressed and studying and doing homework. Last week i forgot to eat anything other then breakfast for a few days which isn't good. I can start setting breaks in my studying times to go get dinner. Another thing is I also need to get more sleep. I can set time aside for me to study and set a set time for me to put my phone down and go to bed. How has the way you approach self-care changed now that you're an adult? Hope to hear from you soon! Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:30: Also we have class time on Wednesday to reply!! Mentor 2023-03-07, 17:57: That’s completely okay! Similarly, I had my parents reminding me about my homework as well, however once I entered post-secondary, I found that I had to be able to keep a consistent schedule with a To-Do list with things I need to get done throughout the week. I found it to be very helpful in staying organized. Furthermore, these are things that I have found that I struggle with as well. I find that in order to overcome these challenges, it really important to have a schedule with a lot of breaks. I find that having breaks in between my schedule helps keep me motivated and focused on my work. Through doing so, I’m also able to plan out my days and make time for going to the gym, ensure that I have breaks to make food, eat, and do dishes, as well as taking out time for myself to just watch a movie or read a book. Now that I’m an adult, I think that I have definitely focused more time on self-care than I did in high school. After high school, I self-reflected quite a bit on my mental health and taking out time for myself. It allowed for me to find what I needed to do to help myself. This consisted of making a schedule to take out time for myself and also starting to journal which allows me to reflect on my day and what I need to work on myself. Mentor 2023-03-07, 17:57: Also, that’s great to hear! I was wondering whether you wanted to complete post-secondary conversation, as I noticed that your teacher is now only requiring one to be completed or whether you would like to continue chatting?",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-15, 09:11: Hi Hailey! My name is Aashna. I'm your mentor. I was just able to gain access to this shell today. I hope you are having a great day! I was wondering whether you would like to begin with the Well-being and Self-care conversation first? Looking forward to hearing back! Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:42: Hi Aashna, sorry for the delay we have not been able to access our accounts. I was just able to log in. We are only doing e-mentoring once a week normally Monday or Tuesday because the timing of our class doesn't really allow us to do more. We can start with the Well-Being and Self-Care but I definitely want to discus the Post-Secondary and Career Planning, and Career Exploring. Hope you are doing well and hope to hear from you soon! Mentee 2023-02-23, 12:15: Sounds great, our plan is to start doing the conversations on Monday! Mentor 2023-02-23, 18:31: That sounds great! Mentor 2023-03-07, 17:56: That’s completely okay! Similarly, I had my parents reminding me about my homework as well, however once I entered post-secondary, I found that I had to be able to keep a consistent schedule with a To-Do list with things I need to get done throughout the week. I found it to be very helpful in staying organized. Furthermore, these are things that I have found that I struggle with as well. I find that in order to overcome these challenges, it really important to have a schedule with a lot of breaks. I find that having breaks in between my schedule helps keep me motivated and focused on my work. Through doing so, I’m also able to plan out my days and make time for going to the gym, ensure that I have breaks to make food, eat, and do dishes, as well as taking out time for myself to just watch a movie or read a book.

Such as classes you are in, things ya like to do for fun, and anything else. Also feel free to ask me questions. Ill leave ya with this joke. Have you heard of the rumor about butter? Never mind, I shouldn’t spread it. Mentor 2023-02-14, 13:57: Also Julian, if you can go through the ""How the program works"" and feel free to ask me if you have any questions about! then we can start with whichever program you would like! Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:51: Hello Ahmed, It is Julian haha, i am looking forward to continuing forward with this program with you, unfortunatly our class time restricts us and I will only be responding once a week. we will check the site again next monday and i look forward to hearing beack from you. I guess my starting question for you is how was it moving into your own place, was it isolating?, were you able to make friends easy?, how big of a change was it from living with other people in your house to having the place to yourself?. I fear i will isolate myself when i move on my own but optomistic I will meet good friends. Mentor 2023-02-23, 00:22: Hey Julian, Honestly it depends on the type of person you are. I started off on campus where you were thrown in with 3 other roommates and that's where I made some of my friends but that's not always the case. The main thing is how willing you are to be involved in clubs at these schools! I know it kinda sounds cliche and that's what I thought, but you really do get to make those natural connections to make some lifetime friends I think! I would wouldn't get too focused on the experience necessarily because the good thing is that everyone else is most likely coming into it without much grounding. Mentor 2023-02-23, 00:23: Also if you read up on what instructions are, did you want to start with the Rural to urban module then? Mentor 2023-02-23, 00:23: or is there something else that your are interested in? Mentee 2023-03-16, 12:28: hello Ahmad sorry for almost never responding, i missed alot of the classes where we were texting our mentors. This will be one of the last sessions we are having in our careers class. I wanted to thank you for being my mentor even though i wasnt a very good mentee, i hope you enjoy/connect more with your next mentee if you chose to participate in this program again. ~ your mentee, Julian Mentor 2023-03-17, 01:05: Hey Julian, Don't sweat it. I enjoyed the time I spoke to you and I hope the best for your future endeavours at university! If ya ever have any questions always feel free to shoot me a message through here.","Mentor 2023-02-24, 14:14: Hey Julian I opened this up and will let you go through it. If you have any question feel free to ask me anything that comes up! Mentee 2023-02-27, 13:17: hello Ahmad I'm sorry for the delayed response I've started the rural to urban but i will not be able to respond until tommorow. Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:21: hello ahmad sorry for the late response I got sick but I should have checked the website and kept up so i apologize, this text box is for anchor one. Three things i enjoy about living in a rural area is i know almost everyone and if i meet someone new i wont have too hard of a time rembering them. I also enjoy how peaceful it can be, sure theres noise like any place but there are trails in town i can walk through to clear my head or just get away from people in. Lastly I enjoy that the town is small, and I know that might sound weird but the most it will take is an hour and a half to walk across town, so I can walk anywhere in not too long of a time. There are downsides to rural areas are since everyone knows eachother especially with kids in and around my grade gossip and spread rumors/spread others buisness and i dont get why. the other thing I'm jelous of that we dont have as much of as rurally, big malls/stores in general, we have only one mall here and theres only about 4 or 5 big brand stores and a hand full of local stores in it, its a sad looking mall. anyways some questions i have are, 1. whats it like to get your own appartment in an urban area, 2. what are two things you like about living in an urban area and 2 things you dont like. 3. what is something suprised you that you weren't expecting you'd have to do after you moved out (ex. a bill you didnt think you'd have, chore/errand you didnt expect). thats about all the questions i have for anchor 1. Mentor 2023-03-02, 12:13: Hey Julian, Thanks for completing the first anchor! I appreciate your answers and can also answer ya quesitons. So i guess ill go through them one at a time: 1. what's it like to get your own apartment in an urban area? Now this was an interesting experience for me. When I first moved to Prince George, I had stayed on campus the first year but wanted to move off campus. When I did that, I realized how quickly things happen from seeing, to signing, to moving in took about 4 days. Which was crazy, I thought it was this crazy thing. I found that living in an apartment as compared to other types of dwellings like a basement suite to be more aware of how loud you are and what time it is. But overall I loved it since I got to buy the stuff and organize and install things just the way I wanted. 2. What are two things you like about living in an urban area and 2 things you dont like? Two things I don't like is that, just like you mentioned in an urban center things go by quickly and so do the people, you will have neighbours moving in and moving out, and I didn't find any opportunity to know them in any regards other than in the elevator lol. Another thing is unlike when I was in Williams Lake, you are isolated in your home so I could do anything at anytime, as long as my parents didnt mind... 3. what is something suprised you that you weren't expecting you'd have to do after you moved out? Things that surprised me was, not having my own laundry machine in my house and the need of coins/card to use them. I didnt mind doing the laundry when it was in my house, but now that I have to go to down a few flights of stairs to get to the laundry machine I definitely loathe it more. If you can get an insuite laundry machine lol.. Also, you might need to choose your kitchen stuff wisely, I kept buying stuff and when I moved again the situation was I had too much stuff and not enough kitchen.

1047582379,9/16/2022 11:06,1047592612,58985,,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:30: Hey Emily! Im sorry i have not got back to you in awhile. I have been having trouble with passwords and logging in! it would be awesome if we could start one of the conversations soon! i will message you back on wednesday. Mentor 2023-03-06, 13:55: Hi Kyri, No problem, I look forward to hearing from you. To help move things along, I had a look at the Anchor text 1 discussion questions. I did a quick search for scholarships that may apply to you. Here are a few options you could consider: The BC Environment Industry Association offers an award to a high school student pursuing environmental studies: https://bceia.com/2022/10/09/bceia-student-scholarships-2023/ University of Victoria has some entrance scholarships. In particular, the ""Robyn Kathleen Addison Scholarship in Environmental Studies"" is for women students entering the School or Environmental Studies: https://www.uvic.ca/registrar/safa/entrance-scholarships/dept/environmental-st.php# Vancouver Island University also has a variety of scholarships you could apply for. In particular, check out the options under ""Entrance Awards"": https://services.viu.ca/financial-aid-awards/scholarships-awards#entrance-awards_719 In terms of how I funded my education: I'm lucky since my parents helped with tuition for the first few years. I didn't work during classes, but I was able to earn a decent amount in the summer months. After first year, I worked at a museum which was only a bit more than minimum wage but I saved money living at home. After second year, my summer jobs were related to my studies and I got a higher wage, so I was able to save money for the school year. Also my department offered quite a few awards and scholarships, so by 3rd and 4th year university the awards and scholarships pretty much covered the cost of tutition. Almost all of these were automatically awarded based on grades or leadership/extracirriculars (I participdated in club activities), so I didn't have to apply. There are many different options for funding your education. Most of my friends had some student loans, but most kept the amount low by working part-time during classes and working during the summer. Please let me know if you have any questions! Mentor 2023-03-14, 09:18: Hi Kyri, That's great you already have some plans to work and save money and apply for bursaries. The scholarship and bursary applications can vary a lot. Busaries are usually based on financial need while scholarships/awards may be more focused on academic achievement (grades) or personal achievement (leadership, community service, etc.). For scholarships and awards, you often need to submit a personal statement that introduces who you are, your motivation to study in a particular field, and highlights some of your strengths. I think the best way to get started is just to search around for some bursaries / scholarships that you would be eligible for (VIU website is a good place to start), check what they aks you to submit and what the deadlines are. Deadlines can be earlier than you expect, so the sooner you do your research, the better! Since you're finishing with ementoring this week, I'd like to say: It was very nice to meet you! Your plans for work and school sound great! Best of luck!!! You're more than welcome to message me again if you have any more questions about work or school. :)","Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:46: Emily!

1047549914,10/30/2021 17:39,1047592613,58984,,,"Mentee 2023-02-27, 13:16: Hi Sakura I applied to the TRU nursing program in Kamloops. I am in grade 12. My 'warning signs': -irritable, low energy, sleep a lot, eat less, emotional. Things that I enjoy: - reading a book, going to the gym, going on walks, hanging out with a friend What tips do you have on maintaining overall good mental health? Mentor 2023-02-27, 13:28: I've heard that TRU has a great nursing program! I am at UNBC. I think that it's great that you know what your ""warning signs"" are because you can focus on those if you recognize them. I find that during super stressful or busy times in nursing school means that I forget about myself because I'm so focused on school. Planning an afternoon off where I focus on myself is something that has really helped with my mental health. I know a lot of my friends do this as well, it's even better if your time off matches with theirs! Having supports in nursing is also really helpful because things like lab exams where you have to show your instructors that you can do nursing skills is extremely stressful. I have definetly had my friends over just for them to be my patient and to watch a movie after to de-stress. What do you do for your mental/physical health now? Do you think that you can continue doing those things when you are in nursing? Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:05: I try my best to take care of my mental health right now by ensuring I exercise each day. I am an early bird so I usually make it to the gym before school starts. When I can't, I make sure to take my dog on an extra-long walk. When I start nursing school, it will be much harder to take care of my mental health because I won't have time or energy. I still hope that I can go to the gym once I head off to University because it helps me a lot and it is one of my favourite things to do. One thing I can do to improve my overall mental health is to take breaks. I can do this by setting a time to end my homework or studying instead of doing it for hours and hours without any breaks. Another thing I can do to improve my mental health is to go to sleep a little bit earlier. I already go to bed quite early but I also wake up super early and can feel over tired by the end of the day. I can do this by putting my phone and homework away an hour before I plan on going to sleep, that way when I am in bed I don't have any distractions. A third thing I can do to improve my mental health is to hang out with my friends more often. I am very introverted and love having all the time in the world to myself but until I hang out with my friends, I don't realize how much better it makes me feel when I am so mentally exhausted because of school and work and never taking breaks to socialize. I can complete this task by making one day a week or even every two weeks to plan something to do with my friends instead of avoiding them because I feel too busy. In reality, I just don't make the time. Can you share any time management tips?",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-07, 18:15: I'll be honest with you, I did not know how to study when I switched from high school to university. I didn't study like I do in university. I didn't really take notes or do readings. In my first year I found out that I had to learn how to take good notes, be able to pull the main things out of my readings, and learn how to review things properly before exams What I do personally (which doesn't mean this will work with you, but feel free to try!) is that I type out all my notes, readings, and powerpoints into one big word document which becomes my study guide for that class. I made sure to have the powerpoint notes done before class so I can easily follow along and add stuff to it when the instructor is teaching it. I found that this was the best way for me to study, because everything was right there in one document and I could put it into bullet points which made most sense to me. Some of my other friends like to make notes right onto the powerpoint (like in the bottom comments section) and print them out instead of typing all the notes out ahead of time. Or some people put all their notes into quizlet and study using flash cards. It's all about figuring out how you study best! I'm sure there are videos on figuring out what your learning style is, but you can also see what works best for you. The best time for this is definitely in the very beginning of school, so you have time to switch up what you do for notes. How do you currently study? Do you think it works well for you? Is there anything you would add it it, knowing that you'll have more to study in university? Mentee 2023-03-09, 08:05: Currently, my study method is to type or write out and summarize all of the notes the teacher gives to me and then usually I write out as much as I can about each topic and go back and add all the stuff that I missed. I find that this helps me remember the terms and sometimes the concepts. Another way I study is by making flash cards but I avoid them because sometimes I feel like I wasted a lot of time writing them when I could've just studied the terms from my notes. One of the skills I used that was recommended in the video is recalling. I always say out or write out everything I know about the material and then go back and add. Sometimes I like the way I study and sometimes I don't because it doesn't always help me understand the concepts that I need to and I really want to try other ways. Recalling has always been the way I study and it does really help. How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? Mentor 2023-03-12, 14:28: The biggest thing for me was that it's sometimes hard to talk to your teacher about things you don't understand because they aren't always accessible or there's 100 students in the class. I relied on my friends to get me through the things we were learning, but if they didn't undersand something I would go to the teacher's office hours. They set aside time for students to go in and talk to them about things you need help with. Classes are definitely different from high school, I think they are drastically different. A lot of my classes were online because of COVID, so online learning was new to me. But even the course load is different from high school. They give you powerpoints (most of the time), and a lot of my classes were ""flipped"", so you do the readings/powerpoints at home and then in the class you talk about it. I found this hard because I learn best when someone is actually teaching it to me, so this was something that I had to get used to. There are a lot of components to class, like exams, projects, assignments, readings, and quizzes. So having all the due dates written out to keep track of everything is great. Nursing is different from other programs too because you have lab and practicum. You'll have assignments in practicum like journals, evaluations, and maybe even a project or two on top of going to shifts. Learning how to manage your time is something that I didn't know how to do in highschool because I didn't really need to. Being organized helps a lot :) Uni changed the way I study in a lot of ways, but managing my time was the biggest thing. I had to learn how to prioritize things, like when I have three exams, a project, and a paper due within a week, readings get left behind. I usually go back and do the readings after everything is done if I have time. Juggling practicum, theory classes, and lab is a lot, but once you find your groove, everything will fall into place! I won't lie, when I'm writing down all the due dates at the beginning of the semester, I feel so behind from day one. But it's important to take it one day at a time and take those breaks for yourself. I study in groups for lab exams so I can practice on my friends and bounnce ideas off of eachother. I study in blocks of time throughout the day because I found that I didn't actually learn anything if I tried to study for an exam for 6 hours straight. I know it seems super scary right now, but take it one day at a time, try to be organized, and take breaks! You'll do great in nursing!",,"Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:45: Hi Sakura. Sorry for the delay in writing to you, I was having technical difficulties but now it is fixed. I might take a while to respond because I only have class time for this on Mondays or Tuesdays. A little bit about me is that I am a serious bookworm, I enjoy working out and I am an introvert. My after-school job is tutoring younger students. I tutor because I love to help people which is one of the many reasons I want to pursue nursing. Mentee 2023-02-22, 12:18: Hey. We are hoping to start our first conversation on Monday. Is it possible that we can start Well being and Self Care? Mentor 2023-02-23, 21:54: Hi Libby! It's nice to meet you! Sorry for the delay in reply, I was out of town. I think it's great that you want to be a nurse because you like to help people! That's also pretty much the reason why I went into nursing! It's incredibly rewarding and I really enjoy it. I'm in 4th year now and I can't wait to start working, especially because I got a job in pediatrics. I also read when I have downtime and I like to go camping, sometimes it's hard to find extra time for these things when I'm in school. Do you know what school you want to apply to for nursing? What grade are you in? I will open up that section for you! Feel free to ask me anything about nursing/school/life outside of school! Mentor 2023-03-06, 16:05: I really like how you have a great plan already for when you go into school! I think scheduling breaks and making time to see friends is super important. I think that I didn't do grat with this during a couple semesters in school just because I was so busy, and looking back, I wish I took more time to explore the city I moved to for school and did more things with friends. For time management, I really procrastinate and get distracted easily so I found an app that ""locks"" my screen when I am on it and it sets a timer so I can focus on studying and making sure that I'm not on my phone and on other apps. It's an app called ""Plantie"". I find that this really helps because I can set a timer to really focus on studying for an hour, then I take a quick break to get up and move around a bit, then I set another timer! I also set my phone to focus mode, which turns off notifications so the alerts don't distract me too. I find that my planner helps me keep track of absoluetely everything, I use it for work, school, hanging out with friends, and even meal prepping! If I didn't have my planner, I would be a mess. I make lists every day so I know what to focus on that day for studying, like if I want to do two units of nursing research class or get my practicum journal done. I am a list person, I get really satistifed and motivated when I can cross things off my list and when I see a completed list at the end of the day. I even put making dinner or doing laundry on the list because I can get overwhelemed by everything that I have to do. Usually I get a free planner free planner from university (I really recommend looking for this on the first couple days of school!), but this year my school didn't print any. So I got the ""original student calendar"" from chapters at the beginning of the school year and it is one of the best ones I've ever had! I also write down big assignments, practicum dates, and exam dates on my wall calendar so I can take quick looks at it. For time management for practicum, I'm not an early bird so I get everything that I can set out and ready to go the night before. You'll find a system that works for you in the first week of practicum which I think is super important. My system is to set up everything from scrubs, coffee, water, stethoscope, pens, little notebook, and my shoes before I go to bed that night. I know on tik tok there are so many people posting ""what I need for practicum"" videos, but I found that I didn't use a lot of the stuff they told me to pack! I didn't have a little clipbaord that folds because I had a notebook, but a lot of my friends used it instead of a little notebook! I think having the necesseties and sticking with that is going to make sure that you don't forget anything. Coming up with a system that works best for you and flows easily is the most important thing to make sure you go to practicum with the best mindset. Otherwise, you'll be flustered in the morning and not be able to focus o nyour patients well. I have definitely had quite a few of these mornings and it is not great! Do you want to know anything specifically about nursing school? Do you want me to open a new conversation? I'm happy to talk about anything! Mentee 2023-03-06, 21:33: My biggest fear for university next year is not having the best study habits I possibly can. Thank you for telling me how you stay on track. I already downloaded the app you use to lock your screen so it will help me with studying starting now. Can you open strategic studying? I'd love to hear your study tips and tricks. Mentee 2023-03-12, 21:01: Thank you so much for all of the advice. It has already helped me! Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:29: I'd love to get advice on what things you use most in nursing school and what is worth buying or not buying. What are the best tools? did you buy anything specific that has helped you a lot? Mentor 2023-03-15, 01:26: Here's a list of things that I got to help me through school! practicum; small notebook, stethoscope, stethoscope case from Amazon, pen light, good shoes (mine are Birkenstock but there are a lot of kinds out there), compression socks, lunch kit (because some hospital floors don't let students keep their lunch in the fridge), tri color pen (you'll need red and black for sure), and some kind of a watch (I have a fit bit but you can have a little clip on watch too!) school: a planner, a wall calendar, blue light glasses (it has saved me), note books, sticky notes and little page tab markers (for quick easy reference, I like to mark my sections), pharmacology flash cards (I bought pre-made ones), and I use the Microsoft notes for all my classes. Just know that if you're using an iPad as a computer, some schools need you to have a computer (like for online exams) because it needs that software. But I know so many people who study using iPads too! I don't have one and a regular laptop worked just fine for me! is this what you wanted to know about? definitely set yourself a little bit before school, like just have the basic essentials to study. Your instructor will give you a list of requirements before your first practicum shift so don't stress too much! don't forget to back up your computer... I know so many people who have had their computer crash on them during school. and join your university's textbook Facebook page. If you can, try to buy your books used! I saved so much money this way. I'll message you if I forgot anything, I have night shift brain right now! just to let you know, you can message me through here until April if you still have more questions :) I know your teacher said you guys are finishing up this week but I'll be here if you want! Mentee 2023-03-16, 12:23: This will be one of the last eMentoring sessions our Careers 12 class is doing. I wanted to thank you so much for being my mentor! It was great to do these discussions with you. All of the advice you gave me was super helpful and has made me a bit less stressed out about next year. Thanks again. Mentor 2023-03-17, 22:12: I'm so glad I was able to help you prepare for university! I loved every part of nursing, and am sad that my school journey is coming to an end. you will be a great nurse! good luck with everything! I hope you enjoy your university experience too! Have a great spring break!",,,,,

So you are all good anyway! I am happy to help you. Keep the questions coming. I've opened the next module. Feel free to start with the warm-up questions and then go onto the first anchor text. The warm-up for me: I am most physically and mentally healthy when I go to the gym, spend time with friends and family, watch soccer, and keep up with my schoolwork. I am least mentally and physically healthy when I'm not eating well and not doing the things I love (like those mentioned above). Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:42: The warm-up: I am most physically healthy when I go to the gym or workout and start eating good/healthy. I am most mentally healthy when I am getting stuff done and when I hangout with loved ones. I am least physically and mentally healthy when my room/space is messy and I stop doing the things I mentioned above 1) The warning signs: I know I'm not mentally okay when I start sleeping a lot more or just feel tired physically and mentally. I usually procrastinate a lot more and have a lot of mood swing, I lose a lot of motivation and I have bad eating habits. 2) I love to spend time with people I love when I'm feeling bad.I like to listen to music and bake or cook comfort food, I love to bike on nice days it never fails to make me feel better. Qeustions 1) How have you managed your mental health as an adult that's going to post secondary school? 2) Is there any tips you have on maintaining overall good mental health 3) How do you stay motivated to do you everyday tasks when things get overwhelming? Since this is our last week I was wondering if there was any other advice you have in regards to university and life as an adult.",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-15, 06:51: Hi Lindsay. My name is Brendan. It is nice to meet you. A bit about myself... I am a third-year university student at the University of British Columbia. I study biology and chemistry. I see your desire to go to UBC, also. Let me know if you have questions about the application process, life at UBC, the transition from rural to urban, etc. I am more than happy to help! Although I'm not in the business program, I have a general idea about the application process. I see that you're Indigenous, as well. I am also a member of an Indigenous community in BC. I think UBC accommodates their Indigenous students well, and you would enjoy the school in this sense. Aside from school, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, playing basketball, and enjoying the outdoors (hiking, biking, etc.). I see one of the things you're interested in is cafes. I also appreciate a good cafe (it makes for a great study spot). You can let me know a bit about yourself also and again, please send me any questions you have. In the meantime, let me know which module you would like to open first. Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:52: Hi Brendan. As you know my name is Lindsay and it's nice to meet you too! So sorry for not responding for a while we had some technical difficulties on our side the whole class had trouble with it. Also just as a heads up the class will only be responing on Mondays and Tuesdays. I am not really good with english so I'm sorry if these emails are unprofessional but I will try work on it! A bit about myself... I am in my last year of highschool and would like to go to UBC to get my realtor license! I'm currently taking mostly business related courses and other classes that will most likely help me in real life. If you don't mind could you tell me about the application process and what it's like to live in an urban place froma rural place. I am also indigenous and I like to play volleyball and I used to be on a basketball team for a couple years, I also enjoy biking. I think I'm a pretty chill person, I like to play video games like slime rancher, splatoon, and like any mario games. For the first module could we open either from rural to urban or post-secondary and career planning please if you don't mind!! Mentor 2023-03-13, 15:36: Hello. Those are great reflections on how you take care of yourself. It is excellent that you can recognize when you are not doing well. I manage my mental health by doing things I love and being consistent. I try to work out, plan out my days, spend time with friends, and eat well. One tip I have is to try to get enough sleep each night. Go to sleep at a reasonable time (before midnight) and try to get 7-8 hours of sleep. I stay motivated to do everyday tasks by making time and remembering I feel best when caring for myself. For example, I do laundry every Sunday, and this ensures my room doesn't get messy. Besides staying on a schedule, I try to break tasks into smaller tasks. For example, if I'm assigned a significant essay, I will try to start it by planning it out one day and then start writing the next day. This ensures I don't get overwhelmed and lose motivation. Mentoring you has been great, and I wish you the best of luck with university and life. My parting advice would be to get enough sleep, try to accomplish something each day (this is especially important for your classes), and try to maintain positive relationships with friends and family. If you have more questions, let me know! Mentee 2023-03-16, 12:30: Hi! This will be one of the last sessions our Careers 12 class is doing. I wanted to thank you so much for being my mentor! It was great to do these discussions with you even though we weren't able to complete them all. I hope you do well in your exchange program and any other classses you'll have! I wish you the best and thank you again these conversations have help me and I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to talk with me!! Mentor 2023-03-17, 04:38: Thank you for completing what you did! It's been a joy to help you and I wish you all the best with your future studies.","Mentor 2023-02-22, 06:44: Hello again. Thank you for introducing yourself. Don't worry about how quickly or slowly you respond. :) I have opened up the Rural to Urban Module. Feel free to start with the KWL chart. Otherwise, begin with the first discussion question. I'll start by saying giving an example for each... One thing I like about rural places is that I can be around family. I like having the support of my family and eating home-cooked meals. One thing I dislike about rural areas is that Amazon packages aren't delivered the next day. When I need something quickly in Vancouver, I can order it on Amazon and get it the next day! P.S. I am responding to you at odd hours. This is because I am on a one-semester exchange program in England, and it's the middle of the day as I write this. Mentee 2023-02-27, 13:13: Hi! So some of the things I like about rural places is it doesn't take that long to get to your destination. I like that it's not so chaotic because once in a while I like the quiet. In rural places you are able to make some good connections and that will make it easier to get a job because everyone knows everyone and you can create a good reputation for yourself. Two things that I don't really like is that there is not that much activities for teens or young adults and I wish there was more, I also wish there was more restaurants or fast food chains, the ones here are good but I just wish there was more of a variety. I have a couple of questions for you but if you aren't able to answer all of them that's totally okay! So my first question is what is it like going to school in a new city? My second question is what are your likes and dislikes about living in an urban place? finally my last question is do you think moving to a new city was good for you? Why or why not? Mentor 2023-02-28, 12:44: Hello. Those are great thoughts about rural places. To answer your questions: Going to a new school in a new city was initially daunting. It was difficult for me to get a grasp of how I should study and for me to make new friends. However, there was a lot of support for me from the university and opportunities to meet new people. All those around me were in the same boat and looking to make friends. It didn't take me long to settle in and at this point, you wouldn't even be able to tell I struggled. My dislikes about an urban city are how busy it is (traffic is insane), fewer green spaces, more expensive to live in, and the overall lack of space. I like watching pro soccer (I love watching the Whitecaps), the educational opportunities, the many restaurants (you pointed out the lack of food choices where you're from), and the diversity of people I meet. I think moving to a big city was good for me regarding educational opportunities and meeting new people. I've already touched on the downsides. I believe in the future, whether I live in an urban or rural place will depend on job opportunities and other relationships I create. Overall, I am happy I moved to a big city as this opened up new possibilities for me, and I always have the chance to move back home or to another rural place. If you want me to explain anything further, let me know. In the meantime, we can move on to the next anchor text discussion questions. You have a choice of two questions, so choose whatever you'd like :) Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:13: Hello again I am native and some of the traditions I love are drumming and dancing, it has never failed to make me feel better. It will always have a special place in my heart and I want to keep that tradition going even when I move. I also love having a seafood dinner before christmas, me and my silblings always look forward to it every year and I would like to keep that going too. I have my own drum and soon I will have new regalia so if there is ever a dance practice I will be prepared. I know that there are some events that are for native people in the place I will be moving to so I could go to those and my family will all be pretty close to eachother after we move so I'm hopeful that we still have seafood dinners even after I move. Some questions that I would like to ask you is, How did you keep up the traditions you found important to you when you moved away from home? My other question is how did you deal with your emotions when you moved away? Was there a specific way that you coped with them? Mentor 2023-03-04, 07:31: Hi. That's great you enjoy drumming and dancing. There's plenty of opportunity to that witness and participate in and around UBC. I also love seafood... specifically salmon for myself. After I moved away from home, I found comfort in cooking myself food, visiting the First Nation Longhouse at UBC (for the weekly lunch), and keeping in touch with my family. It certainly took some time to adapt to a new place, however, calling my family weekly helped greatly, and I would recommend doing this. I coped with my emotions by trying to meet new people, chatting with people in my classes, and participating in other activities I enjoy (like playing sports and other clubs). There are many opportunities to meet people and enjoy yourself in a big city if you put yourself out there. Keep the questions coming :) Let me know if you're ready to move on to the next module. I think earlier you mentioned post-secondary and career planning. Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:32: Hey. I would like to start a new module but I don't know if we will have enough time to finish it but I want to try. Could we move on to the well being and self care module please and thank you! Thank you for your responses in this module I did find it helpful and I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to answer my questions!!",,,,

Both firefighting and being a Coast Guard sound like pretty rewarding jobs. Is that school in Nova Scotia? That sounds fun to move away for a little bit. Anyways, I'm Lindsay. I'm actually from Terrace, so pretty close to Rupert. I went to University in the States and am now in my first year of Medical School at UBC. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask:) I unlocked a ""module thing"" for whenever you want to get started. It sounds like you're doing this for school, which might not be as intersting if you are forced to do it. But happy to go at your speed, and be here for any questions to help you get something out of this experience! Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:48: Hi Lindsay, Sorry for not responding for so long, we had some tech problems with log-ins and passwords. It's a stroke of luck that your from Terrace, I was just there last weekend. I should also let you know that our teacher has decided that we will only be replying on mondays and tuesdays, as opposed to every three days like the rules state. I'd love to hear more about your time in the States and at UBC, that seems like quite the adventure. My mother went to UBC so it would be interesting if you had any of the same experiences. I saw that you opened up the ""Rural to Urban"" topic, which I think is a perfect way to start it off. I look forward to talking in the future and progressing through the program. Mentor 2023-02-22, 17:11: Hi Malcolm, No worries at all about responding! Respond whenever works for you. I check my email quite regularly for school so I should always get the notification whenever you have time to respond. That's cool that your mom went to UBC. I'm having an atypical experience with UBC as I'm technically a UBC student, but i'm studying at UVic. This is because UBC has 4 campuses across BC where you can study medicine. It's kind of cool because it allows me to have a smaller class size (which I like and am used to since I've always lived in smaller towns). I also like not having to live in a bigger city like Vancouver. Victoria is the perfect size for me! Let me know what you think of the rural to urban topic. I'm happy to open a different one if you have a preference:) Also, please let me know if any of the tech stuff isn't working. I'm quite new to this so want to make sure that you have access to the links that you need! Or if you have any other questions that don't relate to the specific module/topic! Good to hear from you, Lindsay Mentee 2023-02-27, 12:57: Alright so I opened the conversation and its asking me to talk about three things i enjoy about living in a small town and two things i don't like. The best things i can think of are the short walking distances/commutes, the tight social network, and the local businesses. My family is pretty well known around Rupert so there's so many people we can reach out to. About a year ago my brother got in a pretty crazy tugboat accident near kitimat and the entire town was super supportive. My dislikes are mainly just that the scenery gets a little old after driving the same streets and areas for 17 years, and that it's often difficult to find things to do with friends. What was it like for you moving cities?","Mentor 2023-02-28, 09:34: 3 things I like: My favourite part about living in a small town is the community. I have had similar experiences to you where the community comes together to help people out when they are going through a tough time! I don't hear about that happening in the same way in larger cities. I also like the community because it's fun to bump into people that you know around town etc. I also enjoy the shorter commute! I like that it only takes a 10 minute drive to get pretty much anywhere that you need, and that it is also a short drive to get outside (ski hill, hiking, etc.). Victoria isn't a huge city, but it still can take an hour or longer to get to areas outside with less people. 2 things I don't like: I think the thing I dislike the most is how long it takes to travel anywhere! The north is pretty isolated. My partner is from Michigan and so getting to his family can take a long time! I really like good food. I foudn that Terrace never had any really good restaurants. It has been really fun trying out new places in Victoria all the time. But, there are so many pros and cons to living in a larger center also. I think you just need to focus on the positives and know that living anywhere isn't going to be perfect. I think that the transition can be tough. Especially if you don't have any connections and need to make friends from scratch! However, being part of a program is a great way to meet other students and get to know some people. I found that for me a difficult part was just getting around a new city. I am quite directionally challenged, so figuring out new directions and public transit was a little tough at the start. I still use Google Maps to direct me most places. Do you know where you hope to move after high school for your marine navigation program? What are you most nervous for or most looking forward to? Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:29: The college I'm trying to get into is way across the country in Westmount, Nova Scotia. I'm both very excited but also kind of nervous just because it's so far away from anyone I know. The idea of having a sort of ""fresh start"" is very appealing to me because Rupert is very small and it's getting a little old. I'm also a bit nervous because once i get there i will have no transportation outside of public transit, and I don't exactly have enough money for a car or bike because i am terrible with money. The most exciting aspect is really just meeting new people and being to new places. How often were you in contact with your family or friends at home? Mentor 2023-03-07, 09:05: That sounds like such a great opportunity to explore the East Coast and meet new people! You're going to have so much fun:) You're totally right that a fresh start can be exciting, but also scary. You might even find that you miss Prince Rupert and all its familiarities once you are settled in Nova Scotia. I was also nervous to use public transportation, however, I found that I actually really like it, now that I'm used to it. I take the bus to school every morning and I really like that I can just be on my phone, call my parents or friends, or get caught up on little errands on my phone. Thank goodness we have google maps and technology. I don't know what I would have done before that. I liked to have a set day where I would call my parents, so I called them most Sunday evenings. With my friends I did quite a bit of texting and the odd facetime call. It was nice to tell them about all of my new experiences and just how things were going in general. You mentioned that you are ""terrbile with money"". How are you feeling about managing money during school? Also, Charles Hayes mentioned that your class will be wrapping up this Mentoring project around spring break. If you want to keep asking questions, the mentor program can keep this conversation open! I know it's not for everyone, but I'm happy to keep messaging back and forth if it is helpful for you:) Mentee 2023-03-08, 13:30: So I'm apprehensive about saving money during school because I will definetly have to make some changes to my bank accounts. I work as a casual lifeguard right now which is a pretty good gig all things considered, but I spend my money very fast on weekend endeavours, my hobbies, and snacks. it kind of works out because I make a little more money than I spend every two weeks. Not to mention the trip to mexico I just booked will almost bankrupt me, but I'd like to have as much fun as I can while in highschool before i have to really start living on my own and such. The program i am applying to does provide me with an allowance which will help significantly. Mentor 2023-03-10, 11:28: That is totally fair. Managing money definitely takes some practice and life experience. Having an allowance will be very nice during your program in Nova Scotia! Would you like me to open up a new conversation? Do you have any other questions? Have fun in Mexico! Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:31: So I've been told we only have until this wednesday to finish this project so it's probably unneccessary to start a new conversation. Was there anything else that surprised you or that you think is important to know? Mentor 2023-03-13, 14:12: Okay! I understand that you are heading into spring break soon. Have so much fun:) Feel free to keep asking questions if you are interested, or else we can say our goodbyes. Hmm... some things that I think are important to know about transitioning out of high school into a new area: 1. Take every new opportunity (especially if it is meeting new people). Moving to a new area can be lonely and making some friends will really help. Even if they aren't like your typical friends, you may meet people through them. 2. If you aren't meeting many people, go explore on your own! You may meet people this way, or else it's just good for your mental health to get out of the house. Nova Scotia sounds beautiful! I'm quite jealous. 3. If you are thinking about pursuing another program after, get to know your professors/teachers. You don't need to be the teacher's pet, but professors often have great connections. They can also write you letters of recommendation in the future and it is a lot easier if they know more about you! 4. Whenever you don't feel like studying or going to class, remember how much money you're paying for it. That should get you out of bed. 5. If you find you have a lot of downtime, it might be worth it to get a little job to help with your money habits ;) Excited for you! You're going to have a great time.... and in the odd chance that you don't, change isn't for everyone and I'm sure Prince Rupert will always welcome you back:) Mentee 2023-03-15, 14:38: So today Is the last day I'll be able to respond so this is goodbye. Thanks for all the info you gave, it was very helpful and it gave me somewhat of an idea of what to expect. The application processes are turning out to take a long time and it testing my patience, but I figure it will be worth it in the long run. I appreciate the time you took to write all these messages. Thanks, Malcolm Dolan Mentor 2023-03-15, 21:57: I'm glad that you found this helpful! Best of luck in Nova Scotia and with those applications. You have got this!",,,,
1047586873,11/7/2022 12:10,1047592616,58981,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-22, 13:23: Could you tell me what your thought process and plans were for the conversation on Post-Secondary and Career Planning? To answer your question, since my family still lives in Kamloops, I knew I wanted to stay in Kamloops and go to TRU. Choosing a major was the challenging part. I changed my mind so many times as it felt scary to start something and not be completely sure if it was for me or not. Even though I didn't end up finishing my business degree, I'm glad I tried it as now I know what I don't want out of a job and I think that's really important when narrowing down what career is right for you! There were a couple different conversations in this section, so I hope that answers your question! It sounds like you have a few career paths you're interested in. The instructions say to look at what kind of education you need for your dream career and realistic career (personally, I think your realistic career CAN be your dream career!). It is important to look at a couple of different career options and paths though. When you're done this, let me know and we can discuss your findings! Mentor 2023-03-02, 15:18: Hey! No worries, the site can be a bit confusing at times. Those would be great careers! Both are different paths, but at the core of it it sounds like you want to help people. Moving onto the second queston, have you looked into what schools you want to attend and what factors are most important to you when chosing a university? For instance, does distance from family matter, size of school, amount of extracurriculars, etc? To answer your question, I'm extremely happy with my decision to pursue post secondary school. It's allowed me to come out of my shell and try things I never would have normally tried. I didn't have the best time in high school as I got bullied quite a bit. I associated education with being bullied, which is partly why I didn't go to university right away. However, it is completely different and I'm so glad that didn't hold me back. Do you like high school? Mentor 2023-03-03, 16:13: Also, let me know which conversation you want me to open next! :)",,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-14, 11:57: Hi Michael, Nice to meet you! I just looked over your profile and it looks like we have a lot of similar interests. I'm also looking for a job that betters people's lives - specifically in dermatology. I love skincare and think it would be so cool to make my own line one day. Also, what video games do you like to play? I like playing Divinity or Need for Speed. I'm a big advocate for gap years. I originally took 1 and then it quickly turned into 5. It sounds like you have a great plan for your gap year and are a forward thinker. Learning about the fields you'd like to pursue is smart! I took a deep dive into all things dermatology before changing my career path. I even contacted some dermatologists on Instagram to see what it was like being a derm and what they liked about their job. I was able to see if their answers aligned with what I was searching for in a career. Let me know what conversation you'd like to do and we can get started! If there's any questions you have along the way, I'd be happy to answer them. Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:43: Hi Emily! Apologies for the week-late text, my class had a few technical difficulties with logging in however it has been resolved! I also will be answering 1-2 times a week usually on a Monday or Tuesday! I'm super excited to learn from you as you have a lot of cool things in your message! Like your love for skincare, fashion, gap years and gaming! (I also love Pokemon and League of Legends). Reading that you transitioned from business to science, what made you make that big decision of switching to different educations? Mentee 2023-02-22, 12:19: Hi again! Expanding on deciding to switch education paths, could you tell me what your though process and plans were for the conversation on Post-Secondary and Career Planning? Mentor 2023-02-22, 12:58: Hello! Nice to hear you have a schedule planned, that way we can make the most out of the program! I decided to change programs during the start of the pandemic. Because we all had a lot of extra time on our hands, I was thinking about my future and if being in business aligned with what kind of job I wanted. I looked at all the different business majors and nothing was really lighting my heart on fire if you get what I mean. I decided I wanted a job that was a bit more hands on than sitting at a computer. When we were all still isolating, my mom dropped off a little care package that included these korean sheet masks that targeted different skin concerns. The packaging had the chemical structure of the main ingredient (I think it was collagen), and I thought to myself that it would be so cool to know what each ingredient does and how it mixes with one another. Up until that point, it never really occured to me that cosmetic chemistry was a field I could pursue. When I was in highschool I enjoyed chemistry and also thought being a dermatologist would be a rewarding job. However, no one in my family had been to university, let alone medical school, so I thought it was out of my relm of possibilities. Dermatology and cosmetic chemistry are two completely different fields/paths, but I did see a lot of overlap and I thought having a chemistry background would benefit me as a dermatologist. So long story short, I decided to bite the bullet and switch programs! Sorry for the long post! Mentee 2023-02-23, 12:34: Thank you so much for the response! I really appreciate all the time and effort you put into the my question because I really want to be strategic with my choices in life. Like my career! And it's really cool how you mention you got dropped off Korean sincare because that is what I use and learn most of my information from! I watch a bunch of Korean influencers and adore how much effort they put into skincare and is what made me love skincare more than ever. Again, thank you so much for being my mentor and I'm really looking forward to geting to know you and learn from you! Mentor 2023-02-23, 13:08: That's so cool that you're into that kind of stuff. What influencers do you watch? And you're welcome! I'm looking forward to being your mentor too. :) Mentor 2023-02-23, 13:11: I forgot to ask: are you going to the ""Meet the Mentor"" video chat on March 7 from 5-7pm? Mentee 2023-03-02, 10:57: Hi Emily! I am SO SORRY for getting back to you much later than I was supposed to. I somehow got confused with the answering and unnecessarily over complicated things but I finished the conversation. For my realistic career which is Teachers Assistant, you need: a highschool diploma and a completion of a ten month program in teaching assistance or social science. For my dream career which is Esthetician, you need: a highschool diploma and any sort of cosmetology program which could take 8 months to 2 years. Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:01: And for my question about Post Secondary and Career Planning, are you happy with your decision on going to Post Secondary School? Did you enjoy school before going to University? Mentee 2023-03-02, 11:01:  Mentee 2023-03-02, 18:46: I am also sorry for answering your very simple questions about the influencers on Instagram: Soobeauty, Wendyskin, Imhannahcho, Glowwithava, and Glowie Amelie Tiktok: sorayaskincares, _karlacruz_, glowingwithmary, misskena and thecalgaryesthetician Youtube: Soo Beauty, Tina Tanaka Harris, Liah Yoo, SACHEU and Michelle Phan! I love Soobeauty because she shares a bunch of affordable K-Beauty, SACHEU because she also does affordable skincare routines and Michelle Phan because she is so nice to listen to when I'm doing my skincare! I also buy 95% of my K-Beauty off of Jolse and they have amazing samples and they're priced pretty fairly. I am also thinking of attending the Meet the Mentor on March 7th! Thank you! Mentee 2023-03-02, 19:06: I am currently interested in attending Blanche Macdonald in Richmond! The biggest factors that concern me are money and if I'll enjoy city life. All my life I've lived in a small city with 12,00 people and everytime I go to Vancouver I equally enjoy my time but feel super drained. But it's also because we try to fit as much into our short time there and rest is only when we sleep and eat. And I am fully aware that my family is no where near financially stable enough to fund for me to live there and I would only have myself to rely on to live off of. Which is my main reason why I wanted to take a gap years and it's to make as much money as I can. I'm also super happy you like going to school now, It's happy to hear when someone's enjoying something in life they enjoy! And I'm sorry you had a bad highschool experience, people are awful and I hate them! But my reason for asking if you liked Post Secondary was because I don't really like learning in highschool. I am not interested in sitting down for multiple hours listening to a teacher, going home after a long day of school and work and then having to study until 12 or 2 am for a test. I understand that to do well you can't just coast through school, but that cycle has made me really hate school and I never even considered going to Post Secondary until this year. However, my reason for wanting to go Blanche Macdonald was because they offer an esthetician course where majority of everything is done physically and I'm actually learning for my future (dream and realistic) job! I also reached out to a local esthetician where I live and asked if she could be my mentor for my school project and she attended there. I am hoping to ask for a reference from her at the end of my current careers course so I cann begin my esthetician journey! Mentor 2023-03-03, 16:12: No way! I used to want to work in fashion and was planning on going to Blanche Macdonald. Moving from a small town to a city is definitely a big adjustment. Big cities are always a bit more expensive, so taking a year to save up is a smart idea. There's also so much to do in Vancouver, so you'll never be bored! I didn't particularly like learning in high school either, but in university you get to choose your classes which is really nice. It's much easier to learn if you're interested in the subject! I personally have never had to study late into the night for tests, but I know some people do. If you have a study plan and are organized, it's much more manageable. That's awesome you already reached out to an esthetician! It will give you a much better idea of what the job would be like. Getting hands on experience would be great. That's one of the reasons that drew me to chemistry! Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:23: Hi Emily! For our next conversation, could you elaborate on what Agency in the World means? Thank You! Mentee 2023-03-10, 14:26: Oh that makes it way easier to understand! I'd like to know the warm up question. Mentor 2023-03-13, 11:49: Hey Michael, I just got a message saying your class is wrapping up the program this Friday. You have the option to continue through the conversations, continue to ask questions/advice, or we can be done all together. Let me know what you'd like to do! Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:32: My most uncomfortable social interaction happened over a few months with a senior coworker at my first job. I worked at a grocery store as my first job and it was not too great. She made quite a few condescending comments towards me, talked about me to managment, and overall made me dislike seeing her name on the schedule if she worked with me. What I did to overcome the situation was just not letting it bother me. It worked and it made me realize many important realities of others and they behave a certain way because of their cirumstances in life. I go by the saying ""Hurt People Hurt People"" and I started to reassure myself that it usually wasn't my fault and I take complete responsibilitiy if it is then move on. Which makes me lead to not attending the Meet the Mentor event!! I am so sorry for not attending and not giving you any heads up or apology any sooner I was really looking forward to the event and I'm sorry for wasting your time if you waited for me. A lesson has been learned though and I put my important events on my calender then my lockscreen. Mentor 2023-03-13, 14:20: Thank you for feeling comfortable to share with me. I'm sorry you had to experience that. By the sounds of it, you handled it really well and have a good outlook on it. I agree with the saying, ""hurt people hurt people."" I'm glad you found ways to get through it. I definitely know the feeling of not liking a coworker.. hopefully you don't work at that grocery store anymore and don't have to be in those uncomfortable situations! No worries about not being at the Meet the Mentor event! I got an email from ReMBC saying you hadn't signed up, so I didn't go either. Mentee 2023-03-15, 14:29: I totally relate to you with asking for help! I try my best to figure out anything I don't know before I ask for help because I want to become somewhat independant. However my knowledge can only get so far and I used to ask for help wayyy later and I have stopped that habit! For my first ally, I would say my highschool teachers. My foods teacher brought out values and skills in myself that I didn't know I had, my french teacher showed me how to show platonic love and appreciation, my careers teacher taught me sooooo many important life skills and strengthened my appreciation for everything. They are all such great people that I have and continue to learn off of and I'm insanely grateful to have them in my life. My second ally would be my friend Amal. She is a very determined hard working person and she truly inspires me in so many areas of my life regarding hard work, discipline and independance! She has given me two job oppurtunies in our friendships and given me so much happiness. I also got her to join taekwondo but it was only for a week. My last ally would be my mother. I give her a lot of credits for my personality and she has very similar values to me. In my culture saying words like ""I love you"" are very foreign concepts and instead of saying that phrase, we show our love and appreciation through food. She's shown me great values as what it means to be a parent and how to affectly parent. Mentee 2023-03-16, 13:09: I am super sad but I think I will be finished with the eMentoring sessions today. I wanted to thank you sooooo much for everything you've done. It was an awesome oppurtunity to be able to talk to someone who had a similar interest in their career as me and I'm super grateful to have you as my mentor. Thank you sooooo much and have a good day! Mentor 2023-03-16, 13:19: I'm happy I was able to help you! I wish you all the best in your future endeavours!",,,,"Mentor 2023-03-06, 13:58: Great question! I had to look it up myself. So from my understanding, agency is different for each person. Depending on what resources they have, what their upbringing has been like, or gender, etc. will give them a different amount of capacity to overcome challenges in life. Grit is similar, but doesn't focus on your socioeconomic background and structual inequalities. Let me know if that makes sense and if you are comfortable we can discuss the warm up question. Otherwise, watch the video and we can talk about the discussion questions. Mentor 2023-03-11, 14:13: The warm up question is just above next to the guy wearing the red hoodie. It is: ""Think of the most uncomfortable social situation you've been in. What made you uncomfortable? Race, gender, etc.? Were you able to overcome it? How? Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:46: Discussion Questions: Think - THINK about times when grit and agency have been important in your life. Grit and agency can be important all throughout life. For example, I am in taekwondo and trained a year to reach my second degree black belt and definetly had a sense of grit and agency when I forced myself to train even when I didn't want to. Share - What is the relationship between “grit” and “agency”? Even though I did pass the test that required a lot of discipline and grit, I think those two areas of my lfie are very very weak. I am naturally a very lazy person and I often waste a lot of time leisuring, or sleeping when it could be used towards actual important things that need to be done. However, I do like to prep and I do it frequently so when I actually do it, it's less work for me. But for agency, I think i've used it way more then I ever have. I have and use a lot of oppurtunities that come my way and I've put a lot of effort into strengthening relationships with teachers and adults. As an adult and post-secondary student, what are your experiences of asking for help? Mentor 2023-03-13, 14:33: That's a great example, you definitely need grit for taekwondo. It sounds like you need to give yourself more credit! Taking advantage of frequent opportunities and strengthening relationships doesn't sound like laziness to me. It's totally normal to need leisure time too. Everyone has a different threshold of how much down time they need to not burn out. As for asking for help, I used to fall into the trap of waiting too long to ask for help in fear that I should be smart enough to figure it out on my own and don't want to bother anyone. However in reality, everyone in my experience has always been happy to help. I need to remind myself this so that I don't waste hours, sometimes days, worrying about something that could have been easily solved with the help of a professor or classmate. Please learn from my mistakes and ask for help when you need it! Mentor 2023-03-13, 14:38: Let's move onto the next discussion question! List 3 or more people in your life who are or might be your allies. Why did you choose these people and how are they able to support you? Mentor 2023-03-16, 12:28: It sounds like you have some great people in your life and put a lot of thought into who your allies are. I'm sure your high school teachers will be great references if you need them. Let me know if you want to start another conversation or we can be done when your class finishes tomorrow!",

Whats your favorite song? Sorry for the delay we had some tecnical difficulties on our end and i was alos away for the week where my teacher was setting up this program/account. have a good day -Renee Mentor 2023-02-22, 17:56: Hi Renee, I'm so glad to hear from you! You're my first matched mentee! I'm doing well. My friend came to visit me from another city yesterday. We had a lot of fun! To answer your questions, I don't have a favourite song, but I usually have my favourite with each band/artist. I'm going to Coldplay's concert with my friend in September! Yellow is my favourite Coldplay song. My favourite Green Day song since childhood has been Wake Me up When September Ends and Boulevard Of Broken Dreams. Lately I've been hearing It Rains (by Archie Faulks) and Anti-Hero (Taylor Swift!!!) a lot and trying to write something like that. I went to Lauv's concert last year. Not a lot of people know about him but I like some of his songs! Although I do hope he can work on the lyric part… Also, I've been hearing Symphony No.9 in e minor by Dvorak a lot. It's golden! I remember doing a musical form analysis in university and everyone complained so much haha. Sorry I talked too much! I guess everyone gets a bit carried away when they talk about the music they like. I read your profile and it's super awesome that you want to look into the topic of music and disability. It's so amazing that you write and record your own music in your free time! I didn't get down that path until 2019. I would love to learn more about the musicians who inspire you musically and in life! And I would like to know more about your pursuit after high school. I think perhaps we can start with something small. Perhaps you could pick out the questions you like and tell me about them? Discussion Questions (all optional) Tell me about your favourite musicians! Do you have a favourite song? If you could, what kind of music you would like to recommend to your friends? How did the musicians inspire you? In what way did they encourage you to pursue your musical dream? Have you worked on any musical projects in school? Did you enjoy it? What makes you want to learn about educating adults with mental disabilities? Have you thought about getting into the educational field? Are you still practising piano and guitar? Do you have a favourite piece? Feel free to write to me anytime when you have a question or a topic you would like to talk about! Looking forward to talking to you again! Hope all is well, Rosie Mentor 2023-03-02, 18:41: Hi Renee, I hope you are well! I wanted to see how everything is going. How are you? How's school? Have you given any additional thought to the discussion questions I sent you? Do you have any topics or interests that you would like to have a further discussion with me? Or any other topics in the Conversation that you would like to open instead? Let me know! :) Also, ReMBC is having a Meet Your Mentor Session next Tuesday. Would you like to attend this event? If you do, please remember to sign up! If not it's totally fine as well! It'd be fun to have a talk with you! If you have any questions or anything in general that you would like to share with me, please don't hesitate to send a message over! :) Best wishes, Rosie Mentee 2023-03-16, 12:33: Hey I'm so sorry I've been away and couldn't respond. But to answer some of your questions I love Shawn mendes, Camilla cabello, harry styles, nial horan, chase Hudson (huddy), and yungblud, and machine gun Kelly. I still do play my piano, guitar and ukulele. And still love to sing. I want to work with those with mental disabilities because I along with all of my friends have mental disabilities that are classified as invisible disabilities. Mainly FASD, and ADHD. Any way it is nice to talk to you and I know that this is the last time that we have class time to write but I would love to talk to you more soon!! Mentor 2023-03-25, 04:22: Hi Renee, It’s so nice to hear from you! No worries! I was just checking in to see if you are doing well. Thanks for your reply! I like some of the artists you mentioned as well. As for the rest, I’ll be happy to go look up their songs! I love your passion for instrumental playing and singing! Therefore, I came up with an activity that encourages you to continue composing. I hope you’d enjoy it! Warm-up Activity Introduce your city/hometown/community/school to your friends! Purpose: Explore the city landmarks (it can be your hometown, a local store you like, your school, etc.) through soundscape composition. Think about how you would like your audience to know about a place you love or have a lot of memories at. Method: You may use the attached websites or music apps to record “the sound of your city.” Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the listed apps, you can also keep track of your work by making the vocal and/or instrumental part(s) and recording it with your phone. Your work can be a combination of the sound your gather in the city and a simple melody you compose. Or you can find a beat and a musical style you like, and then create a demo. Or, go bold! The world is your oyster. Length: It doesn’t have to be long. Even 8 bars would be fine. Anchor Texts Since you have an interest in music-making and composition, I would like to recommend several websites/apps that allow you to record your own musical ideas. Feel free to explore these websites/apps! GarageBand (Recommend) You can make your own collaboration of audio. It’s beginner friendly. Try mixing the soundtracks of different instruments! (Requires Mac to download.) MuseScore 3 (Recommend) You can write down your music score here. Try to create your first music sheet! Soundtrap (Recommend) You can create your own musical projects and podcasts. https://www.soundtrap.com/home/creator/projects Bandlab It’s a music platform for you to record songs, remix, and collaborate music with others. https://www.bandlab.com/ Music Tech Teacher (Recommend) It’s a website about notes, rhythms, musical theory, etc. https://www.musictechteacher.com/music_learning_theory/music_learning_theory.htm Discussion Questions (Remember to tell me!) How would you like your music to be structured? What do you want your audiences to learn from your musical work? What is the most challenging part of this project? Completing Conversations Don’t worry about the deadline! You may take 4-6 weeks to finish this program. If you need more time, let me know! In the meantime, I would like you to: 1. Keep me updated so I can track your progress weekly. You don’t have to share your work with me if you’re not ready yet. But please let me know what you are working on and the progress you make every week. 2. Please let me know if you need any support or have any questions. I hope you can have fun through music making! 3. Don't forget to answer the discussion questions! If you have any ideas about the musical program you would like to work on, send them my way! Cheers, Rosie",,,,,

Have you considered other schools/programs? If this isn't helpful, we can choose a different discussion topic, let me know which one you're most interested in! Mentee 2023-02-23, 12:24: Hi Sarah, I just got my early UBC acceptance and I am pretty certain that is where I will be studying! I still think this conversation string can be useful though, as science/medical/healthcare seem to have a lot of different paths specialization wise. I see the activity, so I will take a look and get started! Mentee 2023-02-23, 12:31: Hey Sarah, update. I was just reading through the activity and was thinking of choosing a different conversation; I think the majority of it goes through a few of the steps I have already completed during my early application. If we have time though, I would love to hear about course selection after the initial application. I was thinking maybe Strategic Studying if that works with you! Taylor :) Mentor 2023-02-23, 22:50: Hey Taylor, Totally! I agree - will open strategic studying and let's get the discussion started!! Also, huge congrats on the early UBC acceptance - that's awesome :) Sarah",,,"Mentor 2023-02-23, 22:53: I must say, I've gone through my fair share of some prettttty bad studying... BUT, I remember I did a whole wack ranging from reading textbooks straight and highlighting what I thought were key notes, to taking notes based on learning objectives, to only solving problems... As much as I would've loved to say one strategy worked best 100% of the time, I felt like it really depended on the content! For math/physics, I really enjoyed just solving problems straight because I learned the concepts through the question solving. However, for biology, I enjoyed reading first to get a better idea and taking notes based on the learning objectives/key summaries... before answering questions. How about you? How have you been studying and whats your strategy for your different courses? Do you think high school and university classes will be similar or different? :D Mentee 2023-02-27, 12:59: I completely agree with your strategies! I loveee making flashcards... they were my saving grace for biology. I imagine university courses will have similar content as my highschool courses, but I am worried the structure will be different, especially coming from a small town. I think my main stress is studying the wrong things. Just this past week I studied the wrong section for my calc test. Maybe I need to be more organized, but it could also just be a problem with how I went about studying. I'll take a look at the videos in the activity section and see if there's anything that resonates :) Mentee 2023-03-02, 10:53: Hi Sarah, I put some thought into the discussion questions: I've used the strategy of connecting the course content with my life, things I already know or things they remind of of. This strategy really helped on tests, if I ever got stuck I had firm memories of reading certain things or concepts. One of the strategies that probably wouldn't work for me is spreading my studying over a two week period. Firstly, for certain classes I wouldn't have this much time between tests to really solidify my understanding. Secondly, because I have a packed schedule on a day to day basis. And then some questions for you: How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? How do your study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to your study strategies from high school? What have you learned about studying since you were in high school? Mentor 2023-03-03, 09:40: Hi Taylor, Love your reflections on these study strategies and from your experiences overall! Can you tell me more about how your classes are structured now? And I totally agree for flashcards for courses like biology or other memorization and application-sort of classes:) Regarding your calc class, I feel like 1/3 of the work is planning ahead staying organized. In my high school experience, even though we had different instructors for each subject, the class sizes were around 25-30ish people that I was familiar with, so I would be able to double-check with multiple people. I definitely felt like it was a bit more independent-led in university. For example, a lot of the first year science courses are upwards of 200 people in a large lecture room, so I spent my first week of courses getting to know the people around me and connecting on Facebook to have someone to contact to discuss course updates/questions just in case! University has really made me absolutely reliant on my calendar. Do you have a way to stay organized? You sound quite busy haha! About the video, I found that a lot of these tips were the active strategies that we were discussing about flashcards, practice questions, etc. That's fantastic that you've connected course content with previous knowledge/reminders. That is absolutely true that sometimes you might not have a lot of time between tests to exactly put this 'spaced reptition' into practice, but some courses have cumulative exams at the end of the term, which forces you to remember and continuously apply concepts that you might have learned 1, 2, or even 3 months ago. This might be a case where even though the spaced repetition might not be helpful for the tests and quizzes throughout the term, it will most definitely come in handy for the final exam! Great questions - I'll try to organize my thoughts here: 1. How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? Oh gosh, I'll say high school was a wee smidge long ago, so I don't remember *exactly* how high school classes were like. However, I think everything was a little more integrated and as cheesy as it is, there's a bit more 'handholding.' I remember there were a few people in my high school classes where they didn't hand in ANYTHING throughout the term, but the teacher was so lenient and still gave them credit if they submitted them all at the end of the term. In university, it was a complete change, where they'll hand out the course syllabus (overview of the content that will be covered, when the exams/tests/quizzes/homework will be and the deadlines, as well as any other relevant information) during the first week of classes, and everything else is self-directed. For example, if your professor doesn't teach the way that vibes with you (e.x., lots of talking but it doesn't make sense to you), the responsibility falls on you to go to office hours (TOTALLLLY RECOMMEND, these are like free tutor sessions/chance to ask questions and get to know your professor), google extra resources/problems to try understand the concept, etc. Because of this, I really went from no calendar to relying on my calendar to input dates of tests, homework deadlines, etc. to stay on top of things. I totally feel you on being busy day-to-day, so I really tried to implement the 'time blocking' method, where I would block out 2-3 hour chunks of my day in my calendar to complete my homework for the week, etc. Even during little breaks between classes or meetings, I would choose one task that would help me get closer to finishing my studying to try to decrease my procrastination. I think this was the most challenging part, was finding time between the classes, and the large number of extracurriculars that are available to you - there are SO many things you can do outside of class, finding balance between studying, being in class, and trying all the activities that seem interesting to you...was very difficult... 2. How do your study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to your study strategies from high school? What have you learned about studying since you were in high school? My study strategy in high school was highlighting and problem-solving. It got me through high school, but I don't think it would fly in post-secondary. One thing that I've learned about myself, is that I enjoy the writing aspect (the words + visual strategy and the problem solving strategy). Due to the sheer amount of information that you learn at in post-secondary, I found myself overwhelmed in the words when I was just reading the textbook, so sometimes, I would just dive into the problems and figure out the concepts as I go. This way, it also gave me an example to remember (e.g., as I was solving a problem about how deep an iceberg would be submerged, I learned about buoyancy. For future questions, I think back to how buoyancy principle was applied to the previous question, and try to apply those concepts in a new setting). For more diagrams/process related concepts, I really enjoyed drawing out the diagrams and also explaining it to myself. I remember watching a video about how you can't be a good teacher if you don't really understand, so I found that this combination of teaching myself/others, problem solving, and making visual/wordy notes, especially on concepts that I didn't understand. This also helped cut down on time as it was more strategic than the broadbrush studying of reading everything from high school haha SO SORRY for the word vomit, I hope some of this helped... SO MANY STRATEGIES that I have tried and failed and continue to try. Even with whatever I mentioned, unfortunately you'll just have to try and see what works best for you too! It sounds like you already have a few established strategies that will translate just fine in a post-secondary context and I'm excited for you to try new strategies (maybe fail some), and add them to your toolkit of study strategies:)",,"Mentor 2023-02-16, 17:13: Hi Taylor, Nice to e-meet you! I read your profile and saw that you work as a pharmacy assistant, and love your science classes! I'm excited that you'll be studying at UBC, and talk all about balancing life and getting prepped for UBC :) I recently finished my Masters in Rehabilitation Science (focusing on stroke) at UBC, but I also completed my BSc at UBC as well, so I've been here for a while... Looking forward to our discussions together Hoping to hear back from you, and then we can get started on our conversations! Sarah Mentor 2023-02-21, 10:06: Hi Taylor, Following up on this! I assume things are busy with school/life? Looking forward to hearing back from you :) If I don't hear from you by the end of the week, I'll open a conversation to begin our discussion Sarah Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:36: Hi Sarah, So so so sorry for the delay, my class had some technical difficulties, but thankfully they are all resolved now. So happy to hear from you! I am really excited to talk to you an get some insight on career paths and course selection as a science student who isn't exactly sure what my end goal is. I'd also love to here about all your years at UBC as you've definitely had lots of experience! Taylor Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:37: Hi Sarah, I've heard about how teaching others is the best studying and I completely agree. I have a friend who comepletely relied on me in chemistry to re-explain the lessons to him. As much as it was a pain, it really solidified my own understanding in the long run. For the past two years (because of covid) our school has run on a Copernican system, which is basically just two classes a day for about ten weeks. I have thrived with this system because it leaves me with sooooo much more time to focus on each subject, but I find I forget the content much faster. For example, in my calc class we just finished different kinds of differentiation so our midterm is coming up. That means I need to review stuff that I leant only 2 weeks ago... but we did it for such a short time I am not as confident. I'm sure once I review it, it will come back to me but it is crazy how fast knowledge leaves my brain. I am for sure a list person so calenders and to-do lists are integral to my productivity. I think once I get used to the new schedule I can exercise different strategies to figure out which ones work. I am so excited but also super stressed... maybe anxious? I'm not sure but I cannot wait to get started. Mentor 2023-03-12, 14:39: Hi Taylor, So sorry for the late response! I couldn't find your response for the longest time, and then I saved my response as a draft and never sent it until I got a reminder email :') Haha, as much as it sounds like a pain about teaching chemistry to your friend, I'm glad it worked out and help you fully understand the concepts. I've never heard of the the blocks/terms being called a Copernican system schedule, but now I understand (after lots of Googling). This is so interesting, I always had it as an A/B schedule, I think... basing it off of the ones here: https://www.edglossary.org/block-schedule. I almost find the beauty of the Copernican system is that it almost aligns a little better with how it is in university - even though you meet 1-3x/week, the content flies by so fast so if you use similar strategies to refresh your memory, would strongly recommend to continue doing that! I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU!! Yes, I fully agree - ultimately, you'll find what works best for you with your schedule and your interests. You seem like you're so on top of things already, despite some challenges with finding time, I am confident you're going to thrive and figure it out in uni:) I just wanted to touch base about the other modules... I know that it's spring break soon and that you technically only have to do one module. Wondering if you wanted to chat about any of the other topics or anything else? Let me know, happy to chat about anything, everything continuously with no stress about doing this for class Let me know, Sarah Mentee 2023-03-23, 20:22: Hi Sarah!! I am SO sorry for the extremely late response. I went out of town for a dance competition and it completely slipped my mind. I am touring the UBC campus tomorrow and I'm overwhelmingly excited. It's all becoming real... My class is finishing up with our eMentoring unit, but I just wanted to say thank you for all your help and support! it's been pleasure talking with you, I wish you all the best! thanks, Taylor :) Mentor 2023-03-27, 11:53: Taylor, absolutely no worries :) Thanks for the confirmation, and all good with me! Hope the UBC tour went well, and perhaps I'll see you around! Best of luck finishing up with the rest of school and HAVE A GREAT TIME AT UBC",,,,,
1047550355,11/7/2021 12:15,1047592603,58977,,"Mentor 2023-03-19, 09:04: Once again, it was great talking to you and I really hope that you learned something valuable that will help you out in the future! There is a short survey above that you are encouraged to fill out.","Mentor 2023-03-09, 17:34: Self care is something that is really important for everyone and I think it is something that many students struggle with as they start university because of all of the changes that can be overwhelming. I have noticed that some signs that I need to step away and take a break include getting easily distracted (as the video mentioned) and just having low energy and feeling unmotivated. It is definitely true that your productivity can go up after you take a break. During these breaks, my most favourite thing to do is to listen to music - it gives me a chance to relax and take my mind off of the task I was working on so that I am refreshed and ready to go back. What are some things that are part of your self care action plan? Do you have any specific questions? Mentee 2023-03-13, 12:52: I often over work myself and have trouble taking breaks, which I know and can always feel that it is unhealthy. I forget how taking small breaks can make me feel so much better. I know when I go off to university being away from my family will be extremely hard for me and a major adujustment. Whenever I am away from my friends and family, my mood defientely darkens. My warning signs that I need to step back and take a break are feeling very low energy, extra sad and emotional, and I get very frusterated and irritated very easily. When I am overly tired and need a break or in a little bit of a funk, I find that exercising is what helps me relax and lift my mood. It allows me to spend time with myself and focus on my mental health. Reading is also something that helps me with relaxation and brings me joy. How have you navigated managing your mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do you have any advice for finding mental health resources? Mentee 2023-03-15, 14:40: Unfortunately my class is ending e-mentoring very soon, because of that I am going to also do anchor text 2 as well. I always want to improve on my self-care. Most of the time I get enough sleep, I eat pretty healthy, get enough exercise, but I absolutely do not drink enough water. I also need to make more time for my family because I am finding myself getting upset because I have not made enough time to just relax and catch up with my parents and grandparents. Three changes I can make right now to improve my self care is make a goal to drink 1L of water everyday, add exercise to my routine every morning, and make sure to spend some quality time with my loved ones. How I will make these three changes a part of my life Drink more water Instead of filling a cup with coffee every morning, I can fill up my favourtie water bottle and make sure to remember to bring it with me to school, to encouage myself to drink it Exercise more regularly I can add an hour of exercise (the gym) to my morning routine before school everyday Spend more time with family Plan a movie night with my parents and grandparents once a week to make sure we have time to see eachother and catch up What self-care challenges should I be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can I do to overcome them? On the other hand, what is easier about self-care when you're an adult and post secondary student? Mentor 2023-03-15, 20:39: Hi Bianca, Here is a response to your message about anchor text 1: You mentioned that being away from family and friends can be difficult - and I certainly can see that. Perhaps another small break in between work can be giving one of them a call! It can really lift your spirits and give you some extra motivation. It is nice to hear that exercising is a way that helps you set time aside for your self. This is another really healthy form of a break. In university and/or as an adult, I think talking to friends and family is something that really helped. When you are feeling down or stuck, talking it out can really help. Additionally, I know that universities offer a lot of mental health resources and I would say find out what these are for the school you attend and do not be afraid to use them. I have heard that these resources are under-used by students so be sure to check them out. Mentor 2023-03-15, 20:47: In response to your second message: Just a quick note that even though your class is ending e-mentoring, you can still continue with this program after your class is finished! This is just an option I am making you aware of - do not feel pressured to continue if you do not want to :). I am happy to hear that you are continuously improving on your self care! I can also relate to the point about not making enough time for family. All of the changes you have suggested seem realistic and I think they are great steps towards even better self care! For your first question, I would say that the university experience really varies from student to student (for example, some students' biggest concern is making a friend, but that is no problem for others). So there really is not one challenge that 100% of the students will face. But, some common self care challenges can be eating right since this is a newer responsibility for many students. So perhaps think about how you can continue to eat healthy and make a plan. I really like your second question! I think something that is easier about self-care is that fact that you really dictate your own schedule - you pick when your classes are (times and days) and this can help you structure your day so you can take care of yourself. On the other hand, in high school, you are in school for a set time everyday and you have less control. Let me know if you would like me to go into more detail on anything or if you want to talk about anything else :). Mentee 2023-03-16, 12:29: Thank you Navkiran! I can definitely understand that eating right for people when they move away from home could be a challenge. I feel like I can see that being a challenge for myself because I often rely on my parents to be making my healthy dinners, and food is so expensive. One thing I am excited for when entering post secondary is getting to choose my own schedule a bit more and not having to be in school the same times and days all the time. I am hoping with that, it will give me some space for my own needs and mental health. This will probably be the last eMentoring sessions our Careers 12 class is doing. I wanted to thank you so much for being my mentor! It was great to do these discussions with you. Thank you for answering all my questions! Mentor 2023-03-19, 09:03: I am glad you found these conversations helpful and it was so nice talking to you! I wish you the best of luck for your future! To finish the program, we usually end off with the ""Wrapping Up"" section :).",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-22, 18:14: This Conversation is all about studying! The video above shares some great tips about studying - do you use any of these strategies already? If so, which ones? Do you find them helpful? I think one of the most important things from that video was spaced practice. Over the years, I have found that this truly helps you retain information for a longer period of time and cramming is not nearly as effective. If you have any specific questions about studying, please feel free to ask! Mentee 2023-02-27, 13:04: I often tend to cram stydying in, but when I have notice before a test I am more successful and use the spaced practice method. I find that this strategy has been the best for me out of the others I have tried. I have also tried the elaboration method and it is helpful but spaced studying still helps me more! How do your study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to your study strategies from high school? What have you learned about studying since you were in high school? Mentor 2023-03-01, 07:35: Everyone has had to cram at some point, but it is best to avoid it if possible. In my university courses, all deadlines and exam dates are in the syllabus so you always know when an assesment is coming up - that can help you space out your studying! My study strategies have evolved since high school and I think the main reason was the fact that there is much more content. I think the biggest thing that I learned about studying is that you just need to find what works for you! Some of these techniques may be great for some students, but may not be helpful for you and that is okay! Try different things out and if they help you, stick with them. Something that I tried out in university was the Pomodoro technique where you work for a set period of time and then have a short break, and repeat. I find that this is helpful to get me started with studying! But I also still do some things I did in high school, like saying concepts out loud. Another thing I want to mention is that studying looks different depending on the course. For instance, math and biology require different methods. Let me know if you have any other questions - what are you most concerned about in terms of studying in university? What do you expect will be the hardest part? Mentor 2023-03-05, 12:31: I am glad to hear that you feel like you now have some strategies to try out so you can find what works for you. I know you said that you are concerned about finding the right strategies and understanding the content, but remember, everyone has these concerns too! They are all figuring out the best ways to study so you are not alone! You also mentioned work-life balance which can be tough to maintain especially when you are making the transition to post-secondary. But again, I think it is helpful to remember that everyone is feeling the same way so you can maybe find some peers and all help each other acheive that balance. There is another conversation related to Wellbeing &amp; Self Care which also ties into this so let me know if you are interested in exploring that as well. Let me know what else you would like to talk about in terms of studying, if there is anything, and please feel free to ask any questions or ask me to elaborate on some of the things I have already said. Also, as a side note, I noticed that your last message was sent in the ""Start Here"" category rather than the ""Strategic Studying"" one so this is just a gentle reminder to comment under the Coversation we are currently on to keep things organized! :) Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:28: Sorry I sent it in the wrong category again!! Thank you for all of your suggestions and advice on studying. Sorry for sending my reply in the ""Start Here"", I totally did not notice. Although my class does not have much time left for e-mentoring, can we still open another conversation?even if there is not quite enough time to finish it. If that's ok to you can we please open ""Well being and Self Care""? Mentor 2023-03-09, 17:27: No need to apologize! And, yes, we can definitely work through ""Well being and Self Care""! I will open that up :)",,"Mentor 2023-02-18, 08:46: Hi Bianca! Nice to meet you - I'm Navkiran :). I am currently finishing up my biology degree and will be headed to dental school shortly after. I noticed that you also have some interest in dentistry so if you have any questions about that, we can definitely discuss them throughout the program! In my free time, I like to spend time in the kitchen or relax with friends and family. What do you like to do in your free time? Feel free to add anything else that you want to share! Mentee 2023-02-21, 12:41: Hi Navkiran! Im Bianca. Sorry for the late reply, I was having technical difficulties on my end but now it is all fixed. I am currently stuck between career paths. I was set on doing dental hygiene but my other choice is to go into social sciences. I am only doing e-mentoring once a week in class on Mondays or Tuesdays! Although I love school and learning, on my spare time I work my two part time jobs, one at a goldsmith shop and my other job I tutor younger children in math and english. I like to stay active by going to the gym. When I have free time I also enjoy spending it around my family or just relaxing at home. Mentee 2023-02-22, 12:18: Hi Navkiran, we want to start on Monday. Is it possible to open ""strategic studying""? Thank you! Mentor 2023-02-22, 18:09: Hi Bianca, We can certainly talk about the two career paths you are thinking about in one of the Conversation topics, if you choose to! It is nice to hear a bit about what you do outside of school - your part time job at a goldsmith shop seems very interesting! And, yes, I will open up ""Strategic Studying"" and we can go from there! Mentee 2023-03-02, 10:52: I totally agree that different courses will mean different studying strategies. I think the thing I am most concerened about in terms of studying in university is struggling to find the right strategies and not being able to understand the content, but now I have some different stratgies to try out! I expect that finding the right balance for studying all of the different courses but also still trying to stay happy and have a life will be the toughest part for me. Mentee 2023-03-06, 12:25: Thank you for all of your suggestions and advice on studying. Sorry for sending my reply in the ""Start Here"", I totally did not notice. Although my class does not have much time left for e-mentoring, can we still open another conversation?even if there is not quite enough time to finish it.

Hope your spring is going well :) I have unlocked general discussion, however, this conversation does not have any anchor text. Was there something specific you would like to discuss? If there isn't anything specific you want to discuss, feel free to pick any other conversation (the rest of them contain anchor texts). I am fine with either :)",,,"Mentor 2023-05-10, 23:59: Hello Brendan! I have just opened this conversation ""Career Exploration"". Let's work through Anchor Text 1! Anchor Text 1 prompts you to think about how you values can inform your career choices. I think it would be a good idea to start by discussing what values are. What are values? Mentee 2023-05-26, 09:54: What do you value in life?I value friendships and being a part of a healthy and connecting family. How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? I want to contribute being a hard worker who is nice and kind to mostly everybody in my community Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? Like i said i have always wanted to be a mechanic and has been my dream job for a long time. if i had to pick another career path i would probably want to be a editor for movies and videos because i like editing videos to make them unique. Mentor 2023-05-30, 10:49: I totally agree with your values! Friendships and family are the backbone of our (or at least my social life). We humans are social beings, therefore we cannot function in isolation. From a very young age, we are influenced by the actions of those surrounding us, shaping us and our values. The career choices you have mentioned would have a contributing effect on the society your in. As a mechanic, you would be helping people move from point A to point B making everyday easier for them. As a video editor, you might motivate/spark an idea that would shape someone's future. We humans are influenced by minor things subconciously that might dictate our future. Currently, I am working in the healthcare sector as I have always imagined as a kid. I would like to be a doctor someday; improving patient's lives. Once you are ready to move on to Anchor Text 2, pleace complete the following quiz: https://careerdiscoveryquizzes.workbc.ca/#career-quizzes and take a look at the discussion questions. You are also more than welcome to keep discussing Anchor Text 1 :)",,,"Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:38: hello My name is brendan, I really like mechanics and working on mostly dirt bikes and cars I like many sports such as soccer, hockey, and many others. Im an athletic person I race motocross as a sport i go riding every week and I like hanging out with friends a lot and somtimes I play video games but not very much lately. How are you doing and tell me about yourself? Mentor 2023-02-14, 02:35: Hello Hello! I am doing well! Thank you for asking! ??My name is Alwalid (you can call me AJ, that's my nickname because no one can actually pronounce my name, but there is no issue around that here because there won't be any pronounciation LOL), and I am excited about being your mentor. I am in my third year of university, studying biology and computer science at UBC (Vancouver). I am currently enrolled and working at my co-op (which gives you the opportunity to work in the field you are studying, foreshadowing future careers). I enjoy playing sports (soccer and basketball) and listening to music. plus I am a car enthusiast. How are you finding the second semester of school to be? Any specific goals in mind you would like to achieve? What position do you play in soccer? What sparked your interest in working on cars? Wow, motocross is very fun. It is definitely on my list to try but have never had the opportunity! Feel free to ask me or talk to me about anything that’s on your mind. I will do my best to answer?? Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:24: My second semester is going pretty well, I like all my classes and I have lots of people who I know in all my classes, and I think the rest of the year is going to go well for me. My goal is to get all of my required classes to graduate done in my grade 11 year so in grade 12 I do not need to be at the school and instead I can be at the collage doing the automotive course for the year and another goal is tho create a resume and apply for a job somewere that will help me with becoming a mechanic, and so I can pay for parts for my dirt bike because motocross is an expensive sport. I use to play soccer and my main position was striker but I would sometimes play defense and goalie. I got interested in cars at a young age because I would help my dad work on them all the time and when I got into motocross I started to have to do a lot of maintenance to keep my bikes running good and to not have any problems. I do recommend trying out riding dirt bikes it is very fun and not too hard to learn.?? Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:28: Hi aj please open the from rural to urban conversation i would like to work on that. Mentor 2023-02-21, 01:28: I am very glad that your semester is going well! It is very impressive how you have your plan set for grade 11 and 12. It is a solid plan. Creating a resume is a very important step that needs a lot of planning and research. You will see that you will need to your resume based on the job description to highlight your strengths. You may have a lot of skills but the way you showcase them is even more important! Do you like being a striker the most? It is very nice you are learning how to maintain cars and bikes, will definitely save you a lot of money in the long run! That is one goal/skill I hope to have and learn. Will definitely save money and is fun and rewarding. Mentee 2023-02-22, 11:18: Yes I did like playing striker because it was my main position. I do also like playing goalie because i was good at it but I was better at being striker so that became my main position. I dont play soccer anymore tho because when the pandemic started we werent allowed to play games so I quit and joined motocross and I am having a lot of fun with it. Mentee 2023-02-24, 10:00: 1. What are 3 things you like about living in a rural area? I like living in a rural area because, I like having privacy and not very many peopole crowded in one town or city, I like being able to explore the wilderness and do a lot of outdoor activities in a big open space, and I like living in houses out of citys where we are not living near many people so we can have peace and quiet and do anything we want without people knowing what we are doing 2.what are 2 things you dont like about living in a rural area? What I dont like is having not very many job opportunities in a small town, but other than that I have nothjing else because I like where I live. 3.One question you have about living in or moving to the city? what do you like and dislike about living in a city? Mentor 2023-03-01, 02:29: Sorry for the late reply! I got stuck in transit between Toronto and Vancouver; my flight got delayed several times due to the weather conditions :( The pandemic definitely halted a lot of team sports. My UBC soccer intramurals team stopped playing once the pandemic started. Now we are trying to get set up again! Glad you are enjoying motocross! Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:09: Hello I am back from spring break. How was the last 2 weeks for you Mentor 2023-03-30, 00:18: Hello! I hope your spring break went well! My last 2 weeks were fine. Unfortunately, I got strep throat, so I took a few days off work to fully recover so that I can go back to work refreshed (as I have mentioned before, I am doing co-op, which is a program that allows you to gain work experience in the field you are studying). I have managed to extend my placement at this position as well until the end of summer so that was very exciting! How was your spring break? Did you end up riding your bike often? Also, I have started a discussion around Anchor Text 2 in ""From Rural to Urban"" conversation. You are able to view my message under that conversation :) Mentee 2023-03-30, 10:11: My spring break was good I had a lot of fun, I went riding pretty much 3 times a week and it was awesome because we had very good weather in the second week. Mentor 2023-04-04, 15:12: That sounds like a great time! I am glad you had fun! The weather was indeed really good. Hopefully the summer will not come around late. I will send you another message under the activity ""From Rural to Urban"" so that you can see where to respond to my text regarding Anchor Text 2. I hope to hear from you soon! Enjoy the sunshine when you can :) Mentor 2023-04-26, 08:45: Hey Brendan! I hope your weekend went well! We have just finished the conversation ""From Rural to Urban"". I enjoyed having that conversation. What other conversation would you like to unlock? Please let me know and we can jump right in and start! Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:12: Can you please open general discussion Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:07: Can you please open career exploration.","Mentor 2023-02-21, 01:40: Hey Brendan! I have opened this conversation :) We can start with ""Anchor Text 1: Taking Flight"". Explain your reasoning for each question :) What are three things you like about living in a rural area? What are two things you don't like about living in a rural area? One question you have about living in or moving to the city Hope to hear from you soon! Mentor 2023-03-01, 02:50: One surprising thing you will notice about cities (my experience from living abroad in a big city in the Middle East and Vancouver) is that you get your privacy. You willl notice that even if there are a lot of people around you, all of them are busy with their own little world. You are able to control how private you want your life to be :) I totally agree with you! Moving to the city to gain work experience is a great opportunity. For example, my co-op (work/learn program) provides job opportunities in larger cities such as Toronto. By assessing the expenses, skills you want to gain, and lifestyle, you would be able to determine if it is a possible choice to move to a city to gain some experience that can benefit you in the future. What I like about the city is the great diversity; you meet many people and eventually gain the skill of deciding who you want to surround yourself around. What I dislike about the city is the routine; you will eventually notice a flow of the week that is constant among all the people living in the city. I enjoy a bit of change which I do not encounter in Vancouver. Please let me know if you have any questions about living in the city, I am more than happy to help :) Also, whenever you are ready, let me know and we can start on Anchor Text 2 :) Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:19: I am ready for anchor text 2 Mentor 2023-03-08, 09:31: Hey Brendan! Anchor Text 2: Same but Different has 2 activities. 1) What are some activities and places in your hometown that are speical to you? Now, do some research on the location you are interested in moving to after graduation and find some comparative places and activities for each item you thought of. If you were to move away after graduation, where would you move? You have mentioned before that you race motocross and it is one of your favorite hobbies. You can look up where you would be able to continue pursuing your hobby in the ""potential"" place of living. You also enjoy playing sports like soccer, so you are able to research some recreational teams that you can join. 2) THINK of a tradition from your childhood, and what made it special to you. Is there something that you did – or even still do – on your own or with your family and/or friends that gave you a sense of connection or belonging? It doesn’t need to be any kind of ‘big deal’; sometimes the simple things are what stick with us in surprising ways. Some traditions might have a sentimental attachment to where you grew up. What are some of your traditions? You are able to pick one of the activities or both to discuss. I am curious to hear your responses on both however :) Mentor 2023-04-04, 15:13: Hey! Here is a quick message to let you know where to respond to Anchor Text 2 :) Please let me know if you have any questions :) Mentee 2023-04-14, 10:08: Anchor text 2: What activities and places in your hometown are special to you? My favorite activity is obviasly motocross as you can probably tell, I also like riding my mountain bike with my friends because there are a lot of trails and mountain bike jumps where I live. Probably my favorite place to go is to the lookout which is on the top of a mountain where you can see the entire town from a clearing in the mountain. Now, do some research on the location you are interested in moving to after graduation and find some comparative places and activities for each item you thought of. I really like it where I live and i wasnt really planning on leaving anytime soon, but if I were to move someplace else i would probably pick Alberta because there are a lot of huge properties and there are many motocross tracks nearby. I would also go to alberta because there are a lot of mechanics shops around that are high paying. THINK of a tradition from your childhood, and what made it special to you. Is there something that you did – or even still do – on your own or with your family and/or friends that gave you a sense of connection or belonging? One of my main traditions that I did with my family was on sundays, we would go to coombs country candy on the side of the highway leaving town and we would always get gelato or ice cream. I always loved coming here and somtimes seeing cool cars drive by in the summertime, This place is also right beside the trail to the lookout I was talking about so whenever we go for a hike or ride our bikes up the mountain we always get something from coombs country candy when we come back down. • How did you find comparative activities and locations when you moved away from home? What were you feeling when you moved away from home, and how did you deal with these emotions (both the good and the bad ones)? Mentor 2023-04-19, 14:13: My apologies for the late response, I was sick the past week :( I can definitely tell you really care about motocross and any place you move to must have trails so that you can keep riding! I am glad you enjoy where you live now and it is also great to see you have thought about Alberta and what it can offer you in terms of your future (working at mechanic shops). The tradition you and your family carry is very wholesome :) If you ever move, you will definitely have the opportunity to create traditions and memories. Although these traditions might be different than what you are used to, they would be nice. One quote I love to go by is “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.” By that, I always remember to appreciate the good times with family and friends, even relaxing alone time :) When I moved away from home, I moved with all my family except my dad. Therefore, the transition was smoother than expected. I was still surrounded by the same people that I have created so many memories with at home. However, there were a few hiccups. I felt homesick. I always found my self looking at photos from my time at home (with my friends etc.). I dealt with those emotions by appreciating the time I had and knowing that I have an opportunity to create similar memories here. Accepting that the current place I live is my home was one of the main ways I dealt with my emotions. We have just completed both of the activities under this conversation. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like to discuss any of these topics further!",,,,

So in this section, I'll get you to reach the newspaper article and then watch the video under ""anchor text 1"" and then we can chat about some of the stuff was saw + any other things that come to mind as well while your working through the info. Let me know when you get the chance to check those out!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-10, 09:18: Hey Zoey! My name is Isabella/Izzy and I'm going to be your mentor until May! A little bit about me - I'm in my 5th year at the University of Victoria studying biochemistry and I'm (hopefully) in my last semester of classes. After that, I'm going to be applying to med school next fall to be a doctor (again hopefully) :) Although school definitely takes up a lot of my time, when I'm not studying or working I love painting, reading and exploring around the island since its such a beautiful place! I saw that you were hoping to learn more about living on your own, being an adult etc. and I definitely have some experiance with that since I moved out of my hometown and began univeristy at 17. Even though everything worked out ok, it was a massive learning curve and I made literally so many mistakes. Enough about me, I hope that you're enjoying high school and are excited to start chatting about life after graduation! Do you have any favourite classes? I saw that you liked astronomy and I completely get that because its super sick and I've taken a few astro classes at UVic! Let me know if you've got any questions right off the bat and if not just tell me a little bit about yourself and which conversations you'd like to start with in the program. Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:40: hey, my name is zoey and im 15 years old. i really like to learn more about ""adulthood"" and science. in my free time i like too paint or draw, and go on walks. i like sports as well, used to play basketball, i used to play soccer, used to play rugby and wrestling. thank you for this oppotunity and id really like toget to know you more. Mentor 2023-02-13, 10:04: Hey Zoey! That's super cool that you like to paint and draw, I also love painting when I've got some free time away from studying and I took Art for three years in high school which I found really fun as well! Thats also a very impressive amount of sports, I only did figuring skating in high school, are you doing any sports right now or taking a little break? I'm so happy to help you learn more about adulthood :) Is there anything in particular you're thinking about doing after high school? Like travelling, staying and working, moving someplace else for school/work etc. If i have an idea of that, then I can give you some specific examples of what I've had to learn over the past few years and what my friends have gone through as well Also, if you scroll to the top of this page, there a big circle with a bunch of different conversations on it. Each conversation is about a different topic thats related to things you might have to deal with after graduation (and now too). It looks like your teacher has assigned us to work through 2 of these conversation but the ones that we do are completely up to you! Let me know if anything looks interesting! I was thinking maybe ""Well being and self care"" because that covers a lot of ""how to adult stuff"" or maybe ""postsecondary &amp; career planning""? Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:15: im taking a little break from sports, im thinking about moving to iowa but i dont really know cause i have no information on it, like the price range. we can do Well being and self care if you'd like? it doesnt really matter to me",,,,,

I want to have a family, have kids. And I want a house that I can raise my kids in. I would like to give back to my community. and I would like to be a part of something like a local sports team. Mentor 2023-05-15, 12:02: Hey Zayden. Those are all great things to wish for and want, I completely agree with you. It sounds like you're already getting ready to settle down haha. At this point, I'm still not sure if I want kids yet, but I'm glad you seem so excited and family oriented! Mentee 2023-05-16, 10:18: One of my goals is to get stronger, I do this by ging to the gym every tuesday and thursday with my friends this also helps improve friendships. What goals did you have when you were in high school? Did you achieved them? If so, how? If not, what could you have done differently? Mentor 2023-05-18, 18:26: Getting stronger is a wonderful goal to work towards, and going to the gym also satisfies healthy exercise requirements! As you mentioned, finding things that you and your friends enjoy doing together is an awesome way to improve relationships and hang out. Back in high school, I wasn't thinking about too much except for academics. Halfway through (around grade 10-11), I started really working towards high grades because I wanted to get into my university of choice. I adopted better study habits and really enjoyed what I was learning. My biology teacher really inspired me, and I ended up pursuing the exact same major at the exact same school that they went to (haha funny right?). Sadly, academics was pretty much all I focused on during high school, as that was the major ""life hurdle"" so to speak that I was dealing with at the time. It's great if you can draw ideas and inspiration from those around you, but don't forget to run your own race to!",,,,"Mentor 2023-02-09, 22:31: Hello Zayden! It's nice to meet you. I'm Aidan, a current undergraduate at UBC studying infectious diseases. I think it's great that you're considering science or trades. I hope by the end of this, you'll have learned a few things so that you can make informed decisions about your career in the future :) Based on your portfolio, we do have video games and DND in common! I think they're great ways to destress, especially with friends. I'm looking forward to our adventure here! Let me know which module interests you the most, I believe your instructor gave you free choice. Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:40: Hi Aiden, my name is Zayden. I curently go to ADSS i'm in grade 10. I'm intresteted in phisics and chemistry. Next year i plan on taking phisics 11, chem 11, and bio 11. I would be very intrested in hearing about your experience with science in post secondary. I also enjoy sports.I play rugby curently. And some hobbies I have include biking, dnd, and video games. Thank you for this opportunity. it will be great to get to know you. Mentor 2023-02-10, 12:48: That's amazing! I think it's great that you know you're interests well and have a plan to go through with those interests. I remember taking physics, chem, and bio during my high school years as well, and I enjoyed them a lot. In terms of science in post-secondary, I'll offer some brief insights. If we have more time to chat about it down the line, I'm open to any questions you might have! Post-secondary is definitely more difficult than what we're taught in high school, but that goes true for most subjects at this level. However, this should not scare you! The learning here goes more in depth and is less focused on pure memorization, but rather the application of concepts. You'll get a lot of hands-on experience with science in labs, and it's great if you're highly curious about the field in general. In other words, there are a lot of opportunities if you look for them. You can think of it as a create your own story kind of situation. You'll find that Post-secondary offers a lot (relative to high school at least) of course choices that allow you to diversify your interests, or pick paths suited to your current ones. Not only that, but research and other experiences are available too. I do play sports as well (namely golf, table tennis, and volleyball), but I've never actually tried out rugby. I think that's super cool! I believe I mentioned in my earlier message that we have DND and games in common as well. It was great getting to know you a bit more, and we'll definitely continue doing so throughout this program. Let me know what module interests you and that you would like to start with!

I hope you've gained some insight from this program! Feel free to shoot me updates on how your career prospects go!","Mentor 2023-04-14, 09:16: Rural to Urban has been opened for you! Mentee 2023-04-14, 09:49: thank you Mentee 2023-04-14, 09:59: the three things i like about living in a rural area is there a lot less people, i dont like lage crowds. Its cheaper, thats always a plus. I am closer to nature i love nature and a lot of my hobbies include it. The things i dont like i have to travel because not everything is in one place andthere is more to do in a big city. Mentor 2023-04-18, 09:58: Those are all fair points! I also am not a fan of huge crowds and like to stick to smaller groups and activities. I think it's definitely a plus that you love nature as well. I'd imagine going on hikes and whatnot would be a lot easier to access than over here. As with most things, there are always drawbacks and advantages and I think you've picked them out well. I live in a suburban area, and access to most daily necessities (grocery stores, etc.) are usually within walking distance. You are correct that there are many forms of entertainment here as well. Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:08: What are your likes and dislikes about living in a city Mentor 2023-04-24, 11:26: This will definitely vary between individuals, but here are some things that immediately come to mind. I'll speak specifically about Vancouver: Many people appreciate living in Vancouver for its vibrant culture, diverse population, and beautiful natural surroundings, including mountains, beaches, and parks. The city also offers excellent public transportation, outdoor activities, entertainment options, and a thriving food scene. However, there are also some downsides to living in Vancouver, including the high cost of living, frequent rain and overcast weather, traffic congestion, high population density, limited space in some areas, and social issues such as homelessness. Additionally, some people may find the noise pollution and busy city life overwhelming, and there may be limited job opportunities in certain fields compared to other major cities. Ultimately, the likes and dislikes of living in Vancouver can vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:15: Every weekend I go bike riding with my dad and if we dont we build bike trails. If I move away I would go bike riding, but would have to find new trails. What traditions do you have that you've kept up. Mentor 2023-05-01, 12:11: I've tried to keep up traditions as best as I could, but sometimes new life stages can make our routines hard to maintain. I always think of myself as more of a simple person, so keeping up with friends by chatting over dinner, and getting to play some sports at the local recreation center are two things that come to mind. Nothing to over-the-top. I know some of my friends are more adventurous but not me haha. Biking is a good one! Great exercise and you get to take in the scenery as well! I'm happy to say that urban areas are not short of beautiful bike trails, and larger parks usually have entire trails dedicated to biking as you've mentioned.","Mentee 2023-05-26, 10:09: • How important do you think these critical thinking skills about digital media are for you as a student It is very important for students throughout their education when they have to do research on assignments such as current events of which their is a lot of mis and disinformation around. to check that the information they are using is correct they should use multiple trusted sources. How prevalent is dis- and misinformation in your world, as an adult and post-secondary student. Mentor 2023-05-29, 21:21: Misinformation is definitely a problem in the digital age, and being able to filter out what's true from what isn't is a critical skill to have. As you mentioned, doing research for assignments is something you'll be doing a lot if you decide to pursue post-secondary education, and I agree that using multiple trusted sources is a great way to start! In the world, it's pretty much everywhere. A lot of topics, depending on whose talking about them, have inherent biases (as we are all human) and can become opinionated. A good habit to develop is doing your own research and forming your own opinion on things, and comparing them to what you see online, what your friends think, etc. Any controversial topic nowadays have misinformation, and it's our job to determine which sources to trust. When doing background research for assignments as a post-secondary student, you will have to use a blend of your own instinct/knowledge, as well as the information you find online to make correct judgements.","Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:22: i have expeience in problem solving and communication when i am paired with a difficult student. Mentee 2023-02-16, 11:27: Library Worker Problem solving Deadlines Working with technology Patient Mentor 2023-02-19, 10:06: That's a wonderful start! Being able to effectively communicate and problem solve when issues arise is a core skill that many jobs require, bonus points if you are also very patient. As a library worker, all 4 skills you've listed would be beneficial to the role. Nice job brainstorming! Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:54:  Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:54: Resume Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:56: Tried to send resume with using ''save to your portfolio'' button. did you get it ? Mentee 2023-02-24, 10:02: If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better? Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:44: Hey Zayden, I have received your resume! It's a great start. A couple things to note: I would watch out for capitalization such as ""school diploma"". This should be capitalized as it looks more professional. You should list the full name of your school, some might not know what ADSS stands for. In terms of the amount of bullet points required for each entry, 3 is usually the goal. Your work experience currently only has one (and the first letter should also be capitalized!), can you think of anything else that might demonstrate your skills that you gained from that experience? Principal's Role should be capitalized You usually don't need ""references available upon request"" on the resume. If they require references they normally let you know and have you fill out an additional form. I love how you included your interests into your resume. Occasionally, they might ask you about what you're interested in during the interview as a way to get to know you better. I would definitely add in more if you have any! When writing bullet points for your entries, a good tip is to follow a STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Results). For instance, your first bullet point for your work experience could be reworded to something like: Managed box inventory and recorded counts, ensuring a well organized work environment. This goes for your extracurriculars as well. Rather than saying ""I've learned valuable teamwork skills"", can you think of a situation where you demonstrated that? You could probably put that down in a sentence! One final thing that is very important when starting out. Don't hesitate to put things on your resume, even if it seems like it shouldn't belong there. Of course, you can't put anything you want on there, but if you've learned a lot from that experience and you are hesitating to write it down, put it down! Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:51: I have done quite a few interviews at this point. I'll admit, during my very first interview, I was incredibly nervous, almost to the point where I wanted to faint hahaha. It is completely normal but is a skill you can improve over time. Know that it's not just a one-sided conversation, while the interviewer is trying to gauge how good of a candidate you are, you are also gauging how much you wanna work there! Never feel too pressured to perform your best! Prepare as best you can and maybe even practice with a friend. A good piece of advice is to have questions (not too many, maybe 1 or 2) about the job you're applying for, so you can ask them after they've finished asking their questions. In addition, you should always do a bit of background research on their company and their values, it may be brought up during the interview and you want to seem interested and prepared! I definitely could have prepared more and perhaps practiced. I belive that was the source of my nervousness, aside from it being my first time. In terms of what I did well, I don't think I did anything well to be honest, and that's completely okay! There's always a first time for everything, and we're all human. Mentor 2023-03-09, 15:15: No problem! I realize that I have indirectly answered the next discussion question, so I'll directly ask you the remaining question related to you! Have you ever had an interview before? If so, how did that go for you? Anything you thought you did well or could've improved on? If you haven't gone through an interview. What are some things that make you nervous about them (if any)? Anything you're particularly comfortable with? Looking forward to your responses! Mentor 2023-03-16, 10:32: Hey Zayden. That is a very common worry and it is completely normal to feel that way! I remember when I was preparing for my first interview, I had also felt that way about it. When applying for these entry level jobs, its important to remember that the employers aren't expecting a fully written resume filled with diverse experiences and skills. They know you're just starting out, and they were once there as well. Take on experiences you enjoy, and soon you'll find that your resume is filling up faster than you thought it would! As for freezing under pressure, this has actually happened to me during my first interview. My best advice on this is actually to treat the interview like a conversation (in some ways it pretty much is a conversation). Pretend a friend or family member is asking you these questions and respond accordingly. Make sure to try and highlight your skills along the way. Alternatively, you could always practice with your friends, family, or with yourself! Find some common interview questions online or ask your parents perhaps, and use those to generate some guidelines towards how you would answer during the real one. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:17: Do you have a story of a memorable job interview, what made it stand out. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:17:  Mentor 2023-04-04, 11:41: One of my previous job interviews for a volunteering position really stood out to me! I think it was becase of the nature of the interviewer, and how they were really friendly and made the interview feel like another conversation I would have with a friend. I feel like being comfortable is an important factor in whether or not you can be yourself in the interview, and how the interviewer portrays themselves is just as important as how you compose yourself. A good interviewer will make you feel at home!",,

I get about 6 hours of sleep on a normal day which is less than 8 which is the recomended amount, I feel this doesnt affect the way my day goes. I eat fairly healthy and drink lots of water. The recomended is about 3 cups a day and I drink approximately 3L a day. I get a well amount of exercise but do not take many breaks. Some questions for you Do you have any time manegment tips? Any tips on breaking bad habits? and do you prioritize self care?",,,,"Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:18: Hi Sahib sorry you have not heard from me in a while I was not feeling well as I sprained my ankle very badly but I am feeling better now. Picking up from where we left off I love to travel it is one of my favorite things to do because I get to see how others live life and also about the conditions some live in. In my eyes success means living wealthy and having everything you would like or most things you would like in life. This does noot just mean money wise this also means to me being able to have the time to spend with family or friends because they mean the most to me. I feel the person I idolize can't be one person everyone around me inspire me and I look up to them all, but if I had to give 1 I would probably choose my brother. Me and my brother have always been close and it works out well because we have a big age gap so we rarely fight. I look up to him as someone I inspire to be. Some questions from the inspiration section to answer. What are my goals for the near and far future? I have many goals I want to achieve such as buying a car, getting my own apartment, succeding in school, and in the farther future having kids. I feel I hold these goals to my heart because these things would make me feel like I have achieved a lot in life. the most important one to me must be having kids. I feel I would love to have kids because I am the only person who can carry on my last name so I feel that there is almost pressure for me because I would love to have that responsibility of having that role. A question for you is what were your goals compared to during high school and now? Do you have different goals? What made you change your mind about what to focuse on? Mentee 2023-03-10, 09:45: Sorry for the inactivity I am finally back. So whilst I was gone I have had a lot of thinking and I was offered to go to a college for a carpentry program, and I have put a lot of thought into it but I don't know if I should. It is a great oppurtunity but I also don't know much about carpentry and I thought I would get your opinion on it as your my mentor.","Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:11: What do I Value In Life? Right now I value many things, but my biggest values would have to be my family, school grades, my job, and Basketball. These are my biggest values because they can affect my life positively and negatively whether or not if I value them. Basketball is up there because it is my biggest hobby and it can help me communicate with the people around me in a fun way. How do I want to contribute to my community and the world? During my life there is many things I would like to do to contribute to my community such as volunteer work, being a gear in the system that helps flow the community, and take care for the environment and animals. What are my dream careers that include the first 2 points? Animal caretaker, work at a farm that raises animals, basketball player, and taking care of my family finacially (not a job just something I would like to do) Sahib some questions for you. What are some values that may fit this career? How did your values inform your career choice? Mentor 2023-05-04, 10:36: To follow up on your career exploration questions: 1) I think values that might be useful for your career choice could be patience, kindness and determination. These are really important not just for you but for a lot of careers. 2) My values that inform my career choice include the aformentioned pateince, kindness, and determination, but also a vigor and strength. Being in academia, it takes a lot out of a person. Persoanlyl when I study I go 14 hours a day sometimes non stop, I don't eat a lot and I don't relax. D Mentor 2023-05-04, 10:38: sorry, I accidentally pressed enter on my last post but to continue on your second question. 2) doing these things can be mentally taxing so strength, vigor and endurance are skills one should build because life itself has a lot of demand if you are chasing sucess. Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:57: To answer some of the discussion questions i have chose the career graphic designer from the quiz. 1. Do I have a Strong personal interest in this type of work? I feel a graphic designer may be a fun job because i have always liked to maske fun designs and different sorts of art work. 2. Will this carrer be able to achieve a work/life balanbce i want? I think it will allow me to have a work/life balance because since it is something where you can just do on spare time and it does't take a lot of ""heavy lifting"" it can make it easy to work in this are while still having enough time for myself. 3. Will this career offer me finacial security? this career is great because it is enough money to live the life i would like to live. this also is a great job because it can lead to other oportunities such as doing big ads and such. Some question for you. Did you ever reconsider your career? Whether this be because of different interests or too much work. Do you wish you considered some of the things above while choosing your career? If you could do it again would you choose the same career?",,,"Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:35: Hi there Sahib, I seen your profile and I think you seem really cool. I see we share the interest in video games which I find interesting because that is probably my biggest hobby, I love to play many sports games including NBA 2k, Fifa, and also love to play shooters as well such as Call of Duty and Rainbow Six Siege, I am also interested in the games you play as well so I know if we share any interests. I also see your very commited to what you do which I find inspiring and I hope that you could teach me about the type of things you do in the field because I am trying to learn about many different careers to find out on what I want to do when I am older. I also am a big movie lover myself. I love older and newer movies to see what it was like in the different eras. My favorite movie has to be Grease, I love where the movie took place and love all the songs they sing in it (I am a BIG music lover!). What are some of your favorite movies and what is your favorite era of movies? Great to meet you and thanks for this opportunity to talk to you Sahib. Mentor 2023-02-11, 15:38: Hi William, I appreciate your interest and can tell this will be a great semester mentoring you. A little bit about me, I'm a physics major at the University of British Columbia and my interests include creative writing, physics (of course), going to the gym (haven't been so thorough with it though), gaming and movies. I am an expert World of Tanks player since I started playing and I know the inside, out of every single vehicle in the game. I am a big history nerd as well, I am an expert in WW2 and general military histroy since it of interest to me and a field I might potential get into some day. As a movie-lover, I appreciate a superb story and the vigor of the actors. I'm really into the Golden Era of Hollywood so basically 1920-1970 movies and some of my favourtie actors/actresses include Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Rosalind Russell, etc. I haven't seen Grease before but I've wanted to watch it. I also like modern film too, anything Christopher Nolan is always on my list of top movies. Mentor 2023-02-11, 15:51: After reading your profile I see you are very interested in gaming and basketball. It's always great to have something you are passionate about. Do you plays in clubs or divisions for basketball, have you considered playing college basketball because Simon Fraser University is the only Canadian University to be a part of the NCAA and if you are really serious about this it could be a great oppurtunity. Furthermore, to help you in discovering your interests I'd like to ask you some questions: what are your academic interests? What are your favourite subjects? Are there any topics you are willing to further research? Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:16: Hi Sahib thanks for getting back. I love basketball with great passion but I feel that for a career it can be tuff. My favorite subject in school would have to be math. Math is my favorite because ever since I have been young I have been incredible at math. Overall in school I do very well, all through out elementry I was a straight A student, now in high school I average a B-A in my grades. Topics I willing to further research is a tuff question because im not so sure on what I would like to do. I am willing to research any topic so I can learn about it and maybe ill end up enjoying it without me expecting. In 10 years I see me living alone still in Port Alberni or whereever my choice of career takes me. Hopefully in that 10 year time I have figured out what I would like to pursue. Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:19: Some subjects I would like to talk about is Inspiration. I feel I cannot find a career that interests me because there is no urge or inspiration for what to do. A question I have is how did you know that physics was the right thing for you? and did you get any spark that you knew physics would be for you? I think that if I can be inspired about a topic it will cause me to want to research and have further interest about that job. Mentor 2023-02-14, 10:27: Drop a pencil on the floor and you'll see gravity at work, newton said it was a force, einstein said it is curvature of space time. For me, I got interested in physics because I realized how fundamental it was. It expalins everything around us, it lays the basis of chemistry and biology and alonsgside mathematics it explains so many phenomena. At times it just the little things. Despite my passion, I do hate it at times but that is natural. Even if you like something there will be times you hate it, maybe because its hard or time consuming. I kind of think of it as siblings, you love them but at times you really hate them. Now I find it really cool that you are interested in math. Math is one of my favourtie subjects and I have a personal record of never getting less than an A in math all my life, elementary, high school and even in university so I hold the subject dear to my heart. Math is so fundamental, it is a language in its own that is used to describe both physical and abstract concepts. Without math we wouldn't have cell phones or cars or any of that just like we wouldn't have it without physics. Physics uses math as its primary language so I understand how fundamental it is. Now let's get to the important part, inspiration. This one can be hard. There are so many options to which way you want to take your life. I'm not going to sugar coat it, but any path you take in life is going to be tough even if you enjoy what you do. There is no easy way, but that is what life is, struggle. I struggle daily, so do my friends, and everyone around me. In the end, what is your goal? Is it money? Happiness in oither forms? Do you want to be remembered for what you've done in life. At your age you are a pivotal point in your life. This is the beginning of your legacy. Strive to be someone bigger than you are currently, better than you are currently, smarter than you are currently. Always improve yourself. Let's see if we can find some careers for you, something you would like to pursue. It is great to make up your mind quickly but also take some time. Gap years are fine, but inevitably they will strat to chew away at motivation toward educating yourself or obtaining new skills. Another thing you want to take into account is money. Money is what makes the world go around and around, nearly everything has a price attached to it. Passion shouldn't be the only thing to look at when deciding a career, looking at future career prospects and the lifestyle you wish to live is also important in the long run and money playa big factor in that. I'm not saying don't follow your passion, I am saying don't forget to weigh in other factors. I recommend laying out a plan on paper. Here are some questions: Do you like to travel? Are you an outdoors or indoors person? What does success mean to you? What new responsibilities do you see yourself taking on in the coming years? i.e Family, work, buying a house or apartment. Is there anyone you idolize in your life? Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:43: Hi Sahib I have sent wa message in the inspirations section. Mentor 2023-02-23, 10:34: Hi William, I hope your ankle has recovered. After reading your response, I think you have great goals. Having a family and succeeding financially are great gopals to have because at the end of your life it is your family that will be there for you, not money. I know I was talking a lot about money in my last dicussion, but I want to emphasize one thing I never mentioned. I hope you always remember the following thing: Money is a way to communicate with the world, not with loved ones Money is a language we use to barter and its a really good one. I really like that you have your priorities set on family and are using money as a way to ensure security of that goal. Your priorities are in the right place. Now to achieve these goals it is important to order and prioritize them. Which one is more important? A car? An apartment? Try arranging them and we can discuss more. Now to answer your questions: My goals since high school and now have not changed. That probably isn't a typical response, but our goals are not much different. I've always wanted to support my family and have one of my own, but before any of that happens I need to be financially secure because at the end of the day I will be the provider. I have a laser sharp focus on the same goals I have had since high school. Mentee 2023-02-23, 10:41: Thanks for getting back to me. I am glad we have the same goals because that makes us think similar. My priorities in the moment are first maintaining my great grades in school because at the end of it education is extremely important, second a car this is important to me because I know I will have my licsence soon and this will be a great help for me. I have put the apartment last as it is still important but I know I will always have a place to go when I need it which I am extremely greatful for. Even though I have a place to go I still want the apartment because it makes me feel likie I have some independency. Mentor 2023-02-27, 13:58: Sorry william Hi ill roely by the end if the day Mentor 2023-02-27, 13:59: I had a power outage and continued no access to electronics between but now im back online Mentor 2023-02-27, 20:12: I really like your prioratization because you want to focus on yourself first and then expand. Putting the apartment last is a great idea. Now, geting back tot he education. As far as I am aware from my time in high school most university applications have closed, but no worries. We can always look at the next cyclce starting in january and the deadlines there. Since your on the island, the closest major institution to my knowledge is the University of Victoria, being about 2.5 hours from where you are. This means if you do plan to attend a major university youre going to have to live on campus which is a new experience and definitely as step toward independence. UVic has a lot of great programs you can look into. The link is below: https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/programs/undergraduate-programs/index.php If you are interested in oppurtunities on the mainland I can send you links for that as well. Mentor 2023-03-07, 20:25: Hi William, I haven't heard from you in a while. Is everything okay? Do you want to continue? Mentee 2023-03-08, 10:04: Yes sorry you have not heard from me in a while I had some visitors from far away and was pretty busy. I will make sure to get back to you in the following days Mentor 2023-03-10, 11:02: Hi William, I appreciate how you took the time to think about what you want to do. In my opinion it would be a great idea to write down the pros and cons of capentry. Ask yourself this is well: Do I enjoy woodwork and outside work? Is the cost of working, sometimes in terrible weather something you wouldn't mid? Will the pay sustain your lifestyle? Is there demand for carpenters in the area you live in or plan to live in? What are the job prospects in the future? And most importantly, how does this job fit into your self-image 10 years from now? If you think it is a good oppurtunity then go for it, but also make sure to shop around for other opuurtunities which may interest you more. As you said, you don't know much about carpentry, it would be a good idea to go on indeed and look at job descriptions of what carpenters do and what kind of jobs they do, pay and demand. Mentor 2023-03-20, 10:17: Hey william I haven't heard from you in a while and I am wondering if everything is okay Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:06: Hi Sahib, we were on march break for 2 weeks and are finally back, continuing the conversation of the college. For your first question I love to do woodwork I am not the greatest but I love it and I love outside work in genral. I would be fine with the weather I would have to work in matter a fact even though it might be a little weird I love working in the rain and snow. It would easily pay for my lifestyle and there is a need for carpenters. In the future I feel there will still be a need for carpenters and I think they will always be needed because there is always something needed somewhere done. Mentor 2023-03-30, 19:49: Sorry, I totoally forgot that you guys had a two week break. I hope you enjoyed it because there isn't much of a psring break in unversity. It isgreat to hear that you gave some consideration to the questions I have asked. You really love being outside so I think carpentry is a great career. As you identified there is a need ofr carpenter especially with all the new developments happening. Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:16: I put some more thought into the college thing but I have decided to decline. This was something that took a lot of thought but as I go on I realize that it was not something that I would like to do. It sounds great on paper but the time that it would take and the money is just something I am not ready for in the moment. I have just decided to stay in my school until grade 12 and then move on with whatever I would like to do. Mentor 2023-04-05, 21:57: Okay, I see, so what would you like to talk about next? Mentor 2023-04-05, 21:57: Okay, I see, so what would you like to talk about next? Mentor 2023-04-05, 21:57: Okay, I see, so what would you like to talk about next? Mentor 2023-04-05, 21:57: Okay, I see, so what would you like to talk about next? Mentor 2023-04-05, 21:58: Okay, I see, so what would you like to talk about next? Which conversation would you like to start next? Mentee 2023-04-11, 10:32: I would like to open the career exploration section Mentor 2023-04-14, 15:34: Okay sure, let's begin with that Mentor 2023-04-24, 13:40: Hi, William, so sorry I didn't respond. It's fial exam season for me, I have one more test tomorrow and I'll be free and post a better reply Mentee 2023-04-25, 10:03: No worries Sahib take your time, Good Luck! Mentor 2023-05-04, 10:32: Hey William, I'm finally back and ready. Sorry for the haitus, my final exams ended and then I joined a new researcher position. So let's open up the career exploration section Mentor 2023-05-14, 00:02: Hi William, Sorry for the late repsonse again. 1) I never reconsidered my pathway. I alwasy wanted to be a doctor. That kind of answers all three of your questions. I would not want to do it over again. Mentor 2023-05-26, 11:51: Hi William, First off, get more sleep because its downhill from here when it comes to sleep, so enjoy it while you can.The recommended amount of water a person should intake is said to be 8 glasses a day which is abot 2L; however, this is not extremely accurate. Water intake depends on the person, their size, wieght, and level of physical activity. You get a good amount of exercise so the water consumption should be fine, you play basketball so that is a tough sport. Make sure you get in your electrolytes. 1) Do you have time management tips? For sure, time management is all about focussing and organizing. When you start doing a series of unrelated tasks at a time say your science homework and math homework, make sure to skip the assingments or tasks to see if you can get an intuitive feel for the task. For instance, say I have 5 homework questions for math. Read all five before you start, because if you start and question 2 is hard but 1,3,4,5 are simple then you know to prioritize the easy one and make notes on the hard ones so you can get help from the teacher. This is a great way to manage time because if you get stuck on question 2 and waste time on it and become too tired to do the rest you will have to waste time another day to the complete the task. Furthermore, another great way to manage tasks is to do the ones that are most urgent first, this is important becasue when you start a task you want to have your mind fresh for the most urgent task. Making a schedule can be good, but being able to adapt to changing deadlines or circumstances you did not forsee is better. You have to be fluid, don't tie yourself down to a rigid schedule all the time. Moreover, build stamina, this is differen than physical stamina, I am talking about mental stamina. There will be days in your life where you might not get a minute to even relax and sometimes these days can be consectuive, and if you build mental stamina you will be able to survive these without to much burnourt. Building mental stamina is incredibly difficult, do hard tasks, do things that stretch you mentally and physically, push yourself to your absolute limit and then keep going. Build a strong mindset centred around discipline, order, stregth and resilience. 2) Any tips on breaking bad habits? This follows from the last point, building discipline. Make rules in your life starting now, set restriction, have pateince and obedience. You need to build an iron will, one that cannot be torn down. William, one day you are going to look back at your life and a part of you will ask if you did good by yourself. When you have a bad habit, ask yourself if its really doing good by you. At the end of the day William, the person whose judgement truly matters is your own. Can you look yourself in the mirror? Is there a self-guilt chipping away at you? Ask yourself questions. Was my life better or worse before this habit? Am I happier or not? I like to think back to the time when I didn't have that habit and ask myself questions; the best thing is to think about when you were a kid if the habit is somethig that starts later in life. Smoking, drinking, vaping, drugs, are some vices people take on in adulthood, but ask yourself if they truly make you happy. Why are you partaking in this habit? That is a great question to ask as well. Is there a reason? Breaking bad habits can be very hard, that's why patience, obdience and limit testing can help build resieliece to these habits. Saying no to friends lor family that e ncourage this is a great first step and focusing on yourself can break any bad habit. 3) Self care is important. In this world, there is a lot of toil and struggle.You will go through this William, you will struggle, you will feel defeated, you will be knocked down and there is at times nothing you can do about it except get back up. But this whole process can take away from self care. There are so many things to do that it is easy to forget about yourself. A lot of people will say that-that is a bad thing; however, I am not going to give you cliche answers about self-care. There is no choice to abandon self care when you chase success, neither you or I William were born into mulit-billion dollar families or are heirs to a throne. Our self care will be comprimsed at times and I am not saying always forget about yourself, but be okay with not participating in self care all the time. But do make time for it when you can. I'll give a personal example, during the school year I adtruggle to go to the gym because I spend 8-12 hours at school or driving there and when I come home I only have time for homework or the gym and I chose my homework. I sacrificed my physical health for my grades and I also sacrifice my mentalo health for it too. I have to reject going out with my friends, going to relatives houses or even enjoy time with my family. Most weekends I wake up and before even eating breakfast I start studying and then I stop when it is time to sleep again. This is terrible for my physical and mental health; however, it is necessary if you want to get somewhere in life. Moreover, this doesn;t mean I completely abandon self care all the time, in the summer right now I'm hitting the gym again after work and doing all the things that fix my physical and mental health. Mentee 2023-05-31, 10:13: Thanks for all the help throughout these months, I appreciate the things I learned from you. Thanks, William",,,,,

Welcome back and I look forward to your sharing from Anchor Text 1, feel free to ask me any questions as well! We can certainly do the photo swap activity! I remember you shared a really thought-provoking drawing with me last time and I'd like to share this digital artist with you this time! Their name is Paulo Abreu and they create beautiful surrealistic digital art, one of my favourites is this: Photo Swap Image I picture the diver in the image as someone desperately searching for something. The disproportional glass of water symbolizes the diver's desire and despite the obvious outcome of what would happen if someone were to dive into a glass of water, this piece of art portrays our desire outweighs the potential harm.",,,,"Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:23: I find this art peice very intriging. I think it expresses the struggles of masking, especially for neurodivergent people. It shows that even if someone has a smile on their face or seems like they are always happy, doesn't mean they are. Just because someones life seems perfect, doesn't mean they aren't struggling. Life if different for everyone. Someone could be struggling with depression and anxiety, but they've learned to mask so well that only those whom they show, know how badly they are truly struggling. art based on mental illness - Bing images Mentor 2023-02-10, 15:34: Hello Voide, It is so nice to meet you, how are you doing? I read through your profile and can empathize with your struggles with mental health. I myself am queer and also struggle with mental health issues at times. I look forward to working with you throughout this program :) Mr. Thomas said to complete 2 conversations of your choice and seeing that you had shared about the drawing of a masked figure, I wonder if you'd like to start with the conversation ""Finding Inspiration?"" Also, thanks for sharing the drawing with me. I really like the interpretation you gave. It brought more meaning to the art and I think it also helps bring awareness to issues people may not choose to present on the surface level as you mentioned! Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:14: i would love to do the finding inspiration. i cant seem to find the activity on the icebreaker sheet though so do you think you could explain? Mentor 2023-02-13, 14:01: Sounds good! No worries that you can't seem to find the activity, it is because the mentor has to unlock the conversations first! I have gone ahead and unlocked Find Inspiration, feel free to check it out and let me know what you think once you reach the discussion questions :) Mentee 2023-03-01, 09:53: it doesnt seem to want to unlock/work. do you think you could try again?

Do you have any tips on how to study for tests? When you have a teacher who really isn't a good fit for you, how do you manage it? Mentor 2023-02-22, 14:42: Vanessa, I can relate a lot to your signs of self care. It's hard sometimes to find the time for ourselves with all our responsibilities. I'm glad you have a lot of cool things to do to decompress though - biking through the forest sounds fun! 1. How do you contiue to feel motivated with life and various school work? What I've learned over the years is that motivation is not something I can always rely on. There are a lot of times where I'm not motivated to do anything! Instead, what has helped me more than motivation is developing discipline. To me, discipline can include a lot of things, but it ultimately amounts to keeping promises to myself. For instance, one thing I am disciplined with is getting some form of exercise every day. If I know that I did something hard, like exercise at the start of the day, then I know other tasks throughout the day will feel a bit easier. Discipline can amount to little actions too - like taking little steps rather than one big step. For example, I'll try to study or write essays throughout the week, instead of cramming in one day. I think by developing discipline and having a track record of accomplishments throughout the day, it can lead to motivation. Ultimately, I know that if I do the things that I'm supposed to do in the day, that it will pay off. I have yet to be proven otherwise! 2. Do you have any tips on how to study for tests? I would say the one of the better tips I can give is to try and review your notes not just before the test, but throughout the term. I have performed better on tests when I give myself plenty of time to review than cramming for a day or two. Additionally, getting good sleep and making sure I am hydrated and have a small meal seems to help as well! I prioritize sleep and studying over a stretch of time, even if it is as little as an hour a day, instead of cramming for multiple hours in one night. It will help you feel a lot less stressed too if you can find a way to spread your time out throughout a week than a single day for studying. It's also never a bad idea to double-check with your teacher to make sure you're studying the right material too! 3. When you have a teacher who really isn't a good fit for you, how do you manage it? In terms of having a teacher who isn't a good fit, reaching out to other classmates can be helpful. If you have friends who understand the material, I am sure they would be willing to help! Moreover, almost anything you want to learn can be found online! I used YouTube and also Khan Academy for some of my courses in the past. Ultimately, sometimes you can't always control who your teacher is, but you can always adapt. In life, there will be a lot of times where the circumstances might be tough, but if you have the right perspective, you can find a way to overcome any barrier. I'll also share something that has helped me throughout the years in performing well with my classes. In my second year of college, I took a sociology class. My professor told us about a study where students who blamed the professor for their grades, rather than themselves, would end up continuing to perform poorly. The students who took accountability for their poor performance, however, improved more than their peers who didn't. I know this might be a bit different from what you asked, but I think it is valuable to share. I hope the answers helped :D Feel free to start on the ""Anchor Text 2"" when you're ready :) Best, Saahil Mentor 2023-02-22, 14:45: Awesome! Real estate can be a promising career for sure! There's no harm in keeping an open perspective to other career paths too. There's a lot of opportunities in this world and you have plenty of time to experiment and figure out what calls to you :D Saahil Mentor 2023-02-22, 14:47: Whoops, meant to send that last message in the ""Start Here"" section! I'll post it again there. Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:59: Yes, real estate does seem like a good fit, but iam also open to many more ideas. Mentor 2023-02-24, 11:39: It's always good to be open to career paths. You also don't have to have everything figured out right now too. The way I see it is kind of like this: The person I was 5 years ago is a lot different than who I am now. I am sure I had an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, but these things develop and change over time. All I know about my future is that I am probably going to be a practicing lawyer. I don't know what type of law or how the pay will be and so on. A lot of these things are out of our control. However, being open to new opportunities and being willing to explore different careers can be really valuable. For instance, I worked in hospitality as a busser/food runner for about a year and a half at a fine-dining restaurant in Vancouver while I was studying. I worked in a really nice hotel and it showed me that careers in hospitality can be very rewarding if you work your way up and you like the environment. Overall, even if real estate seems like a good fit to you now, you might end up landing a job that changes your perspective. Or maybe you'll get really interested in something as a hobby and make it like a career. You've got plenty of time to dial in on what exactly you want to end up doing. In my opinion, developing healthy self-care habits and being positive to yourself is really important. The mind is a very powerful thing and life is a lot better when you're nicer to yourself :D Feel free to start on the second Anchor Text!! :D Saahil Mentor 2023-03-07, 17:11: Vanessa, I think you might have forgot to go over the ""Anchor Text 2: Self-Care Action Plan""! Make sure to go over this part. We can move on to another section once we're done :) Mentee 2023-03-09, 11:22: What ways do you try to get to bed early? Also with all the school work drinking coffee is something i tend to do a lot is there any other ways for energy you would reccomend? Mentor 2023-03-12, 03:24: Vanessa, those are great questions! To go to sleep early, I try to wake up early! I also try to exercise at some point in the day and that seems to help me too. I know that avoiding screens for about an hour before sleep can help too. In terms of having better energy levels, getting enough sleep is important. I also have to rely on caffeine from things like coffee, but eating well helps me too. Going on short ten minute walks outside has helped me a bunch with energy, especially after having a meal too. Mentor 2023-04-20, 18:23: They might be hard to get in to, but it's not impossible. From my experience, grades definitely come first. So trying your best to score as high as you can and to develop good study habits will carry a lot of weight in the future. Extracurriculars matter too and I know so far that you are involved in those types of things. Admissions teams definitely want to accept students who have unique experiences and have more than just academics going on :D",,,"Mentee 2023-04-06, 10:21: My top two dream careers would defineley have to be either real estate or marine biology. For real estate some vourses that help are buiessness education, accounting and math. For marine biologist some courses you need is biology, chemistry and various sciences. I belive i would benefit from post secondary by having a stable career, a good income, and a happy life. A challenging factor is that i plan on taking a gap year, another is the prices with tuition and stuff, i tend to be very bad at saving and lastly staying motivated. I think i would enjoy the schooling in order to get to my future career. i do believe my goal is archieveable. Was staying motivated and on track ever a problem you experienced? Mentor 2023-04-09, 10:25: Great job researching those two career paths :D I think what you wrote is pretty accurate if you want to find yousrelf succeeding in real estate or marine biology. A gap year might be challenging, but I know a lot of friends who took one and they are doing just fine. I didn't begin my post-secondary journey immediately after high school too. Staying motivated at times has been a challenge for me. I think it is something everyone faces. This definitely happens to me towards the end of college terms (like now lol!). However, if you slowly chip away at what you have to do and plan things out, it's easier to stay motivated. I also think a lot about why I decided to study in the first place and try to look at the big picture - that seems to help me too. Feel free to keep moving through this module! :D Mentee 2023-04-11, 10:27: My top three schools i wish to go too are UBC, UVIC, and SFU. These univerities are harder to get into, but i still really hope to archieve this. These universities arent too far of a travel, and look very good job wise, and education wise. Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:11: Another topic i look for in a university or college is a soccer or cheer team, and a school with tons of spirit. Mentor 2023-04-20, 18:26: Whoops, I replied to you in the incorrect thread before! I didn't realize until now, but let's just keep discussing here :D Your reasons for looking into schools and concerns about admissions are definitely valid. Like I said before, focusing on grades and being involved in extracurriculars will help your chances. All the schools you mentioned have soccer and cheer teams, so I am sure you'll find a sense of belonging at any of them. Would you like to know why I decided to attend UBC and Douglas College before? I think discussing that might help us finish this simulation :D Mentor 2023-04-26, 20:45: That's a great question :D Honestly, I don't think it will effect anything negatively. You might have to figure the application process out a bit more by yourself because you'll be out of high school, but that's the only minor disadvantage I can think of. A gap year can be a great idea and I didn't begin college until about 6 months after I graduated! Before we can finish the Post-Secondary and Career Planning module, we'll have to go through ""Anchor Text 2"". It requires some research into what types of grades you'll need in high school. It might seem tough at first, but here's what I did to find out information about if I wanted to study Math at UBC. I googled ""admissions requirements ubc math"" and came to this page: https://you.ubc.ca/ubc_programs/mathematics-vancouver-bsc/ You can do the same process but towards something you would like to study in the future - maybe something biology related! Or for other schools too, the information is very accessible! Then, just share what you found out (like in the gray example box on the second page) and we can discuss it more :D (like in the ""Share""/""Ask"" section on the last page of the Discussion Questions). Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:13: alright sounds good i will start looking into the appliacation process further Mentor 2023-05-02, 13:04: Awesome :D You can do it!! How has your school year been lately? I hope not too stressful! Mentor 2023-05-08, 12:17: That's a great plan :D Let me know if you need any help completing the final bit of the Post-Secondary and Career Planning module! Mentor 2023-05-19, 00:45: Okay, that's great :D The link for the program is here: https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/programs/real-estate/licensing-registration-courses/bc-licensing-courses/real-estate-trading-services-licensing Take a look and consider some of the requirements. I think they're definitely something you can do! Do you have any questions about them, or is it pretty straightforward? I am happy to close this module and we can keep working on anymore if you would like!",,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-10, 15:10: Hi Vanessa!! It's nice to connect with you! I saw on your profile that you are interested in a bunch of career paths, like real estate, business, and even law. That's great!! My best friend is enjoying his new career in real estate and I was admitted to a law school in BC last month! So, I will be a law school student in September 2023 - I am pretty excited for it!! If you have any questions about me or any questions about college/university, I am always around to offer my insight. Your hobbies are cool too - I really want to go to a Vancouver Whitecaps soccer game in the future. Anyways, we will work together through two conversations of your choice! Let me know what the first topic is that interests you and I will unlock it. We will blast through them! Hope you have a great weekend, Saahil Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:16: Hi Saahil! Thank you for responding and iam very interested and curious about hwo to get into and start real estate. I would like to know if it is a smart career path that will last me a long time. What types of courses are mandatory to take buisness in collage? Mentor 2023-02-14, 22:41: Hey Vanessa! Real estate can definitely be a smart career path. I think a lot of it depends on the real estate market. Some times the market is cold (not very many people buying or selling) and other times the market is hot (a lot of people buying and selling). If you like to talk to people and can develop good sales and marketing skills, it can definitely be worth it! To get into real estate, you usually have to take a course offered by a university or other institution. There can be a lot of fees when you're getting started, but my best friend has been making it work. It can definitely last a lifetime - but you have to work hard and be consistent. It is quite competitive too! To study business in college, I'm not entirely sure. The courses would probably be related to marketing, accounting, and business management. You would likely have to do a fair amount of presentations and be open to network with other people. I know at the University of British Columbia, there is the Sauder School of Business which is very competitive to get into. I believe Simon Fraser University also has a great business school. I would definitely look into universities or colleges that interest you and see what their business programs are like. There is a lot of information online! That's what I ended up doing :D Hope you are having a great week! Let me know which circle on the wheel you would like to start :D Saahil Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:46: Hi Sahill, yes real estate seems like a career path iam very interested in. and would like to learn more about the job, and hoow to become a real estate agent. Also, the next thing i would like to foucus on is the self care and wellness aspect on the wheel. Mentor 2023-02-17, 22:41: Vanessa, Sounds good - I opened the ""Well being &amp; Self Care"" option on the wheel! Feel free to start whenever and we will work through it together. To answer your questions on how to get in to real estate, I have a few tips! I am no expert, but here is what I found through online research and talking to my best friend who is a real estate agent. 1. I think one of the best resources you can look at is this website: https://www.bcrea.bc.ca/want-to-be-a-realtor/. They list a bunch of steps for how exactly someone becomes a realtor in BC. They lay it out pretty simply on that page :D 2. What my best friend did was he took the mandatory real estate course offered at UBC. He also enrolled in a third-party course at the ""GOBC Real Estate School"" to help him prepare for the real estate exam afterwards. These things all cost money and I believe my friend Dave told me it cost him about $1,500 to enrol through UBC. He then was allowed 2 years to complete a certain amount of assignments (he only did 2 and they were multiple choice marked for completion) within this time, but he finished much sooner than that. He was given a very large textbook too! Ultimately, I think the best resource is the link I provided above. You can totally make a career out of real estate, or anything in life for that matter. If you adopt a consistent work ethic, I truly believe you can be successful at anything you put your mind to. As soon as I started to manage my time better and apply myself to things, I began to see changes in my life. My journey in academics began at what many would consider a community college, but now I am going to be a law school student in September. No need to feel like you're limited in options or have to have things figured out right now. Be open to career paths and apply yourself in everything you do - that's what I think will make the most difference in whether or not you end up with a career you're happy with! Saahil Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:42: Alright i will take a look into those sites, i do believe real estate is a course i would enjoy. Mentor 2023-02-22, 14:48: Awesome! Real estate can be a promising career for sure! There's no harm in keeping an open perspective to other career paths too. There's a lot of opportunities in this world and you have plenty of time to experiment and figure out what calls to you :D Saahil Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:58: Thank you for all the responses. They all seem like good ideas/advice. i definetly agree with you on the studying part, i should definetly be studying throughout the week instead of the night before haha. Mentor 2023-02-24, 11:39: No problem - I'm glad you found my advice helpful :D Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:31: Yeah, right now iam working at Boston Pizza as a host, definetly not something i plan on doing later in life haha but it is nice to get experience. Mentor 2023-02-28, 17:07: That's a great job opportunitity :D I had a lot of friends work as hosts while studying. I also came to the same conclusion - although I liked my job at the restaurant, I wanted to end up finding a path to law through more relevant job experience. Mentee 2023-03-02, 10:02: Yeah i considered law, it seems like a pretty good career path. Being a lwayer seems like something i would enjoy, not fully confident about it though. Mentor 2023-03-05, 00:10: It definitely can be a good path. I'm currently on that route! A lot of the chances for getting to law school is making sure you are disciplined with studying by getting a high GPA in college. You can do anything :D Also, feel free to continue on the self-care module whenever you're ready :) Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:22: Yeah law definetly seems like an interesting course, next year iam taking law studies 12. Another question, iam not sure if you are a science person,but right now iam having the most troubles foucusing in science is there anything you woukd recomend to stay on task. Mentor 2023-03-07, 17:06: Wow, I hope you enjoy your law class - that sounds exciting. Maybe it'll make you more interested in pursuing law school! I wasn't the best in science classes, but I can give you some tips because I often have to study things I find boring. If you look up the ""Pomodoro technique"", that can be helpful. It's a way to study with a timer and it can usually help people get through work they don't really want to do! I would also recommend putting your phone in another room or somewhere out of sight and reach. Going through the easy stuff first and working your way up can help too. Splitting up study sessions throughout your day might help too. Besides that though, the sad reality is that throughout your life you'll likely face a lot of situations like this. You'll have days where you don't want to do the things you know you should be doing. I've been feeling that way with a bunch of assignments recently. However, the only real way to overcome these things is to face them head on. You'll build a track record of doing things that are hard to focus on and eventually things will get easier. Mentee 2023-03-09, 10:58: Alright thank you i will look up that studying method! Haha this years Scienece is just a lot different than iam used too. Mentor 2023-03-12, 03:26: I can imagine science classes getting more difficult each year. It might take some time to get good at these subjects, but if you keep practicing I promise it will get easier :) Good job on completing the self-care module too! What's the next module you'd like to work on? Let me know and I can unlock it for us! Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:14: Thank you, and those ideas seem good, i do have a gym membership as well too help me stay healthy. Sorry i havent answered for so long just got off spring break Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:16: Yes, lately Scienece seems to be stressing me out. I have a very stern teacher who definetly is not my favourite,but trying my best. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:17: Also, we should do the post secondary part of the wheel Mentor 2023-03-29, 21:13: Hey Vanessa, Glad you had some time off during break! No need to apologize, I was aware already :) It's tough having a teacher who might not be the best fit but you can do it! I just unlocked the next module so feel free to start whenever! Saahil Mentee 2023-03-30, 10:39: Alright sounds good i will start on the weel right now Mentor 2023-03-30, 11:12: Awesome, good luck :) Mentor 2023-04-14, 14:51: Those are all great schools to go to :D I know friends who have gone to all of these schools. I mightbe going to the University of Victoria for law school in September, but I will have to see how things play out in the next following months too! They might be difficult to get in to, but if you apply yourself and stay consistent, things will pay off. Do you have any questions about these schools or want to share any of the research you used to learn about them? I am happy to share some of my thoughts :D Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:10: Yeah theese schools seem pretty hard to get into. Is there any specific things that universitys look for in students? Mentee 2023-04-24, 10:21: yeah, i definetly am going to start researching more about these schools, and ways to get in. iam almost 100% sure i would like to take a gap year, does that affect amything? Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:51: so far this year has been pretty good except for science and pre calc those two have really been messing me up haha. Mentor 2023-05-07, 18:26: That's good to hear :D Those were classes I struggled with too, but things still worked out! In my opinion, as long as you know you tried your best given your circumstances, that's all that matters. I had a pretty tough set of classes this term but now I am graduating and I'll begin law school in September :D How's the Anchor Text 2 coming along in the Post-Secondary Career and Planning module? I am here to help too! Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:12: that is good, i know i will pas my classes just struggling right now, definetly will be looking into a tutor for next year. Mentor 2023-05-15, 15:26: Hey Vanessa! Have you looked into any programs that interest you and their requirements? Let me know and we can wrap this module up :D Mentee 2023-05-16, 10:19: iam very interested in the real estate course at ubc, it seems like the one of the best closest options Mentee 2023-05-30, 10:19: Alright thank you i will look into that, and yes iam ready to start a new section whenever Mentor 2023-05-31, 15:57: Hey Vanessa, awesome :D It seems like this is the end of what's required for your class so good job! If you want to continue through any of the program, I am happy to keep in touch on here too to answer any questions or work through any of the modules you'd like. I hope I was able to help clarify some things that you'll face in the future!",,,,,

You can get started by watching the video for Anchor Text 1 - What do you want? and then answering the discussion questions! Mentor 2023-04-19, 16:31: Hi Tyrone! That sounds awesome! For the next part, you can choose to ask me any of the following questions: Where do they find inspiration to do what they do, whether it be for school, work, passions/hobbies, or in pursuit of their desired career? What inspired them to start down the path they’re on now? What keeps them motivated to do certain things? Feel free to ask them about something that you struggle to stay motivated with. For example, to stay on top of their school work, to give 100% during basketball practice, to stay in touch with their friends from home, etc. How what they wanted and what inspired them in high school has changed now that they’re a post-secondary student and young adult? Mentor 2023-04-27, 19:22: Hi Tyrone! That sounds really cool and knowledgeable of you! Feel free to move onto the next anchor text now Mentor 2023-05-01, 00:13: Hi Tyrone! Sorry, I meant that you should move onto the next Anchor text, not the next module! Please click on the next set of discussion questions and go through it. Mentor 2023-05-03, 03:03: Hi Tyrone! For the next discussion question, you need to share some of your goals and habits with me. Mentor 2023-05-05, 17:26: Those goals sound awesome! You could definitely build other habits to achieve those goals too such as learning to research all your options beforehand so you make the optimal hoice. For the last part of this module, you can choose to ask me any of the following questions: What habits have they built, and how have these habits have helped them achieve their goals? What goals did they have when they were in high school? Did they achieved them? If so, how? If not, what could they have done differently? How do the goals and habits they had in high school compare to the ones they have now, as a post-secondary student and young adult? Mentor 2023-05-24, 11:40: Hi Tyrone! Welcome back! We're not quite finished the Finding Inspiration module yet as we still have one more Discussion to go through. Your next task is to choose one of the following questions to ask me, or you can come up with your own question! What habits have they built, and how have these habits have helped them achieve their goals? What goals did they have when they were in high school? Did they achieved them? If so, how? If not, what could they have done differently? How do the goals and habits they had in high school compare to the ones they have now, as a post-secondary student and young adult? Mentor 2023-05-30, 13:23: Lastly, it looks like your school program is coming to an end! The last day to work on these modules is June 1, so I won't open a new module for now, but if you'd like to continue through these modules or just keep in touch, feel free to let me know. I had a really amazing time working with you and wish you luck in your future endeavours!",,,,"Mentor 2023-02-10, 17:55: Hi Tyrone! I am your mentor Sarah! Let me know which Conversation you would like to work on first and I'll open it up. I look forward to working with you over the next few months :) Mentee 2023-02-13, 14:47: Hello Ms. Sarah. I'm interested in getting hired in a job at a company that deals anything to do with Web Development. Please open the Get Hired conversation. I'm a 16 year old Mixed Race and I'm an immigrant in Canada. (From German nationality) and I'm interested in Web Development ever since I was 15. And I've gotten familiar and advanced already with HTML and CSS and Java. Wish you a good day/night! Mentee 2023-02-15, 10:56: Hello Sarah. Wow, I'm actually impressed that you're learning JavaScript! I am actually trying to learn more about JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) specifically. That's awesome if you're learning currently, since I'll need it for my Web Development career! Have a good day/night. Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:27: Hello Sarah! I'm more of a Quick Learner in every subject. Be it a language, Skill, you name it! And I Learn even Faster if I see the process Visually! And I have a Photogenic Memory which makes it even easier for me to Retain. I only do that to subjects which I find personally very interesting. If it's not a subject which I don't find interesting, then my Ability of Retaining will be low. But luckily, I find Computing a lot of fun and I got a lot of interest for it, so Retaining will be no problem! Have a good day/night! Mentee 2023-02-24, 09:53: Hello Sarah! Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate your comment on my skills that God blessed me with! And yes, I can use my other valuable skills that I already know like HTML &amp; CSS. I can use those together with my JavaScript DOM knowledge and I can be able to make fully functional Websites like a Boss! Thanks to my gift of Photographic Memory, I can learn JavaScript DOM like it's nothing too hard! Wish you a good day. :D Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:26: Hello Sarah! I've been recently searching for Web Development jobs near me. And unfortunately, I couldn't find one near me where I live. All/Most of them are located outside of Vancouver Island. Is it okay if I work for them from Home via Zoom? If not, then is there another way out? (0_0;) Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:47: Hi Tyrone! No worries if they're far from where you live. You're not actually applying for the job you find! We're just going to find an example posting that you like and you will practice identifying skills the employer is looking for. Make sure to come up with at least 4 and feel free to share the job posting with me so I can try to identify some as well! Mentee 2023-03-02, 10:36: Hello Sarah! I actually do have some of the main Capabilities for the emloyers! The ones I usually find are one that want the following below: - Should know HTML. - Should know CSS. - Should know JavaScript. ? (The language I plan on being taught) - Should have a good Work Ethic. Luckily for me I own all 3 of those Capabilities! Except for JavaScript, however I can make Decent/Good Web Design for a company that I can sign up for! So this shouldn't be that hard. ?? (Unless they want me to implement JavaScript into the Web Design before learning JS Document Object Manipulation. Oh no!) Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:43: Awesome! Here's how I'd make/construct my resumé for a Job at an IT Service. Legal Full Name: Tyrone-Diesel Weber. Origin: Germany/Uganda. Age: 16. Date of Birth: 31/1/2007. Physical Disability: None. Home Language: German. Extra Knowledges: German, English, French, Japanese. Computer Languages: HTML, CSS, Java. Work Ethics: Good. Concluding Note: I'm a decent Web Developer that can stylize Websites Greatly and make it functional. (Not with JavaScript yet though.) Willing to work with you and will do whatever it takes! Mentor 2023-03-06, 17:37: Hi Tyrone! You have some pretty good points on your resume, but there are definitely things that you may not have thought of that can be added on. I'll list some of the points below: Previous experience: you can list some of the more interpersonal skills you've learned at previous job or volounteer experiences, or even course work you've done! Awards: any accomplishments, scholarships, awards you can put on such as being on Honour Roll, etc. Characteristics: You can talk about your diligence, curiosity, responsibility, etc. Great job on your first draft though! Try making an actual document now with everything you've gathered so far. Usually resumes should be one page in length, but as you get older you might have too many experiences and skills to fit on one page. You can share your resume to me after you've made it by clicking save to portfolio I believe. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:19: Hello Sarah! Just wanted to make a Message after the long Spring Break, I hope You had a good Break! Also, here's a Confession I'd like to make about all This Business. I came up with a good Idea to create my Own IT Brand! Its Name is, ""TD Enterprises"" and made a custom Logo for it. And I'm currently planning soon to Kickstart it off and I can make good Cash! So with this in Mind, I decided to quit looking for IT Jobs! But if I really/desperately want to have One, then I'll make a Word Document about my Resumé! Anyways, what's Your Verdict on my wise Decision? ?? Mentee 2023-03-30, 11:10: Hello Sarah! I wanted to talk about how I came to that Name of my Company called, ""TD Enterprises."" You see, the Part TD came from my First Full Name ""Tyrone-Diesel."" (Last Name being Weber) So I shortened it to TD then added Enterprises in the End. And I already designed an Actual Logo for my Company before you answered! Well never too late to make Another one Fortunately. Never knew it would've been taken though! Anyways, about the Resumé, I wish I could make it into a real Word Document and show it to you. But sadly, it won't let me attach it to the Message and send it to you. So we'll see soon if it's possible to attach one soon. Also, I've never had a Job Interview before and I have no Fears at all since it's only an Interview. Haha! Have a wonderful Day. :) Mentee 2023-04-03, 11:26: Hello Sarah. All done my Resumé! I got it all made and ready to go with the Word Application. Even cooler is that I didn't choose any Starting Template at all, I did the Color, Deisgn and Fonts all my own. And I think this one out of the Park! I hope you like it and please give me Feedback on my Resumé if Applicable. Thank you! :D Mentor 2023-04-04, 01:43: Hi Tyrone! Your resume looks really good aesthetics wise! You have some pretty good points on your resume, but there are definitely things that you may not have thought of that can be added on. I'll list some of the points below: Computer skills: if you know how to use Word, Powerpoint, Google docs, etc. these can added under computer skills! Awards: any accomplishments, scholarships, awards you can put on such as being on Honour Roll, etc. Characteristics: You can talk about your diligence, curiosity, responsibility, etc. Great job on your first draft though! Even though you don't have any formal work experience, there are tons of other experiences you can add on such as volunteering, projects you've worked on in class or personally, etc. Lastly, usually you don't need to mention too much of your personal information aside from name and contact information. Mentor 2023-04-12, 22:59: Hi Tyrone! How are the next few discussion questions going? Or are you working on improving your resume? Mentee 2023-04-14, 09:53: Hello Sarah. I wasn't actually working on anything really. I just wanted to take a short break! Anyways, yeah. Let's move on to the next segment if that's okay with you! Also I wish you a good Weekend. ?? Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:13: Hello Sarah! Sure, let's all move on to the next Segment. The next Segment I'd like to select is called, ""Finding Inspiration."" Despite me being good at Creativity and Ideating, I'd still like to explore that Segment because I got nothing to lose. Haha! Anyways, have an awesome Day. ?? Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:37: Hello Sarah! My main Goal with this is to improve a lot more in Web Design (Even though I know how, but I'd like to expand my knowledge from there). And maybe some Design with the Usage of JavaScript. Speaking of JavaScript, I'm already good at some Basic JavaScript and can already make Events and a Functional Website with JavaScript! Which for me is already a BIG Milestone. Due to that, I feel motivated to keep on learning more on JavaScript with the Website W3Schools.com! Mentee 2023-04-24, 10:20: Hello Sarah! Yes indeed, the Question I'll ask you is, ""Where do they find inspiration to do what they do, whether it be for school, work, passions/hobbies, or in pursuit of their desired career?"" Have a Good Day! Mentor 2023-04-25, 11:59: Hi Tyrone, To answer your question, I think my passion for physics started when I was in elementary school, when my dad showed me a lot of cool physics documentaries regarding the universe which motivated me to become a scientist. As I got older, I started to read more and learn more about physics in school, which propelled my interest, prompting me to apply to study for physics in univesrsty as well. Now that I am pursuing a physics degrees, I've had so many opportunities to conduct research in this really exciting field and explore topics that most other people have never even heard of. Mentee 2023-04-27, 10:38: Hello Sarah! Woah, sounds like a ton of fun to learn Physics! I'm glad you have a niche to dive into and explore more in. To answer my own Question: Ever since I enrolled into a High School, I had a Grade 8 class amongst the 4 of them and that was called, ""Grade 8 Coding."" And I was actually a Novice at first, but the more I got used to learning Basic HTML, the more motivated I became in Web Developement. I actually got a Solid B+ from that class after that Semester, so I was Happy! But then, I took a HUGE break in between, because the other coming courses I signed up for didn't have any Coding Class inbetween. But then inside of the Beginning of Grade 10, I got the love for Coding once again! And this seems like it'll be a Permenant Niche to withhold. And yeah, that's pretty much how I got into Coding! Have a Good Day. :D Mentee 2023-04-28, 10:38: Hello Sarah! I feel like moving on to Career Exploration, I just feel like Exploring how many Oppertunities there are in Today's World! So that way I can get the Feel of how much there is to it in Life. Have a Good Day. Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:09:  Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:10: Hello Sarah! I'd like to move on to the Next Anchor Text called, ""General Discussion"" if that's okay with You. Have a good Day! Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:13: Hello Sarah! My set of Goals are: • Utilize JavaScript in my Websites. • Utilize PHP as well. • Make $$$ from my Website Commissions. • Migrate successfully to a Foreign Country and live there with my Family next Month (Potentially about 3/5 (60%) of my Life). • Get an A+ at least once in my High School Life (I usually get C+ and B Grades). • Enroll into an IT University. • Travel the World. • Live a Long and Gracious Life. • Get a Pet for the First Time ever. My set of Habits are: • Loving to Learn more. • Getting Creative. • Being Respectful to those who I think deserve it (And don't worry! You deserve Respect as well). And yeah, that's all I have! Have a good Day. :) Mentor 2023-05-15, 18:58: Hi Tyrone! How's it going? Have you decided which question you want to ask? Mentee 2023-05-23, 10:10: Hello Sarah! Hope you're doing well so far, I decided to ask on the Topic called, ""General Discussion"" if that's okay with You. (: Mentee 2023-05-29, 10:12: Hello Sarah! Sure, I choose this Question called... ""What habits have they built, and how have these habits have helped them achieve their goals?"" (Have a good Day!) Mentor 2023-05-30, 13:19: Hi Tyrone! When you attend university, usually it's a really big transition from high school and a lot of things can change which means you need to build new habits. Some of the ones I built and how they have helped me are listed below: Study schedule: your courseload tends to be really heavy in university so it's really important to break down concepts and assignments into smaller chunks that are easier to absorb and finish Meal prepping: sometimes your parents won't be around to cook for you anymore in university, so it's necessary to make larger amounts of food that can be stored to eat later so you can save time on cooking/plan out groceries/getting the right amount of nutrients Exercise: going to workout regularly can really help boost both your brain and your body! Sleep: setting a consistent bedtime and getting at least 7 hours of sleep every night ensures that your brain can function normally during the day Doing all of these have really helped both my academic career and my mental health as I'm able to keep a healthy balance between working and relaxing so as to not burn out too fast. It also means I an achieve everything to the best of my ability without having to worry about my brain or body not performing optimally.",,,"Mentor 2023-02-15, 00:25: Hi Tyrone! Wow, I am also trying to learn Javascript right now haha, maybe you can mentor me instead! I've opened up the Getting Hired Module, feel free to ask me about the discussion questions! Mentor 2023-02-15, 21:33: Hi Tyrone! That's super impressive! You might want to also think about how you can market your abilities to future employers as well as other skills that may make you more employable in the job space. You can get started on this by answering the dscussion questions! Let me know if you have any trouble navigating this website and for the first question, you're gonna want to think about the following 5 areas listed below. Once you're done, give me a specific example of your experience for each skill. Communication • Responsibility or Dependability • Quick Learner • Team Work • Technology Mentor 2023-02-23, 14:34: Hi Tyrone! Those are all definitely really good traits! You can also list specific skills such as your knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Java under technologies. Lastly, I think the term is photographic memory rather than photogenic haha. Next, you will want to find a job posting that you would potentially want to apply to in the future and make a list of at least 4 skills the employer is looking for. Mentor 2023-02-25, 01:59: Thanks Tyrone! For your next steps, make sure to find a potential job posting that you would be interested in applying to and make a list of at least four skills that this employer is looking for. Once you're done with that, feel free to share with me so we can move on to creating your resume using these skills as a foundation! Mentor 2023-03-04, 00:09: Awesome, those are some amazing technical and personal skills! Now, you're going to want to put all of these into a sample resume and try to make one that would be suitable for this job posting. Be sure to send me your resume afterwards so I can comment and provide feedback! Mentor 2023-03-28, 16:29: Hi Tyrone! It's definitely been a while, I hope you had a great spring break! I think your idea of creating your own IT brand seems really cool; however, I believe the name ""TD Enterprises"" is already taken by another company. Even if you're thinking of making your own brand, you definitely still need to have a resume, as you never know when you'll need it in the future for other applications! If you don't feel like making a resume, we can move onto the next discussion question, where you can asnwer either of the following two questions and send your response back to me: If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better? If you have never had a job interview before, what are some things you’re nervous about, and what are you comfortable with? Mentor 2023-03-30, 15:15: Hi Tyrone! You can attach a document to send by clicking on ""Save to your portfoilio"" which is opposite to the ""Send"" button! Mentor 2023-04-14, 22:34: Hi Tyrone! I believe we're actually done all of the discussion questions for this section, so feel free to choose the next module you would like to explore!",,
1047582077,9/13/2022 22:17,1047592264,58906,,,"Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:17: Hi Teagan! First off, I'm so sorry about the late response! I had pressed send a few days ago, but I guess it didn't go through! I'll be more careful in the future. Secondly, how are you? :) If you're comfortable, tell me something (or things) good that happened to you this week. Something good that happened this week for me was that I got a new plant. It's a small orchid, and I hope I can keep it alive! I also had a really good iced coffee today, even though it's pretty snowy here. Warm-up Questions I'm going to start this module off by reflecting on the warm-up reflection questions, and you can do the same if you'd like. For me, I feel the most physically healthy when I cook meals from scratch for myself and move somehow during the day. The meals don't need to be 100% healthy, but the act of cooking makes me feel like I'm taking the time to something productive for myself. I'm not a huge gym person, but I do like to run sometimes, and it makes me feel great after :) I contribute towards my mental well-being by trying to keep a clean and organized home, as well as sticking to some sort of routine. In the past, I've found that when I do not have a routine, I feel much more stressed out and tend to procrastinate... a LOT! So, we'll start with Anchor Text 1: Self-Investigation. After reading ""Mind Power: 10 Tips for Student Mental Health“, be sure to share your thoughts on the article with me. I'll give you some example prompts to give you some ideas, but you don't have to answer them! You can choose how to reflect on the article however works best for you :) My response to the article: I'm glad that they included ""Tip 2: Access Student Services"". Personally, I've had many friends register with their schools' Center for Accesibility, and the accomodations that these places provide can be really helpful if you have an illness/health problem/learning disability. If you need accomodations, be sure to reach out as soon as you can after you are accepted, as sometimes it's a long wait to get everything sorted out! Another tip that I found helpful in my life was ""Tip 6: Use An Agenda To Stay On Track"". I set up an online calender at the beginning of each term and it helps me keep way more organized! That way, deadlines don't sneak up on my unexpectedly. Doing this also gives me a feeling of control over my time. My response to the video: Like the video says, I definitely wish I'd prioritized self-care as something to do EVERYDAY instead of as a reward. For me, making sure I spend time on self-care means I end up with more energy and motivation to be productive anyways! I find it hard to do work when I feel drained and exhausted because I neglected to take care of myself. Your turn! Now that I've shared my reflection with you, it's your turn to share your reflection with me! Click on the ""Discussion Questions"" box under Anchor Text 1: Self-Investigation for a list of prompts. Talk to you soon! Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:17: Warning signs - Procrastination is a big thing for me con wise i do it alot and i am trying my hardest. I also struggle alot with getting up in the morning or having any motivation to do certain things. Activities- I enjoy doing things with my family and friends or travelling listening to music I also enjoy playing ringette which is my favourtite sport and I like going on walks or sitting around the fire with my family. Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:21: My self care action plan- I am planning to start to get into a a better morning routine try to wake up earlier maybe thinking about getting a job i think i just need to work on me and try some more excersing for my mental health and try to push my self harder during school hours and push my self to take action towards my school life. Mentor 2023-04-17, 13:38: It looks like we have some similar goals -- which doesn't surprise me. I feel like most people struggle with procrastination every once in a while :) Action Plan I have the same issue. My morning routine tends to look a little more like 'wake up at 11am and lay around for an hour' instead of 'wake up early and get homework done'. That's definitely something I'm looking to change over the summer. I feel so much better about my day if it's off to a good start. I'm also in the hunt for a job, so I get how stressful that can be. I wish you luck in that! Hopefully before summer some places will be hiring for you :) Are you planning on starting up your action plan once school is finished? I find it hard myself to get into a new routine sometimes with the stress of school. Warning Signs As far as warning signs go, I'm one that doesn't function well on little sleep, so I think having a good night routine and getting a good sleep would help me prepare for my morning routine, too. I'll try to go to sleep at a consistent time so hopefully I can wake up at a consistent time too. I also struggle with procrastination. It can be so easy to get off-task and not get back on-task again. If I fall into procrastination for a day, it can be easier to fall back into it another, so I try to do my best to minimze it. Activities I have cats, and playing with them brings me joy. They're old ladies so they don't play much, but they love to lay with me. I'm also one for a walk or run, especially if it's sunny. Mentor 2023-04-17, 13:43: Oh, and for the action plan: have you figured out any specific times you're starting these changes or specific steps towards the goal? For example, do you have a specific time in mind to wake up? Or for the job hunt, a certain time you'll start looking? I just want to make sure you get full marks for the 'Action Plan' section, because I know this course is part of a class :) Talk to you soon!",,,,,"Mentor 2023-05-26, 11:36: Hi! I love thinking about potential careers. It's so fun for me to think about all the possible things to do and paths to choose, so I'm very glad you picked this module! I'll watch both videos and give my thoughts, and you can do the same, then we can answer Anchor Text 1. Also, just a reminder that there is an option to turn subtitles on. Just in case you don't have headphones with you! My Thoughts: Strengthening Communities Video I've never felt a strong pull or connection to my community, so I greatly admire the connection Lisa Sam has made with hers. To not only choose to work in her community, but to choose a career path that her community could benefit from is inspiring. And to do all that while going to university a a mother! My Thoughts: Dr. Goodlife First off, Revelstoke looks BEAUTIFUL! I definitely relate to the medical student being drawn to mountains and trees, though I do love the city. I have so much respect for rural doctors and healthcare workers and all the responsibilty they took on being sometimes the only provider for great distances. Anchor Text 1: Your Values Your Career My response to the prompts: Prompt 1: What do you value in life? This is such a broad question! But to keep it simple, I value integrity, well-being, nature, and generosity. Integrity is important to me because I think it can lead to living a fulfilling and authentic life. I actually learned about something called ""cognitive dissonance"" in one of my psychology classes. Cognitive dissonance is that uncomfortable feeling you get when what you do doesn't align with how you feel, or what you think you should do. For example, if you believe taking care of the planet and recycling is important, but you throw away soda cans, you might feel cognitive dissonance! Kind of cool I think, and a good example of why I think integrity and doing ""the right thing"" even when no one is watching is so important. Prompt 2: How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? I want to contribute to the community and the world by promoting mental health and wellness. I also want to contribute by taking care of nature, and by being a good friend! Prompt 3: Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? I volunteer with the KidsHelpPhone as a crisis line responder, and I'm going to school to one day become a therapist. Maybe I'll run a psychology lab one day! Though that sounds pretty stressful. As far as nature goes, I frequent my local beaches and trails and I document the species I see on an app called iNaturalist. It's a pretty neat app if you want to check it out! Your turn! I'm super excited to see your responses on this one!!",,,"Mentor 2023-02-09, 11:57: Hi Teagan! As you might have guessed, my name is Sam (she/her) and I'm excited to be your mentor over the next couple months! I noticed you're interested in Psychology, and have been looking into becoming a Forensic Psychologist. Well, guess what? I'm currently taking a class on Forensic Psychology! If you're curious as to what kind of material you would be learning in an introductory class, I'd be happy to let you know. (Spoiler: It's a lot of eyewitness testimony!) I'm not sure if you've had a chance to look at my profile, so I'll give you the quick version here: I'm currently in my 2nd year in a Bachelors of Psychology program at Simon Fraser University. I went from highschool to college, and I'm currently trying to transfer from college to university. My academic end-goal is a Master's of Counselling Psychology, then maybe Ph.D. I love to read, go on walks, cook, and hang out with my cats. It looks like your teacher wants you to complete 2 conversations of your choice by May, so feel free to let me know which conversation you'd like to start with :) Mentor 2023-02-09, 12:00: Also, be sure to read all the links under ""How the program works"" and let me know when you're finished so I can mark these as complete under the checklist. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know! Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:37: Hi, Samantha, My name is Teagan and im from a small town known as port albern and go to Alberni district secondary school it was lovely readin your profile i found it interesting how you prefer a smaller classrookm because so do I most of the time i like atleast only 30 people but that's usually the case in high school when i graduate im hoping to become a clincal therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist ive been interested in that ever since i was diagnosed with depression when i was 12 im currently still battling with it every day and it inspires me to help others when i graduate. Mentor 2023-02-13, 12:04: I haven't been to Port Alberni myself, but I've been to Vancouver Island a few times and WOW, I am so jealous of the nature (especially the tide pools and storms)! I'm glad we're on the same page about smaller classrooms being the best, trust me when I say it was an adjustment having to pile into a classroom of over 100 other students, especially when the weather's warmer... it gets BEYOND humid. That being said, sometimes professors play Kahoot or other online quizzing games, which is a new level of entertaining when you're in a room of 100 classmates instead of thirty. So, there's that to be excited about if you decide to go to a bigger post-secondary institution! Using your own experience with depression as a driving force for going into a helping field is awesome and a great way to make a difference in a lot of people's lives :) If there's a certain time/day your teacher has you work on ReMBC, feel free to let me know if you'd like me to log-on at the same time. Also, be sure to take a look at the options for modules and let me know which you want to start off with! Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:16: Hi Samantha, the nature is definitely my favourite thing about Vancouver island. Can you please open the well being and sefl care conversation. Mentor 2023-03-06, 10:17: Hi again Teagan, I haven’t heard from you in a while, so I just wanted to check-in and make sure you’re okay. I’m looking forward to working through this module together! :) Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:13: Hey, Samantha sorry about the month late response i've been dealing with some issues and spring break of course and i completely forgot about this but today i will start to work on the well being in self care discussion. Mentor 2023-03-27, 13:28: No worries at all!! I hope you're doing okay now and you had a great spring break Also feel free to take your time - we still have until May :) Mentor 2023-04-05, 11:54: Hi Teagan, Still no rush - we've got the time :) But if you have any specific days and times you'd like me to log on, feel free to let me know and I'll tell you if I'm available. That way we can power through a whole module in a day if you'd like! Mentor 2023-04-17, 13:48: Last thing: Which module would you like me to open up now? Mentee 2023-04-24, 10:20: Hi, Samantha i'm planning on starting my action plan probably today im trying to get my marks up and attendance better in class and i think i'll start looking for a job sometime this month or in may i'm trying to wake up at 7 am instead of 7:30 am and you can open up the module from rural to urban please and thank you Mentee 2023-05-12, 10:39: Hey Samantha, Sorry i've been out of touch for a bit I actually got a job this week at my local grocery store I've been wanting a job since January it's the second job that I've had and I'm very eager to start school has been a struggle for me this year work wise I've been having some attendance issues and I'm currently failing math but I only have a couple weeks left and i'm gonna get it all figured out. hope you have a great weekend. Mentor 2023-05-16, 22:50: No worries at all! It's awesome you got a job recently! I have an interview coming up for one this week too, so I'm in the same boat :) I hope these next few weeks run smoothly for you so you can enjoy the summer! Mentee 2023-05-26, 09:52: Hey Samantha, Been a while no talk just catching up I currently am passing math and have worked my first couple shifts at my job just wondering how things are with you? and if you could possibly open up module career exploration. Mentor 2023-05-26, 11:00: Woooo! It's awesome that you have math all figured out and started your new job :) I'm falling behind in my French class, so hopefully your good news rubs off on me too! I'll open up the career exploration module now. Mentee 2023-05-31, 10:26: Hey Samantha sorry i was planning on doing another module unfortunately i forgot i've been so busy and this is my last day communicating with you I learned tons from you and had a great time chatting and getting to know eachother a bit take care!","Mentor 2023-04-27, 14:53: Hi Teagan! So close to summer! Anything super exciting going on for you this sumer? I made a bucket list of things to do this summer, and first thing on it is to check-out some of the trails around where I live that I haven't seen before. Alright, onto the module: So, we'll start with Anchor Text 1: Taking Flight There is no video to watch or article to read for this section of the module, just a set of discussion questions! My response to the prompts: I'll answer the inverse of these questions, since I don't have experience living in a rural setting :) Prompt 1: Three things you like about living in an urban area. For each, explain why you like it 1) I love that no matter what time it is, day or night, there is always something going on. I like the busyness of my surrounding area, and that if I'm awake at 2am and am looking for something to do, there's always a cafe open or somewhere to go. It's comforting to be outside at any time and see other people moving about. 2) Convience of services. Living in an urban setting means that I have access to many services very easily. For example, I've never had to worry if a veterinary clinic was open in driving distance if one of my cats had an emergency late at night. I am very grateful for this part of urban living. 3) You can easily blend in in the city. One last thing I like about living in an urban area is that because the area I live is densely populated, I see way too many people on a daily basis to worry about the impression I leave on them. This allows me to relax in public, and not worry so much if I embarrass myself. Nobody knows who I am! Prompt 2: Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. 1) I don't like that I have a bit of distance between myself and nature. While there is many places to access nature around me, they are all normally pretty busy. This is very different than my experience visiting rural areas. One of my parents lives about 3 hours up in the interior, and when I visit I really enjoy the quiet and seclusion. 2) While I mentioned the busyness of urban areas as something I enjoy, there are some days that it can be overwhelming. I am particularly sensitive to noise, so being in a densely populated area can be frustrating in that sense occassionally. Your turn! Now that I've shared my reflection with you, it's your turn to share your reflection with me! Click on the ""Discussion Questions"" box under Anchor Text 1: Taking Flight for the prompts you will be answering. When you're done, I'll send my responses to Anchor Text 2 very shortly after, so you have time to complete this module before the upcoming deadline. Talk to you soon! And best of luck as finals near! Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:39: Prompt 1: Three things you like about living in an rural area. For each, explain why you like it - I like how close i am with nature i'm surrounded by mountains and wildlife and beautiful lakes that are clear and warm and big. I like how everyone is close in a small community and how friendly people are to eachother. I also really like how close places are like 5 minutes away from your job or schools or a grocery store it's convienent. Prompt 2: Two things you don’t like and, again, explain your reasons for each. - I don't like how everything is closed usually early around 5 or 6 so when people usually get off work you can't go to certain restaurants or shops/places, and places are usually closed on sundays and mondays. I don't like how you have to drive an hour to get to a mall or a costco because if i wanna go to the mall i have to ask my parents to drive me i can't just walk or bike or catch a ride with a friend, I have to wake up earlier to get to the mall but also spend quite a bit of time there so it's not a waste of a day or gas and money. Mentor 2023-05-01, 11:02: Hi Teagan! Onto Discussion Questions #2. You know the drill, feel free to ask any questions! Anchor Text 2: Same But Different Again, there is no video to watch or article to read for this section of the module, just a set of discussion questions! Note that you only have to answer 1 of the 2 prompts listed under discussion questions, but feel free to complete both if you'd like :) My response to the prompts: Prompt 1: Compare places/activites from where you live now to where you want to move. I might move to Vancouver Island to do my masters degree after I graduate, so I will research activities on Vancouver Island. Remember to write the exact name &amp; location of your new places/activities! Home Place 1: Vancouver Aquarium Similar Place 1: Ucluelet Aquarium (180 Main St, Ucluelet, BC V0R 3A0) Home Place 1: Acadia Beach Similar Place 2: Cattle Point Urban Star Park (Oak Bay, BC) Home Place 3: Pacific Spirit Park Similar Place 3: Cathedral Grove Park (452 Alberni Hwy, Nanaimo, BC) Prompt 2: Plan to bring a childhood tradition to a new place One tradition that I had at home growing up was blueberry pancakes every Sunday. This isn't something I still do, but it is definitely something I could start againt to bring some 'home' with me when I move. Plus, blueberry pancakes are delicious. Your turn! Almost done your second module! Wooo! I'm pretty sure your teacher said you needed to complete 2 modules by May, so this should be our last one. It was really nice meeting you Teagan :) Talk to you soon! Mentee 2023-05-02, 11:06: Prompt 1: Compare places/activites from where you live now to where you want to move. - I don't have any where in particular where i want to move maybe hawaii or comox valley but where i currenlty live it's kinda the same because if i were to move to hawaii they both have similarties like surfing, hot summers, it's on an island but hawaii is more commercialized and more of a tropical enviorment. Prompt 2: Plan to bring a childhood tradition to a new place - I grew up in a big city and my family would camp alot with family friends and quad and go tubing at my grandparents cabin lots of swimming as well whether it was at a public pool or by the river or a beach but i had a very outdoorsy childhood i'd say. Mentor 2023-05-08, 11:15: Hi Teagan! Hawaii would be an awesome place to live, I've always wanted to visit. Especially to try surfing. I've gone camping a lot as well, and that's definitely something I would also want to continue wherever I live. I think this brings us to the end of the program, as your teacher said to complete any 2 modules of your choice. It was great getting to know you a bit, and let me know if there's any other modules you would want to complete :) Cheers, Sam",,,,
1047582721,9/20/2022 13:24,1047592260,58905,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-16, 11:02: Hi Tayla, I hope your week is going well so far! I just unlocked the Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning conversation, I think thats a great one to start with. You have a lot beter idea of what you want to do then I did at your age. I didnt figure out what I really wanted to do until the last year of my undergraduate degree. So you have lots of time to figure it out. Saying that its good to always think about what interests you and try to work towards some shorter term goals ( like making sure you are taking all the courses you need for programs you are interested in). There is no need to be stressed about it. The important thing is to follow what you are passionate about. Mentee 2023-03-10, 10:32: Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning I researched the education I will need to be a Veterinary technician and it says I need a 2 year degree. 3 reason why I would benefit from attending post-secondary school are, ill get better job opportunities, I can leave my home town and explore the world, good paying jobs. 3 factors that’ll make it challenging for me are, my current grades in high school aren’t that good so I will have to bump them up, going to a school far away from my home and family is scary, its 2-4 years in college, which isn’t that long but it’ll be hard when I have to leave college because ill create so many memories there and make new friends. I want to get high school done and over with because I feel like I would enjoy learning about vet technician stuff would interest me more and it’ll help me understand it better and make me want to understand it. I think my career is definitely achievable because whatever I put my mind to, I can do. As I’ve been told. I just have to start working towards it and start saving money for college. Mentor 2023-03-13, 16:07: Hi Tayla, it was so great to read your first answers to the discussion question and see that you have been really thinking about your plan after high school. A Vet Tech degree sounds really interesting. 2 years is quite a short program and there are always lots of scholarships and ways that you can work towards paying for something like this. It's great you are already thinking about how much you will earn as well once you have your training. Have you ever thought about doing your undergraduate degree? Would that be something that interests you? For example, a degree in animal science or biology? These are usually 4 year programs. I definitely agree with you about the reasons for attending post-secondary school. I think it is so important and I feel so lucky to have been able to go to university. I think it is great to be able to work in an area you are interested in, get a better-paying job, and it is a great way to start a new journey post-high school. I found that it was such a great way to transition from living at home to being much more independent. It's a really safe space to learn and meet people who are at a similar stage to you. I found this really helped. I lived in residence at the university and it was so much fun. I really recommend that. You mentioned that whatever you put your mind to, you succeed at. I was so happy to hear that. Its so true and the worst thing you can do is put yourself in a box without really trying something. Its so important to set big goals and work towards reaching them. You mentioned you are a bit worried about your high school grades. To be very honest, your grades before grade 10 dont matter that much to universities. They care much more about the later years of high school and they actually really like to see that you are improving as you go along. It is also sometimes good to check what the requirements for programs are so that you can meet them before you apply. I'm sure if you put your mind to it you could start to see improvements in your grades too. Also, in your applications to schools, it is great to have some work or volunteer experiences that can really build your resume. Do you have any questions for me? Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:18: Hi Matilda, I found your reply under the post-secondary &amp; career planning. No, I haven’t really put any thought into an undergraduate degree, but I’ll look into it. I really want to go to college one day but I’m also not sure if I truly really want to. And yes, I am so excited to move out and transfer to living alone, I feel like it would be tons of fun but also scary. No I do not think that I have any questions, ill let you know when I do. Mentor 2023-04-19, 11:33: Hi Tayla, Nice to hear from you! Great, I'm glad you were able to find it. Its a bit confusing for sure. Im so glad to see you are thinking about all the different avenues you can take. It's so important to start thinking about this early. It looks like we are almost done with this conversation. There is one more anchor text with discussion questions to do (Anchor Text 2: Choosing a School) and then we can move on to another conversation. It looks like your teacher wants us to get through 2 conversations by May. Let me know if I can do anything to help us get done on time. Also it might be good to start thinking about what conversation you would like to do next. Talk soon! Mentor 2023-04-19, 11:35: Sorry, Tayla I just saw your message in this chat! There is one more anchor text with discussion questions (Choosing a School) and then we can move on. That's great you have already decided which conversation to do next. I will unlock it as soon as we finish that last discussion! Mentee 2023-04-28, 10:26: I have changed my mind about a vet technician, im still thinkiking about it i just havea few more ideas, which are: something to do with healthcare or a paramedic. i noticed that NIC college offeres animal care classes, and i only need my Math 11 and English 11 which im happy about so it might be a good idea. Mentor 2023-05-04, 13:09: Hi Tayla, I hope you are doing well. No way that is so cool you are thinking about doing healthcare now. I am biased but I think it is the coolest! I absolutely love it because being able to help people in a time when they need it the most is so rewarding. It is also an area where there are always jobs, the pay is pretty good, and there is always room to learn and grow. Its also great you are able to see some specific programs and the courses you need to get into them. There are lots of avenues to be involved in healthcare. You can be a medical office assistant, which only takes a small course and for that you do administrative type work in a doctor's office, you can be a nurse which is 2-4 year degree, you can be a doctor (undergraduate degree 4 years and medical degree 4 years), paramedic (many different types of paramedics usually it's about an 8-month course), and so many other paths. Do you have any questions about any of that? Part of the assignment was making a document with your research on admissions requirements and sharing it to your portfolio were you able to do that yet? Let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to moving on to the next conversation! Mentor 2023-05-05, 10:06: Hey! Sorry I'm still getting a hang of this platform too. The only thing I couldn't see was your answer to these two questions: 1. Do you think you’ll be admitted into the program(s) you researched? Why or why not? 2. What factors made you interested in picking NIC to look into? As soon as you answer those I will open up getting hired! Looking forward to reading your answer.",,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-09, 11:51: Hi Tayla! My name is Matilda. I’m so happy to be your mentor and I’m looking forward to getting to know you better over the next few months! I was so excited to see that you are interested in becoming a vet tech, that’s really cool! It seems like you really love animals, do you have any pets? I’m sure you can read my profile too but I thought I would give you a quick intro here. I’m from a rural Vancouver Island town too and I am now in medical school studying to be a doctor one day. Outside of school, I also love to bake, cook good food, watch terrible reality TV and do lots of outdoor adventures. I just wanted to reach out to say hi. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have about school, university, careers or just general life stuff! Im so excited to be a mentor and I hope that I can be helpful for you. Looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:16: Hi Matilda!! Yes, I do have pets. I have 5 cats and 3 dogs. I absolutely love hanging out with them. I really want to be a vet tech but I’m not sure what classes I need to take, do you know what classes I need? I’m also excited to get to know you more and hopefully I will learn something useful. I think its really cool that you’re studying to be a doctor! I also love baking and watching tv lol. Mentor 2023-02-13, 11:07: Hey! So nice to hear from you. Wow so many animals, that sounds like a lot of fun! It seems like you have a big passion that would be amazing to follow for your career! I am not sure what classes you need, but I will look into it and get back to you. Have you looked into any programs that you are interested in? I was also wondering what grade are you in? I absolutely love my school right now. It's so nice when you find the thing you are passionate about because then it feels a bit less like work and it's way more fun! It looks like your teacher wants you to do two of the conversation modules and you can choose which ones you think would be most useful. Let me know which ones you are interested in, and what module you would like to do first. Then I can unlock it for you to get started. I'm really looking forward to getting to know you over the next couple of months. Please let me know if you have any questions at all! Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:17: Yeah, it is a lot of fun having so many pets, I would love to go in the direction to be a vet tech but I’m just not sure it’s what I really want to do but nothing else interest me. I am Grade 10, I haven’t looked into any programs yet I am going to soon I think. Could you unlock Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning? I think that’s a pretty important one we should talk about so I can figure what I really wanna do in my future and what I need to do to get there. Mentor 2023-02-28, 08:58: Hi Tayla, I just wanted to check in and see how everything is going. Is there anything I can help you with getting started on the module? Let me know if I can help at all or if you have any questions! Mentee 2023-03-31, 10:07: Hey!! im back, sorry i havent replied in awhile. Did you have a Spring break? Mentor 2023-04-04, 07:35: Hey! It's so nice to hear from you. How was your spring break? I'm sorry it took me a bit longer to respond this time. I have just finished all my exams for the semester and finally have time to catch up on everything. I sadly didn't get a spring break but I do get to finish my semester soon which I am excited about! Were you able to see my response to your first ""conversation""? Mentee 2023-04-05, 11:03: Hi Matilda! My spring break was good. That sucks that you didnt have a spring break. No, I dont think i got your response from the first conversation, when did you send it? Mentor 2023-04-05, 11:39: Oh, that's so weird. If you look under the Post-secondary and career planning section you will see my response there. There is also a tab under (Inactivity starts here) chat that we are talking on right now. Let me know if that helps! Mentee 2023-04-19, 10:36: Is there anything else i have to do for Post-Secondary &amp; career planning? If I don't, could you open up getting hired? Mentee 2023-05-05, 09:51: Hi Matilda. I am 99% sure that i answered all of the questons on here. Is there anything that i have missed? And yeah i thought it be fun to do something with healthcare but my heart is still set on being a vet technician. Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:16: Hi Matilda, you said i have to pick a school still but im pretty sure i already did, do you remember me talking about Douglas college? is there anything else i need to do, this is really confusing lol. Mentee 2023-05-24, 11:07: Hi Tilly! Thats going to be your new nickname lol. How was ur kayaking trip? i hope you had fun! One of the discussion questions says to talk about if ive ever had an interview. I have had an interview before, it was at mcdonalds last year. I was nervous about the whole thing but i am usually very socially awkward, but ive gotten better, the interview went pretty good, and when i got home everything was good and they were calling me and saying how i had to fill out a form for something and he said he sent it but i never got it, i ended up telling them i got a different job. I just didnt want to work there i know i definetly wouldve hated it. and i know like you have to have a crappy job at the start even if you dont like it but i had a choice, so i didnt do it. and this summer im going to be babysitting and im also going to move in with my auntie for a few weeks in a different town and work at a sushi bar, thats where she works. Mentee 2023-05-31, 11:08: Hi Tilly, im doing good, how are you? Yes this is the last day :( thank you so much for everything. I really enjoyed my time talking to you. I dont think i have anymore questions. i hope the rest nof your time in university treats you well. it was so nice having you as my mentor!",,,"Mentor 2023-05-08, 10:34: Hey Tayla, No worries at all. It is confusing! If you feel like you have learned enough from the last conversation that's great, lets move on to Getting Hired. I have unlocked it now so you should be able to access it. For this module conversation, there are lots of interesting assignments. There are two anchor texts and discussion questions to answer. For the first you will work through the conversation and send me: 1. Specific examples of your experience with each skill area listed 2. Send me a job posting you are interested in applying to now and your lists of skills that the employer is looking for. 3. We will work on your resume. Send me a draft (remove personal information) and then I will send you some edits. After we have finished this then you will move on to the second anchor text and discussion questions. This one is much shorter. In this one you watch a video and then write to me about your experiences with job interviews. Let me know if you have any questions or have problems accessing any of the instructions. Looking forward to reading your work! Mentee 2023-05-12, 10:02: Hey Matilda, thank you for opening the getting hired conversation. The first part it says to do is discuss with you some skills and times when I’ve experienced them. The first one is communication. I use communication basically everyday at school, like when I’m asking teachers for help or asking friends. The next one is Responsibility or dependability. I’d say that’s when I’m out with my friends and I need to make sure I text my mom that I’m okay and where I am, because it’s a responsibility to let my loved ones know I’m okay. Quick learner, I’m usually a quick learner but sometimes I’m also a visual learner, for example. I’ll be at school and in art class, with some projects I might understand right away but sometimes I’ll need to see how someone else does it to get ideas on how to start. Teamwork, I have a great example of this one, this morning I was in science and were currently building a roller coaster thing for physics, and my and my two friends had to figure out how we were going to design it and start building and that was teamwork. Technology, im not sure what this one should be quite about but there was a time like where I would help either my parents or grandparents how to work their ohone/tv. Mentor 2023-05-16, 08:30: Hey Tayla, Sorry for the late response, I am on my summer break right now and currently on a kayaking trip with limited data. Thats awesome thanks so much for sending your well thought out answers! Sounds like you have some really great skills that will help you a lot as you grow and move on from high school! Im looking forward to seeing your next discussion question about a job posting. All the best, Tilly Mentor 2023-05-30, 12:11: Hi Tayla, I hope you are doing well! I wanted to reach out because it looks like your class is finishing up the program and I just wanted to make sure that I have answered all your questions. It has been such a pleasure working with you over the last couple of months and learning about all your goals for your future. It's so awesome that you have so much passion for animals and you are really thinking responsibly about your career goals. Please feel free to reach out if you have any last-minute questions! Mentor 2023-05-31, 13:30: Hi Tayla, That's crazy how fast it went! I really enjoyed talking with you as well. Thanks so much for being such a great mentee. I wish you all the best in your future and I know you will do amazing in whichever path you choose. I hope the last bit of the school year goes well for you and you have an awesome summer break! Mentor 2023-06-02, 11:15: Hi Tayla, I just wanted to say that if you would like we can continue working through the program, or just chatting after your class is over. The eMentoring staff are happy to keep your mentoring relationships active as long as we want, Its totally up to you I just wanted you to know there is that option. All the best!",,
1047590550,1/12/2023 23:12,1047592266,58904,,,"Mentor 2023-05-26, 20:27: Hi Mary, that's okay, I understand! I just opened the Well Being and Self Care one for you. Unfortunately I don't think that UBC currently has a Health Care Assistant program, but they do have a Nursing program. I'm not sure why, but maybe they will add it in the future. Also, I got an email from your teacher saying that the last day for you to work on the program is June 1. I just wanted to tell you that I'd be happy to continue talking and working on the program after this day if you would like to! For the first part of this new topic there is an article to read and a video to watch. Then we can think about some warning signs that we may need some self care, and activities that we enjoy doing and talk about them. I will think of some things too! Let me know when you'd like to talk about it, or if you have any questions! :)",,,"Mentor 2023-02-24, 11:22: Hi Mary! I'm good, how are you? I decided that I wanted to go to university in early high school. I actually did a program very similar to this one in grade 8 or 9 where I got to think about possible careers and how to accomplish my goals and it was very helpful! I think at that time some ideas that I had were teaching, nursing or something related to medicine. I knew that I wanted to go to a school somewhere in BC, and UBC (where I am going to school now) was my top choice because there were lots of programs that I was interested in. In high school I really enjoyed my science classes and in grade 10 and 11 I went to a program at UBC where I got to meet scientists and learn about what they do. This experience made me really want to go back to UBC after high school to study science, so I applied there in grade 12. Have you had the chance to think about some potential careers that you may like to do in the future? Mentor 2023-03-08, 14:20: I'm so happy to hear that!! :) The first part is ""Anchor text 1: What education do you need?"" Have you read the information about different kinds of degrees and certificates? Perhaps we can talk about some jobs/ programs that may interest you? It's good to think of a couple possible job options/ goals, but there's no pressure to make any decisions about what you want to do right now. I know you are interested in playing basketball in the future. Would you be interested in studying something that is related to sports? Kinesiology is a cool program where you get to learn about the science of sports, activities and health. A business degree also may be good if you want to run your own business or manage a sports team. Becoming a high-school gym teacher may also be a fun job! Mentor 2023-03-09, 20:58: That's great that you like your current job! I believe you said that you work in Parks &amp; Recreation? What is your favourite part of your job? Yeah, learning about muscles and how the body works is very interesting! This website from Simon Fraser University has some information about their Kinesiology program. https://www.sfu.ca/career/WCID/faculty-of-sciences/kin.html If you click on the ""What are the Career Possibilities?"" drop-down menu on that website there are lots of exciting careers listed there. For example: Excersise Physiologist, Recreation Instructor, Physiotherapist, Teacher... Perhaps you can pick one that seems interesting and we can talk about the education that you may need for it. :) Mentor 2023-03-28, 19:19: Hi Mary! No problem, I hope you enjoyed your spring break! It's great to hear that you have people that you like to work with! It can be lots of fun to work with friends! Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts about the website and the possible jobs :) Mentor 2023-04-17, 15:54: Hi Mary, I'm sad to hear that your month has not been good. :( I hope things will get better soon, and I'm here if you would ever like to talk to someone. Nursing is a great job, it is in high demand and it pays well! What college did you visit? Nursing would also be a good career to talk about for the ""Post Secondary and Career Planning"" Conversation! On the WorkBC website there is lots of information about the jobs in nursing. Here is a link for info about being a Nurse Care Aid: https://www.workbc.ca/career-profiles/nurse-aides-orderlies-and-patient-service-associates And here is a link to info about being a Registered Nurse: https://www.workbc.ca/career-profiles/registered-nurses-and-registered-psychiatric-nurses When you have some time feel free to check out the pages on WorkBC, then we can start working on the Anchor Text 1 Discussion Questions! Let me know if you have any questions. Mentor 2023-04-19, 14:13: Yeah I agree, that would be great to try out! Its also nice that the college is close by! Also for this program we have to talk about your thoughts about post-secondary. What are your thoughts on these questions below? What are some reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary? What are some factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for the careers? (Cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc.) How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why? Mentor 2023-04-24, 12:02: Yeah I agree. It can be difficult to get a good well-paying job without some post secondary school or training. I see what you mean about taking a gap year. I didn't do a gap year, and I was happy with my decision because it meant that I could finish school sooner and also get a job sooner. I would really only reccomend doing a gap year if you would like to work to save money to go to school, or if you are not sure what you would like to study. I think you can definitely get those grades! If you ever are having trouble with a certain class make sure to ask for help from teachers or friends. In my experience, it is the best way to improve your grades. Also, if you try really hard in school and get good grades you can get scholarships for post secondary. That is how I am paying for school right now. Do you have any questions for me? Perhaps you can ask me one of these discussion questions: Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university? What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them? How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do they have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? Did length of schooling and experience needed factor in to their career decisions? If so, how? Are they happy with their decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not? Mentor 2023-05-01, 16:33: I often feel the same way and have a lack of energy, and it can be hard to focus on school. Something that helps me is spending a little bit of time doing something fun or relaxing, like going for a walk, playing video games, or watching TV. I'd suggest that during your free time, you do someting that you enjoy! For me, I wanted to go to school because I wanted to get a good job, and learn more about Biology and Chemistry because it was interesting to me in high school. In grade 12 I applied to The University of British Columbia (UBC) and Simon Fraser University (SFU). I wanted to go to a school that was not too far away from home and had lots of science programs. UBC was my first choice because I liked how nice the campus was, and they had so many different science programs. I was accepted to both UBC and SFU, but I decided to pick UBC because I recived a scholarship that helped me pay for my classes, so I couldn't say no to the offer, especially since it was my first choice! I think that location, financial assistance, and the student support at UBC were the most important factors for choosing my school. What is important for a post-secondary school to have for you? On the Post Secondary Anchor Text 2 (Choosing a school) Discussion Questions is has a list of some factors to think about. For example, would you prefer to stay close to home or move away? Are sports teams and clubs important, or would you prefer a school that just focuses on academics? Let me know what you think, or if you have any more questions. :) Mentor 2023-05-08, 16:05: I agree, those are very good things to think about! It's nice to not be too far away from home. Next we can try to find a few options for schools that have sport teams and are fairly close to home. We can go onto the BC Education Planner website for some ideas. https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/plan/start/planning You said that the North Island College is close by and has a nursing program, so that would be a good first option. Perhaps you can find one or two other options on the website (like Vancouver Island Univeristy or the University of Victoria) and check to see if they have the program you are interested in and sports teams.",,,,,"Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:39: hello Anita i am mary i am in grade 10 from ADSS [ alberni distric secondary school] i go by she\he my intrest right know is basketball. Mentor 2023-02-10, 12:11: Hi Mary, nice to meet you! My name is Anita and I am a fourth-year student at the University of British Columbia! It's so cool to hear that you are interested in basketball, my favourite sport is hockey! I use she/her pronouns. I am excited to work with you in this program! When you read through all the information about how the program works just let me know! :) Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:29: hi Anita nice to meet you to i think that is really cool that your favorite sport is hockey, i have played basketball since grade 3 and i made team captin this year for my grade 10 year. how long has hockey been your favorite sport. Mentor 2023-02-13, 12:32: Wow that's a long time! Congratulations on making team captain this year! Hockey has been my favourite sport for as long as I can remember. I think I started learning how to skate when I was about 4 or 5 years old! Unfortunately I don't play much anymore, but I still enjoy watching others play. Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:42: Hey Anita sorry i havent been answeing, I was a way for a basketaball tournament. Last weekend was our last week of basketabll which is really sad but it was a good season. is it possible if you can open the post secondary and career planning please and thank you. Mentor 2023-02-21, 10:50: Hi Mary, it's no problem! I'm happy to hear that you had a good season, and I hope you did well in your basketball tournament! I will open up the post secondary and career planning conversation next. :) Mentee 2023-02-24, 10:09: hey anita how are u doing today i just finished reading the post secondary and career life package. i just wanted to hear about how you got started in your school and how you decided to go into it. Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:23: I am glad to hear that you are doing good That seems like a cool excperiance. I would love to go check out UBC me and my frind were both looking at it. Do you think you can like tell me about it. Right know i dont really know what i want to do and honestly i would love to keep on with basketball but i dont think that will happen. I aslo would like to travel a bit so i dont know if i want to take a year off or just get it over and done with. Mentor 2023-02-28, 16:16: I would definitely recomend going to check out post-secondary campuses! I think it is a great way to see if you would like to go there in the future. I have really enjoyed my time at UBC. The campus is beautiful and is surrounded by nature. Lots of people say that UBC is like a small city! There are classes in almost every topic you could think of, and there are lots of sports teams. I am not sure what the basketball recruiting process is like, but I could help you look into it! As a student you can do drop-in sports too. I know that they have drop-in basketball so you could countine playing after high-school! That's totally okay, you definetely have lots of time to figure out what you would like to do! No pressure! :) Also, there are opportunities to travel during the school breaks. At UBC we usually get a short break in November and February, and there is a two-week break between term 1 and term 2 (includes Christmas and New Years). Many people use these times to take short trips. You could also travel during the summer months (May-August) if you aren't taking classes. Taking a year off can also be a good option! There's lots of options out there and I'm happy to talk about it with you, I know it can be quite overwhelming! Mentee 2023-03-01, 10:16: thank you i would love to talk about it all speciaslly the besketball one. I have looked at the website and it looks really pretty and i would love to go see it in person. i think i might ask my parents to take me to go look one day. do you think you can tell me about the corses you took. Mentor 2023-03-01, 12:56: That's great to hear! I'd also reccomend to go to the programs that universities offer for high school students, that is how I decided to go to UBC! I went to a program called the Verna J. Kirkness Education Foundation Program. It is a free program open to Indigenous students (grades 11-12) and you get to visit a university in Canada for a week and learn about science! If you meet the application requirements I'd reccomend it for next year even if you aren't interested in science. At UBC I am doing a degree in Biochemistry, which is studying how cells/ living things work on a very small scale! I have taken courses in Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Math, Earth/Ocean Science, and English. My favourite courses so far would be the ocean science courses! I got to learn about all the tiny things (like bacteria) that live in the ocean and how important they are! I am also very interested in jellyfish, they are very mysterious! Chemistry and Math were challenging, but chemistry was interesting because you get to learn about molecules and chemical reactions. Also this summer I will be taking a film studies class, and a class on the science of food and how it is made. I am especially excited for the film studies class because I can watch movies for homework! Mentor 2023-03-03, 13:05: Hi Mary! I just wanted to reach out and ask if you are planning to come to the Meet your Mentor event on Tuesday evening. It's still not too late to register for the event. I will be going and I think it would be great to meet you! :) Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:37: HI anita i didnt even know there was a meeting tuesday, i will think about it what is the information and all about it. also for the program that sounds fun i would so sign up for it. i struggled in math a bit last semester so i dont know about the math one and science i did pretty good in, for science i was really good at chemistry. if I do the program what would I do there for the week like do I have a guide like how does it work and all if you dont mind telling me. Mentor 2023-03-06, 12:45: Hi Mary, the meeting is tomorrow from 5-7pm and it is taking place online. If you come we could meet, play games, and you could ask questions or get advice on careers or college/ university. If you are interested in coming, you just need to register using this link: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4kW9RC2fYbmCCG That's great to hear that you are interested in the program! I agree, math can be very challenging! During the week of the program you will spend most of the time working with a scientist and learning about what they do. You usually get to work with them (and another student in the program) on a small and fun science project! You will also get to learn more about the university and explore the campus. All your meals for the week are free and you will get to stay in the student housing too. It is a great experience and you can also put on your resume! Here is a link to the website if you would like to read more about it: https://vernajkirkness.org/page-1075196 I'm happy to answer any questions that you still have! Also, would you like to talk about some of the disscussion questions for Post-Secondary and Career Planning? Mentee 2023-03-08, 11:01: The program seems realy fun i would honestly love to do it i honestly think i will sign up for it i was talking to one of my friends and she said she would also do it, i will probably talk to my parents about it tonight . yes i would love to talk baout post secondary and career life planning. Mentee 2023-03-09, 11:27: i havent read the diffrent kinds of degree and certifictions i dont think, but i do already have a job that is really good. i honestly like it a lot and i would keep going with it. i think i would like to learn more about the muscles and evrything i feel like i would be cool and all. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:21: Hey Anita sorry i havent been answrering my school was on spring break, we just got back. yeah i work with parks and recreation i think my favorite part is working consession. conssession is my favorite I think because of the people that work there with. i will also check out the link. thank you. Mentee 2023-04-04, 10:36: thank you yes i did have a good spring break. for right know i dont think i have any questions. Mentee 2023-04-17, 11:16: hello, sorry i hvaent been answeing i am having a bad month so far. also i honestly kinda took some intrest in like nursing homes. the only reason i have is because we went to the collage to go and look around at offers of classes and i seen a nursing one for elders. i aslo know how to at some points because i had to help take care of my grandma.

I'm sure you will have lots of fun too! :) Yeah the health care assistant job is a great idea! What post secondary schools are you most interested in going to?

I agree with you that the education to become a lawyer is quite lengthy but if you truly want to do it, it might feel like you breezed through it at the end. As you mentioned, the job itself would be worth it at the end. I have answered all your questions below: 1) Did length of schooling and experience needed factor in to their career decisions? I tried not to let the length of schooling factor to much into my decision but experinece defintely did. I was certain that I wanted to be a teacher when I started attending post-secondary school and was not worried about the length of schooling required. I ended up choosing to attend Simon Fraser University (SFU) because I had heard that so many people had lovely experineces in the Faculty of Education at the school. People told me that the professors in the department were kind, caring, and understanding. I ultimately chose the school that I thought I would have the best experinece at! 2) How did you choose what university you wanted to go to? And did you ever regret your choice? I only applied to two universities with the hope that I would get into SFU. I knew that I wanted to stay in the Lower Mainland so I did not apply to any universities that were far away. I ended up choosing SFU because I heard so many wonderful things about the Education programs there. I did not regret my choice because I know if I chose the other university I would have had to transfer to SFU or UBC eventually as it did not offer the Bachelor's Degree I needed. 3) Are they happy with their decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not? I am happy that I chose post-secondary education. Many teachers are expected to have a Bachelor's Degree and teaching certification and the way to get these is by attending post-secondary school. I had a wonderful experinece at SFU, the education community was so welcoming I even ended up working for an SFU after-school program. I got to help newcomers to Canada learn English by running games with them in different schools in Surrey and Burnaby. I also learned the importance of reflective practice in education and beyond. Through classes and professors, I learned to reflect on my emotions and understand them rather than sweeping them under the rug and letting them build on one another. Such an important practice for an educator! I hope that answers your questions! Feel free to move onto Anchor Text 2! I look forward to reading your responses :) -Gurkirat",,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-09, 11:52: Hi Marianne, Nice to virtually meet you! My name is Gurkirat (pronounced gur-key-rit) and I will be your e-mentor. I just graduated from Simon Fraser University (SFU) with a degree in education. I am planning on becoming a teacher and still have to do my teacher education program at SFU before I offically become a Social Studies teacher. From your profile, I see that you are interested in potentially becoming a teacher, so if you have any questions I'm always here to help :) Right now I am working two part time jobs with students and newcomers to Canada and I am volunteering at the high school I went to. Like you, I also like hanging out with my friends whenever I have some free time. I also like listening to music before bed, going for walks to explore new places, and baking. You have lots of career options that you are exploring which is wonderful! I'm excited to read your introduction message and get to know a little more about you! Some questions I have are... 1) What classes are you taking this semester? 2) What is your favourite subject? 3) Why are you interested in either law school, policing, or teaching? What drew you to these professions? Chat soon, Gurkirat Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:42: Hi Gurkirat My name is Marianne, but I go by Mary, I just moved to Port Alberini little over a year ago from Ontario. My parents got offered a job out of nowhere and we moved down. The school I’m at now is huge compared to my last school, my last school had another high school and elementary school connected to it. My part of the school was the length of a long hallway. This semester I have Metal Work in the morning, then carrier life education, Pe and Spoken Language 10, last semester I took pre calc 10, science 10, socials 10 and art. My favorite subject was math for a really long time but it’s gotten a little confusing but it’s still in my top 3. I absolutely love biology, It’s interesting and easy so it’s like the perfect class. I like socials too because it’s history, once you know it, you know it. I’m interested in being a lawyer because first of all they make bank and secondly I love debating and proving that I’m right, I’d like to be a cop or detective because I can connect the dots pretty well and I feel like I’d do a good job and enjoy it and it would be exciting. And finally I would love being a teacher because of the person connection I could have with students and they have summers off. Mentor 2023-02-10, 11:13: Hi Mary, Wow I'm truly shocked about the difference in size between the school you went to and the one you go to now. I work in an elementary school and it has 2 floors, it is literally the size of a high school. Pretty crazy! This semester defintely seems like the more chill semester out of the two! I'm glad that enjoyed your classes last semester and made it through all that tricky math. I remember math 10 being quite a challenging class but rewarding once you get through it. I used to love biology as well, I found it the easiest science in comparison to chemistry and physics. I am planning on teaching social studies so you may have already guessed but it is my favourite subject. I like learning about different countries history and how it has shaped the present. If your school has a debate team, you should totally join - it'll be great practice for a future in law. You've got lots of great career options to explore as well :) IMPORTANT: As per your teacher's instructions, you get to choose two conversations of you choice that you would like to do! There are a bunch of options on the wheel. You can start by choosing one and I will open that up for you to get started on. Chat soon, Gurkirat Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:37: Hey Gurkirat, What do you do at your job? What grade do you teach, and do you like teaching them &amp; if you don’t, why not? Your right this semester is way easier, but I find it so boring it goes by so slow, because I’m not working through time like I was in my other classes. I’m not sure if there is a debate team in the school, I don’t think there is, but knowing this school there probably is. I can’t wait until summer, I miss swimming and the heat. I love the ocean so much, I can’t wait until I’m getting knocked over by the waves again and laying at beaches. But at the same time, I’m absolutely terrified of what’s in the ocean and what we don’t know what’s in the ocean. What’s your favorite season? For the 2 conversation pieces I chose Getting Hired and Career Exploration, but I feel we went through the second one already but I’m not to sure how the wheel works so ill put it again, lol. Talk to you soon, Mary Mentor 2023-02-13, 10:47: Hey Mary, I have two part-time jobs right now and am not a full time teacher yet. Both of my jobs are tutoring jobs and I work with K-12 students. At one job, I help students finish their homework, complete assignments, and make them quizzes to test their understanding on the material they are learning. For my other job I run an after school program for newcomers to Canada and English language learners. I love tutoring these students because there is so much I have gotten to learn from them. Of course, there are challenges as well as in any profession but it is so rewarding helping out these students in anyway that I can and hearing their funny stories and jokes too! I literally cannot wait for summer too! I love the sun, this February weather is just not it haha. So, my favourite season is definitely summer. I am going to open the conversation ""Getting Hired"" for you and if you decide not to do Career Exploration you can always change your mind and let me know! Talk soon, Gurkirat Mentor 2023-02-25, 17:16: Hi Mary, Hope you had a great long weekend! Just wanted to check in and see if you got my message and a chance to look through the Getting Hired conversation! Look forward to hearing from you, Gurkirat Mentor 2023-03-27, 11:03: Hi Mary, I hope you had a restful march break. Yup I'm off break too and back to working with the students today! As per your request, I have opened the conversation Post-Secondary and Career Planning. You have lots of different careers you are interested in exploring and I hope this conversation helps you explore them and see which ones are best suited for you. You may want to look into becoming a pilot or starting your own business by going to business school. Feel free to look into any other careers that interest you as well and see what education you would need for the careers. You can start with the warm-up prediction and Anchor Text 1. You'll get to share what you have learned from the Anchor Text with me and ask me some questions that come up as well! I'm excited to read what you have learned and your ideas/thoughts in general. Remember: Don't move onto Anchor Text 2 until we have discussed the first Anchor Text! Talk soon, Gurkirat Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:46: Post Secondary Planning My dream carrier and realistic carrier My dream carrier is to be a lawyer. I love debating and proving a point, it’s so fun. I feel like I’d be really good at it if I could get far. My realistic carrier would be being a teacher, I feel like you can really enjoy your job working as a teacher, you can make real connections with students, and you can secretly pick favorites, you have the summers off too witch in the long run is great because you can stay home with your kids. I feel like out of most of the carriers I’m interested in, I’d enjoy this one the most. 2. What education is needed For…? Lawyer You need to earn a bachelor’s degree, depending on what type of law I’d want to practice, I’d take classes relating to that area. You need to pass a Law School Admissions Test or a Graduate Record Examinations to be accepted for Law school. You have a higher chance of getting in with your LSAT than a GRE. Complete Law School and earn your JD degree. Earning your juris doctor degree is a common path to becoming an attorney, many law firms want to hire lawyers that have their JD degree. Earn a License to practice law by… Pass The bar exam. The bar exam is used to determine if someone has the knowledge and skills to become licensed and practice law. Meet the Character and mental fitness requirements in the bar exam. Take your oath of allegiance Become an attorney at law. When you pass your bar exam you become a member of the bar association and you’ll officially be an attorney at law Look for an office to work at Being a teacher Earn a bachelor’s degree in Secondary education Before taking the teaching certification exam you need a certain number of hours of classroom experience Get you teaching license 3. Reasons attending post-secondary is beneficial If you go to post-secondary when you’re supposed to you can keep your doors open even if you don’t follow your degree It’s a good opportunity to introduce you to the real world without your parents. The people you’ll meet and the memories you’ll make are worth it 4. Factors that might be challenging for each job Lawyer- 1- Each part of the prosses of becoming a lawyer takes a good amount of time and lots of studying 2- If I don’t Meet the character and mental fitness requirements in the bar exam, I would have a pretty big set back in my life plan 3- Finding the perfect office to finally start Teacher- 1- Choosing what subject I want to major in and teacher, most likely Math, and Science category 2- Most people say teachers don’t make that much money or teachers aren’t that successful so it’s scary following that path having the thought that it could go wrong is scary 3- I’d have to start training in like a kindergarten classroom and I feel like that experience might bring my thoughts on teaching down How do you feel about the education experience you’ll need? I feel like the wight of becoming a lawyer would be such a long and tiring experience but the job itself would definitely be worth it, the pay would be worth it I feel like I’d love the job because it’s just trying to prove a point and I love doing that. I feel like I wouldn’t have much of a social life at that time, I mean like going out and stuff, I feel like I’d have to be studying and working 24/7. I feel like I’d have more time to myself to be able to do more things. I feel like I’d have a more enjoyable time becoming a teacher than a lawyer, but I’d rather be a lawyer than a teacher. Conclusions Both carriers are achievable, I’s just need to commit to one. Questions Did length of schooling and experience needed factor in to their career decisions? How did you choose what university you wanted to go to? And did you ever regret your choice? Are they happy with their decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not? Mentee 2023-05-31, 10:44: Hey Gurkirat, todays the last day for mentoring and I gotta say I don’t know how I feel about that, I liked the mentoring project but I didn’t. It was weird, I feel like the program has some fla. I know I wasn’t good at responding or sending messages but I enjoyed talking to you and getting to know your carrier path. Mentor 2023-05-31, 11:20: Hey Mary, Thanks for all the work that you put into the mentoring project! It is totally fair and valid if you did not enjoy it that much haha. I enjoyed talking to you as well and wish you the best :) Have a wonderful rest of the school year and summer break! I'm still available until the end of the school year if you have any questions! -Gurkirat",,,"Mentor 2023-02-13, 10:51: Hey Mary, I have opened the conversation Getting Hired for you! At this point, you can work on the Warm Up and Anchor Text 1. Once you are done, we will have our discussion and I will give you the clear/go ahead to work on Anchor Text 2. In this first part, you will start thinking about and create a resume. I am here to support as much as possible as I know the process can be tricky. Let me know if you have any questions, if not feel free to get started! -Gurkirat Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:40: Hey Gurkirat, I'm back! We just got back from march break, and im assuming you and your students did too, i didn't really do much this break because i was grounded the whole time but the time off from school was nice. It turns out I wasn't sending emails to the right place, but my teacher helped me fix that. I'd like to change the conversation that's open, and change it too post-secondary and carrier planning or funding your future because i haven't seteled on an idea of what i want to do when im older. I really want to run my own bar or cafe, i feel like i'd love running my own company and being able to have my kids work there and eventally take over, but i also think getting a pilot license would be supper cool and it'd be sofun being able to fly and go up in the clouds. I could be like a sea plane pilot and i'd still be able to maintain good relationships and a home life, but i don't know what i want, it's just a cool idea i've been thinking about.",,
1047582331,9/15/2022 17:54,1047592251,58902,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-04-14, 08:32: Hi Lukas, I have opened up the conversation. Looking forward to hearing about what inspires you and some future goals you have for yourself. Don't worry about being very detailed if you don't know exactly what you want right now. It could be something like, I want a career that gets me outside, I want to own a truck that allows me to bike/camp/boat, etc. Bea Mentee 2023-04-14, 10:01: (Discussion Questions) Some things that I want in life include a stable, well paying job that preferably includes working with metal. I would also like to have good connections with my family through my whole life, especially my brother. I want to graduate highschool with a decent GPA and be the best academically that I can. I want a nice car that I can spend time working on and improving and really making ""mine."" Finally, I want to stay in contact with my friends through my whole life and watch them succeed and go through life like me. Where do you find inspiration to do what you do, such as pursuing your dream career or for like hobbies and such? What made you get on the life path you're on now? What keeps you motivated? I can never stay motivated on one thing for long and I always end up giving up and finding something else to work towards, for example I always tell myself to focus in class and get my work done but I just can't most of the time and i'll end up on my phone or just fiddling with my hands. What did you want to do in highschool and has that changed since you graduated? Mentor 2023-04-14, 10:19: Hi Lukas, Thanks for sharing those inspirations and goals with me! It's great to have really thought about what you want as that can help to motivate you when things are hard. You could consider simplifying those ideas down to a quick list or picture collage that you could put up in your workspace (or locker, or bedroom) that helps remind you why you are putting in this hard work now! I like to have some motivating words on a sticky note at my desk and pictures of my family and friends up. Those are great questions about inspiration and motivation. I got on the life path I am on now because I like to be active and outdoors. But when I was in high school I definitely didn't know how I could make that all work out for me. I believe I had to stay open to hearing about different career paths even once I got to university. It's hard when you haven't been exposed to all the types of careers in the world to know what will be best for you so you have to stay curious and open to new opportunities. Having trouble focusing is definitely a common problem. I have found two different ways to help myself with this: 1) giving myself a ""treat"" of some sort once I finish a task or assignment. For example, I tell myself that once I'm finished my final project for the semester then I can go for a big bike ride to unwind or get some ice cream. I think this works best for small tasks, rather than a project that might take multiple days. Try to break it up into manageable pieces that you can take a break between and do something you enjoy. 2) I found when I first got to university, it was really challenging to concentrate in lectures as the classes can be larger than in high school and the teacher doesn't care so much if you are actually paying attention or not. I would definitely scroll on my phone a lot or even fall asleep during classes sometimes! To counteract this, I found something simple to do with my hands that would leave my brain free to listen. For me this was knitting but I think it could take lots of forms such as doodling or maybe even playing with play-do. The idea is to preoccupy your hands but leave your mind free to listen. I know I got lots of wierd looks from my classmates at first but in the end I started paying attention so much better and remembering more information from classes that I didn't care what people thought. I hope those ideas help you! You can move onto part 2 if you don't have anymore questions. Bea Mentee 2023-04-19, 11:08: (Disscussion Questions 2) I would like to save money for a car. To achieve this, I'll put aside 50% of my income whenever I get a job. If I make sure to not touch that money, I think I can achieve my goal of buying a car in a timely manner. I also want to connect more with my younger brother. Spending time with him every day will likely help me build a stronger bond with him. I would like to spend at least a couple hours with him every day just hanging out and talking. Another goal of mine is to get the highest grades I can. Spending at least half an hour every day looking over my notes will most likely help with that. What goals did you have in highschool? Did you end up achieving them? If you did, what helped? If not, what do you think you could have done differently? -Lukas Mentor 2023-04-20, 09:55: Hi Lukas, Great goals and habits to achieve them! While you are able to stay at home and not pay rent right away is the ultimate time to save money, 50% seems realistic then. But that might not be a long term sustainable amount if you ever needed to start covering more of your own life costs. Hopefully, you can reach your goal before that! It's always a good idea to start looking at what kind of car and how much you are willing to spend so that you know how much to save. Make sure when you are thinking about goals and habits that you make them realistic. It is nice to say you will do something every day and it would make you a lot better but maybe it's actually more realistic that you will do it every second day or even twice a week. If you say you will do something every day and then don't achieve that, it can feel like you aren't making progress. So make sure it's something you can really committ to and have time for! In high school, I had goals about getting into university and getting good grades so I could get scholarships. With all the extracurricular activities I did at school and after school, I didn't find that I had time for a job that would help me save enough money for school so I chose to go down the scholarship and student loan route. That means my goals were about excelling in my chosen activities like rugby, student council and band so that would look good on a scholarship application (and it was also fun!). I also had the goal of keeping my options open for university as I wasn't always sure what I wanted to do, so I always filled up my class schedule and didn't leave any spares because I wanted to make sure I had as many courses to allow me to apply anywhere. Did you want to do any of the extension activities in this conversation? Or would you like to open up a new conversation? Bea Mentee 2023-04-24, 10:25: Would you please open the ""Finding your future"" conversation?",,,"Mentor 2023-04-24, 13:51: Hi Lukas, This conversation is now open so you can work through the warm up and anchor #1 parts.

When you are able to make it through all the parts of the getting started part above then you can let me know what conversation you would like to start with first and I can open it up! Bea PS. Feel free to read through my profile and let me know if you have any particular questions about engineering or starting post-secondary. I read your profile and see you may be interested in persuing trades or engineering. While I did engineering, both of my brothers did trades (heavy duty mechanic and electrician) so I have a little experience with both! Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:32: hi im lukas. i read your profile, rugby sounds fun! you also said it helped you transition to a big city, how hard was that for you? thats one of the things that sounds the most scary. Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:19: Hi Beatrice, Learning about post secondary and engineering would be awesome! I'm a little confused on how you transition from highschool to post-secondary, and how exactly I would pursue being an engineer, and what I need to know before I go that way (classes/courses etc.) If I end up changing course into trades, are the courses needed similar? Thanks for any help you can provide -Lukas Mentor 2023-02-13, 12:41: Hi Lukas, Most engineering schools in Canada start with an general first year of classes and then you would get to choose a specific type of engineering (civil, electrical, mechanical, etc.). I found that to be very helpful as there were many types of engineering that I had never heard of coming out of high school. I had actually never heard of geological engineering before and had thought I was going to choose civil engineering, but when I heard about geological engineering and how it was more outdoorsy and working with natural materials that peaked my interest more. Do you know if you are interested in going to a larger university? Or wanting to go to something smaller closer to home? Or do you want to leave the province and try something entirely new? If the idea of heading to a larger city makes you a bit nervous there is always the possibility of trying out a smaller university (such as Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo) and then transfering to a larger university after first year (such as University of Victoria or University of British Columbia). But on the flip side it could be nice to settle into one school where you will be for multiple years. Once you have an idea of where you would like to go we can explore entrance requirements. Most universities have similar class requirements so you won't have to know exactly what you want to do to plan out what high school classes you need to get there. As for trades, we can also explore the entrance requirements for a trades college but those tend to be a little less strict. I have also seen lots of people start off from high school with a trade and then later in life after a few years working in their trade going back to university. And that is great too, they wanted to be done with school more quickly (trade school is shorter than a full university degree) but then when they were older they decided they were ready for university then. There are many different paths to take! I believe the most important thing is taking high school classes that leave you with lots of options if you decide you want to go to university later in life, even if it's not what you choose now. Is there a particular conversation you would be interested in me opening up on this platform? Your teacher has informed us that you are required to complete two conversations for this class. Your options are (also listed above): Finding inspiration Different ways of knowing From rural to urban Strategic studying Well being and self care Dis- and misinformation Getting hired Agency in the world Confronting discrimination Career exploration Post-secondary and career planning Funding your future Lots of interesting topics to pick from! Bea Mentee 2023-02-14, 10:58: Hi Beatrice, I think maybe I would like to start small with a university closer to home and then transferring to a new school after a year or so. A conversation I'd like to open up is maybe getting hired? I haven't had a job yet and I do have a resume I just don't know how to go about getting a job. Mentee 2023-02-23, 10:09: My resume is saved on an account at home that I dont remember the password to, so I don't know if I can get into it on my school account. I haven't really looked at jobs very much so I don't really have an idea of a job to apply for.

Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:15: Well I did landscaping with my dad a lot last summer so something with landscaping would be nice. I'll work on the job interviews section",,,"Mentor 2023-02-14, 11:13: Hi Lukas, I have opened up the Getting Hired conversation so you will want to work through the first reading and then respond to the discussion questions! Bea Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:28: I have experience in teamwork, having a positive attitude and communication when working on schoo lprojects with a difficult student or someone who doesn't want to participate. I often am a leader in group projects. I learn quickly and pick up new skills fast. I have worked small odd landscaping contracts and am a hard worker. Mentor 2023-02-16, 13:13: Sounds like you have lots of good skills and examples to put on your resume. You said earlier that you have put together a resume already. Would you like me to take a look at it? Do you have a summer job that you are considering applying to or a part time job that you could see yourself having while are university? It's helpful to come up with a generic version of your resume but then tailor it for each job application. Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:04: My resume is saved on an account at home that I dont remember the password to, so I don't know if I can get into it on my school account. I haven't really looked at jobs very much so I don't really have an idea of a job to apply for. Mentor 2023-02-27, 14:13: Okay, well you can try to bring it to school on a USB stick or maybe email it to yourself so you can access it at school? Looking for jobs for this summer, you still have lots of time before you would need to start applying so this can also be something that we come back to later in this semester. But it's good to think about what types of jobs you would be interested in. Restuarant, city worker, landscaping, retail... those are all areas that may be interested in having someone work for the summer. If you don't want to work on you resume right now you can move on to the second part of this conversation about job interviews. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:07: I will move onto the second part of the conversation Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:26: The discussion questions instruct me to ask you about a memorable job inbterview. What made it memorable? How did it go? Can I learn anything from it? Mentor 2023-04-04, 09:03: Hi Lukas, Hope you had a good spring break! A memorable job interview I had was for a summer engineering job where they were looking for people to do material testing at construction sites for the summer, it would be going around to different sites and collecting concrete samples. Because I said I played rugby on my resume they assumed I was a very big person so when I showed up they asked me a lot if I thought I would be able to lift 50 lbs for collecting concrete. So this taught me two things: 1) It is good to make sure you fully understand what the job will entail. If it's not obvious in the job description, try to talk to anyone you may know who has had a similar job or come to the interview prepared with questions to ask the employer about the job. 2) I didn't like being profiled based on my activities (that I would be a really big person because I played rugby) and I wouldn't have taken the job if they had offered it to me because I didn't like the way they treated me. A job interview goes both ways, it's an opportunity for you to get to know the job as well. You can decide that you don't like the job or employer as well as the other way around. If you're happy with the ""Getting Hired"" conversation then we can move onto another one. Let me know which conversation you would like me to open up next. Cheers, Bea Mentee 2023-04-11, 10:11: I think I'm happy with the getting hired conversation, would you please open ""Finding Inspiration""",,

Take a look at the videos and exercises here and we can talk through the questions. Good luck!! Zoey Mentee 2023-04-04, 10:54: Hi Zoey, I found both the videos really interesting because they made me realize how much it is important to find a job that matches with your passions and interests in oreder to really enjoy yourself doing that. Reading some lists of values I think that the most importants to me are: authenticity, kindness, wealth, achievemnt, responsability, fitness... I've always thought about becoming a teacher, or something like a doctor, maybe in the sports area like a physiotherapist. I think that looking at them, these works actually fits with my values a little bit. Did your values help you choosing your career? Bye, Laura Mentor 2023-04-08, 12:02: Hi Laura, That's a great question! You have some great career options laid out and it is important to remember that you have lots of time to figure it out!! I was set on doing something in the healthcare field when I graduated high school, but I didn't exactly know what I wanted. Honestly, I think I changed my mind about 50 times before landing on pharmacy. I really had to do some self-reflection during my second year of University because this was the time that I would have had to start writing entrance exams for professional programs (ie. dental or medical school). After evaluating all of my options, I learned that I was really interested in learning more about medications and how they can change people's lives. My reasoning for choosing my career path truly stems from witnessing medications change people's lives for the better (ie. people with chronic conditions can get an enhanced quality of life because of their medications). A commonality that I am seeing between all of your career options is that all of those professions have a common goal of helping people. I know that can sound cheesy, but you seem very caring and want to choose a career that will help your community in some way or another. While this doesn't necessarily narrow down your options, I think it definitely puts you on the right track knowing that you want to work with your community rather than working a desk job. My biggest piece of advice is to not rush this decision. As you get older, your interests change so you do not need to make this decision at 17 years old. A career is something that you will hopefully do for the rest of your life so it is very important to consider your values and personal interests. It would be very hard to go to work everyday if you choose a profession that does not align with your values and interests. Mentee 2023-04-18, 10:34: Hi Zoey, sorry for being so late in responding. I totally agree with you, and I think that it's really important choosing a career that is interesting to me because it would be stressful, or at least hard, to do everyday something that I don't like. I find hard to choose the University I want to do, because I feel that by choosing that I'm deciding what my life will be. I've answered the questions in the second activity on a word document that I attach to this message. mentor qualcosa, quello che ti pare.docx I focused on the physical therapist career, but by looking at the survey the results where completely different. I don't really agree with them so I researched for another career path. What are some things that you wish you’d known about career choices while you were still in high school? This was a suggested question and I think is really interesting. I want to ask you if you have discovered something about the carreer you've chosen after you have started that. Mentor 2023-04-25, 10:54: Hi Laura! Choosing a University can feel overwhelming at first but I think it certainly helps to choose your program first and then choose the school based on how it can accommodate your program of choice. There is also a financial aspect, some Universities are more expensive to attend than others. I would definitely factor that into your decision! I personally chose to attend a local college in my hometown for my first three years of post-secondary before transferring to a bigger University in an attempt to save money and have more financial freedom by the time I graduate. As for your question, I wish I knew more about what the day to day life of my chosen professions looked like. Shadowing in a physio office would be a great opportunity for you to learn more about it and see if it is something that would interest you. Researching a profession gives you an idea of what they do but actually experiencing it is very different. I did shadowing in a pharmacy while in post-secondary and I think that is when I really decided that it was something that I wanted to do. If you have the chance to shadow, I would definitely recommend it! Zoey Mentee 2023-04-28, 10:17: Hi Zoey, my school organizes internships by contacting different agencies and companies. When I go back to Italy next year, I hope to have the opportunity to have that kind of experience because, like you said, it would help me see if it's something I'm really interested in. It would definitely be helpful to be able to have that experience in an environment where I can experience various areas of medicine to see which one might interest me the most. I've already looked at several compnies that might give me that chance, but nothing is certain yet. Laura Mentor 2023-05-02, 08:49: Hi Laura, Sorry for the delay, I have been crazy busy with moving!! That is awesome! I'm glad to hear you're taking the initiative to get out there and experience your career of choice! I will start the wrap up module, but as always, feel free to reach out with any additional questions that you may have! Zoey","Mentor 2023-02-28, 23:23: Hey Laura, Please take a look at this module and let me know what questions you have!! Mentee 2023-03-06, 11:18: Hi Zoey, how are you? The video was very interesting and I think they are useful strategies to use to study in an effective way. I usually don't use all of them because I don't have enough time to do that. It happens that in one afternoon I have to study more than one subject and it takes me more than few hours. Anyway, there are some of these strategies that I really find useful like draw and write key words while I'm repeating something, because I have a really strong visual memory. When I'm writing a test or I'm talking during an oral test I usually try to visualize the picture of the piece of paper with all the key word to organize my speach. I can even visualize the page of the book and see few words that help me remember thinks. The thing I think I should improve is the organisation. It happens to me to arrive the day before the test with still a lot of things to study. I should organize better my week in order to better spread the hours of studing. Is it difficult for you to organize your time and follow your plan? Thank you, Laura Mentee 2023-03-06, 11:20: I also want to tell you that tomorrow I won't be able to do the videocall with you, I'm sorry:( Mentor 2023-03-08, 10:20: Hi Laura! I'm doing good, how are you? That is totally fine about the video call! It sounds like you have some pretty good studying strategies already in place, the big thing is just being able to stick to it! (I know this is much easier said than done). Different strategies work for everybody, and it also depends on what kind of courses you are studying. My program requires a lot of memorization, so I've found that same-day review is very beneficial (ie. reviewing a lecture the same day that it is taught to you). That method is very effective, but not always attainable because we get busy!! What I've found works for me is using whiteboards and also reading the content out loud/having a classmate read it back to me. I find that it is easier to compartmentalize your classes when in post-secondary because, unlike high school, we only have lectures for a specific class about twice a week. This way I can dedicate specific days to each class and find myself less overwhelmed than I felt in high school. I won't lie, I often find myself in the scenario that you just mentioned of being very behind a few days leading up to an exam, but I really try my best to stay on top of my work so I can avoid feeling overwhelmed!! Do you have any specific questions about post-secondary?? Zoey Mentee 2023-03-09, 11:08: Hi, I'm good thanks. I fell like it would be useful to review on the same day and sometimes I did it, usually on the days I didn't have that much to do. I think it will be easier in university because you have more time to organize things to study. Or at least I think so. I'll probably have to change my way of study related to the amount of things I have actually to know. Did you change something in your way of study? Do you find useful to rewrite the notes? or you think it's better to take notes on my comuter? I don't really know what to expect by unversity so I don't really know what to ask:) thank you, Laura","Mentor 2023-02-12, 13:00: Hi! I figured we could start with the funding your future module. Please take a look through the articles and ask any questions that you may have! Finances can play a very big role in education (especially in BC, I'm not 100% sure how this compares to Italy). Once you've taken a look, I'll be happy to work through the module with you! Cheers, Zoey Mentee 2023-02-13, 11:30: International Education Scholarships &amp; Awards Hi Zoey, I made some research about the Text 1, but even if I have read many sites I've been able to find just this scholarship that I think can fit my situation. International Education Scholarship: opportunities are available for partial funding for B.C. student groups or teachers who are going abroad on short-term exchange (e.g., 1 to 2 weeks), or for B.C. students studying Chinese language and culture in Grade 12. Opportunities are also available for international students who are entering Grades 9, 10 or 11 at a B.C. school district or independent school, or graduating from Grade 12 at a B.C. school and going to a B.C. post-secondary institution. For now, I think I'll get a job when I'll start university in order to help my parents paying for my education, and I hope to actually get a scholarship after high school. I already got a scholarship at the end of middle school because of my grades, so I hope I'll reach the same grades at the end of high school too. Do you know if there are other ways to get a scholarship other than on a grade base? Mentor 2023-02-14, 14:36: Hi! Since you mentioned that you will be going to school back in Italy, I'm not 100% sure how the system differs but I can share what I received. In grade 12, my high school gave all of the students a long list of scholarships which we were eligible to apply for. Most of which required writing an essay or answering questions about yourself. All of this can be broken down into scholarships (which are majorly grade-based) or bursaries (based on financial need, grades are not considered). I remember applying for both, in fact, I applied for everything that I could find when I was in grade 12 because you never know what you might receive! I remember just based on grades, I received a BC government scholarship, as well as an entrance scholarship to my chosen University so it is important to *try* to keep those grades up (it will really benefit you with the scholarships). I personally applied for a lot of essay based scholarships and ended up receiving quite a few of those. Scholarships are essentially ""free money"" so I would HIGHLY recommend applying for as many as you can! I guess in summary, try asking your school for a list of eligible scholarships/bursaries that you can apply for. You can also try going online at ScholarshipsCanada to see if anything jumps out to you. I would definitely recommend working, I personally worked 3 jobs during my undergrad because I know how expensive school can be.. It also helped me learn very valuable time management skills, so that's just a bonus of working while you're in school! Zoey Mentee 2023-02-23, 17:43: Hi, after watching the video in the second part of this activity I realize that the most of all the expenses I will have to pay will be more or less unavoidable (school and rent). So I filled out the form on expenses and earnings by doing some research in Italy and converting to Canadian dollars. I looked for the cheapest apartment, but still I realized that the expense would be too much and to reduce it I could always choose a university in Milan, where there are plenty of them, so that I could stay at home. For some things I could not estimate so the final bill in reality would probably be different. I will definitely have to find a job to try to be, although always supported you have my parents, financially independent for everything else. I also found out there are several piai for a student-worker, which would help me to be able to do both to the best of my ability. How did you manage to find the best balance between school and work? Thank you for the advice, Laura Mentee 2023-02-23, 21:40: 4299_Budgeting_Activity (1).docx this is the link for the worksheet I did.","Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:40: Hi Zoey, how are you? I am very happy that you are my mentor becuause you seem a really nice person, it seems to me that we have so much in common and I can't wait to start! I'm an exchange student from Italy and I'm spnding my year abroad here in BC. I want to go back to Italy for attending university, or at least back in Europe I think. I'm really intresting in maths and science, but also in medicine.I'm not sure which university I want to attend and I hope this will help me have a clearer idea about that. My teacher told me I have to choose two conversation modules and if I can, I would choose: - Funding your future - Strategic studying thank you in advance, Laura Ghezzi :) Mentor 2023-02-12, 12:56: Hi Laura! I'm excited to get started!! It's so cool that you're here on exchange, how are you liking Canada so far? I'm glad you took the time to pick out your modules, I will open the first one right away. I can definitely answer any questions that you may have about doing an undergrad in the sciences and/or healthcare field!! Please ask away if you have any. I'm not super familiar with the European education system but I can definitely do my best to work through the course with you! Mentor 2023-02-28, 23:16: Hi Laura! Sorry for taking so long to respond, I have been studying for midterms!! Great job on your budgeting sheet, I'm sure you can see that every expense can add up when you're responsible for paying for buying everything, you really start prioritizing purchases more. As you can see, rent is a large factor when choosing a University. I personally chose a University at home for my first few years to be able to reduce costs. I now go to an out-of-town University, but I am very glad I chose to stay home for a while because it helped me gain more financial independence now that I am on my own. Therefore, if you enjoy living at home and finding a University there is feasible for you, I have nothing but good things to say about doing that!! As for balancing my time, I used my breaks effectively! In University you will often have long breaks between your classes. The big mistake that I made in first year was not using this time efficiently. Once I realized that I could use that time to finish my assignments/study for classes, it became a lot easier to find the time to pick up shifts at night time/in the evening! I'm glad you spent the time to think through this budget sheet and hopefully, it helped you think more about your future. If you're happy with the progress you have made, I will happily open the next module :) Zoey Mentor 2023-03-12, 22:08: Hi! I personally didn't develop study methods during high school so it was a steep learning curve once I started post-secondary. With that said, you kind of have to figure out what works for you. For myself, I like to type my notes, but I know that a lot of people find that physically writing things down helps them retain information. Both methods are great, just depends on the person!! I think you've done some good work here. Please let me know if you have any other questions! I am happy to open another module for you if you're interested in any of them or I can begin the wrap-up, just let me know!! I am super happy to answer any questions you have about post-secondary, it doesn't have to relate to this module specifically. Zoey Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:49: Hi Zoey, we just came back from spring break. I hope you are doing well. I'm trying to use different study's methods this year because I have to study for my italian school, but I am free to organize my time as I want, so I'm trying to figure out if there are some methods that are more useful for me. I think it would be interenting to go through the career exploration module, but they all seems okay so whatever module you want to do will be fine :). Laura Mentor 2023-03-29, 14:12: Sounds good!

Glad to here back from you, have a good day! Mentor 2023-02-13, 17:21: Hi Kiana, Thats a really good question, I wish I had a very straight forward answer for you but the truth is sadly I don't, you don't really learn everything about yourself in some randon point in time in my experince, the best way I can describe it to you is this: knowing yourself comes in phases, like seasons buts for your life, you discover what you like and what you don't like in whatever phase you are in life, and those things eventually change over time like for example, when I was in highschool there was a time period where I felt an extreme need to find my life long group of friends, where that desire came from I honeslty can't tell you but I learned that I valued community and close relationships, I also learned that I neeeded to learn patience because things like that do not happen over night- but now where I am in life I realize I can be completely alone and still feel content, and that may change again. Really its just about observing what situation you are in currently and evaluating if you feel okay in it and if you don't thats okay things take time. Sorry if this is not a very satisfying answer I know that usually these questions are asked because you want one definitive answer but usually its not the case. Let me know if you have anymore questions! Mentee 2023-02-16, 11:16: Hey Kyla, thank you for your response I know that there is not a straight forward answer but I appreciate your message.

Mentor 2023-04-24, 15:39: Hi Kiana, Funny you should ask that as I am actually struggling with self care lately as well, its been quite because of exams and therefore I have alot of stressors on my plate but heres what has help me so far, 1. sceduling time out of my days to take breaks for myself, this can look different for everyone, for me its taking walks, talking with friends or even cooking my own meal, remember it doesnt have to be fancy (the thing that your doing that makes you feel relax) it should be something you enjoy so you can recharge. 2. I know your said you're feeling lost and the best thing I can say to that is to normalize the feeling and know that it is okay to feel it, and that eventually it will go away, theres no active button you can press to make that feeling go away right away, and avoiding the feeling can make it worse, just remind yourself that you are gonna be okay or that this feeling will pass. 3. Talk kindly with yourself, alot of times when we feel poorly about something or things don't go as plan, we may beat yourself up for it,,realizing you are having a hard time and being kind to yourself for it does wonders. hope that helps. Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:17: Hey Kyla thank you for the tips on self care. I will try them out and have already started some on my own. It's nice to know others sometimes feel the same as I do and that makes me feel less alone during this hard time. I will try to stop beating myself up about everything, which i find myself doing a lot. Mentor 2023-05-02, 10:29: Hi Kiana! Glad to hear back from you, but yes you are not alone, usually when we face a challenging stage in our lives we think we are the only ones facing it but I have found that it id usually not the case. Let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to answer them. Mentor 2023-05-12, 00:03: Hi Kiana, Sorry for the late response life has been very hectic lately. In terms of self care falling on your priority list know that that is completely okay and to not beat yourself over it. Something situations and experinces present themselves unexpectedly and we just do not know how to deal with it. I have something that may be of use to you, its a saying that goes sometimes in life I might not put myself first because certain events that occur that just seem outside my control but I always remember myself. If you view self care in this way you don't put to much pressure to always stick to some type of rigity that ristricts you from the main purpose of self care which is to really just making time for yourself and if you are someone you find important, rather that time be a moment or a couple of hours or days theres no restriction. Remember you are a human that deserves to feel okay, safe and comfortable in the body and space you have so remember to remember yourself. Let me know if this helps or if you need some more tips.",,,,,

My bad habit is prioritizing my extra curricular activitys like Basketball.",,,"Mentor 2023-05-12, 07:53: I've opened up this conversation :) Let me know if you've looked at the BC careers website and the courses UBC offers. Mentee 2023-05-12, 10:05: after High school I want to head up to UBC and take a Physcology class and get a degree in Forensic Physcology and either become a Forensic physcologist or a lawyer, i havnt decieded yet but i do know i want to continue in physcology studies. My friends want to take a gap year but I strongly disagreee Mentor 2023-05-12, 13:06: Like I said, you cannot get a bachelors degree in forensic psychology. You can only obtain a bachelor of science with a major in psychology or a bachelor of arts with a major in psychology. Both of these are four year full-time programs in which you would need to take ten classes per year. To become a licensed forensic psychologist, you must earn a doctorate. This can take 7-10 years. However, you can study forensic psychology at the master's level and work in another field. Again to be a lawyer you need a four year bachelors in anything, your major does not matter. Most master programs require 2 years of study and PhD programs usually require between 5-7 years of study. To become a forensic psychologist you need a Doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology (PhD/PsyD) with minimum 2 years' experience in a forensic mental health context. There is a blocked registration for almost all courses related to forensics at the bachelors level. I found three types of courses. The first type of course code: Blocked registration for the introduction to forensic science course taken in the Joint BCIT/UBC Degree in Biochemistry and Forensic Science. Registration is limited to students in the Joint Degree Program. You cannot take this course code at any level. The second course is restricted to UBC's Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLSc) The following course is likely the ONLY course you can take related to anything forensics during your bachelors degree: ARCL 228 001 (Lecture) Forensic Anthropology The application of methods from biological anthropology and archaeology to the identification, recovery, and analysis of skeletal remains from crime scenes, mass disasters, and unexplained deaths. I'm not sure you've really done the research I suggested. It will be very beneficial to you. Please take a look at the links in depth. Mentor 2023-05-27, 19:55: Hi Jaidin, No worries and to answer your questions, most classes are 3 credits and you need 120 credits to graduate so 30 credits per year in order to graduate in four years. That means you need to take 10 classes each year. What do you mean ""how to get to it?"" The first year is 100 level courses, sometimes you need to take that as a prereq to take a higher level course. Courses in upper levels can have pre reqs or be restricted to certain students in certain majors or departments but otherwise a lot of them are open. I think that it's a good idea to spend your first year taking whatever courses interest you. That's what I did. UBC only considers your first choice so if you apply and put first choice arts and get in, they won't give u the option of science too if that was your second choice. But if you choose science as your first choice and don't get in, they may still offer you arts if that was your second choice. For science, I think the paths are like health and safety, doctor, teacher, researcher. For law school, science wouldn't look better. What looks best for law school is good grades so you could also just spend your time choosing the easiest major and the easiest possible courses by checking rate my prof for each course first. You have some options for sure. I'm going to Paris tomorrowwwww, very excited for that.","Mentee 2023-03-30, 11:01: I stay motivated because of my basketball, having to keep my grades up to play sports is what keeps me motivated, what kept you motivated? by this time next month i want to play in a tournemnent in Ukee with some of the girls on my team. Mentor 2023-04-03, 01:46: Being able to play sports is a good motivation. I think that also you can think about how doing your best at school is one way you can keep as many doors open as possible (not limiting your opportunities.) Good luck, I hope you make it into your tournament! If you're asking what kept me motivated in highschool, I would say that getting good enough grades to get into university was a bit of a motivator for me, and the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship motivated me too (money for maintaining a certain GPA throughout high school.) My mom always told me I should get good grades, that kind of motivated me too. I didn't try as hard as I could with high school but still tried a lot. Even now I could be trying harder, I could be reviewing lecture notes after every class, studying ever day but I don't always do that. Unrelated general advice, when you get to university, you should keep a separate word document for everything you learn that you think will be useful to remember later in life. I can think of one thing from my adulthood and aging class this semester: there are these little pill bottles that have timers that only unlock at certain times or they can connect to an app on your phone so that you can't take them more than once a day by accident. This can help old people if they're forgetful or if they have some sort of cognitive decline. This may be useful for me to know in the future if I want to make sure my mom stays healthy. New things excite me, I think that's what gets me out of bed the quickest. Whether it's the excitement of starting a new job or school, I am more likely to spend extra time getting ready in the morning. As time passes, it seems I find it harder to get up and spend less and less time getting ready. I'm passionate about painting although I don't make time for it now and I wish I did. In the Summer I'll be able to! I also set a realistic goal about working out (5 exercises a day, each 4 sets of 10.) I think that's the kind of thing the second video was talking about. I find a lot of inspiration from assignments from researching online, a lot of different types of searches I can talk more about if you'd like. Motivation to complete the assignments comes from reminding myself what kind of life I want to live (a pretty expensive one with a comfortable home and frequent vacations.) Although that being said I like to think I wouldn't waste money on a bunch of designer things. You could just be using that money to help other people instead. Motivation is such a challenging thing because it's a feeling. Self-discipline is the real test of success. How's school going for you? Do you have a lot of friends? Any classes particularly challenging? Also, if you would like to video call and ask me any questions/meet face to face since I missed the meet your mentor event, I am free in May to do that, just let me know which day is best for you (before May 7th.) I emailed the people and they said they'd be the ones facilitating it.",,"Mentor 2023-02-27, 21:33: Hi Jaidin, That's great, serving is a good job, especially when tips are good. I've opened up the strategic studying conversation. Mentee 2023-02-28, 10:43: Im so tired my coach has been running us and im so out of shape, i just wanna sleep but i have a test today in math :( im not bad at math but im not good at tests it was never a strength for me, i think im getting sick but i cant get sick because if i miss school then ill fall behind and its next to impossible to catch up. thank you for opening up a conversation thing Mentor 2023-02-28, 12:02: Awe sorry to hear that. I know whtat it's like to have to go to school while tired. It was a struggle for me to get out of bed today. Luckily this semester all my classes start at 11am. I ended up waking up at 9:45, snoozing my alarm multiple times then getting out of bed at 10:35, brushed my teeth, hair, washed my face and left my house at 10:48 and jogging a bit/speed walking to class. I'm glad I live on campus so I don't have to waste time commuting and can sleep in more. I just packed a protein bar and a fruit snack to eat in class. It's important to eat breakfast, and the types of food you eat are important too. Check out https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/. It's interesting that the old food guide was made to serve the food industry. This new food guide says half your plate should be fruits and vegetables. Food can impact your mood. Many studies have found a link between diets high in sugar and depression. Let me know if you want to know more about food, I took a class on health psychology and learned a few interesting things. I'm not naturally good at math either. To be honest, I barely passed grade twelve pre-calculus. I can tell you why that was though. I skipped a lot of classes. Our teacher had surgery so we got a sub who was very difficult to understand. The class was already harder for me to udnerstand because it was in French and I hadn't become fluent yet, but because of his thick accent I decided it wasn't worth my time to go. I also didn't do most of the homework. I think one time I received a grade of 0/8. However, in grade 10, I did very well. I completed all the homework or almost all the homework. I asked my teacher questions often. Very often. In fact one time, she told me during student hours, ""Kineena, you can't just ask me for every question."" Yes, I was asking her a question about many of the homework questions, but I was also the only student during student hours at the time, and it was helping me learn. She was just playing solitare, maybe she said that because she didn't want to do too much work. When I received tests back, they were often 100%. I finished the class with a high grade. Later though, what she said stuck with me and I started asking less questions to teachers. So in summary, if you want to do well in math, do practice questions! There is no better way to study for math. Complete all your homework! Ask questions whenever you are unsure about something! It's their job to help you. Now, I study using quizlet. I copy and paste the powerpoint slides onto quizlets and then I quiz myself. Whatever I don't know I mark for later to quiz myself again and again until I know it. Making them on your computer and then using the mobile app works really well. My highschool grades were a mix between very good and average (except for grade 12 math, although I was still able to get a highschool scholarship from AB and you should also ask your guidance counsellor about scholarships offered by the province of BC.) When I started my first year at UofC, I did well in chemistry. Now at UBC, my grades are well above average. I've received a lot of scholarships. I finished one class with 100%. I took six classes last semester, (most people take four or five) and I got straight As. I got an award for being in the top 10% of undergraduate First Nations, Inuit, or Metis students of Canada at UBC Vancouver. Let me know if you want to talk more about what I do to learn in class and to study. It's not necessarily about being smarter, it's about having the right study habits/strategies. Mentor 2023-03-06, 11:09: Sounds like you're putting in a lot of hard work training for basketball! For studying, making quizlets or flashcards or some other way to test yourself is really the best way to study instead of just reading your notes a few times. Active studying is the best kind of studying. You know how when you take a test you have to get 100% on that you are allowed multiple attempts? You are able to get it because you remember making the wrong answer in the past and now know all the answers you need. Testing yourself before a test can work the same way. If you get learning objectives, try to write down as much as you know about them after your done studying without looking at your notes, then fill in what you forgot after.",,"Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:41: Hey Kineena My name is Jaidin and im currently in grade 10 going to ADSS, my pronouns are she/her. I live in a small town that kinda sucks, theres next to nothing to do so i play basketball. i currently play for both Sr and Jr girl ball but ive slowiy been detaching from the Sr girls because our time tables match almost perfectly so i cant play for both, but i play for an all native team called Tseashaht Pride we play in a huge tournament in March, kinda nervous but mostly excited. Before my tourny i have a provincial team tryout with my friend and when we make the team were going to Halifax Nova Scotia in the summer. After my tourny my basketball season is pretty much over tell september, so i plan on getting a job to fill my free time, im getting my first aid and food safe so hopfully that will help. I dont do much outside of my basketball, i tried hockey but it just wasnt for me, i did kickboxing i liked that a lot but basketball got in the way. i used to paint and draw a lot but now ive stopped because i dont have a lot of time outside of basketball and school life. i want to go to UBC and live with 1-2 friends to help financually and so i dont go crazy, i want to become a child and youth care lawyer or a real estate agent. ive ran out of time and sorry for all the spelling mistakes :) Jaidin Mentor 2023-02-12, 11:03: Hi Jaidin! Nice to meet you :) I also like playing basketball, I just played today. There's intramural teams at UBC you can sign up for, mine has games every Saturday. I'm not that good haha especially not at dribbling, but it's fun! I think it's impressive that you are on the junior and senior team at the same time while in grade 10! Good luck on your tournament in March! First aid and food safe are very useful to have and provide good information. It taught me about how to defrotst meat properly and how long you can leave certain foods at room temperature. Maybe you could coach basketball in the Summer if you like working with kids. Working for a city/town owned facility I believe pays more than other recreation facilities, I would try applying there if that's an option. It's a good idea to have roommates, just be careful about who you choose to live with! Sometimes it's not the best for friendships, but sometimes it is, it depends. Me and my roommates didn't know each other before living together. We have a cleaning schedule that works pretty well. We all do one chore a week and everyone has to finish their chore by Sunday. It helps to keep the place clean. One of my roomates just prints a chore list and then we all put a checkmark beside our task when it's done. I think both of your career planning choices are great! Mentee 2023-02-13, 10:48: this weekend we came secound in our tounement and i got to take home the plack, this weekend were going to Victoria for islands and im super excited becuase we get to skip thursday and stay in a nice hotel. after this weekend my school basketball is pretty much over and im thinking of getting a job, either at a local grocrary store or at a close by resterant, i want to finish my foodsafe before i send out reseme's. i have set on UBC for a while and i dont know if it would be eaisier to live in an apartment in the city closer to jobs and local food stores or get a dorm on campus so my school life would be eaisier to manage and i would learn more about the campus of the collage, if i live with someone its problibly going to be with my best friend because of how orginized she is and we both level eachother out most of the time. i am leaning more towards a collage dorm for school and after collage ill find somwhere else to live, and ill figure out food and other living conditions another time. for collage i want to play basketball and take class's for either Law or Real estate, i might take automotive classes too. i am still choosing but i think its nice to have options. Mentor 2023-02-13, 11:39: Victoria sounds fun! I've never been. Congrats on your tournament! I think it would be easier to get a dorm on campus. You save a lot of time not having to commute. There's a new grocery store called the food hub on campus, it's not only the chepest place for food on campus but probably most of Vancouver as well. It's really small but still has a lot. I think you should apply for both jobs, but a restaurant would pay more because of tips. If you memorize the menu in advance, they'll really like that. For real estate, you don't need to go to university, you can if you want though and it would probably be better for you because it would likely be funded, but they also offer licences outside of university. For law, it doesn't matter what undergraduate degree you have, just try to get the best grades you can and then you apply to law school usually after third year and that's also the year you take the LSAT. I'm going to take my LSAT in August and start studying soon. I'm gonna study all Summer. I'm studying Psychology and French Literature right now because PSYC interests me and French is useful/I like the language. Check out this page: https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea I looked at every single thing on this list and every single course under each item. It took me a very long time, multiple days, many hours. Worth it though, if you read all the course descriptions you can get a little sense of what you would be interested in. Take notes of some courses you like for later :) Mentee 2023-02-21, 10:40: thank you for the link thats very helpful and i spent all day looking through it, i got busy with school and basketball, we came sixth, lost to the victoria teams but beat everyone else, it was a good weekend and now my full focus is on NAIG and my Jr All Native Tournemnet coming up!! The girls are talking about creating an all native womens team with all the aged out girls and some of the younger girls so thats exciting, i was hoping that you could open up Post-secoundary &amp; career planning for us, i dont know much about it but it sounds interesting, i have a lot of free time now that school ball is over :( Mentor 2023-02-21, 14:59:  Mentee 2023-02-21, 15:29: Hello Jaidin, Just wanted to give you a heads up that your mentor, Kineena, asked us to send you this message. She tried to reach out but ran into some technical difficulties. So, I am delivering the message on her behalf: ______________________________ Exciting to hear about a new team being made! What do you mean, ""for us?"" For jobs, check out this link: https://www.careertrekbc.ca/episodes#tab=view-list&amp;sort=alphabetical It has a list of jobs, videos about a day in the life, and average salary information. I'm from AB and they have a similar website I've looked at, so I haven't specifically looked at this one. I'm pursuing the law path because I like the average salary I found. Just find whatever is most important to you, whether that's travelling, helping people or living comfortably. Remember, there's some things no one's going to do for you and you have to do for yourself. Career research is probably one of them. My sixth grade teacher told me something that stuck with me, he said, ""successful people do the things others don't want to do."" Career researching now is a really good idea, you should write down a list of potential careers that interest you. Try to look at all 165 careers on the website. Just keep working hard, and you're already ahead of other people that say, ""ah I still have time to figure it out later,"" if you're doing university and career research now! You're doing great :) Maybe talk to someone as well (like a guidance counselor or something) about scholarships you can get straight out of highschool. I got the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship when I graduated, and that extra two thousand five hundred dollars from getting good grades was pretty nice. If you can't find anyone at your school to help you, let me know, I'll see what I can do to look into it, but I'm not as familiar with it because I didn't grow up in BC. Applying to scholarships can take a lot of time but it's worth it!!! Especially if you make that much money from only a day's worth of work. A lot of people don't put in that extra effort to apply. Mentee 2023-02-23, 10:35: thank you for the websites theyve really helped, my mom is over the moon i have someone to help me with this lmao. i thought i had a lot of free time until my other coach said were running at the track Tuesdays and Thursdays so now i have sunday to thurdsay booked with basketball, im not complaining but i am because i suck at just running, i can run for hours in a basketball game or practice but just running at a track my stamina just poof disapears. JANT is in 24 days and inbetween that time i have NAIG tryouts and im going to Las Vages for an Adele consert, its going to be choas but im super excited for it all, im just not sure how im going to have any money after this because i dont have any now and i dont want to apply for a job right now because i know that it would be unprofessenal to get a job and take 2 weeks off right after. i get paid by my band every month but its only 60 bucks and i might save that from this month for Vages but then i need the money for snacks and food, i could ask my family for money but that would be a bit much considering im already going to vages and i have no idea where NAIG tryouts are so if its in Langly again i would have to get a hotel and theres gas money and food for everyone else. Mentor 2023-02-23, 12:01: I'm glad I could help. Sorry to hear you're having money troubles at the moment, but I'm excited for you and all the things you have coming up! I have another link for you and a challenge. I know it's a kids website, but this is how I learned to type. I'm not sure if you're a slow or fast typer, but it's good to practice good typing habits now. You'll be doing a lot of typing if you continue your education. https://www.dancemattypingguide.com/dance-mat-typing-level-1/stage-1/ (Try to complete all the levels) Or maybe you're a really fast typer already and you don't need the levels, in which case, try to beat me on this website. https://play.typeracer.com/ (I just did one go just now, my score was 86 words per minute.) Being able to type fast is a really good skill to have not only in school but in life in general. Saves you time and your time is valuable. Plus it gives you an academic advantage if you're faster at typing. Let me know if you beat my score. Also...something coming up in my life is that I got approved to go on two exchanges this year, one in France for three weeks and one in Hawaii for four months. It's a good idea to go on exchange if you don't know where you want to settle down yet. (I don't yet.) Maybe bookmark all these tabs that I'm sending you or save them in a document somewhere so you have them somewhere accessible :) Mentee 2023-02-24, 10:03: Thank you for the links ive pretty much saved all the links you've sent me so far. Hawaii sounds like so much fun i hate being cold i would much rather it be warm out, the weather here is weird it can be sunny out but -6 outside, once i was outside for PE and it was warm for a little bit then it started pouring rain, me and a few other kids took off our hoodies so we scrambled to get our hoodies on because it was freezing. If I make my NAIG team I will go to Haliifax Nova Scotia, I havnt been on a plane before and the ferthest I've been was Seattle to see my uncle and we drove there. France sounds like fun too, i took french 8 just to take a feel for it but it was'nt for me, i took an interest in Physcology and Metal work im good at math, but i want to improve my English and Social studies skills, lucky for me i took advantage of my grade 8/9 year and tried a lot of diffrent electives, I learned that I dont want to become a cook or an actor simply because I'm not good at it, I think I choose not to be good at it because it doesnt interest me. I was introduced to typing in grade 6/7 and i know the basics I just need to improve on making my I's uppercase and ending my sentences with a peiriod. Mentor 2023-02-26, 20:02: Travelling is good to figure out where you want to live in the future. Where I grew up in Alberta the weather was all over the place too. It was really cold there though, much colder than BC, all the way up to minus 45. It's good you're figuring out what interests you and what doesn't. That typing website that I sent you is just really helpful for muscle memory typing, being able to type while your eyes are not on the keyboard good skill to have. That way you can be watching a presentation in school from your professor or watch a video or anythign like that and take notes at the same time. That website just helps with making that easier. For example, you're supposed to type the ""c"" with your left middle finger not your pointer finger. There are certain fingers associated with each key that make it way easier and faster to type and you can learn them and change your habits if you want. Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:08: Hey I l was woundering if you could open up one of the conversations, I'm not one hundred percent sure if thats what its called but I've been told to ask. I asked my friend how her jobs going and she said she could help me get the job shes working at, its a serving job meaning i will get tips and paid per hour, i told her i would love to but after spring break because of my chaotic schedual this spring break. So by the time that happend I should have my food safe and a job a couple blocks away from my house. Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:43: That's so cool how you were able to manage your work and how your class's start later in the moring. Today I woke up at 7:35 ish then double checked if I had everything for today, I needed my Binder, Texbook, Basketball Shoes and Shorts and I have to hand in my jerseys from this year. :( after i had everything it was quarter to 8 so i got a ride from my Grandma, she dropped me off a few blocks away from school because its hard to get in and out of the high-school traffic, so i walk a few extra blocks every day. On my way to school today I grabbed an energy drink for my morning. My coach is pushing us to the limit, were running like theres no tomorrow and my legs are dying, we ru 20 laps do 2 sets of 3 sprints, first set we face the wall jump for 30 sec, baskwards run to the free throw forwards to the wall backwards to center line running on the spot for 30 sec forward to the wall full sprint to the other end of the gym and back, 15 secound rest then we do it again. Secound set we do 10 burpees forward to free throw line backwards back, forward to center line 30 jumping jacks run to the other end of the gym full sprint there and back. Then after our running we shoot 50 free throws, I avrage 25-30 but I still need to work on making a routine for muscle memorie. after we either do a 3v3 or do other exersices. For school I study the easiy things days before so that im confident i know it, and for the harder things i go to my teacher at lunch or before school the day of the test to try get a better understanding of the harder things, if I still don't understand i will look over my notes and see if breaking it down makes it easier . If I understrand parts of a hard equasion I call that a win because its better than not knowing anything. Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:15: Hey, I hope you had a great spring break! sorry for the late reply We came 3rd in our tournement, it helped with our team bonding and I cried a lot our last game, i wish we went to the Finals and came 1st or 2nd but it is what is. Now were back into school routines and now my goal is to join a club ball team and I want to get a job. Mentee 2023-03-28, 11:28: hey again, sorry to double text but i was looking at the ubc website for dorm rooms and i seen a meal plan i was woundering if you would suggest getting it or not. I was weighing it out in my head. Mentor 2023-03-28, 21:52: Hey my break was for a week in February, and it was good I just visited my mom in Kelowna. There's a lot of pressure in sports and you have to devote a lot of time into it, but if you love it, I'm sure you can go far with it! I met someone on the UBC womens basketball team and she said she trains about 10 hours every week. I'm pretty sure that the meal plan is required for first year students. Living on campus was worth it for me because I hate commuting. Having a meal plan was convenient and saved time. I'm going to open the finding inspiration conversation :) Mentee 2023-04-03, 11:25: I just learned that some jobs that are offerd now are not gong to be there when I graduate because of the technology thats growing rapidly, so if I keep am interesr in auto motive i will have to be open to the newer modles of cars, some dont have engenes and some dont run on fuel. Law even laws are changing/evolving as everything in the atmostphere evolves, for example like Gender/sex/identification even more changes everyday. My thought process is that everythings evolving and if i keep up it will be just a bit easier for my own growth, i think i want to go to UBC and study Family Law, thats going to be my goal for the rest of high school, i also want to play Collage ball but i want to play for a good team. I was thinking of going to the states for ball, i was thinking i would just apply and see what happens but i would keep my options open and apply to closer universitys. Mentor 2023-04-03, 12:28: There's something called the J-treaty, look into it if you are at least 50% native, it could help pay for all of your schooling in the US. Remember for law you can take a bachelor in anything first as your undregrad degree, did you look at all the courses offered like I suggested? Mentee 2023-04-04, 10:53: I never knew about the Jay-treaty tell now thank you for sharing, I want to apply for a job at TimHortans because its close and seems like a nice job for me. Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:17: ive applied and i got a call at 11, i couldnt have answerd because i have school, so i called them back after school stating that i was in school and they said that their manager is only in 11am-2pm every day and to call them in that time frame. that became an issue, because i have school at those times and i have basketball up and running again. im not sure how i feel about getting a job knowingly i can not manage a part time job school and extra cariculars like tutouring and basketball. I think i will put a job on hold until i have more time and i have the confidence i can work 30-40 hours a week. Mentor 2023-04-19, 13:58: Yeah 30-40 hours a week is too much for while you are in school. You don't want to get burned out. I did before, I worked two jobs and was taking Summer school at the same time and it was too much for me at the time. To be honest, I think it was mostly because I had a problem with showing up on time. One time my phone died so my alarm never went off and other times I was just slow at getting ready in the morning. I had one boss tell me she expected me to show up 15 minutes early every time and I didn't know that until later. These are the important years, your brain is still developing until you are 25 and according to some studies, your most vivid memories are between the ages of 15 and 30. I don't think that basketball is a bad habit at all! Exercise is very beneficial to your health, so are social relationships. Exercise has been shown to prevent telemore shortening associated with high stress. This means that normally, if you have a high stress job, you'll age faster, but exercising can counteract these effects. I met a girl on the UBC basketball team, she trains 10 hours a week. It all depends on what you want to do. What are your priorities? If you are passionate about basketball and you believe you could make it onto a university team, you should go for it! One bad habit I broke is vaping. I used to be terribly addicted. I started when I was 16 because I wanted to look cool in front of some new friends who were all doing it. I was vaping 5% nicotine which is way too much, only 20% is legal now. I'd say it got bad from 17-20. (I'm 20 now.) Honestly, it was like every breath I took, I vaped in class, and I even took it with me so I could vape while I wrote exams, hiding it under my sleeve. In highschool and when I got to university, I thoguht I couldn't do well without it. I thought if I stopped vaping, I would do bad on my exams because I would be so distracted by thinking about wanting to do it. Two things helped me to break that habit. 1) I made the conscious decison that my health was more important than school. I decided that even if I did bad on my exams because I was distracting by nicotine cravings, what was more important was my health. I ended up doing amazing in school anyways, and this month, April 15th, I reached 8 months! 2) The people around me. I slowly hung out with friends that vaped less until it didn't affect me to be around them when they had vapes anymore. But mostly, the person I hang out with the most in my life does not vape. I think that's also had a pretty big impact. So in summary, I'd say you have to start with a conscious decison about what exactly it is that you want, and then surround yourself with likeminded people. Find people that are at the same level or above your level. I have a friend whose GPA is higher than mine, and I really respect her study habits, she is so dedicated and disciplined. She will wake up early to study and almost ALWAYS goes to bed at a reaonsable hour (around 12 or 12:30.) Ultimately, you need to keep showing up for yourself. Most likely no one is going to brush your teeth for you, no one is going to manage your time for you either. Get an agenda, (that's what I do) and write daily to do lists, or use the google calendar app. Organize your schedule so you know when all your deadlines are. Give yourself ideally 2 weeks to study for every exam, find ways to ACTIVELY study. It can be hard, but it will pass. I remember a quote I heard, ""this too shall pass."" And it will. Every moment will pass. Every good moment, every bad. Work towards what you want your life to look like! Me personally I'm scared of MEDIOCRICITY. That's why I'm about to head to the library right now to study with my friend after I finish typing this. How do you want to pass your days? What do you want for your future? I really hope you did the career research I told you to do. And I hope that you look at EVERY. SINGLE. COURSE. that UBC offers on their website and read the descriptions and makes a list of what interests you. That's the best thing you could do for your future, and NO ONE else is going to do that stuff for you. No one else can. They always say, ""oh you're young, you have time to figure it out later,"" but now that I'm older I hate that they say that and that that's the norm. You do have time of course. But the time to start? That's now. Because what if you decide to look at all the careers finally at 18 right before university, and you don't like any of them? Then suddenly you're stuck. And if you'd just found that out earlier, you could have already began researching about the MANY alternative ways you can make money to survive/live/thrive (whatever you choose) And if you do these little (although they are time consuming) things, you're really setting yourself up for success. Mentee 2023-04-24, 11:14: I love basketball but it took up so much of my time this year but it was one of ,my motiviations to pass each class. From september to about march my weekly scheadual consisted of (5-7) 2 hour practices so i was doing 10-14 hours of basketball a week and games but now basketball isnt as much only 2 practices a week but i have games/tournements evey weekend to the end of may. 8 months is really good my mom tried to quit smoking because she was preggo with my little brother but after he was born she had troubles sleeping so she went back. I looked into law at UBC and i learned that i need a batchlors degree in somthing before i can even take a law course, I came up with a phsychology degree in child development because i want to be a family lawyer, and if i lose intrest in it i can still go be a social worker or and acual child physcologyst. i also need a 70% avrage to get into ubc which could be an issue and i might need tutouring so thats somthing to look forward to next year Mentor 2023-04-26, 21:48: I can tutor you online (although not for free but for pretty cheap) if they'll allow it! I'm really good at writng, reading comprehension and science. Maybe you should tell your mom about the effects of second and third hand smoke. I'm doing psych now, it's really interesting. You can definetly take some child development courses if that's what interests you, but your degree would be called BA or BSc major in psychology depending on if you want an arts degree or a science degree. The UBC acceptance rate is around 52% so you have a decent chance of getting in. Try talking to your teachers about how you can improve. Mentee 2023-05-01, 10:13: I have a toutor for math i also got a sponcer to pay for my tutouring which is nice but its for my Pre-Calc 10 and I think Its helping but i've always been Math Science smart but I have an interest for English/Socials class's but Im not the best at it. This weekend I did a womend and a Co-ed U17 tournement up in Ucluelet and For both teams we came 1st i seen Lots of family and made new friends which was amazing and i have basketball trips planned everyweekend of May which i find super exciting, Including my Final NAIG tryouts! Im super excited and nerveus because the last time i seen the girls who are trying out we were going head to head and things got pretty heated. Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:05: Today I learned that girls have to much fat to stay warm but guys have muscles to keep them warm and i just learned that and i dont know how to feel about it. but i got my progress report and i am passing all my class's with 2 C's and 2 B's :) Mentor 2023-05-06, 00:34: Congrats on coming first!! I know that it's easier for guys to get muscles but it's possible for girls to get a lot of muscles too. It's nice that you are getting funded for help when you need it. You should be able to talk to your teachers too if they have student hours. Not too bad on the grades, keep working at it, and using active recall. I've been pretty busy lately, I was packing all of my things, and I also just started a new job as a research assistant intern a few days ago. I get to work with a lot of lawyers which is really cool. Which conversation would you like to open next? Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:11: thats great! Congradulations on the job!! I think we should open up Post secoundary &amp; Career and planning Mentee 2023-05-26, 10:17: Im sorry for responding late we got an assignment and weve been working on that all week. Ive been looking at the first few links youve sent me and theyve helped but its a bit confusing to me. It tells me what the class is and what credits are but it doesnt tell me how to get to it, i really like the idea of Bachloring in art, would Science look better on resumes and transcrips? And for my learning i need to take a Bachlore in somthing and Major in somthing then i need to take 10 other class's ?",,,,,

This is something new that I am trying as part of ""well-being and self-care."" My favourite conversation module with you was ""Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning"" because, instead of doing the activity by looking at BC schools, you looked at Italian schools. For myself that was interesting because I googled the places and they look awesome! In this way, I got to see Italy online from a non-tourist perspective :D I am so sad that I won't be messaging you any longer :'( I really wish you all the best in your final years in high school and university &lt;3 I'll look out for famous architects from Italy that are named ""Francesca,"" and hopefully, that will be you ;) Before you officially complete the program, this ""wrapping-up"" activity is a survey about the program itself, and your answers will be anonymous. Once again, I wish you all the best &lt;3 Enjoy your final days in BC especially as you get a glimpse of how our summers are like. - Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-05-16, 10:27: Hi Mattea, This is my last massage, I want to say thank you because you are a sweet person who really helped me to learn about what I could do in the future. All the conversations with you were really useful, I hope I could give to you something as well. Best whishes, Francesca :)","Mentor 2023-05-02, 13:07: Hi Francesca! I have opened up this module now! I was in Victoria this past weekend, so I was busy doing touristy things :D My favourite thing I did was visit Craigdarroch Castle. The history junkie in me loved that &lt;3 Back to business. (lol) I decided to do the warm-up activity because the video and article discuss things I found myself thinking about. Last year I was undergoing lots of stress at school, and with activities I used to enjoy a lot. It was the first time I admitted to myself that I needed help, so I went to counselling at my uni for the first time ever. Although I didn't talk any differently than I would with a friend when I visited the counsellor, it was easier because these counsellors have professional opinions. Everyone around me encouraged me to seek help, which improved my day-to-day life. Afterwards, I picked up my pace again, doing the stuff I love, etc. I continue to make these small habits to this day, which helped me SO MUCH this past school year. Here are some of the warning signs I saw myself having before seeking help: More procrastination; staying on my phone longer than usual; feeling insecure because of acne flare-ups, grades, etc., which perpetuated my energy levels and mood. However, some actions and activities I enjoyed the most that I began to do are: Having a ""Sunday spa day"" (nails, skincare, etc.); maintaining a Monday to Friday work schedule with a weekend break; reading books; spending time with my friends; watching YouTube while drinking my coffee or tea (oddly this makes me feel productive); listening to my vinyl records. I wanted to wait to answer the discussion questions in anchor 1, so you choose the question that intrigues you after reading and watching the article and video. Talk to you again soon &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-05-05, 10:10: Hi Mattea, I hope you had a great time in Victoria! I like your healt care routine, it seems reallt chill but at he same time it looks like it halps you to grow mentally. My warning sign is that I'm bored, even if I get easily bored because I lose my motivation and at the end I don't get anything done. What usally help me is spend sometime with my family or friends or also drawing, it relaxes and inspire me. My question about anchor 1 is: what mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? talk to you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-05-05, 13:39: Hi Francesca! I totally recommend my health care routine. People laugh at being a basic girly doing these things, but there's something to it that helps! --&gt; Now that I think about it, I noticed this relates to the second anchor discussion. So I'll keep the details for that ;) That's great you can recognize your warning signs! From personal experience, when I was in high school, I didn't often see those signs. Though, the warning signs were obvious. I love how you include your family as part of what helps you take out of your funk. Not many people can say that, and I am super duper happy you're one of those who can &lt;3 As for your question: For myself, I knew that I needed a proper transition from high school to university. I was an academic achiever and determined not to fail my first year at uni. At orientations from universities, they mentioned how high the statistic for failing is, which I was most worried about. The best thing I did to overcome this was attend college first and then transfer to university. It is not necessary to do that here in Canada, but I really wanted that transition, which helped me a lot! Otherwise, as much as I hate to admit, nothing can truly prepare you for the challenges you face after high school. However, the best thing you can do is ensure you have enough time for yourself, making things a lot easier. As for mental health, in high school, I was very insecure, and I would've been considered a nerd. I was in theatre, loved art, and had straight A's. You can imagine the comments I heard from those who liked to make fun of people. I was so excited to go to college because I made sure to attend this school where I wouldn't see people from my high school. That helped quite a bit. I also enjoyed how I could do things on my own time. There was a strict 9-3 timetable in high school, and in post-secondary, the timing is essentially your choice and your responsibility to attend your classes or not. I really liked that, and considering that I didn't need to see everyone every day, that was a lot better for my mental health because I had the time to do things I liked and got to work more without feeling that someone was judging me. Is there anything I said that reminded you of what you're going through? I hope I answered your choice of question properly! Now that I have responded to your question, is there another question you'd like me to answer from anchor one? Let me know when you can! This module is one of the more important ones because this relates to all aspects of life, not just school. Over and out! - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-05-08, 10:22: Hi Mattea, Thank you for all the tips, I will make treasure of them :). What I can change is: - Less using of phone, I could do less hour of work but more concentrate and turning of the phone; - Less lazy about serching information abvout the topics, don't wait for my classmates to send me over notes or whatever, but try to look at books or on internet with more activly porpuse: My exchange year is about to finish so I have to do an all in right now :D. My question from anchor two is: can they share any time management tips? Cause you already know I'm vaery bad at it lol. Talk to you soon, Francesca &lt;3 Mentor 2023-05-09, 11:28: Hi Francesca! You're already ahead of the game for Anchor 2! But awww, I hope you had a wonderful time here in Canada and that you'll treasure every moment &lt;3 For myself, the three changes that I can change right now are: - Go to bed before midnight, and I can do this by showering earlier and talking less with my mom when she comes home from work. - Read more during the day, and I can do this by choosing my book instead of TikTok and watching random TV shows. - Prioritise my feelings. I can do this by thinking for myself and what I like rather than thinking about others. To answer your question: I started making to-do lists for the entire semester, which helped me stay on top of my tasks. I'm also continuing to make these to-do lists even after my semester is done, and I'm more motivated to do stuff. I think a good sleeping and waking-up routine makes a big difference, and I recommend starting on that before anything else. I hope this all helps &lt;3 Now that you mentioned your exchange is coming to an end, will your teacher allow you to do the ""wrap-up"" activity? I hope you can because I wish to properly say goodbye to you :') Talk to you soon, and good luck with your final days &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-05-12, 09:51: Hi Mattea, The year is almost finished, but I'll try to follow your routine in the summer so I won't loose the concentration! I asked my teacher about the wrap-up and he said I can do it. Talk to you soon, Francesca &lt;3",,,"Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:48: Hello again! So, good news-- no videos! And our previous conversation module will help a lot for this one! Good choosing ;) However, it sounds confusing what to do, but that is why I am here :D I recommend first going onto Work BC and then looking at the anchor text box for one discussion to understand the differences between the three programs (bachelor's, certificate, diploma). Though the instructions say the opposite, I found it easier first to go onto WorkBC. Since I want to become a teacher, here is what I found on WorkBC: The first position I found is at a private school with a salary between $86 000 - $113 00. However, I need five years of experience. Some qualifications I need are accuracy, client focus, excellent oral and written communication, flexibility, and being a good team player! I would need a practicum for training, but this depends on what certificate program I get into for teaching, and training should be included. Before getting a certificate, I would need a bachelor's degree in a teachable subject. Since this is what I might pursue, I know what I need. I am getting a History and Humanities bachelor's degree, and after that, I will go to the PDP program, where I will get my certificate in teaching. I am going for five years for my bachelor's degree since we get to go at our own pace here, and if I get into the PDP program, that'll be about a year. I will be in school for about 6-7 years in total. The second part of this anchor discussion might be less helpful since you're from Italy and will be studying there. Perhaps instead of using the websites recommended here, maybe there is an Italian equivalent you may know of and can use that to help with this activity! If you don't want to, totally chill! If you want to know about the transfer process, I did it myself, and I can answer any questions you might have. I know these are very Canadian/BC focus activities, so feel free to use any Italian sources that will be helpful if you like &lt;3 Message you again soon :D - Mattea Mentee 2023-02-28, 10:54: Hi Mattea, So, I searched for the profession of restorer but there wasn't anything, so I ended up searching for archaeologist. I found one pretty interesting in Burnaby, here is what I found on WorkBC: It is a regular full time with a salary around 100.000$ yearly. I need completion of a Bachelor’s degree in archaeology or anthropology with a specialization in archaeology, plus considerable post-graduate training and considerable related experience in archaeological resource management related to infrastructure or public works projects is preferred, or an equivalent combination of training and experience. Since I'm not really sure if this is what I want to do, I would choose a degree in Art area so it will be more versatile, surely the site help to have a concrete vision of what you need to do for achieve that type of job. Accademiaalbertina S.a.s. Di Corsino Alessandro E C., this would be an option of Art university, because first of all is in my native city, because I would like to stay there and talking to some friends, they recommended to me. I did all the research based on Italian programs because it is more useful. See you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-03-03, 13:34: Hi Francesca! Yeah, archaeologists here in BC have few opportunities unless it's through a university. But based on what you found, that is a good salary! I agree with you that as long as you know you want a degree in art, it's easier to navigate your next steps, especially when you're a student. When you get to university, I 100% recommend looking for volunteer opportunities, etc. Since you live in Italy, I wouldn't believe it if there weren't any. Look at you already starting the anchor 2 discussion! Since you already found a school and observed factors from the first two slides, do you think there are any issues you might have to deal with when you start applying? For example, courses needed to get into the program, etc. For myself, if I go into the teaching program at the university I am at currently, I still need to take an Indigenous course to fulfill the application requirements. So from now until I get my bachelor's degree, I need to take that at school. Other factors are also required, such as enough experience outside of school to get into the teaching program. I am currently volunteering with this program here, and hopefully, soon I'll get tutoring experience. That is what's left remaining for me. I know the process is different in Italy than here in BC, but if you have any questions about applications (or transfer between schools), let me know &lt;3 Talk to you soon! - Mattea :) Mentor 2023-03-09, 12:34: Hi Francesca! Sorry for the delay. My week has been once again very busy! That's interesting to know that there are high schools in Italy for specific focus areas too! My cousins in Croatia also have a similar system such as that. While that can be a considerable disadvantage, I agree that if you have a passion for it, you will be fantastic &lt;3 Since we are near the last conversation module, ""Funding your future,"" would you like to do the extension activity here on ""post-secondary and career planning""? Let me know when you can! I heard its Spring break next week -- so have LOTS of fun &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentor 2023-03-13, 11:26: Hi Francesca!! I hope you will have had a great Spring Break when you read this! I read over the articles for the extension activity, and while some may not apply to universities in Italy, they still capture the essence of post-secondary. About the first article: I would have been very excited to hear about the 4-month summer if I were in high school. But considering how expensive tuition has gotten since my first year, almost four years ago, I don't think working part-time during the summer would help pay off your second year. Perhaps when this article was written, it was doable. Another thing on this list, which I know I loved when I entered into uni, was getting to know all assignments and readings on the first day of class. SUPER helpful! Number eleven on the list is hard, especially since getting an A here in high school is much easier. I would've argued against that if I were in high school, but after several years in uni, it's tough. If I was in high school, I would've been nervous about my assignments and exam being worth more. Even after four years, I still am. However, I have had to deal the hard way with explaining to myself that it's okay if I get anything below a B. Sometimes, it is what it is. Since there is another part to this activity, let's finish this first part. So when you have the time after Spring Break (or if you log in during), let me know your responses to this article! Talk to you soon, Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-03-27, 10:46: Hi Mattea, My spring break was great! About the first article, there are few similarity with Italian Universities, but I was alreardy pretty concious about all of them because I have two siblings who are both in uni so I have a general idea how it works. I feel that the most hard part is the you have more holidays, which is is for sure a good thing, but I work better under pressure so I already know that it will be a challenge for me to kepping up with the lesson and exams. Talk to you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-03-28, 11:41: Hi Francesca! I'm happy you enjoyed your spring break! I hope the weather was nice for you there as much as it was nice here in Vancouver. You have a good point about holidays. Sometimes too many can distract our focus. That's great that you work well under pressure! I know many students who do not handle the pressure well, and I've met many who have unfortunately quit uni. :( As long as you keep updating how you handle stress, I know you'll be the best ;) The second article discusses academic success tips. Are there any on the list you already used in high school? For myself, curbing my procrastination and taking different types of notes is what I did in high school. Now that I am in uni, I noticed thinking critically and engaging in class, along with short-term goals over long-term goals, made a significant difference. You mentioned that you have siblings in university. Are there any big differences based on what I told you and what you see from their experience? (I've always wondered how different university was in Europe, like in Italy, compared to Canada) You could combine your answers to my questions if you'd like to. Talk to you again soon! I've missed these chats &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-04-03, 10:29: Hi Mattea, I missed these little talks too! And thank you for the trust you place me :'). About the second article the two things that I do the most is: - having a routine because I have a plan to follow so I have a clear idea of what I need to do before the end of the day; - and problably I take a little bit too much care of myself lol, because as problaby I already said to you before, I get easily distracted and so my breaks are too long and too freaquent. About the differences between the European and Canadian uni, from what I get it from both of the parts, they aren't too many, I mean obviosly they are not the same but they more look alike than than high schools. Mentor 2023-04-04, 11:19: Hi Francesca! Your commitment to answering each time is much appreciated &lt;3 Which is why I know you'll be fantastic at uni! I must admit, there is no ""too much"" self-care. Believe me. I miss being able to say that. haha That's great you have a routine for yourself so you have a clear idea of what to do each day. I only started to do that about two years ago, and I wish I had started that earlier. My grades got better because I organized my days better. Keep that up! Since high school is so different in Europe, I was intrigued to know more about universities there. Watching YouTubers who go to university somewhere in Europe is my guilty pleasure, and that weirdly motivates me to do better. But you don't see how universities function in those videos, only what the YouTuber does. Do you like watching YouTube? I watched YouTube much more in my early high school days but stopped. But the pandemic brought me back into it. Alrightyyyyy, I see we are finished with ANOTHER conversation module. I'll be opening up next, ""Funding your future."" I'll make sure to update you once I do. P.s That will be our last conversation module :( Unless you want to add more ;) - Mattea :D",,"Mentor 2023-02-16, 15:43: Hello again! I watched the first two videos, and the videos will take 6 minutes of your time. This means the videos are easy to watch and understand :D The second video screams ""Canadian,"" so I hope you'll enjoy the video as much as I did. Haha With the first set of discussion questions, I recommend doing the warm-up activity first because I found answering the questions more manageable. Here is how I did mine: For the warm-up, I made a list of careers I used to think about and ones I am considering today. When I was younger, I loved singing and wanted to be a singer. Later as I grew up, I noticed I am very introverted and have anxiety, which wouldn't be fun if I became a struggling musician. Lol Today, however, I would like to have an educational type of job. This includes being a social studies teacher or working in museums. These are very different careers, but both jobs would include an element of teaching. Both careers closely connect to what I am studying (history and humanities), so I'll enjoy whatever career I decide on. I want to see your full response to the discussion questions! And I'll share my response very briefly, and we can see how our answers connect :) I love my ""me-time,"" so I believe that is my biggest value. However, this does not mean I shouldn't value this as I grow older, and I hope that I will continue to value my ""me-time"" in other ways. My ""me-time"" differs with the seasons; for example, during the summer, I love to be outside and go swimming or biking when I'm not in school or not working. Regarding the second and third components of the discussion question, since I am studying history and humanities, these subjects in my opinion are as important as math and sciences. Still, they're taught in a very bland way for K-12 students. So, I want to change this mindset and focus on making history enjoyable to learn because the impact you have on the student, they'll continue to create an impact further in their community and globally. I hope this helps, and I can't wait to see what you write! Good luck &lt;3 - Mattea :) Mentor 2023-02-16, 15:59: OK, quick update. I don't know if I can suggest other websites that may help with ""career exploration,"" but I remember when I went to high school, I had to do this online quiz activity about what type of job I should have based on my answers. I can't remember the website I used, but I have found quizzes you can do from ""WorkBC"": https://careerdiscoveryquizzes.workbc.ca/#career-quizzes You don't need to do it, but I noticed that you really value your future, so perhaps the link may help you &lt;3 If you do decide to do the quiz, let me know so we can both share what we got :) Mentee 2023-02-23, 10:59: Hi Mattea, When I was little there wasn't really something i want to do, maybe I would like to be a middle/high school teacher or a caretaker. Now my ideas are even less clear, I would like to try evrything, I would like to become a restorer, a forester or wotk in the area of maths. From the videos you can understand how your work has to be something that you own, you have to enjoy what your doing because it will affects you and the people you're working with. They alsi help you to understand that your life is not just at your work but you have to fallow your passions and intrests outside the wotk life, you have to still live your life. In my future life i want to have a family and I want to enjoy it, I also want to find a job that suits me and don't bored me. I also want to travel a lot and know a lot of people and give them something about me and the other way around. I really don't know how to incorporate these desires in my future job, problaby doing a job that allow me to have a right amount of free days. I did the test and the results was two principals area, as archeologist or wab designer who are both pretty interesting jobs that i didn't considerate. sorry for the late answer Francesca :) Mentor 2023-02-24, 13:24: Hi Francesca! You are not late at all! I must admit the website I sent to you was also included in the following anchor discussion. Clearly, this module and I think the same! Haha. Your answer about values you would like to have in the future shows how different the ""North American"" values are compared to Italy! Very rarely do I see someone have the same response as you, but I am noticing a shift here in Vancouver about it. With that in mind, I would agree with your values. When you're happy and content with what you're doing, you also become satisfied with everything around you, which includes family, holidays, etc. The hustle culture here in Canada and the U.S. is not healthy in the long run. I find too many miserable people. Haha. I wish growing up here that, there was less of a focus on the fact that your purpose in life is only your career. There 100% needs to be a balance with everything else that's not job-related. I wouldn't worry too much about incorporating your desires into a future job just yet. The number of times I have thought about different careers and where that might lead me is chaotic. There is pressure needing to worry about this while you're in your teens, and I was just the same back when I was in high school. Take it from me, and I'm sure many others would agree; enjoy your time as a teen while you can because just one day can change everything literally (like the COVID lockdown. I was 18 then, and now I'm 21, and I feel like I can't have the ""young kid"" mentality anymore and I'm more pressured about my career than ever before). I did the test as well! My results are just about what I want to do in life--something that includes education. However, I was surprised to get nursing, considering I wouldn't say I like biology. Haha. Doing this type of test now, I can assure you I had MUCH different results when I was in grade 10 and had to do it. You mentioned ""restorer,"" which also closely aligns with archaeology. Considering the questions in the anchor two box, how might this work with the values you would hope to have in the future? Have an awesome weekend, Mattea :) Mentee 2023-02-27, 10:16: Hi Mattea, I feel like this job in some ways would fit with my values a and in some ways not. It seems like a job that you have to travel a lot, and I love travel, but if somedays I would like to build a family it would be difficult. On the other hand, I really like art this is why it is one of my options. But I'm still deciding, and I still have an open mind about it! Francesca :) Mentor 2023-02-27, 19:11: Hi Francesca! I agree that one day if you have a family, it might take much of your time in the future. However, I have a professor this semester who has a family and is an archaeologist alongside teaching! Currently, they're in Egypt for two weeks because, depending on your research, it's usually short because of budgeting, which I didn't know before. I also recently got an email from my school for students interested in restoration learning, and here's the link to check it out: https://www.sangeministudies.info/sgps-programs-2022 This link that I sent you, the program runs every year in Italy, and it's right up your alley if this interests you! The program may be cheaper since you mentioned you'd want to study in Italy. But it seems super cool! Had I been in my first few years of university, and if COVID didn't happen, I would have considered it. I believe we're done with this conversation! It seems we don't have much else to discuss. However, you are more than welcome to continue here whenever you think of something to ask :) As usual, I'll make sure to message you when I open up the next conversation module: Post-Secondary and Career planning. Bye for now &lt;3 - Mattea :D","Mentor 2023-02-10, 16:55: Hello Hello! So. I have gone through the video... I wish we had been paired a week ago because I could have used some of these strategies for the midterm I JUST did today! That's alright. Next time. Hopefully. Lucky for you, this conversation has only one video :) The best part: it's under 10 minutes! A quick little summary about the video; the individual explains six ways to effective studying methods. But, interestingly, they mentioned that learning methods do not mean they are your studying methods. The way we study can be entirely different from the way we learn. I didn't think about it that way before, and it makes sense now that I have watched the video. I looked over the questions and will briefly answer the first suggested question. (But you could make one question up if you would like to use it for discussion!): While I did not realize I had done this already, I tried to space out my studying and study in short intervals rather than cram everything at once. The downside is that I need to work on doing this method. Another method I use that I learned is recommended is the words and visual approach! I hope you'll learn something different, just as I did! In your answers that we share, you could compare and contrast the different learning and studying methods used in Italy versus here. I learned back in high school from similar conversations that countries teach students studying and learning strategies very differently than BC. Take your time, and enjoy your weekend! - Mattea :) Mentee 2023-02-13, 11:12: Hi, how are you? I really appreciate the video, because it gave me new tips to study that are different from my usual one. Usually, I rewrite my notes in a word, then print it and highlight the topics with different colors. My approach to study it is also different because in Italy most of the tests are oral tests. In particular the last method, words and visual, because I think it can help me to have a map of the topic I am studying about and also helps me to understand what I know and what I need to review. One thing I find really challenging in study is to keep focus even if it is for a short amount of time, do you have any tips? The question I am curious about is the following one: how are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? Hopefully I give you also a little point of view about my ""Italian method"", if you have any question about ask without any worries! Thank you for your sharing, Francesca :)) Mentor 2023-02-13, 20:27: Hi Francesca! I'm doing much better now that I slept more over the weekend. Haha, I hope you're doing great too &lt;3 I have heard about those oral tests! That must be brutal when you don't understand a topic and get asked to be tested verbally! Visuals would for sure help you further comprehend the material you're studying. That way, you understand the ""bigger picture"" (see what I did there ;) ). Unfortunately, I do not have any tips on keeping focus because I need to work on that too. However, this did change slightly when I got to university. So I'll answer your other question together. I don't know what high school is like in Italy, but in the high school that I went to, during lunchtime, we were able to leave the school grounds to go to the gas station to get snacks or the mall nearby. No teacher had an issue as long as we were back in our classes at the right time. That, to me, was amazing. Especially when I had free periods in grade 12?! Heaven. I used that time to start on homework and to study. But I struggled to finish things after school because being at school from 8-3 (sometimes until eight at night because I was in theatre) drained my motivation for homework and projects. That being said, when I got to university-- that's when you see improvement! In universities here in Canada, we get to choose what classes we want and how many (usually 3-4 courses per semester). That flexibility means a lot to us students because we get to finish our degree at the pace we want (even do classes during the summer). This aspect helped with my attention span. On the days I would have no class, I wake up just a little bit later and get to my to-do list. I don't make my to-list long; otherwise, I lose focus. So, on those days, I aim to be finished by 5 pm, and I have the whole evening to do whatever I like. When I used to work, I often placed my shifts in the morning for four hours, bought myself a coffee after work, and went back home and tried to do the same thing but with a smaller to-do list. My biggest advice is don't push yourself for small things. You can choose what's more important, do that first, and that one small reading for another class can be finished after the main thing you wanted to accomplish or do it the next day. Why torture yourself? It's 100% not worth it. Especially if it's a degree, you have a passion for. I never made to-do lists in high school, so you can try and let me know! Sorry for the long message. I like to explain in detail :'D Let me know if you'd like to know more! I'll open up the next conversation sometime this week. It's a hectic week for me (more midterms before reading week), so I'll message you again when I have the time this week! I hope that's alright &lt;3 - Mattea :)","Mentor 2023-04-04, 11:45: Hello again! Welcome to the final module that you requested &lt;3 So I reviewed the anchor one discussion, and the activity requires you to look into three scholarships, bursaries, etc., that you can apply for. When I applied for scholarships, etc., I had a teacher in high school who created a blog just for scholarships, which helped me see what I could apply for. In high school, I also applied for scholarships in the community I was involved in, and I applied to two and got them worth $500 ($1000 total). It wasn't much, but this helped pay for my first semester in college. I started in college first before transferring to a university for my second year, and many people here in BC do this because college is a bit cheaper than university. Currently, for each semester in an arts program at the university I am in, I pay $3 500 per semester. Now, I am considering again applying for scholarships, but because application processes are lengthy and are due when I have finals, I have no time for them :( However, I found a scholarship through my faculty department due at the end of April, which I will apply to! Are scholarships offered differently in Italy in comparison to what you read? For the activity component, if you know, use Italian websites to help you browse for scholarships! Including the university you would like to go to. Sometimes universities also have entrance scholarships you can apply for as you apply. Talk to you again soon!! - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-04-12, 10:54: Hi Mattea, I'm back from Easter Holidays! I read the first article, but I searched the answerings based on Italian scolarships as you raccomanded me to do. I obviously want to attend a post-secondary education and it would be even better if I achive a scholarships, also because as I already told I have two sibligns so it would help my parents fiancially. In italy most of the scholarships are based on which regions you're going to attend the uni, so in my case, problaby Piemonte. Three scholarships I could take are: - the first one is erogate by the region, and in my case it would be 2900$, it is given to you based on your grades and if you live in the region you're attending your uni, which is my case - the second one is erogate to who want to attend an artistic pos-secondary school education, which it might be me, in this case you would be exonerated about 1200$ of the yearly fee, which is about 44.000$ - the third and last one is from Politecnico of Turin, it is for an architeture, it would be about 3000$. I don't have any question for you about it, I already found useful your last answer! Next time I will do the second article. Talk to you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-04-12, 11:58: Hi Francesca! I'm glad to hear you're back! I hope your Easter Holiday weekend was fun despite being away from home. But soon, you'll see them all again &lt;3 The second scholarship that you found must be so helpful! I hope you get it ;D. Yes. The second article discusses the various expenses you might find yourself in. The second anchor activity box has a document for a budgeting activity! I did it myself and found that I knew how to answer, having already done my taxes and worked for three years in one place. But I am not working anymore, so I based my answer on last year: After my yearly income was subtracted from my yearly spending, I had a total of $3 300. But monthly, that's nothing considering how expensive Vancouver is :( I must mention that I live at home since the university I attend is not very far. So, I am lucky not to pay many additional fees that other students might have. Instead of me answering a question now, in the anchor box, you choose several questions (or one depending on your interest), and I can respond. I'm trying to figure out how to attach my budgeting activity here; if I figure it out, I'll send another message. Talk to you soon, and I hope it's nice and sunny, just as it is here in Vancouver. Enjoy &lt;3 - Mattea Mentor 2023-04-12, 12:05: Update: I figured it out! I attached my budgeting activity to my portfolio. Unfortunately, I don't know if your screen differs from mine. If not, what you do: is save the document on your computer; then, when you want to write a message here, click ""save to your portfolio,"" where it will ask for the document. Then, once you see the file below ""save to your portfolio,"" it should be there. I'm pretty sure you'll know how to do it. B-) - Mattea Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:34: Hi Mattea, I finaly finished my budgeting assignment! Most of the expanses I left blank because I'm planning on living with my parents during my uni period, so they would pay for them. But in generl I'm good with my incomes and my expenses are balenced. the question I want to ask you is: what do they recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? ps. for my birthday I will be over Vancouver! talk to you soon, Francesca :D Mentee 2023-04-17, 10:39: Okay I think I saved my budget to my portfolio, let me know if you can see it Mentor 2023-04-17, 14:43: Hi Francesca! I'll answer more quickly because my semester is over, and I am taking the summer off. So, if you're wondering why I'm responding on the day you sent your response, that is why. :D Unfortunately, I can't see your budgeting activity. Were you able to see mine? If not, maybe that activity is for us to reference back to in our answers to each other. Considering that this conversation module is on ""funding,"" I'll answer your question with that in mind. There is no correct answer for balancing part-time work and school. In previous modules we have done, articles stated that they recommend working to pay off your tuition during the summer. However, as I mentioned, tuition increases quite a bit each year here in BC, and this is hard to pay off just by working part-time. Working a minimum part-time for about 8-12 hours a week did not get me to 7k for the whole year. Considering that when you're young, you want to travel, have fun with your friends on a night out, etc., it's unrealistic that working and studying will pay off tuition. I'm on student loans and won't need to pay them off until after graduation. That being said, working 8-12 hours a week allowed me time to study and have a social life. I recommend that once you start working, keep a savings envelope (or savings account) and add money every few weeks or so, and when you want to get your nails done or go out, you already have money to spare. I found that method worked nicely for me. I have an envelope for ""something big"" and ""miscellaneous."" Is there any other question you want to have answered? And would you like to do the extension activity? As for your brief mentioning of going to Vancouver for your birthday (which, by the way, Happy early Birthday &lt;3), here are some recommendations I have that I found fun to do before turning 19: - rec room (arcade and entertainment place). -Granville Island is perfect for cute photos in the rain and on sunny days. (It's called an island because it's detached from the land but accessible from downtown). -If you like art galleries, the Vancouver Art Gallery is cool to visit near the mall and Robson Street (good shopping places). -If the weather turns out nice and warm, the Kitsilano area is one of my favourites. The beach is so big with fantastic views, and up a few blocks on West 4th Ave, you have a bunch of local shops and great restaurants (Las Margaritas is my favourite Mexican place). -Take the sea bus from downtown, and you are in North Vancouver! (The Lonsdale Quay market is right there, and, again, small vendors for food and local shops that are cute to visit. There's an art gallery by donation in a building nearby if you want to visit). I could go on and on, but I bet you have some places on your list, too. So unless you want to know more, then let me know ;) Talk to you again soon, Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-04-18, 10:15: Hi Mattea, thank you for the wishes and for the advices, I will definitely vist those pleces! Mentee 2023-04-18, 10:19: I'll try a second time tosend you my budgeting assignment, and answered to all my questions, so I don't have any else! I wish you a great holiday! talk to you soon, Francesca :) Mentee 2023-04-18, 10:20:  Mentor 2023-04-19, 13:03: Hi Francesca! I just your budget activity! Good Job! I remember when I had to do a similar activity back in high school, I did it horribly. LOL I'm glad you liked my recommendations &lt;3 Hopefully, the weather will be beautiful when you get here. April weather has been very dreary. Well then... Congrats on completing this final module! You were always on time and always had awesome answers &lt;3 Your class only required you to do two, and you did four! Is there anything else you would like to review? If not, let me know, and we can say our final goodbyes :') - Mattea &lt;3","Mentor 2023-02-09, 14:21: Hi Francesca! My name is Mattea, and I'm excited to be your mentor! I will say that I do not have experience in Italian Universities. However, I had a professor who studied in Florence, and he became an art history professor here in Canada. Perhaps you could look into studying art and architecture there! If you don't know, Florence was the center of all art and architecture during the Renaissance. Brunelleschi, though he lost a competition for some baptistry doors, he proceeded to build the duomo in Florence! This part of history in Florence might spark your interest in studying there. I hope your interest in being an architect or anything to do with art won't leave you because BC could use an exciting architect. Perhaps after completing two conversation modules (of your choice), we could browse together some universities in Italy that are also offered in English. Together we could see the process of searching for schools and what is best. Remember that if you go to a university in BC, most schools offer study abroad programs that will probably provide Italy as one of the locations to go to! I couldn't study abroad for my entire post-secondary, but I plan to attend a field school in Prague this year. Studying abroad does not need to be eliminated from your bucket list if you stay in BC ;-) And if you have a burning passion for architecture, I know someone who studied architecture in Europe (in Croatia), and I could ask them what their degree looked like. I can't wait to hear back from you! You seem to have lots of determination, and I absolutely admire that :) Make sure to let me know which conversation you would like to start with first &lt;3 - Mattea :) Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:33: Hi Mattea, How are you? I am very happy that you are my mentor because you seem a really nice person. I really appreciate your mail, and I can't wait to start! What I forget to tell you it is that I am an Italian exchange student and this is the reason why I would like to study in Italy, but I do not exclude to study also around Europe. From the conversation modules, I would like to talk about: Funding Your Future Strategic Studying Francesca :) Mentee 2023-02-10, 10:33:  Mentor 2023-02-10, 16:36: Hi Francesa! Thank you for your sweet words &lt;3 I must have sounded funny when I told you about Florence, and you must have already known! Lol You should be telling me about Florence! haha Now it makes total sense why you would like to study in Italy. Which part of Italy are you from? I hope that BC has treated you kindly and that you will have beautiful memories &lt;3 I met lots of exchange students when I was in High School, and they were the best people to hang out with ;) But who knows! Maybe you might come back to study here in Canada again... Let's move clockwise and begin with Strategic Studying. I'm 100% sure that will be useful to the BOTH of us. haha I'll write another message to you once I have opened the conversation! - Mattea :) Mentee 2023-02-14, 10:53: Hi Mattea, Thank you so much for your answer, it was very useful! Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that don't know how to study, so I was happy to know that I am not the only one! :) I will try your method to do less thing per day and try to spread them well through the months. Don't rush to answer me! Have a nice week, Francesca &lt;3 Mentee 2023-02-16, 10:15: Hi Mattea, How is been your week? I am writing to you because I would like to add two more topics, that are: Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning Career Exploration Is it possible? See you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-02-16, 14:53: Hi Francesca!! I finally have some time to answer you &lt;3 My week has been busy, but I pushed through :) Some weeks are like that, but then that means my weekend will be time to relax -- worth it. Haha. I hope you're having a fabulous week as well! From what I remember when I was in high school, February meant we had semester break week. Will you be having one? I'm glad that you liked my response on studying advice! As you go further along towards the end of high school and onto post-secondary, you'll definitely want to be efficient and be able to balance life-work-school. It's hard at first, but it becomes good when you pick a steady tempo. And, of course we could add two more conversations! I am down to learn something new ;) Never too late or early to start thinking about the topics you have chosen. Again, going clockwise on the wheel, I'll open up ""career exploration"" next. When I do, I'll send another message. If you think you would like to continue a bit more on ""strategic studying,"" we can still do it :) If not, we can always come back to it if you would like. - Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:26: Hi Mattea! How are you? Some challenges I could find in an art post-secondary education is that I do not arrived from an art high-school, so i would have to implement some skills probably, so I would start a little behind comapre to my classmates. But it art is a passion so I think, for me, it wouldn't be as bad as catch up with a literature subject. Bye, Francesca :) Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:38: P.S. Just to let you know, tomorrow I can't do the videocall with you, I'm sorry :( Mentor 2023-03-06, 11:19: Hi Francesca! Thank you for letting me know about tomorrow! You're on top of your game, and that alone I appreciate &lt;3 I'll respond tomorrow for our conversation module. I just wanted to quickly reply to the message about the ""video chat with your mentor"" event. I hope you'll have an awesome week! - Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-03-10, 10:08: Hi Mattea, sure, I would like to do an extention activity about the post-secondary! Problaby I will answer you after spring break. Have a nice weekend :) Francesca Mentor 2023-04-12, 12:02:  Mentor 2023-04-26, 12:46: Hi Francesca! I hope you're doing alright :) I just wanted to pop in and ask once more if you would like to do one more module; if not, we are required to do the ""wrapping-up activity,"" which is a module but for goodbyes. Then you'll be officially complete with this site! Perhaps you are visiting Vancouver at this time, so if you are, enjoy &lt;3 Answer when you can &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-04-28, 10:03: Hi Mattea, my teacher said i have to do another one, so I would like to start well being and self care. I really loved Vancouver and the wheater wasn't that bad! Talk to you soon, Francesca :) Mentor 2023-04-28, 17:07: Hi Francesca! That sounds awesome! Unfortunately I am on a weekend holiday, so on Tuesday I'll open it up for you &lt;3 Just wanted to let you know :D I'm happy you enjoyed Vancouver! - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-05-15, 13:34: Hi Francesca and Mattea! Just want to let you know that you are welcome to keep chatting even once your class is over. We can keep your MentorCity accounts active for as long as you want, or let us know if there's anything else we can do to help you two keep in touch.

What tips do you have? Mentor 2023-06-09, 17:56: Hey Sam! Awesome work on this module's content and the discussion questions! I really like that you put down ""get more sleep"" in your self care action plan because that's something that gets totally overlooked sometimes. It also plays a huge role in basketball too because I remember playing some of my best basketball when I got a good night's rest and was ready to go. Getting help after school and practicing basketball everyday are defintely going to help you achieve the goals you have for those two areas. For my self-care personally, I always try to prioritize my physical health because a lot of my mental health and mood comes from that. So I try to hit the gym everday and make sure I work on basketball as well. I also play other sports throughout the week to keep things different and fun like playing soccer on weekends. Eating healthy is also huge for my self-care and I try to keep a pretty healthy diet, but still eat junk food a decent amount. Doing all of that makes my body feel good, and from that my mental health benefits a lot. Sometimes I also find putting my phone in a different room for maybe an hour can be kind of relaxing. Daily naps are also needed for me haha. It took me a while to really understand myself and find which self-care techniques work the best for me, but after experimenting with different ones you will eventually find a good list of things that you can rely on to stay mentally and physically happy :) Mentor 2023-06-09, 18:06: Great work on this module! I'm not sure if your teacher wants you to do the ""extension activity"" at the end of this module. If they do, then go ahead and work through that and ask me any questions you have while working through it and building your list that the activity wants to you make. If your teacher doesn't require you to do the extension activity, then you can move on to any of your required modules next!

I believe you are not required to do the extension activity so feel free to move onto one of the other required modules next!

Mentor 2023-06-24, 21:23: Awesome job on this module! I think physio is cool too and I came across from basketball injuries as well, which I find is what bring a lot of people's attention to the job just like it did for you. To answer your discussion questions, I really value just being an honest person and helping others out of the good of your heart. Lots of times doing things for people might seem small but it can make a huge difference to them. That's why my dream job is to be a doctor so that I can give back to the community by taking care of people when they are sick :) Other things that helped me choose my career was my interest in the human body. I find our body super interesting because it is super durable and is crazy smart, so being a doctor would give me a chance to study subjects I like. I wish I knew more about the path to become a doctor better early on in high school because I'm the first potential doctor in my family so I've had to go through a lot of trail and error and do lots of research about how to become a doctor. This has come with a lot of mistakes unfortunately haha. Awesome responses though!",,,"Mentor 2023-02-13, 21:41: Hey Sam! My name is Arjun and I'm a fourth Behavioural Neuroscience student at UBC!

Feel free to ask me any questions about hobbies, school, or anything else you might be curious about! Mentor 2023-02-14, 22:02: Hey Sam! Following your teacher's instructions, I opened all the requrired conversations. Your teacher indicated that you are required to complete ""Getting Hired"", ""Well-Being and Self-Care"", ""Confronting Discrimination"", ""Career Exploration"", and one conversation of your choice. Go ahead and find the navigation wheel and choose any one of these to start!

My aplogies for responding so late, I got totally lost while studying for a big upcoming exam. To answer your question on how I snap out of it when feeling low or not like myself is usually I try to take a little break and do something I enjoy that I find fun. This includes playing basketball, which I love to hear that you love playing as well, working out, watching a TV show, or sometimes even taking a quick nap! If that isn't working, sometimes taking a cold shower can snap me out of it! Mentor 2023-06-22, 16:29: Hey Sam! It seems your teacher wants you to wrap up the E-mentoring program by the end of this week :( Just wanted to say thank you for being an awesome mentee and giving great responses through the ""Well Being and Self Care"" module. Of course, I'm still here for any last minute questions, advice, or responses if you end up going through another module within the next day or two. Also, let me know if you want to keep working through the program after your class has ended or even if you want to keep chatting after basketball or school. The eMentoring staff can make sure our accounts on MentorCity remain active for as long as its needed, or, if you’d prefer to communicate outside the platform, the eMentoring staff can help safely facilitate this too! If not, no worries and I wish you the best of luck with your future studies and basketball training!",,,,,"Mentee 2023-06-22, 22:22: implict bias- people who say whatever is on their mind without any knowledge to back their opinion indivisual racism- people who is taught to not like other races Institutional racism- poeple with power trying to sabotage other race and create a advantage towards their race Microaggression- saying negative things towards another person wheater that is intentional or not Privilege- having a advantage overthings because you're born with it What efforts have you seen “in the real world” like at your school, job, in your everyday life as an adult to minimize discrimination? Mentee 2023-06-23, 00:20: The exprience that Dr.Caron went throught was awful and unfortunate.I think most people once in their life felt racism or a mean comments and it's just something that we can't control. why i think it took so long fro the sugeon to apolagize was becasue of his pride. He proably knew that he said something wrong but he felt like he was going to lose something. I think it makes it hard for some people to admit their mistake becasue of their ego and the fear of damaging your confindence. Also i think it makes it harder for someone to apolozise when we do things that are hurtful and discriminatory becasue it makes the situation more akward. Mentor 2023-06-24, 21:48: Nice defintiions, I really like the one about insitutional racism about ""people with power"" which is usually people in majority ethnic groups. I have seen some real world scenarious of people trying to get rid of discrimination a couple times, but I think the most important one was names being covered up sometimes for job applications. This helped a lot with keeping names, which usually tip off ethinicity and cultural background, a secret which meant that any implicit racism or discrimination against certain people could not happen because the employer only saw your age and resume. I totally agree with your point about the surgeon not apoligizing due to pride, which unfortunatley happens alot when people make mistakes. They usually know they are wrong but cannot swallow their ego enough to apologize, or like you side, don't want to confront the awkward situation."

Mentor 2023-04-27, 14:21: Hi Riley, Wellbeing and self care are the most important skills you can have when living independently. You will encounter stressful situations as you leave your home for school or work and therefore need to ensure your mental health and wellbeing is going well. They teach you wellbeing so that you can learn to stay positive as well as cope with a stressful lifestyle. The way to maintain your wellbeing is through self care. Self care can be as simple as drinking water and getting sleep to as complicated as choosing activities that can help you calm down or unwind. As you read above, self care is basically anything that keeps you healthy and/or happy which is why it is crucial to learn it.

During high school I have had experience to learn to communicate because that's how you can get help and it's the way to learn . I have responsibility because I learned to take care of the important things in school, I'm a quick learner and have good team work if I pay attention closely to the things my teacher says and during school I learned technology in classes . 2. I would like to work with a camp site or something that pays good or short staff . I should re read my resume just in case I put to much info or not enough . I think it's a slow pace because I'd have to mowe and do everything the right way to make it perfect . 3. Have you ever been in a interview for a job ? If so how was it and how'd it go for you ? Were you nervous or anything during the interview 4. Can you tell me a story on how your first and your last interview was and which one of them was better and which one were you more confident with ? Mentor 2023-06-08, 19:35: Hi Riley, thanks for asking such great questions. 1. I agree with what you said about communication. It's super important to express an confusion you might have on a subject so that your teacher can explain it t you. It is indeed very responsible to pay attention in class so you can learn as many things as possible. 2. I agree with re-reading. The more you edit it the better it will get. I see your point with the slow pace. Moving away can be hard so doing it perfectly can take some time to plan. 3. I have been interviewed for lots of jobs! I think I've had 5 jobs now! And, I was nervous every single time. My first one was defintely the scariest because I had no idea what to expect and did not know how to make myself seem like a good candidate. It's usually very intimidating but overall it always goes smoothly. You have to remember, the employer wants you too, that;s why they interview you. So, if you be respectful and understand the job they have for you, they will definitely consider hiring you. 4. My first interview was at a clothing story right after I graduated high school. It was super scary because it was my first job. However, thos interview wasn't like many others. This is because it was a group interview. The store was hiring a bunch of people and so the interviewed us all at the same time. We all took turns answering questions and sharing facts about ourselves. Being in a group definitely made the experience a lot easier and less intimidating. I have also had many solo interviews after that. Most recently, I started working at a speech clinic where I was interviewed in person by myself. It is always nervous when you go in but you soon learn to get comfortable with the employers. My last interview was definitely better than my very first one. The people and talking skills I have developed over the years helped me out a lot. I always prioritize confidence and respect when I am in an interview. Sometimes making a joke can help ease the tension as well. I also research the company I am applying for so they see that I know what I am talking about and also know about their company. So, overall, it's always scary the first time, but it gets easier and easier, just remember to be confident but also respectful.",,"Mentor 2023-04-24, 13:30: Hi Riley, I've unlocked the Confronting Discrimination set for you now.

I recently graduated with a degree in English Literature and Language at UBC but I'm back for accounting. I see on your profile that you like creative writing as well! Do you also write poems in your spare time? As for music, I took piano for a bit and played the flute for about a year. Wouldn't say I remember anything though. I'm old now :L Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be more than happy to answer!! Some other things about meee - I eat a ton of Korean food. It has to be my favourite though I'm usually pretty open to trying new things. I tried beef tartar with my friends and, surprisingly, it was quite good. My friends aren't that open to ""interesting"" foods but how about you? Weirdest thing you've ever had or want to try? A quote that I really like is from J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be"". I think it's important to remember that our fate is within our hands. As we grow, it's up to us to make the decisions best for us. Culturally, I was born in a household where emotions were seen as a weakness and, looking at this quote, I know that I'm not bound by my birth. Or, at least, that's my take on it. What do you think?

Working out, waking up and sleeping early, eating healthy foods might seem like extra work, but it makes you feel better in the long run. There are plenty of mental health resources around you, if you look for it. If the school counsellors are not your favourite choice, there are plenty of online annonymous counselling services available if you just search for it. You will be responsible for a lot more than you are right now, in terms of doing your laundry, buying groceries, paying taxes, and handling documents. In addition, the difficulty of your studies will be uncomparable to secondary school. You will have more freedom, but responsibilities as well.

Mentor 2023-03-17, 00:50: Oh okay gotcha. Were you able to get a chance to look at the well-being and self-care activity? Let me know your thoughts on this activity! :) One big thing I learned throughout my 3 years at university was that cutting out healthy eating and working out because I was busy with exams did more harm than good. The reality is that you are never going to be 100% productive no matter how much time you have. You will have to take breaks at some point. But what you choose to do during those breaks is crucial. I spent my first year always on my phone, I would plan to take a break for just a few minutes but it would sometimes turn into an hour or more, and I would feel no better than when I started. Instead, planning out more fulfilling breaks like going to the gym or cooking a yummy meal actually helped me feel rejuvenated and more motivated to study. Overall, my mental health has significantly improved since then. If you’re not into going to the gym, you could also go for a quick walk outside, or even up and down the stairs in your building (if you have stairs) Mentee 2023-04-17, 11:08: Okay so I'm so sorry but I have such a hard time focusing in the class I am in.

Mentor 2023-04-26, 21:46: Hi Kaylayla, I am so sorry for the late reply, I just finished a brutal round of final exams! How are you doing? To answer your question, I wouldn't necessarily say you'll develop any mental health disorders while in university, but burnout is quite common (something I'm experiencing right now). There'll be periods of time in which you're super busy with exams, work, and other commitments, and it may start to feel like it is dragging on forever. I think when this happens it is important to still make a plan to take time for yourself, like for example after an exam going out for ice cream with friends to de-stress before starting to work on something new. You can't be productive 100% of the time and that's ok, you shouldn't beat yourself up over it. Were you able to make any more progress on the modules? It might help to wear headphones in class to reduce the distractions. That is another reality of university, lots of the time you'll be studying in places that are quite distracting (unless you go to the silent area of a library), so it is good to learn how to block out the distractions Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:00: Self care action: - Clean my room more - Eat better - Get more exercise How I will make it part of my life: - Pick a day to clean my room every week - Incorporate more fruits and veggies in my meals - Take my dog for a walk every day after school",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-09, 22:20: Hi Kaylayla!

My plans after my undergrad are either to go to med school to become a doctor or possibly to take another degree in computer science! Basically I'm not totally sure yet what I want to do, and that's okay, lots of people don't have it figured out yet, even at my age. I'm here to support you in your transition from high school into the next stage in your life, because it can definitely be kinda scary. I see that you're into art! I used to do art in high school too, I did all sorts of different mediums but my favourite was oil paint, and I really liked painting landscapes, especially mountains. I still have some of my old paintings hanging in my apartment. What's your favourite medium? What do you like to paint the most? I'd love to see some of your work! In terms of your career goals, I can definitely help you out with applying to university, moving away from home, and figuring out funding from your band.

Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:20: Hello Jasminka! So nice to meet you! I'm sorry I took so long to get back to you I haven't figured out until now no how this e mentoring works. I've just been working on other assignments in class. I'm not great at using computers hahaha. Wow that's really cool you seem like you are really smart going into neuroscience! My favourite medium is definitely acrylic painting:) I love painting landscapes too. I usually paint anything nature related. Awesome I'm glad I have you to guide me in the struggles I am currently having!! Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:24: Maybe we can do the well being and self care first..? Mentor 2023-03-08, 21:59: I totally get that haha computers can definitely be frustrating at times. This program is a bit confusing so it definitely takes some getting used to. That’s so cool you like painting landscapes too! What was your last painting of? I'll go ahead and get us started on the well-being and self-care module then! Also what days are you working on this stuff in class? Or is it just any day you have time? Mentee 2023-05-11, 12:39: it's okay exams suck. I only finished what I sent you. Yes I understand that distractions are something I'm going to have to overcome. And also no headphones. I've just been following directions and now I will do the next step of the self care. Mentee 2023-06-02, 11:18: Heyyy Yes I think practicing potential questions is a good idea. Oh my gosh that sounds so stressful. I was so nervous at my first job interview and equally nervous the second time. I think the trick is to try to stay calm and collected, and take deep breaths. Also like you said, to take my time to think before answering a question so I can give an answer to the best of my ability.",,,"Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:09: I would like to start the getting hired section on the wheel if that's okay with you. Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:23: Discussion questions: Transferrable skills and your first resume Communication - When I am unsure of how to do something in school, I communicate that to my teacher Responsibility: - At school, I do as I am told to by teachers and try my best to be a good role model for the younger students Quick Learner: - I can follow instructions very well and don't find myself needing contant help all the time for my school work. Team work: - I get along with all of my peers and don't have any conflict with people. I am very friendly and enjoy working with others Technology: - I use technology all the time at school for assignments and things like this (e mentoring) The technology incudes laptops, computers, and my phone, I also had a job once as a web designer. I worked online a lot and learned how to edit a website for the company. Mentor 2023-05-12, 14:36: Hi Kaylayla, My responses may be a bit sporadic and at odd times right now as I am in Iceland taking a UBC Go Global course on sustainability (which I must say is an excellent opportunity for you when you reach 3rd year at UBC, there is even a scholarship to cover the costs of the program for Indigenous students)! In terms of your resume, I would avoid generalities. For example, saying that when you are unsure of something you ask your teacher. It might be better to mention something in terms of group projects or team sports, or if you're part of a club, and then to describe how what you do makes you an effective communicator. Be specific. Maybe you check in regularly with the group to see where everyone is at with the project, or maybe you tell your teammates when something isn't working. I like how you mentioned working as a web designer. I think this could be expanded on, maybe mention some specific skills it gave you. Mentee 2023-05-16, 08:53: Wow Iceland that is really cool. Thank you for the advice, I will update my resume with more specific examples. Mentee 2023-05-16, 09:27: -Discussion Questions- If you have had a job interview before, how'd it go? What did you do well, what could you have done better? I have had a job a job interview before. It went pretty well overall, but I was so nervous. I was good at taking time to think about my answers when I was asked questions, and I dressed professionally in work appropriate clothes. To do better, I could've acted more confident instead of nervous. Can you please tell me a story about a memorable job interview, good or bad? Mentor 2023-05-19, 13:15: Hi Kaylayla, Job interviews are definitely stressful! I think my best advice would be to just practice beforehand as much as possible. You certainly will not be able to anticipate all of the questions they will ask you, but you can get a feel for the type of questions they typically ask in interviews and try to formulate appropriate responses to them on paper, or even better, with a friend or family member. I remember my very first interview the clearest, probably because it was so bad. I did not practice beforehand because I thought, what's the point, they won't ask the exact questions I find online, so I won't be any more prepared (newsflash: I definitely could've been more prepared). To make matters worse, I didn't know where exactly in the store to go (it was Costco) for the interview, which I should've clarified beforehand, so I literally just told the first person I saw that I was there for an interview and then thought that they would tell the manager I was there. They didn't come back and it was taking a while so I told another person. They finally came back and told me to wait in the breakroom. That also stressed me out because there were so many people moving around in there, having lunch, and I felt awkward because I thought ""they must be wondering why I'm here, I'm so out of place here"". I had a lot of time to ruminate as it ended up taking an hour before the manager finally came to get me, and I'm pretty sure it turned out that he didn't even know I was there for so long, so there was some lack of communication there. By this point I was so stressed that during the interview I had a really hard time thinking of responses, and one of my biggest mistakes was that I tried to respond to their questions quickly, but I ended up just rambling on about things that weren't even completely relevant. I should have taken time to respond. Now I know that I can ask them to repeat the question if I feel like I need more time to think, or take a sip of water to buy some time, or even just let a moment of silence slide while I think (they'll appreciate that more than my rambling).",,"Mentee 2023-06-02, 11:21: I hope it's okay with you but I'm going to start the confronting discrimination section now. Mentee 2023-06-02, 11:27: Think about if you have ever been discriminated against: I haven't really been discriminated against personally, but my mom has. Every once in a while there is a worker that just stares at us and follows us around stores. We believe this to be racially motivated. Mentor 2023-06-05, 16:42: Hi Kaylayla, I'm sorry to hear that, it does sound like it could be racially motivated. Sometimes stereotypes really get in the way of just seeing people as people, without judgement. I think people hear a lot about reserves in the media and it can form negative generalizations about Indigenous people. I've definitely heard comments from people being mad about their tax dollars going to Indigenous people, and I'm just there shaking my head like how can you be so ignorant. I think it's harder in smaller towns where there is less diversity, but at UBC there's people from all walks of life, all different backgrounds and races and cultures, so I'd say there's less discrimination, but it can also make it harder to find your community. Luckily there's the longhouse lunches every Tuesday you can meet other Indigenous people at!"

When youre studying the land The turtle/tuth is one of the Seven Teachings that I have trouble living by. I think my life is a lie and I find it easy to lie. Did you know about the Seven Teachings when you were going through secondary and post secondary school? Have these teachings helped you succeed? Ill be back to finish this. Mentee 2023-06-02, 10:22: Hi Zee When living on the land you become familiar with it because you need to survive. There is a connection. When you're studying the land the connections not the same. The turtle/tuth is one of the Seven Teachings that I have trouble living by. I think my life is a lie and I find it easy to lie. Did you know about the Seven Teachings when you were going through secondary and post secondary school? Have these teachings helped you succeed? Bye Jayden Mentor 2023-06-03, 18:18: Hi Jayden, I found it really easy to lie when I was in high school too. I think I lied because I was uncomfortable with myself and my identity, and that the only way others would like me was if I lied. Is it similar for you? (only if you're comfortable sharing) I did not know about the Seven Teachings until this module, actually, I think I'll read more about them. To this day I have a lot of trouble with courage/the bear. I feel like I live a lot of my life like a scared cat with its fur sticking up, but I think that's because I had a very rough period in my life a few years ago. Every day I'm learning to be calmer and most of all braver. Do you have to do the extension activity? Until next time, Zee",,"Mentee 2023-06-06, 13:25: Hi Zee Some warning signs I have when I may need some self care are, irritability (I may become argumentative). Some things I enjoy are eating, pokemon, gardening, greek mythology and video games. What do you do to get out a funk? jayden bye Mentor 2023-06-07, 14:25: Hi Jayden, I get pretty irritable and argumentive when I need some self-care too! I get out of a funk by taking a nap, making sure that I've been sleeping or eating enough (usually that's the problem), or watching a bunch of silly YouTube videos (SovietWomble is one of my favorites). Sometimes what also helps is talking to a friend or family member and getting a different point of view. Journaling also helps me. What about you? Until next time, Zee Mentee 2023-06-09, 09:41: Hi Zee 3 self care actions i can work on are do more gardening, learn more about greek mythology and get more sleep. I can make these actions part of my life. whenb i get home from school on mondays &amp; thursdays i will garden for 20 mis. i will take Greek Mythology books out of the library &amp; i wiil read at bedtime. i can set an alamr to remid me to put my book down and yo to sleep. Do you have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? I used to eat fast food a lot at lunch time. thanks jayden Mentor 2023-06-11, 19:36: Hi Jayden, Great actions! Good luck. Also, are you super interested in greek mythology? I am too, the stories are interesting. I try to ease out of a bad habit by replacing it with a good habit, or trying my best to change the environment. For example a bad habit of mine is eating junk food. What helps is choosing something healthier, or making sure there's no junk food in the house. Do you have to do the extension activity? Until next time, Zee",,,,,"Mentor 2023-03-16, 16:31: Hi Jayden, That's alright. Hopefully by the end of this program you'll have a better idea of what you want to do, even if it's just a small idea. I just watched the first two videos in Career Exploration (to get there, press on it in the big circle at the top of the page) and I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about it. Did you realize something new about what might shape your own career choices? How might these realizations change your career goals? I don't think I realized anything new (because I've put a lot in energy in thinking about my career choices, especially because I've switched majors a few times) but I did realize how my values contrast with theirs. After living a few years in a rural community, I'm much happier living in a city because there's a lot more that's accessible to me, and that's why my career goals (becoming a designer) allows me to live in a major city. What about you? Zee Mentee 2023-04-26, 10:19: Hi Zee, My values include being alone. I like to grow plants and see the things I plant grow. I don't like being outside much though. I kind of like the city, but I don't like being around a lot of people. We had an Ivy plant that wrapped around a tree at our house. It wasn't healthy so I clipped a part of it and planted it in a pot. It rooted and now it has 3 new leaves. I like doing this kind of thing. I like watching 'The Last of Us'. I've only seen the last episode, but I want to watch the others. Did you start watching it yet? I can contribut to my community by picking up wrotten fruit. This would clean up my town and help with my compose. A career that I think I'd like is growing fruit, veggies and plants and selling them in local businesses and markets. Do you have an idea for a career that works for my values? How did your values help you find a career that you like? Jayden Mentor 2023-04-30, 00:36: Hi Jayden, I'm very sorry I almost missed your message and that it took me a bit to reply! I haven't seen The Last of Us yet, I've been busy with family recently. I still really want to watch it though! No spoilers. You sound like you have a real skill for nurturing plants; That doesn't come easy to most people. Maybe a career in argriculture could be interesting to you — whether that's a farmer, a plant scientist, an environmental engineer and so on. There are a lot of places you could take that career, whether that's managing a farm, or working in the government (Ministry of Agriculture and Food). I feel like this overlaps with gardening as well, which can range from jobs like being in charge of running an urban garden, or becoming a horticulturist! I understand your value of being alone... I was a lot like that at your age too. In most (if not all) of these jobs, you'll be interacting with people, but how many people and how often would depend on the environment. My values include creativity, communication, and balance. I chose a design degree because it sit under these values quite nicely. Balance is still a thing I'm trying to learn actually — I care a lot about being to able to focus on both my work/academics and life responsibilites. I'm looking forward to your thoughts about Anchor Text 2. Zee Mentee 2023-05-11, 13:14: Hi Zee it's ok that you almost missed my message did you ever consider a different career? what are some things that you wish you new? next time spoilers bye Zee Mentor 2023-05-14, 22:46: Hi Jayden, I did consider a few different careers actually. Before my design degree I was in computer science for a bit, because I liked the idea of being a software engineer. And before that I was in a Bachelor of Engineering. Both weren't the best match for me... sure I enjoyed math and science subjects in high school but the idea of being a software engineer as a career kind of really depressed me, so I took time off school to reevaluate and ended up choosing design. I guess that kind of answers your next question too... I wish I knew that my career interests didn't have to reflect my high school interests. I was also dealing with a lot of parental pressure and that took a lot of boundary setting with my parents. I also wish I knew it was okay to start at a smaller university first, rather than jump straight into a big university. Coming from Port Hardy, I floundered at UVic. In my experience smaller universities are more supportive... you're not just a number to them. Now that we're nearing the end of this module, what are some things that've stuck with you? I'm very curious to know! Zee Mentee 2023-05-16, 09:21: Hi Zee a couple of the quizes I took in the Career Exploration madule suggested a few jobs Im not interested, like a physiotherapist. One suggestion was horticulturist/agriculturist though, and I would like that I think. i like see the plants and food grow in our garden. I like food and I like eating the food we grow. Working as a horticulturist would give me a work life balance because growing plants doesn't feel like work. Also I can do my own thing while my plants are growing. Job security would be good because everybody needs fruit and vegtibles. I could start my own company, work on a farm or be a plant scientist. There are different pay depending on the job. A basic a horticulturist makes $41,000/year. I think this is good enough money to get by with my lifestyle. Most of canada is resonible for planting. I could live anywhere as long as it's not too cold. guess what? chicken butt. jayden Mentor 2023-05-19, 22:11: Hi Jayden, All makes sense! Are you ready to move on to the next conversation (and if so, which one), or is there anything else you'd like to discuss? Zee",,,"Mentor 2023-02-10, 05:58: Hi, Jayden! How are you? I'm Zee! I'm a 2nd year student at Vancouver Island University in the Bachelor of Design program. Before I was here, I was studying computer science, and before that, engineering at the University of Victoria for a bit. I'm from a rural background too — I graduated from Port Hardy Secondary School, which is all the way at the very north tip of Vancouver Island. I'm hoping to work in the tech industry after grad. Probably something that's web-related because I love that kind of stuff. Outside of school stuff, I enjoy writing and listening to the same few songs on repeat. I'm excited to go through the program with you! I see you're interested in working in the film industry, are you a big film fan? Mentor 2023-02-14, 15:04: Hi, Jayden!

I have a hard time talking with new people. Do you have any pets now? I have five cats left. Have you watched any sci-fi shows lately? Have you written any books? If I had to pick something on the wheel, I'd like to work on career exploration next. Jayden Mentor 2023-03-13, 12:37: Hi, Jayden! I have a pet cockatiel, her name is Kooky. She's pretty cute and loves headscratches, but she also's also pretty loud because she squawks a lot. I love cats! But I never got to have one because we moved around a lot when I was younger (and now we have a parrot + cats don't mix with birds). I've been watching the new season of The Mandalorian, and I've been wanting to watch The Last of Us because I've heard it's really good. What about you, what have you been watching? I've never written any books but maybe someday... what about you? Your school asked the mentors to unlock all the conversations, so Career Exploration is open and ready to start!

If you'd like to continue the program, let me know and we can contact the eMentoring staff. If not, that's okay too. Either way, I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Zee",,,,,"Mentee 2023-06-13, 14:37: Hi Zee Implicit bias - Having judgment without realizing you're actions and attitude are expressing judgement. An example of this is being nice to one person, but rude to another because they look different. If individuals were more self aware they may realize they are bias and try to fix it. Privilage - when a dominent group has more power (simply because there are more of them) than other groups. An example of this is when a white person is at a store they sometimes get treated better adn with more respect than someone who isnt white. Microaggression - Slowly picking away/insulting someone based on them being a less dominent group. An example of this is when someone tells one person they look really good and then they tell someone from a less dominent group that they jsut look OK even if they are both wearing the same thing I will finish this email later. I ran out of time. Jayden Mentee 2023-06-15, 11:32: Individual Racism - when a individual person has beliefs, or says things that are racist on purpose or without realizing it. Example: telling someone a racist joke. To minimize this people need to be nice to everyone. Make everyone feel special. Institutional Racism - When big institutions are treating the white people better or make it easier for them to get things. Also when they make it harder for coloured groups to have access to things. Example: Red lining. To minimize Institutional racism we can protest the government and higher institutes that have racist policies. What have you seen in the real world that has helped against discrimination? Do you have any tips on how someone can check your own privilage? Section 2 I think it took the surgeon a long time to apologize because he didnt want to admit that he was in the wrong. It is difficutl to admit your mistakes when the mistake was harmfull because you feel guilty and a bit ashamed. What would your answer be to this? bye jayden Mentor 2023-06-15, 23:03: Hi Jayden, Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I'll be honest, my answer to that question depends on the day you ask me. On one hand, I see that we've made a lot of progress in the last 20 years (for example, there's a lot more inclusivity these days which is very nice... I wish there were brown dolls that looked like me when I was little). But on the other, I feel like sometimes we're sliding away from the progress we've made (slow increasing anti-tolerance against different groups of people). I hope the effects of discrimination in the real world (and online) continue to fade as we continue making progress, but it gets exhausting sometimes. I speak all of this as a brown, immigrant (naturalized Canadian citizen), Muslim woman in Canada. I think checking your privilege means being aware, doing your own homework (you can't expect someone to explain to you how to do better), and using your privilege in ways that benefit groups that may not have as much power. Like how there's a lot of straight allies for LGBTQ+ folks. What do you think? Have you seen anything in the real world that has helped against discrimination? Section 2 I think you're right. I'm glad awareness, reflection, and maybe a little bit of guilt made him apologize to Nadine Caron. It is difficult to apologize when an action you did was embarrassing. Do you have to do the extension activity? Zee"

They all sound like wholesome activities, either on your own or with other people! I also like to cook and go on walks as well. When I'm feeling low, I typically give myself a nice rest to do nothing at all for a bit. This includes taking a nap, taking a warm bath, and going on social media to ""doom scroll"" for a while. I think the most important thing to remind yourself is that it's okay to take a break and you don't have to work hard all the time. After you recharge from the break, you can return and try again at work. I also really like to eat sweet things such as eating cake - I find that this usually improves my mood!

Do you have any advice on how to get out of a funk? What are things you do when you are feeling low? The 'well being and self care' activity asked me to share a few self care actions. One thing I enjoy doing is making food. I can do more of this by looking up a new recipe every month and practice making it for my brother and I. Another slef care action I can do is to hang out with people who have similar interests as I do. To do this I might call the local Art place in my town and see if they have classes for my age group. The third action plan I have is to spend more time outsiede. I will make sre I go for a walk or even sit outside for a bit every Tuesday and Saturday.

Best, Emily",,,,,"Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:33: Hi Emily I accidently deleted the last email you sent. Are you able to send it to me again? Discussion #1 I opened confronting discriminatan module. Have you seen someone be discriminated against? How did it make you feel? I looked at the Racia Equity dictionary. In my own words I think Privilege is when someone has power just because they are part of a dominent group. I think implicit bias is when someone has negative opinions toward a group or race, but they are not aware they express these negative opinions. Discussion #2 I watched the Confronting Discrimination video. Dr. caron seemed sad by the surgeons hurtful comment. I think it was brave of her to respond the way she did. She let him know that his comment hurt her and was personal. I was surprised that the other surgeons lef tthe table. They were sticking by Dr. Caron's side. If I was in her position I don't think I would say anything, but I would get up a leave. what would you do from Hailey Mentor 2023-03-08, 12:12: Hi Hailey, Thanks for starting the Confronting Discrimination discussion! You can find my reply to your previous comment in the Well Being and Self Care module. Discussion #1 I think your definitions of ""Privilege"" and ""Implicit Bias"" are correct. I have seen some cases of discrimination in the hospital setting, where I work. I've seen patients being treated differently by care staff due to their ethnic or cultural backgrounds. Discrimination is not always obvious, but it can be subtle things such as different tones of voice or non-verbal behaviors. Discussion #2 I think I would also do what you would do - get up and leave. Sometimes, I think it's difficult to confront another person and react immediately to a situation like this. The best action to take make be removing yourself from the situation, reflect on the situation yourself or with someone you trust, and then react. Thanks for your thoughtful answers, Hailey! Feel free to start another module."

For the entertainment point maybe a voice actor, live streamer or music artist For the service point maybe a mechanic, chef, geek squad or a electrician sorry for the info dump =) Mentor 2023-04-19, 20:07: Hey Garrison, I've survived the info dump :) I could see you doing both of these things- the ""entertainment point"" and the ""service point"". Geek squad is great &amp; has saved me a few times. I did some looking into the electrical pathway for you. BCIT has a great program for this called Electrical Foundation:https://www.bcit.ca/programs/electrical-foundation-certificate-full-time-1780cert/#overview One of the campuses is in Langley. The electricians I've known really enjoy it. They often have the opportunity to work for themselves, and have a good work-life balance while earning a very steady income. I checked out some of the scholarships for entering the program; there are 7 of the offered through BCIT ranging from $2000-5000. Most of these are determined based off of grades. Tuition from the program I've linked is $4100; some of this could be covered by Student Aid BC. I've often been told, and have come to learn that the best investment to make is investing in yourself. What's your biggest fear when it comes to exploring careers?",,,"Mentor 2023-02-11, 22:11: Hey Garrison, Happy we got matched up together! I rarely get matched with someone interested in engineering so I'm excited about this one. I went through engineering at UBC and now work in software/ R&amp;D at Kardium. Hopefully I'll be able to answer some questions about career paths and Engineering in general. A bit about me: I like to ski &amp; do watersports. The only FPS game I've ever played was halo trial on my PC, thought I did get pretty good at it... I wasn't sure what I wanted to study coming out of hight school. Ultimately I chose Biomedical Engineering because it's a broad field. Is there anything in particular you want to get out of the mentorship program? Eric Mentee 2023-02-21, 13:50: Hi Eric, I'm sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you, but here is my response: I'm also enthused that we were matched. I saw that in your bio under hobbies you put ""eating bagels"" and that was a wonderful bit of info. Anyways, I have no current plans for postsecondary so I'm kind of excited to think about that stuff with someone who shares some of my interests. I've played halo as well, I think I did pretty good too, since I've played all the campaigns except infinite. I don't really know what I want to get out of this mentoring program because I don't know what it has to offer. Garrison Mentor 2023-02-24, 21:01: Hey Garrison, I just drove through hop on Monday- man was it ever raining hard! My wipers couldn't go fast enough. As for what the mentorship program has to offer: We'll end up working through a few things called ""conversations"". Each conversation has a couple prompts to kick off the conversation. I've been asked to open them all at once · Getting Hired · Well-Being and Self-Care · Confronting Discrimination · Career Exploration · One Conversation of their choice I'll open all of these up- pick a conversation you would like to start with &amp; let me know! Eric Mentor 2023-03-04, 16:51: Hey Garrison, There also a video chat session this Tuesday from 5-7 pm. I'll be there hanging out- come by &amp; we can chat if you have time! It's on gathertown.

Another development in stuff is I got accepted into a welding program that is hosted by TRU (Thomson River University) it goes from August to February so yeah Mentor 2023-06-01, 22:13: Hey Garrison, Are you interested being a software engineer/ would like to hear more about it? It's what I do now. I develop software for mapping the inside of the heart. Mentee 2023-06-09, 09:15: hey Eric I am pretty interested in being a software engineer, it was one of the things that I was most suited for. If you would like to tell me a bit about it, that would be great. Mentor 2023-06-12, 21:09: Hey Garrison, Sure thing! Software engineering is a pretty broad space. There's two main kinds of roles that often get lumped into ""software engineering"" One is an actual software developer. Think of this as making some kind of product for a client. This could be anything from design a computer game to making a web or mobile application. As a developer, you take in a set of design criteria and then output the finished product. You can be pretty creative in how you go about solving a problem, but the inputs &amp; outputs of your work are, in a sense, somewhat fixed. Software development has the most jobs associated with it. That being said, it's still a competitive field, and just having a certificate or degree won't guarantee a job. You'll have to put in work to develop your own portfolio of projects to show off to potential employers. The work-life balance is quite good, and there's a good chance you will be able to do remote work. As a developer gets older, they'll usually start to do less coding, and more management of their team. A lot of people say you don't need a degree to become a software developer. I'd argue the field is getting more competitive now, and it would be harder to gain traction without one. Regardless, only having a set of online certificates puts all your eggs in one basket. If things don't pan out, or you change your mind, those certificates will mean much less in other lines of work. With a degree / diploma related to software, that's not necessarily the case. Another kind of software role is a data analyst / scientist. Here, the emphasis is less on the code you write and more on the thinking behind your actions. People in these roles are generally curious, suspicious, and like diving into the details. A data analyst looks at existing data, usually to improve some kind of process. You analyze some kind of complicate situation, distill it down into sweet looking graphs, and then present your recommendations. You might be working to make a business more efficient, or to crunch the latest COVID case numbers, or for an intelligence agency. Who knows! The possibilities are again pretty broad. Being a data analyst is nice because you have the opportunity to get involved with a field you are interested in. A data scientist usually won't have a background in straight software. Often, they will come from a different field, and have also learned to code. Examples are math and engineering and some fields of science. Often a data scientist will have a graduate degree. These roles are more open-ended- the tasks are less defined, and the solutions are often unclear. Here you are pushing boundaries, developing new algorithms and new ways to look at and capture data. For myself, this involves trying to answer questions like how to classify different kinds of heartbeats / rhythms, or how track devices inside the body. Some data scientists look at DNA &amp; ways to design new drugs. Hope this helps! Which of the three interests you most? Developer, data analyst or data scientist? Mentee 2023-06-15, 11:35: hey Eric I think I would like to be a developer but that could be because i've wanted to make a small game for a while now. I also know that GPT-4 can now do most of it for you so, it might be a little difficult to get a job Mentor 2023-06-18, 19:42: Hey Garrison, Try not to worry too much about GPT. Developer are still needed to piece things together and test code, I don't see them being replaced anytime soon. Making ""working"" software is easy. Making robust, good software that doesn't have bugs or crash is a hard thing to do. That will need humans for quite some time.. What's the next topic you want to start?",,,,,

Mentor 2023-04-17, 11:50: Hi Gaige! It's great to hear from you - when I was in high school I was constantly sleep deprived as well, so I completely understand being low energy sometimes. My sister was low-iron as well, which made her tired and lethargic, but she started taking iron supplements and vitimans and it helped a lot! Having engaging hobbies and interests like gaming, drawing, and swimming are awesome! To answer your question, exercise is 100% something that has helped me regulate my mental health and have a consistent outlook on life. Being a part of a sports team, for me I am a part of a racing cycling team in Vancouver, is also awesome, because it allows you to connect with people who share your interest, even if it's just at a recreational level and not an ""elite"" level. I also play the piano, usually an hour a day at least, because it's one of the things in my life that gets me to use the creative part of my brain. Now that we've completed this module, you can choose any other open module to continue with when you're ready!

Mentor 2023-06-05, 11:05: Hi Gaige, Its great to hear that you are interested in a career that lends itself to the arts, I admire some people's knack for creativity and creation. To answer your question, as I see myself more academically inclined, I see myself continuing with school for a while. Right now I'm studying for the MCAT for medical school, but that's a long process. If I could tell my highschool self anything about choosing a career path, it would be to not rush into anything, and to really take the time to think about what YOU want, instead of what your parents or what society may think is best. -Mackenzie Mentee 2023-06-08, 09:57: Manual Dexterity: Heavy equipment operator, 23-25 dollars an hour, Halifax.

ASK: How did you choose their career? Mentor 2023-06-09, 09:14: Hi Gaige! Interesting to hear about your future career interests, it seems like your true passion is along the lines of being a chef. I think, unlike you might worry, that it can offer lots of stability and you can likely work your way up to making enough money for youself to be comfortable and happy. I think if you are passionate about it, that's the main thing that matters. To answer your question, for me, I am still very uncertain about what career I want to settle on - but I am making sure that whatever it is, I am leaving all my options open and trying to choose the best thing for me. And you should keep that in mind for yourself! Try not to be self disparaging, because you can achieve anything that you believe in and that you work for. -Mackenzie Mentee 2023-06-13, 14:19: THINK: - To do what you enjoy, I also do that :() - Not really :( SHARE: - I value my friends and family - create entertainment - film makeing ASK: - How have your values informed your career?

Getting hired on the spot can be a stressful type of interview, so that's great that you excelled at that. My first job interview was similar to yours, I had an on the spot interview for a restaurant on the beach in Vancouver, and was hired immediately, which was very scary but good!

SHARE: I think it might of been hard for the surgion to apologize because onceyou realize your wrong it can be hard to admit it. ASK: what is your answer Mentor 2023-05-16, 23:38: Hi Gaige, When it comes to the video above, I agree that lots of the time, people may be unwilling to apologize or admit their wrong-doing because they don't want to dammage their ego. I think that being able to understand where we've gone wrong, where we're privileged, and etc. is an important step to understanding our wrong-doings or being able to apologize to others. In terms of checking my priviledge, I think some good tips are to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and to ask yourself if you're really capable of understanding the struggles they go through. Additionally, educating yourself on things such as critical race theory and other themes to do with racism and descrimination, as well as other types of descrimination, is the best way that I've gotten to be able to assess my priviledge."

What makes it difficult to admit our mistakes? Is it especially hard to admit when we do things that are hurtful and discriminatory? I think it took the surgeon so long to apologize because he knew what he had said was hurtful and discriminatory. He knew that an apology that day wouldn’t have meant anything and that he needed to think on why what he said was so hurtful and why he shouldn’t have said it. It’s hard to admit mistakes because no one ever wants to be wrong. It can be embarrassing to make mistakes and even more embarrassing to admit them especially when you know the mistake was hurtful to someone. Ignoring the problem won’t make it go away and neither will an apology but admitting your mistakes is a start. It’s important that the surgeon understood what he said was wrong especially because he’s in a place of power."

I hope watching the video allows you to reflect on when is the right time to make an apology. Switching gears here now, we will be talking about self-care and health. What aspects of life do you think you are most healthy in? Which aspects of life do you think you are most unhealthy in? For me, I think I am most healthy in terms of keeping a consistent sleep schedule. I am probably most unhealthy in terms of getting the appropriate amount of fruits and veggies over the course of the week. Let me know what you think your strengths and weaknesses are Mentee 2023-06-08, 09:07: thats a good thing to be healthy in, i am healthy in a few things including being kind to people, making lots of moniez and making lots of moniez i am unhealthy in NOT making moniez moniez moniez moniez moniez moniez Mentor 2023-06-09, 13:23: Hmm thats interesting that your strength that keeps you healthy is also your weakness. Do you have any checks and balances to ensure that making money doesnt become harmful to your health. For example do you still get enough sleep? do you still eat properly?",,,,,"Mentor 2023-02-15, 11:43: Hey Bladen, That's a great question! For me, I think what inspires me to get up in the morning is knowing and seeing the difference I can make in other peoples lives working at a pharmacy. Is there anything that inspires you? Since we are on the topic of inspiration, I opened up the career exploration converstation. I am curious to know is there any job out there that inspires you or is something that you would want to pursue? Do you have any dream jobs that you want to be in the future? Looking forward to hearing from you soon :) Mentor 2023-02-22, 23:30: Hey Bladen it's good to hear from you! It is great to hear that you have financial goals to become wealthy. Switching gears a bit here, I want you to take a look at the following 2 videos: 1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQveBSsjwz0&amp;t=70s&amp;ab_channel=UniversityofNorthernBritishColumbia 2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pqRMqLeIEw&amp;t=197s&amp;ab_channel=TheRCCbc In the 2 videos, the nurse mentions that beyond her regular work, she enjoys teaching in the indigenous community while the doctor enjoys getting out to enjoy the mountains and the clouds. The common similarity is the both the nurse and doctor enjoy and value things outside of their current work. For myself, I enjoy swimming and hiking when I am not at the pharmacy working. I do swimming and hiking because I value my health and I think it is a fun way to take advantage of what nature offers us. I am curious to know, beyond spending and earning money to become a crypto billionaire, what are some other things you currently like to do or find value in? Mentor 2023-02-28, 22:15: Hey Bladen, I will definitely check out the videos you sent to me. Keeping on the topic of careers here, I want you to explore beyond being a crypto investor as crypto can be unpredicatable.

I unfortunately did not get a spring break. did you get to do anything fun for yours such as travel or just hang out? In terms of what job you could be, I think the opportunties are endless for you as you seem to be a creative and high energy individual. Have you ever tried applying for a job that may seem suited for you? This is a great transition into our next topic of getting hired! Mentor 2023-04-06, 20:56: You mentioned there are some jobs that think are pretty cool, which ones are they? what skills or things do you think they are looking for you to have? Mentor 2023-04-12, 22:38: You raised a good point about being smart but to be more specific I went to google and took a look at a job posting to be a mechanic and I've copied and pasted what they are looking for below: • Thorough knowledge of the standard practices, methods, materials, tools and equipment used in the automotive and heavy duty mechanical trade. • Thorough knowledge of braking systems. • Ability to perform a variety of complex skilled electrical and mechanical tasks in the overhaul, repair, maintenance and adjustment of motorcycles, automotive, heavy duty equipment and marine electrical systems. Based on what they are looking for, what experiences do you think you have or are looking to get to make you a good applicant for the job? Mentor 2023-04-14, 23:12: Learning the new skills and building upon the basics your currently have is all part of the process. Another essential part of the process of getting hired is the job interview. You mentioned you currently work at McDonalds, how was the job interview for that? Mentor 2023-04-18, 12:47: That's good to hear. It's important to note that as you move up in the employment role, more and more people will be competing for one job. As a result of this, the interview becomes more important Take a look at the following video I have pasted below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-X7xPe0fWs&amp;t=71s&amp;ab_channel=Jobpostings.ca It goes over some common mistakes made in job interviews. Let me know if you have ever made any and what things you can do to improve to prevent this from happening Mentee 2023-04-25, 13:48: im literally a pro interviewer doer",,"Mentor 2023-04-27, 17:14: Being a pro-interviewer will help you go far in finding any job that you like! We're going to switch gears and transition to a new topic on confronting discimination. As a general warm-up question: Have you ever felt discminated against? How did the situation make you feel? What did you feel afterwards? This can be a very sensitive question to some so feel free to share how ever much you feel like Mentee 2023-05-02, 12:51: I do not expirence discrimintory behavior except for online trolls and https://youtu.be/puZJp-3eXoA can u rate my video thanks Mentor 2023-05-04, 15:46: Hey Bladen, its good to hear that you've never faced discrmination. I took at look at your video and it seems that you are a very skilled COD player and have great creative skills to one day be a content creator. Moving forward in our discussion on racism and discrmination, I want you to take a look at this link on words that deal with different forms of discrimination: https://www.racialequitytools.org/glossary I would like to hear how you would define/ or explain an experience of each of the following terms in your own words: •Implicit bias •Individual Racism • Institutional racism • Microaggression • Privilege So for example I would say privelage to me is having access to something that we feel is quite common but there are groups of people who do not have this same access. An example of this would be having access to fast internet. Let me know if you need help coming up with definitions for these terms Mentee 2023-05-08, 14:07: the defnition all the thingss you said are one word BAD Mentor 2023-05-09, 23:04: You're correct to an extent that the terms I asked about are pretty bad and we should prevent it from happening in our society. However, there are some differences that exist between the terms. For example, what is the difference between individual racism and institutional racism? Does the racism happen in different forms? Another example could be whats the difference between aggression and microaggression? Why do you think it is called a microagression? Mentee 2023-05-16, 09:34: Institutional racism is like when the police are more aggressive or harsh on certain ethnicities, indivdual is directed toward one person of certain ethnicity usually by a small group or singular person. yes it can happen in different forms, aggression microaggression. micro because its subtle and aggresion because its still a form of aggresion. Mentee 2023-05-16, 09:34:  Mentor 2023-05-18, 22:23: Great work! you seem to really understand the different terms and how they relate to racism. Take a look at the video link I will share below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BFnHxBcXXQ&amp;t=768s In it, an indigenous doctor mentions a racist comment made by a fellow collegue but only decides to apologize for the incident years later. The doctor mentions that she actually forgot about the incident and eventually accepts her apology. Do you think events or incidents that involve racism are easy to forget and forgive others for? Mentor 2023-05-25, 09:03: In terms of actually apologizing, do you think that the surgeon was embarassed or if he did not recognize the wrong in his ways much later one? Mentee 2023-05-30, 08:47: yeah he acknowledged that what he did was wrong which kind of excuses him from his wrong doing."

I wanted to reach out to give you a quick introduction of who I am. I am a recent graduate of the UBC Master of Kinesiology program, applying to medical school. My hobbies include staying physically active whether that is going to the gym, playing hockey, snowboarding, and playing intramurals. I moved from Vancouver to Nelson BC when I was 16 to play junior hockey, where I billeted with a local family - so I have little bit of experience with rural BC. As such, I know that it can be tricky navigating from high school in a small community to a bigger school/city - hence why I have chosen to be a mentor. Feel free to share any thought or comments Kindest regards, Branden Mentor 2023-03-03, 17:31: Hi Sam, I was wondering if you have time to attend the Meet your mentor session this coming Tuesday? I am cureently signed-up, ut no pressure at all. Thanks so much. Branden Mentor 2023-07-01, 09:34: Hi Sam, I hope the school year went well. I'm sorry we couldn't get a chance to connect. If you would like I can still post comments and discussions in the units throughout the summer and feel free to keep in touch if you need anything. I am currently in Nelson, BC wildland firefighting, which I am super excited about being back in a rural community. It is getting busy but I will be sure to check the conversation every week to see check for any messages. What are your plans for the summer? Enjoy! Branden",,,,,

My question for you is What mental health challenges should I be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can I do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? Mentor 2023-01-16, 11:17: The mental health challenges people face are different for everyone. Some common things include being away from home/family/friends, struggling to keep up with deadlines and the new workload, feeling depressed and or anxious. It's important to remember you are not alone and that there are lots of people available to support you, including a variety of university resources. I would reccomend searching up and looking at what researouces are availablbe long before you may feel you need it. There are absolutley possible mental health benefits too! Being on your own gives you the opportunity to grow and develop as an individual. This can have incredible positive impacts on mental health. University also allows you to cater to your own learning style, create your own schedule, and explore who you are as a person. All of these can have wonderful positive impacts. I hopw this was helpful! If you have any thoughts/questions please let me know. Otherwise we can move on :) Mentee 2023-01-18, 14:18: Thank you for the advice it was very helpful, within the second part of this assignment/ conversation it tells me to identify three changes that could benefit me for the future.Those would consist of fixing my sleep schedule, eating healthy, and create new goals.• What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them?

I was thinking we could start with wellbeing and self care first because ive been pretty curious to know how that aspect is going for you. Mentor 2023-01-19, 16:55: I think the biggest self care challenges are making the time to take care of your self and holding your self accountable to get support if you need it.

I went to a small, three year rural pre-medicine program before medical school. I am 22 years old, and in my second year of the UBC Vancouver Fraser Medical program. Some of my favourite things include hiking, camping, cooking, hanging out with my friends, reading, and playing guitar! Since I've moved to Vancouver, the beach has been one of my new favourite hangout spots, since it's my very first time living by the ocean. This is really lead by you (and your teacher); they may or may not have set up some conversations for us to do; you basically let me know which ones, and we can get to them! This e-mentoring thing is kind of like having an online pen pal; it's an opportunity for you to ask any and all questions that you want, and I will do my best to answer! If you wouldn't mind letting me know what you'd like to talk about, and sending me a little intro about yourself, that would be great! Thanks! Look forward to hearing from you! Kira :)",,,,,

You are welcome to contact me through MentorCity if you have any questions or would like to continue our discussion. It was lovely getting to know you.",,,,"Mentor 2022-12-12, 13:28: Hi Khang, Please let me know if you can see it now that I've opened it. Thank you! Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:02: i wanna go apply BCIT after highschool but i have some question it make me confused. can you explain it for me.so this is some question i was considered it. Is this a community you can imagine being part of?, is that school can make me how to do the jobs i want and can i do it with myself when i finished BCIT. and I am international student i`m from VietNam so how about the tuition ? is that expansive ? Mentor 2023-01-08, 15:57: Hi Khang, Sorry for the late reply! How are you doing? 1. ""Is this a community you can imagine being part of?"" I mean it truly depends on your personal preferences and values. Some may feel that BCIT is a welcoming and inclusive community that aligns with their goals and interests, while others may not feel as connected to the community. It is ultimately up to you to decide if you can envision yourself being part of the BCIT community. 2. ""that school can make me how to do the jobs I want and can I do it by myself when I finished BCIT."" It is possible that BCIT can provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform the jobs you want. However, it is also important to consider whether you have the personal motivation and dedication to apply and develop those skills on your own after completing your studies. It ultimately depends on your individual efforts and dedication to continuous learning and improving your skills. 3. ""I am an international student I`m from VietNam so how about the tuition? is that expansive?"" The tuition for BCIT varies depending on the program you are enrolled in and your status as an international student. Generally, international students can expect to pay higher tuition fees compared to domestic students. However, BCIT does offer scholarships and financial assistance options for international students to help offset the cost of tuition. It is recommended that you visit the BCIT website or contact the school directly for more specific information on tuition fees for international students.

Last year I went to college for my level one heavyduty mechanics ticket, meaning I only have 3 more years of school for that, welding is another 4, the reason I chose hd mechanics and welding is because welding is used a lot in heavy duty mechanics, meaning if im double ticketed I will be making double the money. I could never see myself working a 9-5 office job its to boring. One of the challenges im going to face is that it’s a lot of money for school aswell as a lot of time, every year for mechanics you need a cirtian amount of hours for example I need 600 hours before I can go for my level 2. The expiriance and school are just more hours and information for me, so I feel the more I work the better im getting at my job and the better im getting the more money I could make. I belive this career can be extremely beneficial as well as sucesfull. What were some of the challenges that you had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. If so, how did you overcome them? Mentee 2023-01-09, 13:11: when i was choosing a school i wanted to make sure it was a. in a place i liked and could enjoy and b. still close to family. i wanted a school known for its trades teaching as well as sports (hockey), aswell as a place that has good outdoor activitys. i decided on oc okanogan college, they are known for there trades programes aswell as having wonderful activitys outside, alot of my family lives down in the okanogan so it will be nice. what were some things you looked for while choosing a school. Mentor 2023-01-09, 16:00: Hi Kadin! Some of the challenges I faced was that I had to commute 1 hour to school every day and 1 hour back. This meant I had to let go of some extra curricular activities that I did in high school. However, as I became better at managing my time, I was able to resume all of my activities. My advice for you would be to create a schedule at the beginning of the week and create a plan of how you will complete all of your work. This really helped me manage everything. Another challenge that I faced was that all of my friends went to a school closer to home so I got to spend less time with them. I overcame this by texting them regularly and meeting them every other week on the weekend. This helped me feel like I was not missing out on anything. Can you name a few other challenges or factors that may make it hard for you to obtain your education? I see you have listed a few. Mentor 2023-01-09, 16:05: Some things I looked for when deciding the school I went to was whether it would provide me with the resources and oppurtunities that I was looking for. I always wanted to start doing research and UBC is known for its research and giving chances to undergraduate students. I also wanted to do the degree I did which was chemical biology and at the time UBC was the only school that I found that was offering this combined major. Last, I wanted the oppurtunity to meet new people from all over the world. UBC has many international students and studying here allowed me to meet many new people.

Warm regards, Nate Mentee 2023-01-25, 12:42: hey Nate! I got an email saying we can continue if wanted even though my class is almost over. i personally would love to complete more if thats alright with you. 1)Create a list of your own ‘warning signs’ that you might be in need of some self care.(Eg: low energy/mood/creativity, often tired, procrastination, irritable, etc). -low next to no energy -snappy -getting less than 5 hours of sleep every night for more than week -lower fuse -no motivation for top hobbies 2)Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy. What lifts your mood or brings you joy? -gaming -writing -youtube -aO3 -hanging with friends -planning fun events with friends or with partner Ask our mentor at least one of the following questions, or ask them your own question(s) about this topic. -Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? -How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? -What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? -What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? I'm being honest, all would be nice to know Mentor 2023-01-26, 14:43: Hi Leon, When does your class end? Of course it’s alright with me, I’d love to keep talking as well even after the class is over! I am the same way; I try to reevaluate my mood depending on my physical wellbeing. If I’m fatigued or hungry, I usually find myself with less patience and less motivation. Some other warning signs I personally look out for are things like being easily stressed by everyday issues, having a tendency to think in black or white, and making snap decisions about other people’s motivations and reasons for their actions. I also do many of the same things you do to de-stress and find my baseline again. Sometimes I will revisit things that remind me of the past, such as reconnecting with an old friend or rewatching a movie I love that I haven’t seen in a while. It helps me because it reminds me that it wasn’t always bad and it can always get better. 1) Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? - When I find myself unmotivated or feeling low, I find little things to accomplish. Getting a sense of accomplishment from things like organizing my desk, cleaning my keyboard, making my room a little cleaner or doing the dishes helps me start refilling my motivation tank. Like a snowball being rolled down a hill, it picks me up and I find myself motivated to do more, to actually tackle things that I may have been putting off because of my mood/anxiety. Other than that, there are other self-care things you can do like go on a short walk without a goal in mind or daydreaming. One thing I like to do is sing to myself, I find it very cathartic to sing (and it helps me revisit old music that I might not have listened to in a while) 2) How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? - In the past, I had a very bad time navigating the intricacies of my mental health while in post-secondary as I started being an “adult” out of high school. Honestly, it’s a really good idea to start looking at those warning signs you mentioned before and slowly asking yourself why you feel the way you feel at certain times when they come up. Whether it’s that you need to eat or drink water, that there are certain triggers that may come up in life that affect you more than you think it does or that you’re feeling overwhelmed by life/work. Mental health services is a hard resource to navigate, especially if you’re looking for more specific help on mental health issues you have. Most colleges/universities usually have a service place for things like career counselling, mental health counselling and mental health services in that area. 3) What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? - Above all else, I want to mention that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and behind at times and that you’re not alone when you feel this way. I’ve had issues in the past where I’ve isolated myself due to the amount of stress I was feeling from school and from being an “adult” and it wasn’t healthy. There’s not a lot to “prepare” because life is unpredictable, however, it’s still important to look ahead. Like I said before, it’s a really good idea to try your best to listen to your body’s physiological needs (if you need air, water, food or sleep), and adjust accordingly. Some other things to look at are things like your sleep hygiene (whether you nap, if you can sleep enough throughout the night, etc.). On the bright side of things, benefits you may find is that you have a whole new world of opportunities opened to you. Things will be exciting and new and you get to learn so much more, not only about your field but about people from all over, all different perspectives and views. It’s all small steps towards something bigger in your life, and like with everything else, stumbling isn’t mandatory but it’s definitely expected sometimes. 4) What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? - Beyond what I’ve outlined in other questions, I think a good thing to do is to imagine what good mental health means to YOU personally. What you expect yourself to feel or act like when you are maintaining your level of good mental health. What do you expect yourself to feel or act like when you’re only at an adequate level of mental health or when you find yourself slipping from the level you want to maintain. Doing a self-check once in a while is important, it allows you to catch yourself before things get too much. I always ask myself things like: “hey, am I doing okay right now (physically, mentally, emotionally)? Am I happy with the current situations in my life?”. Being mindful once a day is very useful in the long run, it allows for self-reflection and may even allow you to improve on yourself. One other thing is to find something that works for you personally. There’s a lot of material out there telling you what’s good to do to keep good mental health but there aren’t all catch-alls. People work in different ways, some are introverts or extroverts, some like to spend time with family while others need alone time. Having time to yourself (whether it’s with others or alone) is important to maintain a balance between your own life and the obligations of school/work/socials.",,,"Mentor 2022-12-07, 16:48: Hi Leon, I've opened up the Post-secondary section, let me know if there are any issues! Warm regards, Nate Mentee 2022-12-12, 13:14: okay so i just read over everything. i find it easier to answer in numbered stuff so it'll be list formed. sorry if you don't like it but its much easier to follow 1. what education do you need for BOTH careers you researched - for being a police detective i would need a bachlors in any criminology section with any major that also relates followed by acadmy training with three to most likely four years of being a standard officer. -the other career was bartending which only requires a bartending license which you'll need to be 19+ as well as being a high school grad 2. three or more reasons you would benefit from post secoundary -being able to do my personal dream job -the feeling of knowing you can do anything that you put your mind to despite the hardships -being a role modle to others who also stuggle with disapproving families it being either career choice or being LGBTQ+ -to be proof that despite everything you can be the real you one day 3. Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example: cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions. -the only thing i can think of is the gap year and the physical work ill have to do for training. 4.How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why? -for the most part im stocked. im looking forward to learning this stuff. i do however want to be detective sooner BUT im more than okay of doing the schooling and working on myself more. 5.your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? why or why not? -yes, both are and im more than happy to have my dream one being possible. ASK your mentor at least one of the following questions, or ask your own: -Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university? Mentor 2022-12-14, 15:52: Hey Leon! I think numbered lists are awesome, they make conversations through text threads like this much easier to navigate, so thank you for doing that! It's awesome to hear that you've begun thinking about what you'd like to do in the future. Have you considered bartending as a job you could do part-time while in post-secondary? The benefits you have listed are very good to hear! I like that you don't only want to reach your own goals but also inspire others to try their best as well. Are the physical requirements to be an officer very hard to reach? Is there a specific reason you want to become a detective ASAP? I went to a University as soon as I graduated highschool without knowing what I wanted to do for a career. Through a couple of complicated life circumstances, I ended up having to drop out. I had worked for a couple of years afterwards, doing jobs here and there (superstore, a bank, etc.). Then I ended up going back to school (at a college) as the COVID pandemic started which was both a good time to quit my front-facing job as well as restart my education (as we were all locked at home). The time between my education really helped cement who I was as a person, both at an individual level as well as at a career level. I think it'd be a nice experience for someone to go from a college to an university because the college classes are much smaller for 1st and 2nd year courses (from my experience), which allows for the student to connect with the professors at a deeper level. Some students might also find it easier to learn in smaller classes! Nate Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:11: hey Nate! doing numbered stuff as well keeping track of thing helps lots for me so i tend to use them lots and just glad you don't mind. im actually status as a first native, im not full but my band would pay for everything plus give me an extra 700-800 a month for going to post sec. i would also require a bartending traing which you have to be 19+ to do. the physical requirements are very hard on your person. for example you need to be able to run 3.5k in under a 45 mins as well as jump fences depending on the hight 2-5 secs. itll take four years to get my degree plus 6-8 months training with the police then an additional 4-6 years as an officer before you can go to be a dective. so anywhere between 8 and a half years to 12ish years. i also plan on wedding someone anytime after im 27 (don't wanna marry young) and at some point have a family. i wanna be able to protect and provide and i know my partner could too but i wanna feel and know i can as well. it seems like covid helped your learning and gave more chances. my whole highschool life ive had it so it did more harm than good but im glad you as well as others had some good :D i figured the collage i want to go to is closer to home so learning the weird timings would be more wanted than going too far. i do well with lesser people. i mostly just do everything in the libary since im more comfy with it. im actaully going to be doing part 2 of the assiment but i wanted to answer everything you said beforehand. Coast mountain (crim sp) 1.Prerequisite courses: these are the courses required in order to gain admission into a program or school -grade 12 english -grade 11 math (higher than workplace) -grade 11 chem -grad grad 12 (or GED) 2. Grades: many programs require you to have earned a minimum grade in certain courses. -you don't need a certain grade or higher for any, just passing is enough 3.Other requirements: like a certain number of hours working/volunteering/observing in the given field You can often find this information under “Admission Requirements” on a program’s website -no other requirements needed Mentor 2023-01-04, 19:51: Hey Leon, Fantastic to hear back from you so soon after the break ended. How was your break? I hope you had time to relax and do the things you want to do! That's interesting to hear, sorry I'm not very well-versed in what it means to be statused to be a first nations member, would you feel comfortable in sharing what that means to you? In any case, it's amazing to hear that you have your band to support you through your post-secondary education. Wow, do you like physical activities like running or sports? Have you ever tried training for long-distance running before? I'm glad you're able to share your aspirations of marriage and providing for a family with me. It does sound like a long road ahead of you but you seem to be full of passion for the career path and I personally believe that's half the battle! Do you spend a lot of time at your local/school library? How far is Coast Mountain College from your hometown? What other factors (student supports, culture, etc.) about the college catch your eye? Have you had time to look into their extracurriculars or other activities they might offer? Have you looked into any other schools other than Coast Mountain? Warm regards, Nate Mentor 2023-01-11, 18:33: Hi Leon, I'm glad you had a decent break! It's amazing to hear that you're slowly learning about your family heritage and culture. It sounds like you're finding new ways of getting your exercise! Like you said, there's no hurries and it's just nice to have a healthy avenue of exercise routinely. I can see that you've thought deeply about what you want to do after highschool and it's really nice to hear that there are accomodations that fit your needs as well as your partner's needs! It looks like we've covered most of the topic, we can wrap up this module and move on. But if you have any other questions regarding post-secondary/career planning in general, for sure we can always come back to it and talk about it! Ask your teacher what module they want us to do next!

It's great to see that we've been matched up! I'd like to do a little self-introduction for you. Currently I am finishing my bachelors in psychology honours at Douglas College! I am coming up to my last semester this coming new year, finishing up the last few classes I require and my honours thesis. I aspire to work in the helping field as a counsellor, primarily with children and family. I am keenly interested in developmental psychology and creating the best environment for future generations to grow and flourish is very important to me, whether that's through education and better resources for parents, or helping through therapy. I see that you enjoy dnd! I love playing tabletop rpgs with my friends as well, even if it's hard to get everyone together. Besides dnd, I love Pathfinder as well. I also enjoy video game ttrpgs like divinity 2 and pillars of eternity. I also love reading, though I've been finding it difficult to carve time out to read. I'm a big fan of pulp detective novels as well as fantasy books. Some notable authors I enjoy reading are Brandon Sanderson, and Ursula K. Le Guin. Besides novels, I also like mangas! I would love to hear what you've been reading recently. I'm nonbinary but only recently out. Publically, not many of my friends know and it's been a hassle figuring out how to breach that topic. I don't know much about the RCMP but I would love to explore and figure out the processes of finding a career with them with you. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. I'm an open book so don't be shy. Nate Mentee 2022-11-29, 12:34: i actually changed my mind. i still will be going to the rcmp but i desided to go to collage. im going for an associates of criminology specializtion for 2 years the a bachelors for another 2 years. i didn't know it was an option before like a little over a week ago so now i want to but worried of money but im half native so hopefully my band can pay for it or at least most???? dnd is really fun but harsh on me. being dm is lots of work and stressful but fun actually doing it. im thinking of having us doing tabletop ""can you survive"" games to help with stress. before my xbox broke i played dead by daylight, apex, like all of the resident evil games, left 4 dead 2 and some more i can't think of. ya, finding time for reading can be hard. i read on my phone of mostly A03 rewrites that are slow burns. anything feom 20k and up words. mostly 100k words and up. one im rereading is 1mil+ words. with the whole not being out is fair bc it is hella scary. i got to the point were i just gave up feeling like i had to act a role in some show. family didn't like it and aren't close to me but they never were exepct my older brother and he accepted me with open arms, thats all i cared about. some other members did too but i wasn't as close to them as i am with my brother.My advice is just go at your own speed. if you come out and they don't like it then ditch em. they don't deserve you and you don't deserve to be around others who judge on things you can't control. coming out isn't a thing you should feel like you have to but a thing you want to do. ahhh sorry if that was too far and overstepping. there's for sure things that i would like to know and if im honest i don't even know what to ask when it comes to collage or even stuff like taxes leon lightwood (p.s. i dont know if there's misspells or weird wording so sorry!) Mentor 2022-12-01, 16:02: Hi Leon, It's great to hear back from you! How was your weekend/week? It's exciting to hear that you're going to pursue an associates degree! What made you decide to start there? Yeah, dming is especially fun when you like designing and playing with storylines or even writing your own. I've never really looked at A03 fanfic stories! What genre are you reading? Are they original content or based off an existing story? That's so nice to hear that your older brother is supportive! Thank you for your kind words and advice, your perspective is refreshing to hear. Thank you for being so considerate! Feel free to ask anything, and if it does feel like an overstep, we can talk about it then. For the most part, don't be afraid to ask and I'll try my best to answer, especially things revolving around college, or even taxes! On the topic of starting the Conversations, let me know when you feel like we've adequately covered this introduction section and we can choose a Conversation to begin with! Nate Mentee 2022-12-05, 14:13: hey nate, i found out that to be an actual detective i need a bach in crim. i wanna be a homiside detective so that means 4 years in post secoundary my teacher wants to do the post secoundary and career planning section. i think you have to unlock it. also with A03 most is just fanfic that are either rewrites of something with some changes for ships to be involved or countineation of something. some have oc's in it aswell sorry if this is short, I just exited to try this stuff leon lightwood Mentee 2023-01-09, 12:47: Hey Nate, my break was alright, was mostly at a friends house or work than home so nice. I don't know that much about first nations due to growing up around non first nations from my dads side. I more recent moved to where my mum is from so still learning. i know the main drumming songs along with my crest dance for the welcome song. I used to play lots of sports till i came out as trans, didn't feel right to be on the girls team and felt unsafe on the boys so i dropped it. I recently got a gym membership and i go on morning jogs every once in a while. i have a long ways to go but i got four years to take a nice easy pace so im not too worried. I like to spend time in our school libary since it feels more safe and away than my classes. the coast mountain I'll hopefully be going to is just the next town over so close to home but far enough for me to start my life away from family. well theres a newly done library open 24 hr for students, a gym included aswell as nice dorms. it has courses that I need as well as my partners. we both plan on going there since we has very similar classes and careers. he wants to be a lawyer and his classes are almost the same as mine execpt for a couple. i have looked at other but they either are way too far or dont have the classes i need or want. warm regards, Leon Lightwood",,,,,

Looking forward to hearing about what type of training and/or school you need to go into your trade! I know nothing about the field so it will be cool to learn from you. As for nursing... when I graduated high school I actually pursued a science degree first before getting accepted into UBC Nursing. Initially, I was more interested in science but when I graduated I realized that to pursue a job in the field with a BSc I would have to move out east. I also realized that I wanted a career outside of a laboratory and wanted to work in a team with other people. Then I landed on nursing as a career and I haven't looked back since! What makes you interested in pursuing mechanics? Have a great week! Katie",,,,,"Mentor 2022-11-25, 16:01: Hi Edward! I am Katie and I will be your mentor for this program.

I'm in grade 12, and I currently have to do this program in order to complete a mark in my Careers 12 class. Not sure if you know what that is, it's a course on learning about becoming an adult, with a final project at the end. My plan for my final project is to talk about heavy duty operating. Question for you... why did you decide to go into nursing? My teacher has asked us to ask to unlock the Post Secondary conversation if possible. Thanks! Great to get to know you!",,,,,
1047586873,11/7/2022 12:10,1047588259,57206,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-12-06, 16:43: Eventhough it's a bigger workload, I find university more enjoyable since I chose what I wanted to study, vs in high school when things are more structured. I don't think anyone really feels prepared though.. I know I sure didn't! Those feelings passed once I got into the swing of things. Should we start with anchor text #1? Once you have explored your careers we can move on to the discussion questions. Based on your profile, it sounds like you already have a couple careers in mind! Mentee 2022-12-12, 12:36: How about we start on something about your path to your current post-secondary program. Have you changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did you work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Mentor 2022-12-13, 10:58: Since high school I've changed career paths more times than I can count. From fashion merchandiser, to makeup artist, to flight attendant, to pilot, to psychologist, to marketer, I've changed my mind a lot. In saying this, I didn't act on any of these interests except for being a flight attendant. I had an multi-day interview with Emirates Airline, but I didn't make it after the second day. I took 5 gap years after high school and was the only one out of my friends that didn't go to university right away. I lived in Melbourne, Australia for 2 years and in Auckland, New Zealand for 2 years. I worked as an Au Pair (like a live in nanny) for 2 different families in Melbourne and 1 family in Auckland. After my contract was up with my family in Auckland, I had the opportunity to be a dental assistant and receptionist. My work was going to sponsor me to stay in the country for another 5 years, but decided it was time to move back home to BC. During my gap years, I backpacked around Australia, New Zealand, Bali, and Europe. It's safe to say that I caught the travel bug! Apart from au pairing and dental assisting, I also worked as a server, bartender, and retail associate. During my first year of university, I was in the Bachelor of Business Administration program, but during the pandemic I realized the careers that I'd be able to get with a business degree weren't aligning with my values and my learning style. Business is a great degree and I have a lot of friends with business degrees that love it, but it just wasn't lighting my heart on fire. I realized I wanted a job that was more hands on and visual, but where I was still mentally engaged and constantly learning. I also started to miss working with patients and feeling like I was making a direct difference in their lives. For the past almost 3 years now I've wanted to become a dermatologist and although you don't need a science degree to get into medical school, I wanted to give chemistry a try since it was calculation heavy and hands on. I also thought having a cosmetic chemistry background would be beneficial for dermatology if I wanted to create my own products some day. I was interested in dermatology when I was super young, but didn't act on it because no one in my family had been to university, let alone medical school, so I thought it was out of my relm of possibilities. I won't become a dermatologist until I'm about 38, but time is going to pass anyways! Looking back at my career options, I discovered that a lot of them the goal was to make people feel confident and to fuful their potential. If you have changed your mind on career paths, it's interesting to see if you can find a link between all of them! I apologize for the lengthy post, but there you have it! My path of twists and turns to post-secondary. Mentee 2023-01-03, 12:51: I really love the very detailed response, It is quite helpful and quickly to understand! Your story help me realize that I shouldn't focus on one thing forever. I clearly have no interest in Business Administration at all, but it is the only career that my parent suggested since I couldn't think of any career that suits my interest. For the time being, I'll focus on finding a career that can help me in the future. Moving on to another question/s, What factor did you consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once you got there? Mentor 2023-01-04, 09:39: Happy New Year! I hope you had a nice holiday. I remember graduating high school and being so focussed on picking the “perfect career,” that I was too scared to actually commit to anything in fear that I’d make the wrong decision. Now, I go in with the mindset of just trying things that interest me and seeing where things go! I’ve found it quite useful in figuring out what I don’t want out of a career as well. Kinda like what my dealbreakers are. But who knows, you say you don’t have interest in business administration now, but you don’t know unless you try! Business admin opens a lot of career opportunities! You might be surprised what interests you too. If you told me 5 years ago I would be studying chemistry, I would have laughed. I totally didn’t identify as a science student before university, but now I love it! As for choosing schools, TRU was my only option. Financially it made sense since tuition is cheaper than say UBC or UVIC, and I knew I’d be able to save money living with my parents. But if I were to take those factors out of the picture, I’d look at a school with smaller class sizes. That way you have a closer relationship with your professors and it’s easier to get help and research opportunities. I know some larger schools like UBC have around 200 students per class with a TA teaching, where as my classes at TRU are around 30-40 and the professor teaches. Mentee 2023-01-09, 13:11: I forgot to say Happy New Year! and I also hope you had a nice holiday too! Choosing a career may be a hard and tough choice to make, but you're right, you won't know until you try! I'll try out business ad and see what happens from there! TRU is a very long drive from here, but I guess going to kamloops for university is the only option for some students. I haven't thought about picking a university since I'm quite stuck on choosing a career that I would take, but TRU is an option I can go. Now that I am finished discussing about this module, would you kindly please unlock the ""From rural to urban"" chapter? Mentor 2023-01-09, 18:31: Yes, TRU is a bit far! It looks like Coast Mountain College is much closer to you, so it'd be nice to be close to friends and family. Under 'Anchor Text 2' it says you're supposed to create a document with the requirements of each program you're intersted in. Do you have that for me to review? I've unlocked the 'From Rural to Urban' chapter! :)","Mentee 2022-12-05, 13:19: May I ask, how difficult was the business adminstration program that you applied to in your first year? Was it based on more projects and presentations than essays? My mom told me that it was a little bit of both based on her experience about business ad. Mentee 2022-12-05, 14:22: Oh, and Emily, the class is supposed to start with post-secondary and career planning. Can you please unlock that module? Mentor 2022-12-05, 15:25: Oh I'm sorry, I've opened up the post-secondary and career planning module! As far as difficulty for the business administration program goes, it depends on your definition of difficulty. I would say the topics aren't particularly challenging, but more so the amount of content you are learning is greater compared to in highschool. Your mom is right! It's definitely a bit of both. I had to write essays in my Intro to University Writing class, but had group work in my Intro to Business class. I'd imagine it also varies from professor to professor and institution. How are you feeling about starting college next year?",,,,"Mentor 2022-11-23, 16:54: Hi Ben! I'm Emily. Before starting university, I lived abroad for 4 years in Australia and New Zealand. Now I'm a 4th year Bachelor of Science student majoring in chemistry at Thompson Rivers University. In my first year I was in the Bachelor of Business Administration program. I see you'll be studying business too. That'll definitely be a good background to have when you start selling your art. Are you interested in opening up your own restaurant or working for someone else? I also see from your profile you like video games! Do you have any favourites? My fav is Divinity. I've spent an embarassing amount of hours playing it! Mentee 2022-11-28, 13:16: Hi Emily! It is nice to meet you! I'm looking forward to speaking with you! I see that you love playing rpg games. I'm always playing a game called Overwatch 2 as of right now on my ps console. I don't play other FPS games than Overwatch because I am completely obsessed with it. Mentor 2022-11-28, 16:28: I just watched the trailer for Overwatch 2. It looks like fun! I'll have to check it out. Now that we know a bit about eachother, why don't we get started. Is there a particular conversation you'd like to start first or would you like me to choose? Mentor 2022-12-03, 17:06: Hey Ben! I just opened the first Conversation ""Finding Inspiration"" as I don't want you to fall behind. Mentee 2022-12-06, 14:45: I'm quite not prepared to be honest, it'll be more stressful than it is now, but that's just how life works I guess. I'm just glad that I am almost finished on education and can't wait to start working.","Mentor 2023-01-17, 15:36: Hey Ben, I just got a message saying that students from your school are wrapping up this week. Would you like to continue to work through the program or be done once your class finishes? Either way, it's been great being your mentor! It's too bad we didn't have longer as it would have been great to continue through the conversations. Mentee 2023-01-25, 12:48: I'll be done. I've learned a lot from this program and from your experience and Thank you for being my mentor, Emily! I hope for the best for you in the future!

What are the most useful classes to take in highschool for education? 3. How do you manage your stress/ mental health in university? Are you able to make time to care for yourself? Pt.2 1. What schools do you recommend as a back up choice for if i do not get into my first choice of school? 2. For my school ive chosen to go to Thompson River University. Im taking the Preforming Arts and Education progam so I will be certified in drama. I can also Teach up to K-12. Are there any courses I should take while I am there? Mentor 2022-12-14, 13:25: 1. ) I didn't take a gap year, but it can be useful for some people. I depends, but people usually reccommend having a solid plan if you're going to take a gap year, like working. 2. ) The most useful classes for education that you're going to take for education will be in uni/college most likely. I'd just reccommend taking the courses that align with what you want to study in post-secondary. 3. ) One of the most important things for taking care of myself and my mental health is actually setting aside time to do so. Treat taking some time for yourself on a similar level of importance to schoolwork. Also, knowing my limits and not expecting myself to do more than that in a given day/week. Pt. 2 1.) My reccommendations would change based on what you value the most in a post-secondary institution (location, program, social life, etc.). 2.) I'd reccommend looking at the graduation requirements and courses required for those programs. If you need more courses than are required in that program for graduation, you can usually choose any courses you find interesting.

Hope you're doing well and will have a good winter break :) Mentee 2023-01-03, 12:36: The school ive chosen to go to is Thompson Rivers University, I emailed them a few months ago and they've told me what courses i take to achive my teaching goals, now for me its a matter of applying. My second choice is VIU, its the same place where my drama teacher went and she said the course was very good. Im not sure if I need a Third choice or not. I like the areas of where im thinking of going. Do you have any recommendations for me? What factors did you consider when choosing a school? I hope your Christmas was nice and relaxing :) Mentor 2023-01-05, 09:56: I'm glad that you've figured out more about where you want to go! Neither of your choices have low acceptance rates, so I wouldn't worry too much about finding a third choice, though it wouldn't hurt to have one extra backup. If you're looking for another choice, I'd consider other schools that offer theatre programs like Capilano University, or University of Victoria if you want to study on Vancouver Island. For me, I considered how close to home schools were as well as their variety/selection of courses/classes that I could take. Thanks, you too ! It was nice to have some time to relax after the semester ended :) By the way, if you don't have any more questions about this topic, you can pick a different conversation for us to work through.

I am in my third year of university, studying biology and computer science at UBC (Vancouver). I have just started my co-op program 2 months ago (which gives you the opportunity to work in the field you are studying, foreshadowing future careers). I enjoy playing sports (soccer and basketball) and listening to music. plus I am a car enthusiast. How are you finding the first 2 months of school to be? Any specific goals in mind you would like to achieve? I noticed you enjoy biking; is that road or mountain biking? What sparked your interest in auto shops? Feel free to ask me or talk to me about anything that’s on your mind. I will do my best to answer??",,,,,

That is so cool to hear about your plans, I'm glad you're following your passion and going to Okanagan College! Kelowna is an awesome place. Would you want to start the ""Different Ways of Knowing"" module now? I can get us going by discussing the first warm-up question about things I hold true. I'm a graduate student in STEM so I rely on western academia and science most of the time, but I have also been learning a lot about Indigenous cultures and Indigenous knowledge, such as Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and how this is applied to research done by scientists around BC! You may or may not feel comfortable discussing the prompts in this question, but if you wanted to say something about the different ways of knowing you know, have seen, or use, that would be great! If you want to jump right into talking about the first video that works for me too! (if you're having trouble finding the open module, I think there's a menu at the top of the page where you should be able to click on ""Different Ways of Knowing."") I really want to make this process easy for you, so feel free to answer in any way you like! Bullet points, sentences, paragraphs, poems, whatever works for you is good for me. Thanks! - Mackenzie Mentor 2023-01-03, 00:38: Hi Elijah! Whenever you have a chance to continue with the module let me know, I believe that the due date for everything is coming up, so I would hate for you to not have enough time to complete it! I totally understand you've been on vacation for the last few weeks, so have I, so no worries about that. Let me know, Mackenzie Mentor 2023-01-24, 10:52: Hi Elijah! I hope your winter break was relaxing and the start of the term has been going well! I realize from your teacher that you and your classmates are back in school, so if you have time we can get through some of these modules pretty quickly! You don't have to worry about not finishing everything, even just a little bit would help your overall grade for this course :) Let me know if you're interested in continuing, Mackenzie",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-11-17, 15:06: Hi Elijah! My name is Mackenzie and I'm your mentor! I am super excited to get to know you and work through the activities on here! I hope we can make this course fun and informative to prepare you for your awesome life after high school. If there's anything specific you want to let me know I am here to listen non-judgmentally! Mentor 2022-11-17, 15:07: Let me know which conversation you would like to start with first, or if your teacher has any specific one mandated : ) - Mackenzie Mentor 2022-11-26, 13:24: Hey Elijah! I am sure it's a busy time of year right now, but please let me know when you're ready to get started on the modules! I'm opening ""Different Ways of Knowing"" now so we will have access to it! I also read in your bio that you're interested in cooking, I actually run my own baking business for charity, so i'd love to chat about your future goals and try to get you motivated if that's what you want! Let me know, Mackenzie Mentee 2022-12-01, 11:04: Hello Mackenzie My name is Elijah, my apologies for not getting back to you sooner I had some difficulties with the Mentor City site but we're all good now. a little bit about my life atm, I recently got a conditional acceptance into a culinary management program at Okanagan College in Kelowna and I'm working at a restaurant called Wings. I am really excited to graduate this year and continue the next adventure in my life. thank you Elijah Anderson",,,,,
1047567941,8/29/2022 9:27,1047587175,56878,,,"Mentor 2022-12-02, 04:56: No worries, the system is a little weird to get used to at first. I'm also doing ok! I'm mainly finishing up some projects before my exam season starts next week. I find that around now I would get into a bit of a feedback loop. Workload from school would lead to trouble with wellbeing, which then caused productivity to drop etc. I think recognizing that, and sometimes taking a step back to look at the big picture, helped me to handle some of it better. For this conversation, take a look through Anchor Text 1 and feel free to get started on a few of the first discussion questions. Since some of the topics can be quite personal, do note that the conversations between us (mentor &amp; mentee) are confidential. I'm very happy to listen (and maybe help if appropriate) to anything you want to share. I'm comfortable discussing anything really, and I'd like to think I'm quite open-minded about stuff. It's also definitely possible you would like to reach out to other supports about some of the issues that we might discuss, and in addition to the resources in this module, I can help you look for those other sources too! That being said, there are a few things that I'm supposed to communicate to the ReMBC staff (not confidential) and it's generally when safety is at stake. So this includes: ""Child abuse and neglect; Abusive relationships (emotional, physical, sexual violence/harassment); Substance abuse; Illegal activity; Suicidal behaviour; Untreated mental illness"". That isn't to say you should keep that to yourself, but more just so you know ahead of time and feel comfortable sharing :) If you would like to clarify the bounds of this, then let me know, and I can clarify with the other staff. Past all that, enjoy the first video and send your thoughts on the video / first discussion question(s) when you have a chance! Mentee 2022-12-08, 14:09: Hi there, so clear skies was not much luck unfortunately, it was ridiculously cloudy last night, right on the night of the full moon too:( Thats okay though. I hope it was a clearer for you guys over there and that maybe you caught a glimpse of it. Gingerbread houses sound so fun! I haven't actually made any yet, I will probably do it after winter break starts because of all the stuff happening in my life right now. Im excited to just leave it behind for a second and enjoy the holidays. The only thing I can ever think about is things going wrong, and for me personally I haven't found a proper way to rationalize those thoughts into the notion that things wouldn't be as bad as I think they would be. If you have any tips on getting to that point where I can become more grounded and have clearer and optimistic thoughts about my future and how it might turn out that would be amazing. Overthinking and intrusive thoughts are a very big personal plague of mine. I read the first article of the self care and well being acitivity and I very much enjoyed what it had to say. As for the first dicussion question, it asked me to make a list of things that indicate when I need to step up my self care so ill lay it out right here. Low energy(Not having any motivation for the things that I love or just day to day activities.) Lack of Focus(Being unproductive in my studies in school and at hope) Being unproductive in general Pessimistic thoughts(I'm not good enough..etc...) The urge to give up Messy room(It's constantly awful) Dissociation (I struggle with this one heavily.) That's basically the just of my list that I can think of as of now. Let me know your thoughts so far and then i'll send you my list of actvities that I enjoy, or I could create a warm and fuzzy file. I'm not exactly sure how to do so and how I would share it though. Hope your day is going well. Mentor 2022-12-11, 06:10: Oh right yea, I really messed up the timing with that message. We used to joke about how much one of our previous club presidents hated the moon. She hated how often the clear nights would coincide with a full moon. For me, it definitely did take a bit of time to start seeing things more optimistically. I can kind of think of a distinct low point after which I started getting better at it. For me, I think part of it came with looking back at all the random stuff that I was able to get through. I would find that either by luck or by my own abilities, I WAS able to get through difficult times/issues, and I was able to continue working towards my end goals. Another thing I noticed was how I could separate those far future end goals (wanting to do good in the world, healthy future relationships, a certain field where I wanted my career) from the current path that I was on. This is an image that I like to use when I think about that (hopefully you can see it, else I'll upload it myself somewhere). So while it feels like certain actions or events might be shutting doors for me, there are still a lot of other ways to get where I want to. There are also a lot of ways to return to something that I didn't think I wanted. Now that I think of it, a lot of this did come from just seeing how myself and everyone around me adapted to things going wrong / changing our minds, which kind of makes this advice a bit of a ""just trust me"". So for strategies, I might recommend looking back at things that you have overcome, or times that things just 'worked out ok'. Similarly, when you are worried about something, you could look at what might actually happen if things go wrong. Sometimes when I grab on to an intrusive thought and take a step back to think about it, I find reasons why it's not as bad as I would have thought. For overthinking, one thing that often helped was to try and explain it to a trusted friend. A close friend of mine has often been able to help me get out of stuff like that by asking some hard questions about why I feel a certain way. The overthinking starts to fall apart from there. I think because it can be hard to think critically about your own feelings and worries, having someone else weigh in does help. Your list of indicators looks really good! I didn't think of messy rooms, but that's definitely true for me as well. One extra thing I had on my list was my interactions with friends and family. If I find that I'm more annoyed by people around me, or I'm starting to get angry at people and the such, then that might also be a sign of needing to take some time off. For the warm and fuzzy file / list, you could pick out specific things to share or link to things in some way. I'm good with whatever you decide to go with. The only program limitations I can think of are ""ReMBC prohibits sharing of personal information. Please do not provide identifying information including, but not limited to last names, phone number, email addresses, and social media handles. [...] ReMBC prohibits communication outside the MentorCity platform, including via Zoom, email, social media platforms, gaming platforms [...], etc."". So outside of that, feel free to share as you please! One thing I'd include in my warm and fuzzy file right away would probably be Joey the sea otter (guess I was a bit literal with the warm and fuzzy). Shortly after the pandemic first started, there was this baby otter that was rescued by a team at the Vancouver Aquarium. Watching the 24/7 livestream of what the little guy was up to really helped me deal with the changes and the other stuff I had to get through. I've been meaning to visit the aquarium in person for some time and might finally go see Joey after this term is done. :) Mentee 2022-12-17, 10:46: Hi there! Sorry for the late reply, finals week was a hectic one but I'm finally on break, feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders honestly. I'm excited to just relax and take time to myself. I've been told a few times that talking to someone really helps to get outside of your own head. My friends are definitely helpful with calming me down but I find in the moment I become really deflective when they go to comfort me, in a way that I just don't want to deal with it and if I ignore it it'll go away type of deal. I think the reason for that is that I've always been an overly sensitive person, and throughout my life I've been shamed for it, so lately at this stage in life I get really scared to open up about things in person with people, especially in public. Thank you so much for suggesting looking back on the other things that I've overcome so far in life, that gave me a big confidence boost and motivation to keep going knowing that I've made it through worse. I'm currently at work but it's a fairly dead day so I'm going to work at my warm and fuzzy file and send it your way as soon as possible. Warning, it's going to be flooded with music. I always need my headphones in throughout the day but i'm trying to force myself to lay off so I'm not deaf by 25, because then I won't be able to listen anymore. First world problems right here. I hooe you're having a great break! i am no longer ridiculously busy and swamped with school work so we can have more consecutive sessions and I will reply much quicker. Again, I apologize, my brain is constantly scrambled. Mentor 2022-12-20, 10:15: No worries at all! I totally get it, I'm just finishing up with my finals now as well (my last one is this Wednesday). I'm very much looking forward to the break. I didn't even really plan much this time, and instead I'm just looking forward to having time to do whatever comes up. On the point about friends, I feel like I've seen that kind of reaction too, both in myself and with my friends. I agree that part of it might be feeling overwhelmed and scared to open up about emotions, even more so if you have had negative experiences like that in the past. I think part of it might also be with timing (where friends may offer up support at a time when we're not as receptive to it?). It's good that the support is still there though, and I don't really have as many suggestions there because this is something I'm also not sure how to deal with in my own life. One thing that might help is to consider if you want the friend to just listen or to actually try and fix the problem. You might also be able to communicate with them depending on how close they are, otherwise it might give you an idea of why you're feeling a certain way. Definitely still be gentle with yourself since I feel like that's a pretty normal reaction, and also take time and space when needed! Send over the warm and fuzzies whenever! I also listen to music constantly, although I probably haven't been as careful as you with giving my ears a break ??. Around now during exam season it's mostly playlists for music without lyrics, but the rest of the time I have all these different playlists for different moods. I haven't really considered how that all plays into managing my well-being, but I do think taking a break to listen to music is a big part of my self-care. I'm also open to trying out some good new music if you have any suggestions. Send more updates whenever, and totally feel free to take a break from stuff and enjoy your break as needed! Also congrats on finishing finals week ?? Mentor 2022-12-31, 06:46: Heyy sorry for the delayed response! Yea, that doesn't sound as fun, but hopefully you got a little bit of time to enjoy the break as well? I definitely did feel that as well when I was going through my undergrad, where it never really felt like I got an actual break. I might shoehorn in a small recommendation to consider doing a co-op if it's compatible with your career goals. I didn't do one myself in my first degree, but from what friends have told me, it can be a nice change of pace during your degree. While it also doesn't really slow down, the shift in focus can help with burnout. After getting through my degree though, I feel like I do have more of a break every now and then. (small extra sidenote, I don't have as much experience with the physics/astronomy co-ops and if they're worth doing, and it might depend on which area you want to focus on). I definitely feel you with having a hard time communicating. I even have a running joke with a close friend about how sometimes I really don't make much sense when I'm trying to explain something. As for the warm and fuzzies, I exchange so many animal clips with my friends, and I've shared a few cats playing in the snow too! A good bit of the suggested content on my social media is just cats/otters/other animals at this point. I've included one clip a friend sent me below. Do you have any pets / are you thinking of getting any in the future? https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/ztgjol/snowpiercer/ I actually haven't listed to a lot of these, but I like how clam and flowy they are. I'm not sure how to describe the feeling they give me, but it's similar to comfort food if that makes any sense? ?? It seems like a lot of movies and TV shows have used Starman, but it still gives me goosebumps every time that they do so. I feel like stuff by Red Hot Chilli Peppers is just very consistently good! Not sure if these are my favourite since there are a lot of good ones, but two from my saved ones were Soul to Squeeze and Under the Bridge. I actually didn't think I knew Chris Cornell till I looked him up. 'You Know My Name' was so memorable from Casino Royale, and I also liked 'Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart'. I'll have to explore his stuff some more. Part of why this response took extra long was because I spent too long trying to pick out music, and I'm still unsure about the ones I've picked. I went with a few artists of similar themes that made me feel nice recently: R.E.M (ex. Oh My Heart, Losing My Religion), Ozzy Osbourne (ex. Shot in the Dark) Isley Brothers (ex. Footsteps in the Dark), Idris Muhammad (ex. Could Heaven Ever be Like This), Delfonics (ex. Hey Love), Angela Munoz (ex. Can I Get Your Name) Yuna (ex. Relax your mind), RINI (ex. Meet me in Amsterdam, Aphrodite), H.E.R (ex. Avenue), Santino Le Saint (ex. Burning, Red). A lot of it has been R&amp;B and soulful music recently because a lot of my listening recently has been while I'm getting ready to sleep. There's also a bit of hip hop, rock, synth, etc. Some specific albums I go back to when I want to feel good are The Midnight Hour (ex. Smiling for Me) and this acoustic Above and Beyond album (ex. Satellite, You Got To Go). For movies/TV, I think my comfort movie is probably the Bee Movie (nothing to do with the memes, I used to watch it as a kid when I was feeling meh), and my go-to TV show would be Brooklyn Nine Nine or some other comedy sitcom. Hope you get a chance to have a bit of a break before classes start up, and take care! I'm really enjoying talking about music and your other warm and fuzzies / self care tools and would love to hear more thoughts. When you're ready to move on to the next task though, just let me know :) Mentor 2023-01-20, 12:54: Hi Kaelyn, Hope your week went well and good luck with the last little bit for your courses this term! Yea, definitely let me know if you do like any of the music. Your dogs sound amazing, and it definitely sounds like some photos belong in the warm and fuzzy folder. A friend of mine has a French bulldog, and I always found that they just have so much... personality? ?? It was one of my favourite parts about visiting his place. I don't have any pets currently, but I do want some in the future. I think I mentioned something similar during the video session, but I really like the somewhat more goofy and scraggly animals, and I'm following a few of them online! I'm not sure what kind of pet I might have someday, but once I've moved out and have my own space, it might just be whichever animal I connect to more at a shelter for example. I've opened up the 'Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning' section. Feel free to start going through the warm-up and activities. If you find that some of the content is not as relevant (since you have schools and programs you are interested in already, for example), let me know, and we can skip some and put more focus on the more useful areas. We also got a note recently from the eMentoring staff that they can keep the mentoring relationships active as long as needed, so you should have time to cover anything that you would like to! We can always come back to things later on, but before moving on from this section, I thought to check if you wanted to maybe talk a bit more about the sleep related things you mentioned? It can sometimes help to share what the thoughts are or what they are about, and sharing was something that helped me when I was working through something similar. In my case, I think I used some temporary anonymous chat service because I didn't feel comfortable sharing with my close friends. That's a little different from this, but I definitely won't judge no matter what it is. Share however much or however little you would like to! I actually came across something just this week that touches on the issue of intrusive thoughts, which was described as the 'pink elephant' or 'white bears' paradox. I looked around a little bit, and the idea is that trying to suppress the thought might actually make it pop into your mind even more, potentially even more than if you were trying to think of the idea in the first place (although I have yet to really check over the research articles on those bits). Here is an article that gives a bit of an introduction to ironic process theory and the white bear paradox if you wanted to explore some more. https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/10/unwanted-thoughts I will say though that if you are comfortable talking about it a little bit, that can be a nicer way to go about it. This article was decent, but while exploring I came across others (including a short film) that made me uncomfortable, so just a heads-up is all! I can't find the original post I saw on the pink elephant paradox, but from memory it went something like this: Don't think of a pink elephant. Why are you thinking of a pink elephant? You shouldn't be doing that. Why are you thinking of it even more now? Do you... like the pink elephant? Do you hate the pink elephant? Why can't you stop thinking of the pink elephant, it must be something just with you... The idea being that in reality a 'pink elephant' is not something that's meaningful to you, and yet some of these lines may almost feel reasonable for a moment. It's a bit of a silly exercise, and I've also read about how it might not be as helpful since other intrusive thoughts can feel a lot more personal (thus being harder to work through). It might help a little though :) Mentee 2023-01-24, 19:24: Hi! My classes are going alright. This week is my final week of these classes and I'm feeling a little drained and stressed about marks and all that jazz, but otherwise, things are going pretty okay. I haven't looked into the Pink Elephant paradox yet but I'll take a look at it as soon as I can. It's very true that when trying to surpress an intrusive thought, it only makes it more intense. In my personal experience when something unwanted pops into my head and I try and distract myself its almost like I'm swatting away an endless swarm of wasps. I usually take simple sentences to repeat continuosly in my head to replace the repeated intrusive thought. It works more effectively than you'd think, but not all the time. My dogs are great. Although they can be little turds sometimes, you can really see and feel how much they care. Whenever I am visibly and or audibly upset they are the first to be on my lap to comfort me however they can manage. That's awesome that they can keep the e-mentoring relationships active as long as needed. I am happy to hear that. I will look through the activity as soon as possible and get back to you. I hope you have a great week! Mentor 2023-01-30, 20:42: Hey :) Yea that's no worries, take your time. I hope your last week went well and congrats on starting your new set of classes! Could you remind me what classes you have for this quarter that just started? I'll have to try that strategy sometime, especially if it's working well for you. It's also really great that your dogs are so attentive. I still find it amazing how well pets and animals can understand how people are doing, and how there's still so much for us to learn about those relationships and other tasks that animals can help with. That was one of the things I also enjoyed learning about in the psychology and neurobiology courses that I took. Oh also feel free to also throw any quick thoughts or questions my way as well as you think of them, I'll definitely make a better effort to respond to things more promptly as well. Hope you have a good first week in your new classes and take care :) Rafi",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-11-11, 22:50: Hi Kaelyn, I'm Rafi and I will be your mentor over the next few months. So far I had a great time reading through your profile and I especially appreciated how much thought you put in to every question. I definitely feel like I have lots to share, and I'm looking forward to working on some modules with you and dealing with other things as needed along the way! I was a little unsure about what information about me was passed along, and I didn't want to bore you too much by repeating the same stuff here. If you click on my name, I think you can see some of my own background information, but I'd also be happy to share more. As you may have spoken to the program coordinators about, I'm not personally a physics/astronomy student, although a number of my friends are! For me, astronomy was an interest I really wanted to explore for some of the same reasons that you mentioned. I wanted to learn more about the universe, about our future endeavours in space, and about how I might personally be able to make it up there someday (although for me, it probably won't be as an astronaut any time soon). I joined the Astronomy Club at my school and I've been closely involved with it for some time now, and from what I've heard from friends, there are a lot of different paths you can take even late in your degree. I know a few people that are currently doing grad school or PhD programs, and others that started working as data scientists or developers for the CSA or ESA, for example. As for the program, since you are not taking it as a part of a course and since I feel like you know what kind of support you might need (again, amazing response to each of the questions), I'm thinking you can guide us on which sections to go through? Along the way, I'll try to share more specific advice depending on the topics. ?? While I don't think any of us mentors can guarantee we will have the right advice for you, I promise to do my best to send you honest and helpful advice for whatever you need help with (program related, personal questions or anything else). I saw that you mentioned wanting help with adulting in the big city, and I can definitely help out with that. I'm far from an expert, but it's something that I also had trouble with and learned a lot about. I definitely messed up a lot at the beginning (can't count the number of times I took a bus/Skytrain in the wrong direction because I'm that directionally challenged). I found that while some of it just comes with experience, another big confidence boost is just knowing that I was able to recover from those mistakes and make it home ok each time. Past that though, I'd love to share some tips that others shared with me since that might make things a little easier. :) To start off with, send me a message back to confirm that the system is working, and please do include any other thoughts you might have. If you have any worries or concerns, then definitely feel free to share that as well. It would also be helpful to know what grade you are currently in and/or what stage of the applications you are in. As a small aside, how is the star gazing around where you are? I'd imagine you have similar issues with the weather as Vancouver, but during clear nights is the light pollution is a lot better? - Rafi :) Mentor 2022-11-21, 20:01: Hi Kaelyn, No rush at all in responding, as I know you must be busy with schoolwork and the such! I'm just checking in to see if you received the message, and if there's anything else I can help with in the meantime. Thankss :) Mentee 2022-11-22, 16:05: Hi Rafi! I deeply apologize for the delay in responding. The past couple weeks have really been hectic and I'm just trying to get my stuff together haha. I've looked through the introduction before but im going to do so again quickly to refresh my memory. I hope you're doing well! Mentee 2022-11-22, 16:22: Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity, i've just read through your profile and I can see that we have loads in common, I am also a soccer player and a very big music lover. I'm very excited to get working on this program with you. I looked through the different conversation topics and at the moment I'm quite drawn to the self care and well being section. I have been struggling quite a bit lately and I think it would be a great place for me to start so I can ready my mindset for handling other topics such as planning for my future and so on. I am currently in grade 12 and im just finishing up my applications for UBC and SFU this week so I can meet the early application deadline. Stargazing here isn't as good as it should be unfortunately, its always cloudy and or rainy here, the gloom never ends. However, when it's a clear night, theres a 100% chance that I am outside enjoying it. Mentor 2022-11-25, 03:54: That's no worries at all, I imagined that was probably the case! It's quite busy for everyone right now, and especially so for those sending out applications, so definitely feel free to take some time to deal with the other stuff. I'll probably still check in periodically anyway, just in case there are any other issues of some sort. Congrats on being almost done with the UBC and SFU applications! Your background seemed quite strong and your write-ups on here were really well done, so I'm not imagining any issues there, but feel free to bounce any thoughts off of me for those. I definitely can relate with the stargazing. The club here used to sell hoodies with ""We hear there are stars behind the clouds"" on the back because of how many observation events we had to cancel last minute. I guess this also means that when there IS a good opportunity, more people are out to enjoy it lol Was there anything in particular you were struggling with for self-care and well-being? I know for me, for example, my sleep and diet usually suffers during this time. Also, I think there may be some issues with the remBC system, so I'm not sure if I was able to unlock the conversation properly. Give that a try and see if you can access it. Otherwise, I've sent a message to the other mentors to see if there's something else I should be doing. Mentor 2022-11-25, 03:55: That's no worries at all, I imagined that was probably the case!

Your background seemed quite strong and your write-ups on here were really well done, so I'm not imagining any issues there, but feel free to bounce any thoughts off of me for those. I definitely can relate with the stargazing. The club here used to sell hoodies with ""We hear there are stars behind the clouds"" on the back because of how many observation events we had to cancel last minute. I guess this also means that when there IS a good opportunity, more people are out to enjoy it lol Was there anything in particular you were struggling with for self-care and well-being? I know for me, for example, my sleep and diet usually suffers during this time. Also, I think there may be some issues with the remBC system, so I'm not sure if I was able to unlock the conversation properly. Give that a try and see if you can access it. Otherwise, I've sent a message to the other mentors to see if there's something else I should be doing. Mentee 2022-11-30, 18:30: Hi! I didn't recieve your message at first i'm sorry, I was having trouble figuring out the system for a little while there and I wasn't recieving the emails that said they came through. I have it all down now so hopefully no more difficulties haha. Hope you are doing well! I don't really have any specifcs in mind in terms of well being, i've just been struggling mainly with mental health issues, causing my productiveness to falter quite alot. I think i'd like to touch on all subjects under it, I just want to learn how to be better for myself and my mind so that I can be sucessful and happy in general. Mentee 2022-12-07, 16:38: Hi just wanted to let you know ill be starting the activity pretty soon here, and I fully understand that, most of my mental health issues are heavily stress related right now if im being honest. I set the bar way too high for myself and I struggle alot with worrying about the future and if i have what it takes to do what i want to do. I have a workshop to attend for UBC at 5 but hopefully after that we can get started with the activity. I hope you're doing well:) Mentor 2022-12-08, 05:14: Ahh yea I totally get that. I'm not sure if I'm better about stress/setting the bar just yet, but I do think it's gotten better over the years. I'm not sure if this is the healthiest way of dealing with it, but sometimes I think over what would actually happen if things go badly. Often I find that it wouldn't actually be as bad, or that at least I have a plan already for if things go badly. Another side to this for me was about balancing activities and commitments with small fun things every now and then. Since my last day of classes was today, I actually went to this random gingerbread house making event at UBC for that same reason! ?? I'm doing pretty well, hope you're also doing good :) Take care and clear skies! Mentee 2022-12-26, 20:26: Happy Holidays! I hope you had a great christmas, I ended up being scheduled to work for the entire break so I'm sorry again for the late reply, everything always gets ridiulously hectic right when I think it's about to slow down :( I agree with considering when I want to hear advice and just want someone to listen and being communicative about it. I have a few close friends but I struggle really speaking about things in general, which is something I'm trying to work on. People can't read my mind so I need to learn to better communicate my feelings in an effective and beneficial way for myself and the people around me. As for warm fuzzies, I don't currently have links but, cat's playing in the snow has been a very big favourite of mine recently, cat's in general are adorable, but them in the snow takes the cake for me. I have LOTS of songs to show and talk about but the ones that make me feel safe and happy specifically are; - Do you remember- jack johnson and also Upside down by him, from curious george. - Nude- Radiohead, this song makes me like ascend, more of a calming one for when i get anxious -Starman - David Bowie Drive - The cars, or the deftones version is equally as good -Dust in the wind - Kansas - The interstellar soundtrack, all of it. -I also really like Storms - by fleetwood Mac I've noticed most of these are a bit more sad and flowy than upbeat but honestly soothing songs make me feel the most warm and fuzzy over the more hyper ones. A song I am obsessed with is Eddie by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, the guitar solo is AMAZING. I would say they are my favourite band, I saw them live in seattle and I'm going to go see them again in March when they are in Vancouver. My favourite aritst however is Chris Cornell, rest in peace, I like his song he did with Slash called Promise. I could go on about music forever but i'll leave you with those. What are some of your favourites? My comfort movies are Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox and all of the Winnie the pooh movies(Tigger is my favourite disney character). Those are all of the warm fuzzies I can think of right now. Hope you're doing well! Mentee 2023-01-08, 12:37: Hi! I hope you had a great break, sorry for the late response, life is just being life. I havent heard alot of the songs you recommended either,so I am excited to give them a listen. I honestly only recognized R.E.M. The co-op sounds interesting, I'd definitely love to look into it further. I have three dogs right now, their names are Mika, Enzo and Senna. Two of them are frenchbulldogs and the one is a pitbull. They're named after F1 racecar drivers, my step dad is a certified car guy. If i could, I would have an entire farm in all honesty. I love animals and I plan on fostering in the future so that more animals can find homes quicker. I genuinely spend my free time signing petitions to stop kill shelters. Do you have any pets, or want any in the future? I giggled when you said the Bee movie but it is a great movie, regardless of the memes lol. You described how I feel when I listen to my music pretty acurrately. I really enjoy music that I can connect with on a spiritual level. I think we could definitely move on to the next task. I think moving onto the post secondary planning or career related ones would be most helpful at this time. Mentor 2023-01-13, 04:10: Hi Kaelyn, Really sorry for the late replies. I actually started my own co-op role this past week, but I should be on a more normal schedule real soon. I wrote a part of my response, but I wanted to quickly pass this along first since it was more time sensitive. Your last message was great, I was just bad about managing my time this week and should send my stuff tomorrow! So the eMentoring people are holding some events that you might be interested in if you are free at the time. I'm pasting in the details below, although maybe you also received the same stuff in an email. Unfortunately, I'm already sending this after the first session has passed, but I should be at the one on January 16th if you wanted to join! Here are the details: Meet your mentor live: Have you been wanting to video chat with your mentor? Well now you can! Join us on our Gather space and video chat with your mentor, or meet some of our other eMentors. We're hosting sessions on two dates: January 12th 4:00-5:30pm (Pacific time zone) January 16th 8:30-9:30pm (Pacific time zone) To attend: talk to your match about which session you're available for - you don't have to attend the whole session (and you can attend both if you'd like). If your match is unable to meet, you can still attend and meet other eMentors who can give you advice about your future. When you're ready, sign up here (it's free!): https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4kW9RC2fYbmCCG There's also this other event here: The Power of Mentoring Event: Hosted by Starbucks and MENTOR Canada - January 19th 3-5pm online. For youth, mentees and mentors. This FREE event will include a facilitated panel discussion with Starbucks leaders highlighting their career experiences and insights, followed by smaller group career mentoring discussions in breakout rooms. Register here: https://mentoringcanada.ca/en/power-of-mentoring/exclusive-hybrid-power-of-mentoring-event-partnership-starbucks-canada Mentee 2023-01-16, 15:46: Hi! No worries we both have busy lives so I understand. I am signed up for the event tonight. I hope your co-op is going well! Mentee 2023-02-06, 15:17: Hi! My classes are going well so far. I have chem and calculus. I ended precal with an A and physics with 2 percent away from one. I am not super proud of either of the grades since the precal one is below 90 but I really struggle with focusing outside of class and studying so that's something I am working towards fixing for the rest of the year and also moving forward into post secondary. I've been super busy with extracurriculars lately so I apologize again for late replies and for not started the new section yet. I have a paper to finish today but i'll take a deeper look into the activity tomorrow so I can think clearly and critically about it without any stress or distractions. I hope you're doing well! Mentor 2023-02-07, 13:57: Hi Kaelyn, That’s no worries, good luck on the essay and I hope it goes well :) I’m starting to get into the flow of the work term now and I’m appreciating the lack of homework and exams. Hope you’re getting a bit of time to yourself as well while you go through all that! I think university has skewed my frame of reference because my first reaction was that those grades sound amazing! But yea I also get the feeling of hoping for a little bit more, especially when there’s some other program/requirement that looks at your grades. We can definitely go over different studying strategies and issues later on. Good luck on the start of chem &amp; calc as well ~ Mentor 2023-02-24, 13:00: Hi Kaelyn, Just a quick update about the video chat session on Mar 7th. Unfortunately, while I will try to make it home as soon as I can, I will be leaving work around that time and may not make it back in time to join the session. However, similar to last time, there should be lots of other mentors available too! It also looks like they organized a few more games and events, so that could be fun as well. Hope your term is going well :))) Rafi Mentee 2023-03-03, 17:18: Hi! first off I really want to apologize for my late answer. I have been extremely overwhelmed lately and went through a bit of a bad unmotivated rough patch. I hope you're doing well and that everything is going good for you. That video chat session sounds super interesting but its no worries if you can't make it. I wont be able to either unfortunately, as I have hockey that night. We only have a couple practices left for the season so I don't want to miss any. Mentor 2023-03-07, 02:17: Hey Kaelyn, No need to apologize, I totally understand! This program is meant to be on your own terms, so please feel free to take breaks when you feel that you might want one. Sorry to hear you're going through an unmotivated rough patch / are feeling overwhelmed :( If you have any thoughts on your mind right now, then feel free to share! At the same time, I know when others have offered me the same, I found it hard to organize my thoughts until much later. So it's also understandable if that's the case! Either way, have fun at your practices and good luck with the rest of the season! Mentor 2023-04-09, 03:42: Hey Kaelyn, This isn't meant to rush you on any of the program stuff. I'm just checking in to see how you are doing :) How did the end of your hockey season go? Is there anything you are currently up to? Hope you get a chance to relax a bit over the long weekend, and take care! Rafi Mentee 2023-04-11, 18:14: Hi Rafi! I am so sorry, I didn't receive the message you sent before this most recent one through my email. After taking a very extended break with spring break and the long weekend I'm feeling alot more prepared and ready to be more productive. These coming weeks I will put in my best efforts to be very active with the program and we can get started with the activities. Especially so, since I have been accepted to SFU and UBC. So now I'm left with the choice between the two. Im leaning more towards UBC at the moment, I'm just currently trying to work out the logistics of everything. I wanted to ask about the general life there at UBC. Like in terms of living in dorms and also if there are any tours I can attend within this month or the next. Whether they are group tours or if there is a possibility to do a short personal one. Aside from that, the end of hockey season went really well and now i've just begun my soccer one. How is everything for you? Any new and exciting? Mentor 2023-04-14, 19:15: That's no worries! Glad to hear that your break went well :)) Also congratulations on getting into both UBC and SFU! That's such amazing news, and hopefully a good bit of stress off your shoulders. What kind of logistical things are you looking in to? I didn't personally live in the dorms, but I would say that community wise the schools are fairly similar. Overall, whatever school you go with, I don't think you'll be missing out on much because they're both excellent with great faculty. One thing you could explore is if there are particular researchers / labs / faculty you might want to connect with, which might sway your decision maybe? For example Dr. Jess Mciver's work I think might be somewhat close to your interests?: https://phas.ubc.ca/jess-mciver-appointed-canada-research-chair-gravitational-wave-astrophysics Tour wise, I think you would want to check here: https://you.ubc.ca/tours-events/campus-tours/ You can schedule one in according to your schedules, or just look at the options available. They should also be able to provide lots of other guidance. Soccer sounds exciting! Are you playing with school or like a local group? For me, work is getting more interesting. They're bringing me onto bigger projects now, which is fun. I still don't feel like I understand what I'm doing a lot of the time, but I don't think I'm supposed to fully understand it. Outside of school, I'm looking forward to the weather getting warmer and classes ending for friends. I'm planning to spend more time with people and maybe go explore some stuff around the city. Take care and have a great weekend :) Mentee 2023-04-20, 10:53: Hi! I hope that you've been doing well. I ended up choosing UBC. It was mostly an intuitive choice, but I made sure to go through the basic pros and cons before choosing. I will be attending the tour for black and indigenous students next weekend, so I'm very excited about that. I've already made some new friends through the discord that they have set up so It won't be completely nervewracking to be there. On another note, I play on the girls soccer team at my high school and I'm planning to join the womens soccer team for the summer season before I move down to van. I have a question concerning the dorms. I'm fairly sure that indigenous students are allowed to move in a bit early, so is that something that you'd reccommend? Getting in there a bit early seems like it would relieve some stress before starting classes, and give me time to adjust to the new envrionment. I'll definitely check out Dr. Jess Mciver's work regardless, that sounds super cool. Im glad to hear that work is getting more interesting for you! I am also sortof looking forward to warm weather. I love being warm but the sun and I dont really get along. I do not tan, if that wasn't evident enough already with the red hair. So, I am more of a fall type of gal. Exploring around the city sounds nice, I'll have to do my fair share of that, even though I'm down there almost monthly visiting my dad lol. Do you have any big summer plans? Mentor 2023-04-23, 01:47: That's great to hear! Yea, the organizing the pros and cons makes me feel more comfortable with big decisions, like I didn't forget something important. Hope your tour goes well! It's exam season right now, so campus should be relatively quiet, aside from the few students running around all stressed like ?? The various discords and the subreddit (reddit.com/r/ubc) are all very helpful. When I went through originally, there were a lot of really good Facebook groups too, but it seems like most of that has migrated to Discord. I basically always try to find the group chat or Discord for each course at the start of the term, so that when I inevitably need to ask a last minute question (ex. ""Wait which page is the lab for tomorrow?!?""), I have it ready... The women's team would be super cool! Through your student fees, you'll also be paying for a lot of other recreation things, so there's lots to try. I'm pretty sure the aquatic centre is free, and a lot of the random intramurals (dodgeball is a personal favourite) are cool too. I think during the first month, there's also a ""free week"" where you can go and try the various classes and programs. I think it would be nice to move in early and get settled in. As you get closer and closer to the start of classes, everything gets going more and more. Moving in early would get one thing off your mind. One thing I have heard is that the first bit in the dorms can be a little quiet, because everyone else hasn't moved in just yet. Although since you have your dad in the city, and if you have a plan for how you want to use the time, I don't see any harm in moving in early! (One small tip, if you are preparing for the term during that time, don't buy any textbooks; wait for after the first week of classes, so the prof can clarify) Yea that's understandable about the warm weather! ?? When I go outside, I find a nice shady and breezy area to chill in. Most of my outfits are for the colder months, so I'm usually overheating regardless. Otherwise for the summer, I don't have that much planned just yet. I decided not to take any classes, so I'll probably be focussing on work and some of the little personal projects. I haven't had a chance to work on those much yet, aside from setting up some of the foundational stuff, so that's probably how I'll spend my time. Otherwise, I'm thinking of taking a trip to Ontario to visit some of the friends there maybee Mentee 2023-05-03, 21:05: Hi! I just got back from my tour of UBC, and I loved it. Holy crap is it ever big though. I will 100% be getting lost, a lot. If you have the names of any of the facebook pages or links to the discord I would really appreciate that. I'm about to register for jumpstart as we speak, so I will be moving in early. I agree that it would relieve some unneeded stress while starting out. Most of my outfits are also for the colder months, I have very little clothes for warm weather, and the clothes I do have don't really go together. I'll forever be a sweater wearer, just my destiny. Ontario trip sounds nice! My only summer plans are to work off student debt in advance. Mentor 2023-05-07, 19:21: Yea it's really big! When I started, I learned where everything was relative to the fountain and then would always return to it when I got mixed up. You'll start finding shortcuts soon enough though! Also not to worry you or anything, I'm mostly just curious, what kind of courses are you looking to sign up for in first year? For the Facebook and Discord pages, the links seem to change every year. For UBC Astronomy club, you can find there relevant links here, and I think their Discord is fairly active: https://www.ubcastronomyclub.com/links . You can also find some of the links posted in places like this https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/q44oiu/new_to_campus_megathread_post_all_your_admissions/ . That page, and the /r/UBC subreddit itself, are also really great for getting oriented and learning about what's happening on campus. Hope the summer work is pleasant for you! I'd also recommend taking a little bit of time for yourself if you aren't already :) Have a great weekend! Mentor 2023-06-03, 02:16: Hi Kaelyn, Don't worry if you don't have any updates to share or if you're busy with the end of year activities! This is just a quick check-in to see how you are doing, and if there was anything you wanted to ask / get help with. If not, then that's no problem, hope the end of the year goes well for you! Cheers, Rafi Mentee 2023-06-03, 14:17: Hi Rafi! Very sorry for the delayed response, things have definitely been hectic. I hope that you are doing well! I'm not super sure what courses would be best to choose for environmental science, if you had any pointers that would be amazing. There aren't really any mandatory prerequisities to specialize in it in 2nd year so I'm just trying to gage what to do and where I want to take it so I can set myself up on that path. Mentor 2023-06-04, 01:59: That's no worries! Yea course registration can be annoying to deal with, right now I'm also going through and planning out my ones. One way to go about it would be to look at any required courses for your other second/third choice specializations so that you can keep your options open. After that is done, you could also look ahead at other courses you will need to take in the future (ex. 300 or 400 level courses) and see what their prerequisites are, and then you can trace back to see what courses you will need to take to get there. One thing that helped me was to talk to other people and see what courses they are taking. You can make some friends and see who you might share sections with, and you also get some reassurance that you aren't forgetting something. I'm not as familiar with environmental science personally. Have they given you some guidance on what courses you should look for in first year? If you send what courses you're planning to take, I can also take a look, although you've probably reviewed more than I have for environmental science stuff. :) Mentee 2023-07-12, 16:04: Hi Rafi! Just wanted to reach out and say thank you for everything! I know we didn't get through lot's of activities because of the busy schedules but I am grateful for what we did instead and all of the advice you have given me. It has been a pleasure getting to know you as a person aswell. I received an email saying that this will close on the 14th unless a survey to notify we'd like otherwise is filled out, I am okay with keeping it open just to keep in touch since we are attending the same school so advice further down the road would be awesome! Let me know if you want to keep it open and I'll fill out that survey thing. Mentor 2023-07-14, 04:49: Hi Kaelyn, I hope your summer is going well! I'm staying with the program, and I'd love to keep this open into the next year. Thank you as well for being a very engaged mentee, it makes my role really easy when you're already eager and asking lots of great questions. It's been great getting to know you and I'd love to hear your experiences as you start next year, both the good and the bad! ?? How has your summer been going otherwise, was there anything you wanted to share? Cheers, Rafi Mentor 2023-09-05, 04:49: Hi Kaelyn, Just wishing you best of luck as you start your first year! ?? If you have anything on your mind then feel free to share, otherwise best of luck and hope you have a great first week. Cheers, Rafi Mentor 2024-01-13, 06:15: Hi Kaelyn, Hope your first semester went well! Let me know if there is anything you want to check in about, otherwise best of luck with your next semester :) Rafi",,,,,

Mentor 2022-11-17, 21:35: Hi Mellisa, I hope you're having a great day! I was just sending a follow up message to ensure you received my previous message.

1047549915,10/30/2021 18:39,1047587028,56756,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-12-11, 17:35: Hi Evelyn, To address your question about going from high school to university, there were some challenges, but I think I've learned a lot about myself in the process. I want to preface by saying am from an urban area, and I understand that there are additional and unique challenges when you transition from a rural community to a urban community. Some of the biggest challenges for me were work load. High school was much lighter in terms of coursework in my experience, and so the amount of work required by university took me by surprise. At the time I didn't know how to really handle this efficiently and how to cope with the stress that can come with university. But I have developed those skills over time. I think one of the things I would have done differently in hindsight would have been to take less courses in my first semester. I took five courses, but you only need to take a minimum of 3 courses to be considered a full-time student. And I think taking those three courses instead would have helped in the sense I would have been able to slowly transition to university and learn how to study in university with less pressure from course load and I guess less ""on the line"" in a way in terms of grades. And taking less courses would have also given me more time to have more of an active social life outside of class and build a support system around me in this new envrionment. I was also working part-time to help pay for costs, so along with a full-course load, I felt like I had a lot on my plate. Although I did participate in social activities, I think I would have had a better time in first year if I had more time to participate in more. So that is definately one piece of advice I would have: Take your time. Don't get intimidated by all your friends saying their taking a full-course load and or saying that they will be specializing in something really difficult or entering some really hard program. Most people end up changing what they do anyways! Take your time to transition to post-secondary and don't put too much pressure on yourself, especially in the first year. Taking it slow will only benefit you! And if you do have other obligations or challenges (such as needing to work part-time to help pay for costs or perhaps you are moving to an entirely new environment and maybe need some time to adjust), taking fewer courses in your first term is an important consideration. I think a lot of the important considerations with regards to transitioning to post-secondary come up in the different activties, but if you have specific questions please message me and I will answer to the best of my abilities. Also I want to add that although university has had its challenges, I've had a great time over the last five years. As an additional note, if you have specific questions about transitioning from a rural community to an urban environment, feel free to message and I can get some input from friends who have had similar experiences :) With regards to the conversation/activity..... I've opened up the post-secondary and career-planning conversation, and you will need to go through the activities to complete the module. Then you can message me with questions that you may have, and questions that you may feel are left unanswered by the activity, or anything in general :) . Here is some insight I have about this activity: The Career Compass website helps you explore career options. I remember using this website in high school, and having the opportunity to explore new career prospects. It's a great opportunity to take some time to explore careers options. If you really don't like the suggestions based on your responses, do not worry about it, they are just suggestions. I would suggest you try to explore at least 1 option that you might not have previously considered as career options. Just recently, while volunteering at the hospital, I met a cardiac perfusionist. I have always wanted to pursue a career in healthcare, and have mainly researched careers in nursing or as a physician. I did not know what cardiac perfusionists do, and so I went home and researched about the position and cardiac perfusion programs. I found that it is a role that closely aligns with my career interests, and I may not have otherwise discovered this career prospect had I not decided to do some research out of curiosity after meeting with the cardiac perfusionist. Sometimes we do not know if what a potential career prospect entails until we do more research about it, and I'm glad I decided to do some research in this case. Did you discover any programs you had not previously considered? What sparked your interest in these programs? If the career path you are interested in was not displayed, how might you go about exploring this option? Jasleen Mentee 2023-01-11, 10:40: Hey Jasleen, sorry for not respoding I was away from christmas and just got into the swing of things. I hope you had a good winter break. thank you for all of your helpfull tips, I definitaly agree I should pick afew things that I am interested in, and I really like the recomandtion to not take to much on in the first year, I that is defintaly somthing I would do. I am abit worried about going from a small community to a big city but I think it will be alright as long I as don't overwhelm myself I think I will be ok. Making friends will definiatly be somthing I will need to work on becouse i am defintialy an inrtovert. Did yoyu join any clubs or groups that helped you build a friend group/support group? Mentor 2023-01-15, 15:24: Hi Evelyn, No worries at all. Joining clubs in first year really helped me explored different groups and make new friends! UBC is kind of like its own city as it has over 60000 students, faculty, and staff, so joining clubs was definately a great way to meet new people with similar interests as me. I was a part of my Faculty's undergrad society, and also participated in the intramural leagues as I love participating in sports and it was a great way to meet new people while having fun at the same time. I did not stay in student housing in first year, but my friends who did say it was a great way to make friends. Most schools have lots of clubs for many different interests. I know UBC has lots of niche clubs and clubs that cover almost every hobby I can think of. There's social groups, hobby focussed groups, fundraising and social awareness clubs, cultural clubs, and many more. Jasleen",,,,,"Mentor 2022-11-10, 21:49: Hi Evelyn! My name is Jasleen, and I'm a fifth-year UBC student in the Faculty of Science, studying Biology. I am excited to be your mentor this year. In my free time I like to play sports, hike, run, crochet, sew, and listen to music. I'd love to learn more about you! What are your interests and what is something you are hoping to learn more about through this program? Feel free to reach out to me with all of your questions at any time and I will do my best to have them answered for you. Cheers, Jasleen Mentee 2022-11-24, 11:45: Hi there Jasleen, my name is Evelyn I am sorry i have not been messaging you I have been away sick. I am super exited to be doing this course this year! I also love sports including soccer and riding horses. I read that you like music have you been to any cool concerts recently? Mentor 2022-11-26, 21:40: Hi Evelyn, No worries! I hope you are feeling better now. It is great to hear from you. It's been a little while but I went to the Olivia Rodrigo concert! It was super fun. I see on your profile that you like doing activities with your dog and also like horse riding. That sounds super fun! Do you also ride competitively or is it something you just like to do for fun? I'm glad that you're excited to participate in this program! Let me know which ""Conversation"" you would like to begin with! Best, Jasleen Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:56: Hey, yes I have been riding horses since I was five and competitively for around ten years. Then is 2020 i get a german shepherd puppy cleo, and started doing dog sports with her. I have been doing schutzhund dog sport with cleo for two years now. I am not sure what you mean by conversation but I would love to know how it was for you going from highschool to post secondary? Mentee 2022-12-08, 10:05: Hi jasleen hope you are well, I have chosen a conversation i would love to talk about post-seconadry &amp;career planing. Mentor 2023-01-16, 18:03: Hi Evelyn, I received a message that you signed up for the Meet Your Mentor event. That is great. I will be there at 8:30 but I won't be able to stick around for too long unfortunately as I have another commitment. Looking forward to meeting you! Jasleen",,,,,
1047587030,11/8/2022 12:42,1047587026,56755,"Mentee 2023-01-31, 14:02: Hi Rachel! hope your week is going well! the first discussion question i went over was why do you think scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge are often seen as in conflict with eachother. my answer was that i think they often end in conflict because of the contrast between what is proven and what is believed. or maybe its hard for people to believe something different after believing in something else their entire life. my question for you is what is your connection to the land compared to mine?, i honestly feel little connection to the land i call home even after being the second generation canadian on both my mom and dads side, i have appreciation for it of course but its hard to see the land im on as my homeland. the second question is wAre there any Indigenous inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? some inventions that surprised me are team sports used as a diplomatic tool, willow bark tea used as a pain reliever and pine needle tea used as a cure for scurvy. my last question to you is as an adult and post secondary student what kind of indigenous innovations or businesses have you encountered? hope you have a great day! Mentor 2023-02-01, 12:42: Hi Madison, Thats a really interesting take on the question. It absolutely makes sense. I think sometimes change can make people feel threatened and then conflict arises. My connection to the land is kind of interesting. Through my matriarchial line I am 5th or 6th generation canadian, through my partriarchal lines I am actually predominantly norwegian and scottish. My indigenous roots come from both sides of my family. I've learned a lot recently regarding my family lines and it has given me some confidence to learn more about my roots. I observe indigenous spiritual practices that are common to where I live. I smudge regulary, drum with a womens group and practice graitude daily. I try to live according to the medicine wheel teachings because I find it encompasses many ways of being. My favorite indigenous invention is the jolly jumper for babies, both of my children used one and it was literally thier favorite thing to play with when they were that little. I think its really cool that she was able to see the potential in an item that had already been used for such a long time. I think the natural medicines are very cool and there are so many that it would take a lifetime to learn them all! Changa is interesting, its a fungus that grows on trees and its used for many things. inflammation and digestion, among other things. So in my education journey I have actually met quite a few indigenous entrepreanurs. Theres an artist who makes dreamcatchers that are absolutely beautiful. There is another who designs clothing and has a majority of their family employed for them. There is another knowledge keeper who beads and makes moccasins and holds little workshops so we all have the opportunity to learn those skills. I will open the next module, let me know if you have any questions! Hope its an excellent week! Rachel :)",,"Mentee 2023-02-22, 15:52: Hi rachel! honestly its hit or miss with the weather over here most of the time its either rainy, near freezing or dark or its bright and warm which seems pretty rare these days. I guess i didnt know i was into earthing! but yeah its honestly pretty enjoyable,and if i had the chance to i would probably be one of those people burying themselves in soil starting with the self care folder, (you're totally right i love self care discussions!) some warning signs that i need some personal care are: irritability, being too quiet, and being withdrawn, most of these are pretty self explanatory if you're more extroverted (aka talking way too much) like i am. But its definitley a sign to myself or even close friends that i need to take a minute for some self care. Activities i enjoy especially when it comes to self care are hiking, art, and yoga! what are some of your tips for maintaing good mental health in geeneral? i hope you have a great day!",,,,"Mentee 2023-01-24, 10:13: Hi rachel! finaally got this whole thing figured out lol, i checked out the finding inspiration folder and i've got my answers for the discussion questions! first things first, what motivates me is practicing positive thinnkinng when im dealing with topics that seem out of my reach or hard for me, excersising regularly also helps me. what i want to know is what inspired you to start down the path you are on now? and what innspires you to continue? . the next few questions are from the getting whaat youu want part of thhe folder. By next month i want to know atleast the basics of sign language (ex: greetings, pronouns, goodbyes) what could help with leearning that is spending an hour everyday studying sign language. i was also wondering what habits haave you developed to fight things like procrastination? hope you have a great week!",,"Mentor 2023-02-08, 14:07: Hi Madison! I know! Im so excited for warmer weather too, I love to get out and enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. My favorite part of the warm weather is being able to get out hiking and having fires in the evening. I have to agree that the best part of rural living is the connection in community. Its so nice that you have the opportunity to connect with nature in that way. I firmly believe that those things are super healthy and beneficial in so many ways. Have you ever heard of earthing? its basically connecting with the earth through bare feet or taking the time to sit quietly with the grass and trees. I approach ot like meditating with nature. Its a very enjoyable experience. My favorite part of living in a city is the aspect of convienence. Everything I need is readily available and its nice to be able to have chicken nuggets at 2 in the morning if I so choose. That extends to things like being able to shop late, walk in clinics and lots of stores so I can find everything I need right here. One of the things that I dont like about that, is that I dont have a need to go anywhere so I find i dont get out of town very often. I also dont like the amount of crime or the fact that I dont feel safe walking at night. Its unpredicatable and therefore not safe. Unfortunately I am not exempt from that even though my city is quite small. I am going to open strategic studying, as always, if you have any questions or concerns...let me know. I hope you have a really great week! Rachel Mentee 2023-02-14, 10:14: Hi Rachel!, today is especially warm which is great! i love to get out too especially hiking ( obviously or i wouldnt be here at all haha ). i agree with you about hiking being good for you i find that being out in the sun and open air helps my mental health every time i may need it. ive never heard of earthing but i think i might already do things like it?, my favourite thing about hiking is getting to a place where i caan just sit and feel one with the soil and trees its the deafening silence that also makes me love it so much. havee you used any of the techniques recommended in the video? andd if you did what was your expiriences? i surprisingly have only mainley used visuals! i never heard of the types of studying in that video up until this point! neverthelss they sound like a good idea haha. since were getting a test soon what strategies do you use to prepare and study for exams? hop you have a great week! Mentor 2023-02-15, 14:57: Hi Madison! I am defiinatly a little envious of your warm weather, its still cold and snowy here. Not as cold as years past though, so thats a bonus and Im glad of it. I really love hiking and i think its wonderful that you get out regularily and enjoy nature. Yes! thats essentially earthing, the whole idea is just to make a connect with the earth in a physical manner. Some people bury themselves in dirt and just hang out lol. As far as the study strategies in the video, I dont really use many except for the short study bursts and coming back to subjects im weak on from another angle. One thing I have found that is super effective is to teach what I need to know fully to someone else, or to explain in it simple terms. It also shows me where I am weak in the subject matter which allows me to focus on that part. I take a lot of notes, I color code them and make them all pretty so that when i need to review, its interesting to look at. A struggle that I had when I started college was feeling super overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge I was supposed to be able retain and recall at any given time. Made me have crazy bad test anxiety too. I was able to mitigate that by doing study groups. for example, we have a midterm tomorrow, 6 chapters and my friend group at school and myself each took a chapter and fully answered all the questions that they give you at the end of each chapter. It really helped because no one had to study half the textbook in a week. We are all much better prepared and way less stressed about it. Im going to open well-being and care next, I think this one will be enjoyable for you. As a social work student, self care is huge. In order to help others well, you have to be in a good place and thats best accomplished by making yourself and your needs a priority. I hope its a really great week! Rachel",,"Mentor 2022-11-08, 13:13: Hi Madison! My name is Rachel and I am happy to meet you, I am looking forward to getting to know you while we navigate through the modules. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Rachel :) Mentor 2022-11-19, 09:56: Hi Madison, I hope this message finds you well, please let me know what module you would like to start with. Your teacher is hoping we will have this completed for January. I'm more than happy to assist you with it getting it done. Hope to hear from you soon! Thanks. Rachel Mentee 2023-01-05, 21:05: Hi Rachel, it's Madison Hughes from the SEEC program, sorry it's taken me this long to get intouch with you. This is all new to me and I'm not the greatest at technology. I'm just starting math 11 online as well. A little about me, I'm 16, I live with my mom,dad and younger sister. I have a 9 month of lab and a 6 month old kitten I just adopted before Christmas. I love music, art, poetry and writing. I struggle in school I have a learning disability in math and English and I have loss of hearing in both ears which I should wear my hearing aids but don't. I struggle with anxiety and depression. I want to go to post secondary school to take the sign language interpreter program. I can't believe next year I will be in grade 12, not going to lie it gives me a lot of anxiety just texting it to you. Thanks for taking the time to be my mentor. Madison Hughes Mentee 2023-01-05, 21:05:  Mentor 2023-01-05, 21:16:  Mentor 2023-01-06, 11:05: Hi Madison! Its so nice to hear from you! Dont worry at all about taking a little time to reach out, life happens! Thank you for sharing a little bit of info about yourself. I""ll share a little too. I'm a college student, in my last semester for the social services worker diploma. My plan is to get my bachelors degree and go into policy making in the future, hopefully I will be able to help change some of the ways we give support and resources in the future. Thats my goal anyway. I'm a mature student so I did things a little differently than most. Raised my children and then went back to school. I love animals too! I have 2 dogs that are very spoiled. I also enjoy the more creative things. I paint for fun, I started with really bad stick figures and have since graduated to pretty trees. Thats a great goal that you have, I've been lucky enough to see a couple of interpreters during concerts and the energy is so amazing. I totally get the anxiety and stress that comes along with new experiences and starting to navigate things on your own. Please know that I'm here, I'm more than happy to help and I'm excited to learn right along with you. This is my first time being a mentor and I'm a little nervous too. Its a new thing for both of us! You can reach out anytime and I will answer within a day or two at the very most. When you have a chance, let me know what module you would like me to open first, I hope you have a really great day! Rachel :) Mentee 2023-01-13, 13:46: Hi Rachel! so nice to finally get the conversation started between the both of us, I would really like to start with finding inspiration - if thats even where we are supposed to start , if not please let me know where! thak you for sharing about youself by the way - madison :) Mentor 2023-01-15, 13:11: Hi Madison! How are you? hope your having an excellent weekend. I spent mine on homework, reasearching the practicum placement that i'll be doing overseas,and spent some time with friends. I opened finding inspiration for you. I will also take a look at it today. Approach it however feels the best for you. Feel free to reach out with questions, thoughts or whatever you would like to share. I'll respond in a day or two at the very most. :) Rachel Mentor 2023-01-24, 16:30: Hi Madison! Thats awesome that you got this all figured out, I like the methods you use to motivate yourself! Both have a number of benefits and can actually be great ways to center yourself and de-stress too. Something you can maybe keep in mind when you come up against something that seems like it might be out of reach, Theres really nothing that cant be figured out, some things take a little longer than others, but theres aways a solution of some kind. I find motivation by staying organized and using visual tools (white board, calender on my phone) as reminders of what I need to get done and when it needs to be ready. I do this so that I dont forget things or get overwhelmed due to time constraints. Ive also tried to make it habit that the if the thing I need to do takes 10 minutes or less, I just do it immediatly. It seems to give me pretty great results and helps me be able to focus on the bigger tasks better, since im not worrying about all the other little tasks i need to do. My motivation to become a social worker comes from a few places, Ive always gravitated toward helping professions. I was a care aide for elderly patients, with a specialization in dementia care. I worked with the disabled and the very young. It was sort of a natural progression for me to move away from the medical end of the spectrum into human services due to the nature of the work. I have an interest in social justice and the general betterment of society. I'd like to help make a difference in whatever way I can, social work will let me do that. My inspiration to continue comes from the knowledge that my children are watching, I want to set a good example for them too. It does help that I truly enjoy learning what Im learning, thats a huge motivater all by itself. Honestly, procrastination is absolutely a thing I struggle with sometimes. I mentioned the 10 minute habit above, that really helps. When I have a lot on my plate and find that Im procrastinating about school tasks specifically, I actually just sit down with my computer and kind of make myself go through the task lists for each course im in to double check where im at. If I have to do research, I pick one topic for that day and spend at least an hour on it. That's an awesome goal! You've totally got this! This week I will open up different ways of knowing. Let me know if you have any questions. Have an amazing week!! :) Mentor 2023-02-23, 13:02: Hi Madison! I absolutely know what you mean about the weather. It really does have a mind of its own. In a week we went from +8 to -31. Its sunny today but cold. Thankfully warmer days will be here sooner rather than later! Im so glad you enjoyed this module. I think self care is super important. You cant give your best in anything if your pouring from an empty cup. Its awesome that you know when your mood is getting low, I think some people struggle with identifying that in themselves. Knowing where youre at internally definitley makes a world of difference in addressing those feelings and making positive changes. Getting outside is my number 1 go to for stress relief and mental wellness, but there's quite a few other things I do as well. Music is a big one, its almost always on. I like it loud too. I cant always have it cranked, so I am very attached to my headphones. I also enjoy art very much. I draw and paint and crochet. I've been making terreriums lately. I have a friend who makes these super cool insects out of wire and crystals and beads, I build them enviroments in jars and bottles with different things Ive gathered up. Its a fun collaboration. I also like to journal. I think self care is a really personal thing and journaling gives you a way to kind of look back and say, oh hey.. Ive felt or thought this before, or this is the same but the way I feel about it has changed. Its a good tool for insight into yourself. The next module I will open is dis and misinformation. I hope you have a great week!! Rachel Mentor 2023-03-07, 11:19: Hi Madison! Glad to hear you are taking good care of yourself and successfully identifying the need for a mental health break! good job! As far as this weeks subject matter, I think there is a huge amount of dis and misinformation out there, its really great that you have the ability to identify and weed out the stuff that is probably not accurate. Its always a good idea to critically think about the information that is being presented to you, and by questioning it for validity you are actually teaching yourself skills that will allow you to more easily and readily identify info that might be suspect. Part of the college experience is identifying what critical thinking is and how to action it in your day to day. One part is questioning who provided the information, and why. Whats the motivation behind sharing a post or an idea? Does this support information on this subject that has been scientifically proven? stuff like that. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether or not something has a basis in fact, In that instance it is best to do some independent research and use your ability to discern truth from fiction to formulate an opinion. I will open getting hired next, I hope you have a really great week! Rachel Mentor 2023-05-27, 17:09: Hi Madison! My apologies for the later reply. I've been up to all kinds of cool stuff! I'm glad you have been able to enjoy the nicer weather. I just got back from the practicum portion of my learning journey. I got to go to New Orleans, Louisiana for a month and learn about the history,culture and connect with some of the vulnerable populations down there. It was an absolutely amazing experience. I also completed convocation for my program. So now it's time to get to work! Absolutely feel free to message anytime you have time or inclination. As far as advice this time, I'm gonna go with.... have as much fun as possible while the sun shines! It's super nice to hear from you and I hope you have an excellent week. Rachel Mentee 2023-06-28, 14:23: hi rachel! its been a while but today is our last day of classes are today! and im so excited for summer, i hope you are too! i know im gonna spend my summer hiking and being outside. it was so great to have you as my mentor, i appreciate all the good conversations we had, you honestly gaave me alot of advice that i still use today! i hope you have a great summer! -maddy Mentor 2023-06-29, 08:14: Hi Maddy! Happy summer vacation! I hope its absolutely awesome and you enjoy it to the fullest. I'm so glad I was able to give good advice that was actually helpful. Feel free to reach out over the summer if you like. I also very much enjoyed getting to know you. Thanks again for being the best mentee! Rachel","Mentee 2023-02-06, 15:42: Hi rachel! hope your week is going well! seems like the days are getting a litte longer which meaans springbis hopeully coming soon :) the jolly jumper was really popular in hy household too i remeber it was my little sisters favourite. the three things i like about living in a rural area is sense of community, peace and quiet, and well being. the sense of community on saturna island is small but extremely welcoming, the locals are nothing but nicee most of the time. peace and quiet is pretty self explanatory, dont get me wrong i love the busy loud city but its a nice break to come here and just be alone with myy thoughts for a couple days. and finally well being, this is mostly apart of peace and quiet but i find that the outdoors aspect really bennefits my mental health. the things i dont like are pretty imited but isolation and limited things to do are big part of it my question to you is what do you like and dislike about living in the city? hope you have a great rest of your week!","Mentee 2023-03-06, 11:25: hi rachel! sorry for the late response i decided to take a mental health break last week. but i'm back! and we're going camping tonight wish me luck in the cold. i opened dis and misinformation and I started with ""do you think you are a safe consumer of media content? and have you ever been drawn in by misinformation?"" i think i am a pretty safe consumer of media most of the time, but during times likee the weekend i catch myself over consuming things like social media, despite that i dont really think ive ever been drawn in by misinformation, ive kinda always been aware of misinformation on social media sites. And ""how prevelent is dis-and misinformation in your world compared to mine?"" honestly misinformations spreads lik wildfire among highschool students as you would imagine. hope youve had a good week!","Mentee 2023-05-24, 16:04: hi rachel! lol its been a minute, we've been taking advantage of summer being basically around the corner and havent been inside at all. my teacher told me to ask you some questions to fill in time between now and summer break, bujt at the moment im kinda blanking so how have you been? what have you been up to? is the weather just as nice as saturna or do you haave any new advice since we last talked. hope you're doing well!",,

It was a pleasure having this VERY long talk show with you; it was the most entertaining way of communication I have done. I hope you continue working hard and enjoy your time in school! I know you'll do great if you decide to go into post-secondary, and who knows, if I ever meet an ""Artemis"" at UBC, I'll be thinking whether or not that is you! I'll miss my internet bestie a lot :'( If you wish to continue with the conversation modules, just let the program know, and we can continue together &lt;3 If not, I hope that you learned a few things, and I hope that in your own time, you can google schools and complete the ""Post-secondary and career planning"" in your own way. Enjoy your summer and best of luck :D One final time: Over and out, Mattea &lt;3 Mentor 2023-06-22, 12:53: P.s, If you have the time, please complete the survey! It doesn't take long, and the survey helps the program decide what to improve. Mentee 2023-06-28, 14:21: Hello for the final time. Its been an honor being here and talking with you! You've helped more then you know this year and I'm greatful to have gotten someone with the same interest as me. Maybe well randomly meet sometime in the future, possibly during our post-secondary years or at a Taylor Swift concert. Whatever the future holds I wish you the best of luck, who knows maybe we'll end up working in the same school. I'll miss you tons, best internet bestie ever! Thank you again for everything. Have a wonderful summer! Love always, Arty Barty life of the party. Over and out &lt;3 (Thanks again Mattea, you truly don't understand how much you've helped me.)",,,,"Mentor 2023-05-25, 14:25: Alrighty! Welcome to part three of our talk show segment, where we will discuss post-secondary and career planning! So, I do recall you prefer to do less reading, and unfortunately, to do this module properly, you will need to read. I know. It sucks. However, it is helpful because I did something similar in high school and still think about it. To give you a quick rundown on what I am currently doing in university, I am nearing completion of a Social Sciences and Arts Bachelor's degree in History and Humanities. With this, one of my options is to become a teacher (since history is a teachable subject), and I'll need to do a program where I'll be receiving a certificate to become a teacher here in BC. --&gt; The first ""read the text"" link will direct you to what a Bachelor's, Certificates, and diplomas mean. Three reasons why I think post-secondary is beneficial (based on the discussion prompts): 1 I think whatever you decide to do, you'll rock ;) 2 As long as you have a paper with any post-secondary education, you'll be able to have more opportunities open for you. 3 Post-secondary is stressful, but you learn to develop personal skills such as multi-tasking (even with procrastination) and balancing life-school and work. A few stressful things: 1 Mean professors. Unfortunately, there will be professors who will be rude. However, ""rate my professor"" after the semester is over is a great place to write a bad review on them ;) 2 Workloads can be a pain. The amount of writing I did for my degree is A LOT. Solutions I found useful are purchasing Grammarly and using this software for citations called ""Zotero"" (for free). (write them down for the future because they will save you LOTS of time and stress ;) ) 3 Finding the balance between school, social life, and work. After working in retail for three years, I quit because it was too much for me. I ended up finding a job as a tutor through my university, and I like this job because they prioritize education and are aware of student stresses. So, if you go to a school farther from home, I recommend finding a job through the institution that you are at. The WorkBC website is fun because there are quizzes for people to see which type of career suits best for them if they still need to learn what they want to do. One of my results was a teacher, so I am close to what I was planning on doing for my career. For the anchor 1 activity, you will need to do all this. But don't worry; I promise it's entertaining to view results you did not think about before. I am aware I wrote wayyyyyyy too much. So I will just stop here and wait for your reply. I recommend doing the workBC activity, then checking out what education (e.g., Bachelor, certificate, diploma), and write it down in your following response &lt;3 And see if, in your answer, you can respond to the first 2 out of the 5 prompts just like I did. Since you're not in post-secondary, imagine the benefits and stresses you may find yourself in. Over and out, Mattea :3 Mentee 2023-05-30, 11:25: Hi! Its great to back (talk show talk lol) Anyway, I took the quiz you suggested I take and I'm happy to say it suggested I become a teacher of some sort. I feel like thats the profession I'll hopefully end up in. Either that or something to do with psychology. I know it says dream job and a more grounded job, but I have no clue what a grounded job for me would be. I chose both Elementary and Secondary School teaching. They both require about the same things Secondary: - Bachelors Degree in education (arts or science) - Provincial teaching certificate - Specialized training in their subject area Elementary: - Bachelors degree in education - Provincial teaching certificate - Past experience working with children or youth or volunteering in schools (I'm assuming you already know all of this) Benefits from attending post-secondary school: First off, I'd be the first one in my family to attend higher education after high school Two, I'd have more work opportunities Three, I'd be able to follow my dream job of becoming a teacher Challenges of attending post-secondary 1. Getting into my first pick schooling. I realy wish to attend UBC but their exceptance rate is terrible for the people of BC. 2. I have no clue if my grades will cut it. I'm not the smartest, the only thing schools might be interested in is the fact that I native. 3. If I decide to take a gap year I feel I'm less likely to get accepted if I take a gap year. Finally for my question ( i have more but I'm being rushed to go) Whats the most important thing I should know before attending post secondary. Im out (: - Arty barty life of the party Mentee 2023-05-30, 11:25:  Mentor 2023-05-31, 11:50: Hi Artemis! I was so happy to see you respond :D That's awesome that you also got ""teacher"" on the quiz and that career was something you were leaning towards. I think you would be a fantastic teacher ;) Suppose you end up planning for the provincial teaching certificate. In that case, my advice is that you'll need experience working with children, even if you do not want to become an elementary school teacher. I learned last year that the teaching program requires work or volunteer experience as a requirement, so if I could change anything in my post-secondary experience, it would be to start earlier my experiences. Also, the earlier you start with these types of experiences, you'll see if this is something you want to do or not. You and I are pretty similar! I, too, will be the first to complete a post-secondary degree! For this reason, we should not give up on our dreams because these are achievements that will motivate us in the future &lt;3 I noticed that you chose the name Artemis for yourself, which is a powerful name! If you don't know already, the Greek goddess, Artemis, was the twin sister of Apollo. Unlike her brother, she was a hunter on the ground, which meant she had to face many challenges that never led her on a straight path. Her journey is like yours. She never gave up despite the obstacles in front of her. So, if you have lower grades than you would like, try your best until you graduate! UBC has a written component on their applications, and if you write great answers, the institution might accept you over someone with stellar grades but bad answers. As for the gap year, I heard people were having issues, not because of the university, but because of their motivation in classes--so, work on procrastination ;) --&gt; I got better at this, but it was not easy, haha. As for your question, I do not have a proper answer. I wish I did because it's easier, right? But every experience is unique to everyone, and the struggles that you might have, others won't. In this case, the most important thing you should know is to keep an open mind and prioritize yourself to balance life and school. Our anchor one discussion has answered the rest of the discussion prompts. So for anchor two, let's split it up and start with a list of schools and write the pros and cons. Then, write why your first choice was the best pick for you. The best way to figure this list out is to check the universities' websites and browse what they offer and where they're located. Here's my example: Simon Fraser University (SFU) Pros: Close to home, do not need to pay rent, transit is accessible, food options are good, work opportunities and mental health resources. Cons: I do not live on campus, so I miss out on the university's culture (football games, social events, etc.); the friends I make often live far away from campus (e.g., Surrey --&gt; an hour's car ride from the campus on a good day); and I am not involved in clubs, etc., and I wish I were and I blame the pandemic for that. But why did I choose to go to SFU? It was mainly because it was close to home, and I was saving money while going to a reputable university. Also, I went to Langara (a college in Vancouver near UBC) in my first year and knew I wanted to transfer after a year to SFU. I went there first because I wanted to transition between high school and university and get away from people I had known since elementary. HAHA It was the furthest college away from my high school, and I didn't need to leave Metro Vancouver. Once again, sorry for the lots of reading you'll need to do. XD Over and out, Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-06-14, 15:59: Hi again! I hate to say it but I don't have the time to do the proper reasearch for pst secondary schools. We've gotta leave for the ferry in the next five minutes. But I've thought about going to uvic or ubc. I have a native background which helps with my tuition for uni. I should do more research and I plan on doing so but for right now I am unable too. I really wish to try and stay in BC for post secondary, I've never thought of leaving BC. Sorry to cut this conversation short but I must go. Also I love to read so don't worry about long text. Till next time. -Artemis :) Mentor 2023-06-15, 12:22: Hi Artemis! Whenever you have the time this summer to research on post-secondary schools, I highly recommend it! The second part of the anchor two discussion is relatively straightforward after you research schools. However, considering that we won't have many sessions left to look at each other's messages, perhaps look into admission requirements for UBC or UVIC. For example, when I went to post-secondary for Langara (into the arts and social sciences program), I had to have completed Pre-Calc 11, Social Studies 11 &amp; 12, English 12, One Language 11, etc. While I was in high school, the curriculum program was different and changed entirely the following year I graduated. However, some requirements, like English 12 with a minimum of C+, probably remained the same. Message me when you can! After your next response, I'll open up the ""wrapping up"" activity so we can say our final goodbyes &lt;3 I'll miss writing to my internet best friend ;) Over and out, Mattea &lt;3","Mentor 2023-01-17, 11:37: Hi Arty! I know I told you I'd open up a conversation, but I COMPLETELY forgot to ask you which one you're interested in. I noticed that this conversation module won't require too much of your time, so I hope you'll be able to do some of it! The video is repetitive, so you'll get the gist of the questions even if you watch half of it. Here is what I brainstormed to help you with this part before watching the video: Morning workout Pilates, yoga, cardio Journal writing Travel videos/vlog videos Photos on Pinterest (aesthetic photos help sometimes...) Organization Heartfelt stories Having nice nails that I do myself I say brainstorm random tidbits, no matter how ridiculous they may sound. Mine sound pretty basic and random, but they're what inspire and motivate me. Can't wait to see what you have written down and what questions you choose from this first anchor conversation! We can move on to the next if you don't like this module; just let me know which one you're interested in. But let's have at least 1 conversation module that's fully completed! - Mattea :) P.S I LOVED MEETING YOU YESTERDAY &lt;3 Mentee 2023-01-24, 09:27: Do I have to watch these videos? why couldn't there be a pdf like something for me to read? Mentor 2023-01-24, 11:19: Hi Arty! So, unfortunately, for this first video, there is no option to just read through it. Watch at least five minutes of it, and you should be okay to continue on the first set of questions (perks of having a mentee who is also supposed to watch the videos). And also, you don't have to do all questions, and you can only do one if you'd like! I'll give you a life hack when I, too, don't feel like watching videos for classes: for example, the second video is on YouTube, so if you watch that video on YouTube, you'll see three dots beside ""download."" You click on those three dots, and there will be an option for ""transcript."" Click on that option, and now you can read the video instead of watching it. As I said, for the first one, there is no option for a transcript... I checked ;) Hope this helps &lt;3 - Mattea Mentor 2023-01-24, 11:20: I meant to say ""mentor"" and not ""mentee"" in my message. My grammar is not the best either. haha Mentee 2023-02-07, 11:07: Where do you find motivation to do the things you do and where do you typical find the insperation for your activities? (god it feels so formal asking questions like this) - Artemis Mentor 2023-02-07, 16:42: Hi Artemis! Glad to see your question :) My means of motivation changed since high school. For example, I motivate myself by waking up at a reasonable time and starting my day with something productive. While I do, I make myself a coffee, which inspires me to continue with my to-do list for the day and take things easy. When I was in high school, this was NOT the case. I used to crunch everything fast to watch my favourite show with my best friend. Sometimes my friend would come over with her homework and crunch together. Though, I slowly learned through time that habit was horrible going into post-secondary. But I wouldn't change it because of all the fun we had ;) These activities do sound formal, so ... let's try to use our imagination and pretend we're on a fun interview show and respond with fun answers (that still make sense with the topic). But you could also make up your own question too! For example, here is my question to you: If you were not in school right now, what does a day in your life look like, and what would motivate you to do those things? After this, the second anchor activity is fun to do! It's about goals, and the video does have a transcript for you to read if you watch it on YouTube (the hamster video). So with your following response, try to answer my question that I wrote to you (it could be very short if you like), and perhaps look into one of the questions (or your own) from anchor 2. After that, we can move on to any other conversation you like. Just be sure to let me know so I may open it up :) I also want to say you make me smile whenever I see your messages!! I can tell you're awesome, and don't stop being awesome ;) Mentee 2023-02-13, 16:21: Going to Seec has definetely changed how I get up in the morning cause its not the same as main stream. Waking up at the Hollow (main cabin) is more like waking up around all my roomates. It takes me a bit to wake up because I am definetly not a morning person (I have like three alarms set). When I finally wake up I just get ready to walk down to the school which is probably about a 15 - 20 minutes away. Get dressed, pay a visit to the people in the Hollow (we have seperate cabin to sleep in and seperate bathrooms), only if I wake up early, then do makeup. I really wear too much but it's how I express myself. If I were out of high school it would probably be the same, I don't really have anything that motivates me, music gets me in a good mood but I don't know if it motivates me. I really enjoying messaging you here I just wish we could've continued our conversation we had during that call thing. And sharing pictures would be nice too cause I've got three pets that I'd think you find adorable. Do you like dogs and or cats? Never asked. Off topic, but side questions are nice. Talk show vibes. &lt;3 Mentor 2023-02-13, 19:39: Hi Artemis! That day in the life is very interesting compared to mine! You sound like you're in Camp Rock (if you know that film from Disney) but with school involved. That's alright though! It's still an interesting and unique experience! :D I love that you do full-face makeup when you can. I used to do it back in high school too, but mine was the typical (bad version) 2016 makeup. I was in grade 9 back then, but I thought I had to do those thick eyebrows. I joke now that my eyebrows were the first thing you'd see, and then the rest of my face. I was a theatre student back in High School, so I expressed my love for makeup there too. I loved doing special effects makeup, SPECIFICALLY zombie makeup for our Halloween event. That was my favourite thing, 100%. Otherwise, a good makeup day is definitely a motivator in itself. ;) Not to mention, a good music playlist makes the day even better. So I would agree that music is a motivator. It boosts your day and makes you feel like the main character. I would agree that call was fun! I loved messaging you for a bit and talking to you about stuff irrelevant to these conversations! To answer your question: I used to be full 100% a dog person, but there's a cat on Instagram (Stepan from Ukraine) who I am obsessed with, so I like cats too. 60/40 ratio (dogs more than cats if I had to say which one I like more). But to connect to our motivation conversation, I cannot own pets in the building I live in, so my motivator would be to own a place where pets are allowed and hopefully have a job someday that will financially allow me to own a pet too. Let me know which conversation you'd like me to open next! (Or should I say our next segment on our talk show ;) ) One more conversation, and then you finish two conversations your teacher required you to do for your class! Hope to hear back from you after the commercial break ;) - Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-02-21, 15:37: I love Camp Rock! I know most Disney Channel originals past the 2000's, my favourite has to be Lemonade Mouth. When I was in mainstream school I was in theatre productions cause I was too scared to actually be an actor, but you could consider me to be a theatre kid too. In elementary I used to use acrylic paints before I had real makeup, definetly was terrible for my skin. I used to listen to Megan Trainor as I practiced my ""makeup'. She was my idol I swear I was obsessed. I didn't grow up with music too much cause if I'm gonna be honest I was a poor kid before I hit highschool so my family didnt't have money to afford stereos and such. Oh you also brought up ukraine, kind of, but I am actually Ukrainian and am currently trying to learn the language. WOOOO! Anyways could we do Strategic Studying next please and thank you. Bye for now! Mentor 2023-02-24, 13:56: Hi Artemis!! You're becoming more iconic to me with each message I read from you. Lemonade mouth is a BOP. I still randomly sing their songs since they came out. My favourite Disney channel film is HANDS DOWN High School Musical. Oh geez. I remember watching the final film in theatres. I swear the obsession with this film was wild. People brought in posters to the movies! I went on opening weekend, and people were sitting on the STEPS inside the theatre! Definitely not possible these days with pre-paid seats. I love that you're also a theatre kid. I did both backstage and acting. I loved them both equally &lt;3 My favourite production is when we did Game of Tiaras. Think about Game of Thrones with Disney characters (but the non-copyright version, haha). I was one of the Snow Queen's soldiers. It wasn't a spectacular show, but it was definitely entertaining. I agree that makeup is better than acrylic nails. Acrylic nails damage the nails so much, but it's a bit different with makeup. My go-to artist while doing my makeup is ABBA. I would say ABBA has similar vibes to Megan Trainor, and both have sing-a-long bops. I'll be completely real, the only time I would listen to music as a kid would be in the car with the radio. I, too, started listening more in high school. Spotify wrap has been helpful so that I could see how many new artists I listened to. Maneskin has been my current number-one artist for the last two years. I'm so happy for you that you're learning Ukrainian! Slavic languages are pretty hard to learn, so I hope you stay motivated! I still struggle with Croatian even though I have spoken it since birth. However, I can't imagine not speaking Croatian now that I'm older. Slavic cultures are so much more beautiful when you can also speak one of its languages. I recommend learning about Slavic mythology! It's super cool! In Croatia, the god of thunder was called Perun, and people say that where his lightning bolts struck, iris flowers would grow for his love Perunika. I loved this story so much that I have an iris flower tattoo. I hope that you learning Ukrainian will lead to other passions for you &lt;3 I'll write another message once I open up ""Strategic Studying""! Over and out. - Mattea :)",,"Mentor 2023-02-24, 14:20: Hello again! Welcome back to a BRAND NEW conversation module ;) --&gt; see what I did there? Haha. The video is brief, and it explains several (6 in total) different ways of studying. If you ask me, you chose a perfect conversation module because it's helpful. If I were you, I would take note of each method and what it does so if you're struggling with studying, you can look to your notes for help :) When I was in high school, I found myself doing more recall studying methods. These days based on the video, I see myself doing spaced practice, words and visuals, and I sometimes still do recall. The most important thing I found listening to this video is that your learning methods don't mean your studying methods will be the same. And I can 100% see that with myself. While I don't mind listening while learning, I love adding visuals when I study. What strategy do you think is the most useful to you? Or, is there a helpful strategy you do that is not in the video? I can't wait to hear your answer! And make sure to respond with a question you would like answered for the following segment ;) (This question could also be from the discussion questions list). - Mattea &lt;3 Mentor 2023-03-03, 13:44: Hi Artemis! I wanted to check in and ask what's up :D My last message was relatively formal compared to our previous conversation in the previous conversation module, but I hope you are okay with it! If you are interested, on March 7 from 5-7 pm, there will be another ""video chat with your mentor"" opportunity! You mentioned you enjoyed the previous one, and perhaps we can discuss ""strategic studying"" more there if you like &lt;3 Don't give up! You're almost done!! And then you can look back at this and think, ""wow. That was something."" Haha. Our next segment is waiting. So don't wait too long ;) - Mattea &lt;3 Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:13: My life being like a wattpad story is for sure wack but good wack. Back to what I'm actaully supposed to do, I haven't properly studied for something since grade 7. I know thats real bad but I've got stuff going on always. I usually study for history test but not much because I've got most of the lessons memorized by then. Mentee 2023-03-07, 14:05: Watching the video I've thought that the Elaboration and concrete examples study strategies would work best for me. what strategies do you find helpful for studying? Mentor 2023-03-09, 12:09: Hi Artemis! I wanted to tell you I'm sorry for not being able to attend the ""video chat with your mentor"" event. I had new assignments come up right after I asked you about the event last week. I hope you still attended and got to do some fun stuff &lt;3 I'll be completely real with you; I don't remember studying much in high school too. I was good with history (which is why I'm studying it now at university), but I only remember studying for biology and French tests. Based on that video, I was doing words and visuals, and I often did recall for those biology terms, and I usually just did recall for my French class. I'll tell you a funny story, but this is not to encourage you to do the same!!! When I was in grade 12, my French teacher was so chill because we were a very small class size since you were no longer required to take a language in grade 12. So for some of the tests, my best friend was a genius in that class, so I sat beside her, another friend sat beside me, etc. We made a line beside one another and slightly tilted our papers so the person beside us could see. It wasn't 100% cheating since we all tried and got different results. But sometimes French was complicated, and that little help was needed. My one friend got caught because they thought if they skipped test day and went into the hall on another day, they could use their google translate. The reason why they got caught was that they got 100% using the google translate app even though they only knew ""bonjour."" LOL, but I want to say that I did study regardless! Don't take my funny story the wrong way. My French teacher tested us orally to see if we knew or didn't know at random moments, not on official test days. --&gt; That's why I still got an A in that class. Haha While I'm in uni, I recall less than I used to, but I find myself doing a combination of all the strategies mentioned in the video. If I had to choose one that's my strongest, concrete examples strategy is more and more helpful-- just like your answer ;) I definitely recommend practicing this strategy if you plan on going to post-secondary. Many arts and social sciences classes require you to demonstrate, explain, and understand. What strategy do you think is the least effective for you? Enjoy your Spring Break (if you guys have one)! I'll talk to you soon &lt;3 - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-03-13, 15:10: Least affect, everything. It's hard for me to remember information unless I'm interested in the topic. We do have spring break and it starts next week. This is short cause I truly don't know what to say. Mentor 2023-03-14, 17:05: Hi Artemis! That's alright if you don't know what to say :) I hope your Wattpad moment is more relaxed than a week ago! Let's make the question different. What would you say is your favourite topic you have done so far in school and found yourself studying the most? Now let's connect this further with our previous conversation module on motivation: How did that topic you enjoyed most motivate you to study? For example, I enjoyed (method 3) asking, explaining and connecting events when I studied for my social studies test when we learned a unit on Napoleon. Since I loved learning about the French Revolution, I did not find studying so difficult in contrast to math. But this studying to me did not feel like studying, compared to when I told you I remember doing more studying for French and biology. I hope this change of direction will help you with your response! - Mattea &lt;3 Mentor 2023-03-28, 11:27: Hi Artemis! Thought to pop in and see how was your Spring Break. I hope it went well and that you got to take a little break. Soon summer will be here, and things might get better :) When you can, I would love to hear your answers! I miss seeing your messages &lt;3 Talk to you soon, Mattea :D Mentor 2023-04-04, 11:06: Artemis!!! I am so very happy to hear back from you &lt;3 I'm glad things got much better recently :D I can already tell the tea is pipping for that next book ;) At least your cousin tried giving you a suggestion! But hmmmm. Go more imaginative. For example, where do you see yourself a week after that math test? If math doesn't have much involvement in that future vision of yours, then put in enough effort for that feeling of success on your math test. In February I was in the hospital twice from food posioning, and that same week I had my midterm that I coudn't reschedule. I only put in enough effort that my brain could handle, and I was very very very happy with a B. I still wanted to achieve some success, so I aimed to study just enough. You get what I'm trying to say here? Perhaps for studying you could try out the Pomodoro Technique on the link above. Time yourself, and see how much you can complete in short intervals. GOOD LUCK &lt;3 (Update me how it all goes ;) ) - Mattea :D Mentor 2023-04-12, 11:29: Hi Artemis! I thought to pop in and see what is new! Have you tried the Pomodoro technique yet? I heard it's good. I tried it myself this past week, and it depends on your study subjects. When you're writing academic papers, this doesn't help as much, but it got me more focused. Talk to you soon &lt;3 Over and out, Mattea B-) Mentee 2023-05-24, 15:31: HIIIIII MATTEA!!!! It's been forever. Hope everything is going well with you! Little update Darrin, our first teacher, is gone entirely. Mr. Pendergast, our principle, is now our primary teacher. Me and my bf are doing great. I turn 17 in 3 months which is crazy. Gotta start looking at colleges and unis. Kind of nervous for that. That leads me to ask, could we open up post secondary and career planning. I'll be able to do maybe 2 more modules before school comes to an end. Can't wait to get back to our little talk show, sad its must come to an end in a month. -Arty Barty life of the party &lt;3 p.s. Whenever we go to do our ementoring I tell everyone I'm going to talk to my bestfriend. lol Mentor 2023-05-25, 13:44: Hi Artemis! I am so happy to hear ANYTHING from you &lt;3 I won't lie, you made me tear up when you mentioned the best friend part &lt;3 You're super sweet!!!! I am glad a solution was made for your class, and now that it's almost the end of the school year for you, I hope nothing more bad things will happen. That's awesome that you're turning 17 soon and excited about it!! 16-19 were my favourite years as a teen. That's when I felt like an actual teenager having fun. Hopefully, you'll have an even better experience than me ... especially since you have a bf! But remember, don't let your bf refrain you from what you want to do ;) These are peak years in your teens!! Haha I am glad that you want to do at most two more modules! I'll open the post-secondary and career planning and message you again. Over and out, Mattea :D",,"Mentor 2022-11-09, 14:14: Hi Artemis! Nice to meet you!! Love your name! And I'm happy to be your mentor! You made my day when I read you want to be a stripper if all else fails. I couldn't stop smiling! My friends and I joke about the same thing. We underestimate how much money they make. :'D I enjoy reading about your interest in careers. They're diverse, and yet, they all connect. Definitely (no bias involved... maybe), you should do something in art or teaching. ;) Or both! Art history is a thing, and it combines the two! My majors and the topics I'm taking intersect quite a bit. Though, if you want to study art history as a major and want to move to Vancouver, I know UBC has it! At SFU, where I go, it is slightly different. While art history as a discipline does not exist at SFU, there is a concentration that allows students to learn art and materials culture. I'll be completely honest with you; I prefer that over just art history as it is. If you're interested in learning how art history is changing, there is a book I read a while back called ""Stories of Art"" by James Elkins. He's a professor in Chicago and discusses the way art history is taught and how it is ignorant. (if that makes sense) It's a short read, and I noticed you like to read, so I hope it might interest you. If you want to know more about it, let me know! Otherwise, I will not say anything else about it... I'm happy to hear that the outdoor school you're going to is healing some trauma you have. I often say that healing trauma can only go so far. Trauma will always exist in you, but it depends on how you move forward. Recently I learned of an existentialist named Jean-Paul Sartre. In one of the lengthy blurbs my professor showed us, this part stood out the most: ""existence precedes essence."" Your trauma does not define you; what you learn from the trauma after is what defines you. I'm aiming not to write too much when we begin with the modules, but if I bore you with all my writing, please be free to say: ""hey, maybe just go to the point next time."" haha I noticed that your teacher requires you to do as many modules as possible before January 1 and that you can choose which ones! So, let me know where you would like to start. Hope to hear from you soon, Mattea :) Mentor 2022-11-17, 13:37: Hi Artemis!! I hope you're enjoying the nice weather for a while before winter comes in full blast! I noticed you haven't yet responded, and I wanted to pop in and say hello again. I did look over and saw that your class is doing this program as a mandatory participation. Based on my previous experience, I noticed some conversations require less time out of your day than others. I hope that encourages you and I hope to hear from you soon! You seem like an awesome person based on the biography I have read, and I would love to get the chance to work with you a bit! - Mattea Mentor 2022-12-18, 13:17: Hi Artemis! I hope you're doing well :) I just wanted to pop in and say I wish you a great holiday! Your class is still doing these conversations, so perhaps I'll hear from you. Good luck with everything &lt;3 - Mattea Mentor 2023-01-09, 10:39: Hi Artemis! I haven't heard from you, but I hope things are going well. Good luck with the rest of your year :) - Mattea Mentee 2023-01-16, 15:14: Hey Mattea! Sorry I haven't responded to any of your messages, we've been having problems with our logins at school. I am ready to start with whatever whenever. If I'm gonna be honest I am not the brightest person so don't expect me to know to how to use grammar properly or be able to understand something easily. I might have a learning disability who knows. Also last thing, I'm really not really great at art nor is it something I wanna pursue. But I'm interest in learning more about the female sex organs. Did you know that we know more about male sex organs then female sex organs. I wish to help others understand more about the female body. - Arty Barty the life of the party Mentor 2023-01-16, 15:29: Hi Alyssa! Or would you prefer to be called Artemis? I'm so happy to hear back from you finally! I understand about technology issues! I have them all the time... I wanted to reach out to you right away, but if you are okay with it, I will start the modules tomorrow! Honestly, don't worry one second about grammar. I'm in my fourth year at university and still suck at it. Now that I know what you meant-- I can 100% about how we know more about male organs than female. ... Like, how could a male possibly know so much about female bodies?! a little bit suspicious if you ask me... I'll be on the ""meet your mentor live"" for a bit tonight, so I hope to meet you there! - Mattea Mentor 2023-01-17, 11:40: Hello Arty!! In case you didn't see, I opened up a module! Let me know what you think. I have already started a conversation on it to help you get an idea :) I hope that helps! - Mattea Mentee 2023-03-06, 10:49: Hi! Sorry for my absence I was at home last week. I promise I'll get started with the study module soon. My life has been pretty wack recently almost like I'm living in a wattpad story. I'll start soon I swear. &lt;3 Mentor 2023-03-06, 11:13: Hi Artemis! I hope all will be well soon! Wattpad in real life is way too unhinged. My whole February felt like one too... Take it easy, and update me sometime next week if you need more time &lt;3 - Mattea :) Mentor 2023-04-03, 13:14: Hi Artemis! I must admit, I miss receiving emails that you responded to these conversation modules! I hope you're okay, and know that I can also be your virtual friend along with being your e-mentor &lt;3 You don't need to respond to the conversation module, but a quick little update is perfectly fine :) When you're ready to respond to the conversation module, I'll be here to respond soon after I see the message. Enjoy the sunshine, rain, wind, or anything else that makes you smile &lt;3 - Mattea Mentee 2023-04-04, 09:57: Howdy! I'm back from spring break and my wattpad story has taken a really good turn. New love interest has been introduced, weathers changing, everythings in bloom, and seasonal depression is ending. I feel a new book coming out. I would love to expand but I feel I should answer the question before I explain my life recently. I don't really have a favourite topic in school, favourite subject yes. Socials was one of my favourites, aside from english, my main way of studying for that was just taking notes and rereading everything the night of the test. I swear I passed with flying colours everytime. I'm currently struggling with getting motivation to do math and study for before june 20th. If you've got any suggestions or tricks or hacks for me that'd be really helpful. All my cousin has given me was trying to get into post secondary school but that doesn't help me and my brain. Hope all is well and swell with you! &lt;3 -Arty Barty, life of the party Mentor 2023-04-17, 14:05: Hi Artemis! I hope you're doing well still &lt;3 I wanted to message you again before it has been two weeks since I heard from you. Since we last spoke, I hope you have found a good way to study for your classes! I totally understand if this is why you haven't answered yet :) I'll tell you one good and bad thing that has happened to me so that you don't feel alone with whatever you're struggling with (school, life, etc.). Good thing: I won second place in an academic essay category recently! That's the first award I have ever gotten so far at university. Bad thing: I won't be able to visit my dad and my other family members in Croatia this summer. (My parents have been separated since I was 5, and my dad left the country when I was 8. I don't often go to Croatia, though I wish I could. The last time I went was in 2019.) Over and out! - Mattea :D Mentee 2023-04-18, 14:17: Hiiiiiii! I know it's been awhile, our teacher kind of disappeared. We'll be informed of what exactly happened wednesday. First off, congrats on getting second place! Second, sorry you're unable to visit your family in croatia. My parents split when I was young too and my father moved but not to another country, thankfully just another city. But I do understand the annoyance of having family far away, my grandparents live in America. Hopefully you'll get to see them later this year. As for your study advice, my cousin recommended me a focus app to help me study thats similar to your suggestion. It's this like flower/tree planting thing, I would check the name but theres a teacher hovering over my shoulder who got annoyed with my bf picking a playlist for me. I don't what else to bring up I feel theres more but I can't think of anything. All I can think about is how annoying teachers can be, I can't even talk to anyone rn, I didn't even do anything. Whatever. hope everythings going alright with you! &lt;33 -Artemis :) Mentor 2023-04-19, 12:51: Hi Artemis! Oh, how happy I am to hear that you're okay &lt;3 We all got parent issues these days, eh? XD I know exactly which app you're talking about! You'll have to let me know if it's helpful! I have an iPhone, so I usually use ""do not disturb"" mode, which usually helps me. I hope your teacher is okay! That's crazy that it happened to you late in the school year. Just enjoy your class as much as you can &lt;3 We are officially done with two modules! Congrats!!! It's an awesome accomplishment because not only did you rock with these responses, but you always tried your best. That, to me, is the biggest accomplishment &lt;3 Is there any other module you would think could be useful? Or any more questions on motivation and studying? Let me know when you can! Our talk-show series is nearly at its end ;) - Mattea :D Mentor 2023-04-26, 12:54: Hi Artemis! I hope you're doing better and that your original teacher is doing ok :') I totally get how chaotic these events might be, so if you happen to see my message, know when you have the time to let me know whether you'd like to do one more module. If you do not wish to continue, I need to open up the ""wrapping-up"" activity, which is the official end of this mentoring program between you and me. I'll totally miss writing to you! Initially, you barely answered, but after a while, you were great &lt;3 I'll also miss your school life updates. I hope you and your bf are doing well &lt;3 Talk to you soon, Mattea :D Mentor 2023-05-02, 12:25: Hi Artemis! I wanted to see how you're doing. I hope everything is alright! Let me know whether you want to start another module or wrap up. Over and out, Mattea :D Mentor 2023-05-15, 10:59: Hi Artemis! I hope you're enjoying the summer weather we got going! I definitely feel much better with the sun out :D Once again, I wanted to pop in and ask if you would like to do the ""wrapping up"" activity, which is a final activity for goodbyes. I hope everything is alright on your end &lt;3 - Mattea :) Mentor 2023-06-07, 13:50: Hi Artemis! I just wanted to see what's up! You mentioned wanting to do two more conversation modules, but school is almost over! Hopefully, you'll be able to at least finish this unit on ""Post-secondary and Career Planning""! Based on my understanding, unless you want to continue with the program when school finishes, that too can happen if you wish. Talk to you soon, Mattea &lt;3",,,,,

I looked into the first anchor text and it got me thinking a little bit about my how my own values have influenced by career path. A big value of mine was always being kind to people and helping anybody in need, and I feel this is a big reason why I'm aiming to do something in the healthcare field where I can work with injured or sick people. Go ahead and work your way through the first anchor text and discussion questoins and feel free to share your thoughts with me or ask any questions!

Go ahead and try that out! Let me when you are done or if you need any help! Mentee 2022-12-01, 09:51: Some of the values expressed by the speakers in these two videos were the nurse was ahppy togive back to her community up in fort st. Johns and to be a role model for other girls and young women that are going into university, and the doctor had a balance of free time and work while livivng in a rural area in british columbia where he could work and have time to have fun I did not learn anything knew about my career choices share: what do I value in life? I value my Family and my Soccer career How do I want to contribute to my community and the world? I want to contribute by Coaching and mentoring people in soccer Soccer coaching can be good for me in my future i love to do tactics to are unique and a good playing style to feel different and to play different, maybe bring back Total Football and play a high paced possesioned game where all the players can play with the ball and play like a team and not suround one player with the team Mentor 2022-12-04, 23:18: Awesome! I used to play soccer too and loved it! It's great that you value your family too along with your soccer career. Being able to give back to the community by coaching is defintely a genuine and awesome thing to do as well and its great to hear you want to do that. It could also be cool to pursue things like kinesiology where you could train and help up and coming soccer players with their bodies and injuries. Love the thoughts on coaching a team game rather than focusing on one player like you said, I always wished coaches did more of that when I was growing up. Good work with the first anchor text! Work your way through the second anchor text, which involves a couple quizzes, and share your thoughts with me about the discussion questions!

Below is the part 1 of our first conversation that your teacher wants us to cover. I've decided to break the conversation into a ""part 1"" and ""part 2"" so that you have time to respond to the first set of Discussion Questions from Anchor Text 1 without feeling overwhelmed. Please read through the discussion questions for Anchor Text 1, as well as the prompts I've written out below, and write responses in whatever way you feel comfortable. This is quite an important topic when we consider the cultural diversity of North America today, and I personally love how this conversation challenges us (me included) to really direct how we think and why we think the way me do. Despite us both being from the same province, we live so far apart, and as a result must have had quite different upbringings. I'm really curious to read how your cultural environment helped shape the way you think and come to ""know"" things! Not sure if my own experiences will be very interesting, but I'll do my best?? Conversation 1: Different Ways of Knowing, Part A = ""The 6000 Year Old Village"" This conversation explores the importance of respecting cultural differences in ""knowing"" and learning about the world. As Canadians, the structure of our education system is inherently ""western,"" meaning it has been based on Western European cultural norms. As a result, we learn throughout our school years, from kindergarten to grade 12, that we can only truly ""know"" things when we've gathered enough evidence through the scientific method. While this is a great way to learn about the world and ourselves, a huge flaw that, historically, has caused a lot of conflict between cultures is when it's assumed that there is only one way to emerge into a sense of ""knowing."" Question: How do know that the things you beleive are true? How to you prove or disprove your beleifs? My Thoughts (feel free to respond to this question yourself, but don't feel pressured): Over the past few years I've come to beleive in subjectivism, meaning that I don't beleive there are objective truths that are universal-- or, in other words, ""constant across people, cultures, and the world in general."" I was brought up in a religious, Muslim family, so a huge part of my upbringing was the beleif that the universe had a set of laws that were pre-determined at a point of creation, and were the same for everyone. Now, I don't really beleive this is the case. I beleive that ""truth"" takes many forms, and aside from scientific constants, there is variability in reality: e.g., an experience that is very real, intense, and animated for one person may seem ludicrous to another. In day-to-day life, I do beleive that the scientific method, and empirical research studies are the best way to come to general agreements on what ""truths"" can be commonly accepted as valid, but I don't think that this should limit what individual people know is true for them, based on their own life experiences. Discussion Questions - Over Time &amp; Between Cultures: - (NOTE: there are more discussion questions listed, but we're only required to choose a few. Please respond to/ share your thoughts on a minimum of 1. If you want to discuss more, feel free to do so) Question 1: Consider the quote, ""I think it's hard for a lot of people in the industrial world to understand the connection between people and place."" How do you think the connection to place differs from a rural environment to an urban environment? My Thoughts: as someone whose lived in both a rural and urban area, I definitely feel that there is a separation from both the land and other people that comes with the city life. Where I'm currently living, the vast amount of people constantly moving to the city for new job opportunities and higher education creates an ongoing sense of competition: people work longer, study longer, and stay isolated from friends and family longer, all while competing for new opportunities. Although I love how the city constantly motivates and challenges me to be the most productive and creative version of myself, I definitely do feel a difference between now and when I lived on a farm. In a natural setting, there seems to be a greater unionship between oneself and the Earth: the Earth provides everything needed for the sustenance of human life, and the more we rely on it, the more we feel how intertwined all life on Earth is. In my experience, the urban lifestyle promotes individualization, while on the other hand, being is more secluded, rural areas promotes interconnectedness with others and the land. Question 2: Consider your connections to the place you live. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change the way we treat the land? My Thoughts: Yes! I've always been really fascinated by anthropology, and I was so blessed to grow up in close proximity with Salish Nation, where elders taught the community ancient stories of what is now Vancouver, as well as the ancestral heritage of living in coexistence with the land. Additionally, since my religious upbringing stresses that the world is ""one nation,"" I was always encouraged to live in union with the Earth and all other live forms on it. I feel that ""humanizing"" the earth (I guess you could call it that) through story telling is a practice as old as human life itself, and it certainly leads to a more ""mystical"" relationship with the world. From the ancient Mesopotamians to the Aztecs to the Scandinavians and more, all indigenous people groups around the globe have created personifications of aspects of nature through deities, gods, and stories; from these stories, rituals have been made to respect and care for the Earth. Although the scientific revolution in the Western world, brought about by the Age of Enlightenment, has made our modern world possible, I do feel that it's lead to an increasing separation with the folktales that traditionally kept people connected to their land. YOUR TURN: (I hope I didn't ramble too much) After reading through the questions and responses I've written above, please write me some responses with your own thoughts. Remember, this is a place to explore anything, so don't by shy is when it comes to showcasing your unique takes on life! When you've done that, it's your turn to ask me questions: in the link labelled ""Discussion Questions"" at the bottom of Anchor Text 1, scroll to the second page and choose at least one (preferably at least 2) questions for me. Important: I'll be writing up some questions for Anchor Text 2 in the next day or two, and once you've responded we can move on to the activity, and then the next conversation. Depending on how busy you are, I think it's possible to finish this section in a few days. I never want you to feel like this stuff is too much work, but the sooner we get through it the more free time you'll have! If you ever need help with responses just shoot me a message here. Have a great rest of the week! I look forward to your responses. Mentee 2022-11-24, 13:30: hello jamine i just wanted to send a quick message letting you know i am working on a proper reply! ive just been very busy recently so I hope to get back to you and speed myself up especially after I quit my job (story for another day) i just thought it would be better to say im still here than to be silent for a week, anyway i hope to finish my reply soon. Mentee 2022-12-01, 13:29: Hello, again Jasmine. I just wanted to apologize again for being late. I was hoping to get back to you on time or even early but a lot of things are happening. I've now got prescribed antidepressants so that's a good thing for me, any way to the topic at hand. If this isn't how it works please correct me when you contact me next but I'm pretty sure I watch the video, give my thoughts, ask questions and respond to your questions or anything interesting with your thoughts! I'll be using the prompts to give my thoughts so I apologize for any blandness or repetitiveness, the website prompts will be signaled with [ ] and the questions you ask will be signaled with { } [What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land?] While studying the land itself after all events that it could go through itself is interesting but living on the land as the events themselves are happening gives a lot more meaning and perspective of the events and what changed due to them of course we can go back and relive that but we can guess the main effects and events that occurred but knowing what happened definitively is near impossible [Consider the following quote from Dana Lepofsky: “I think it’s hard for a lot of people in the industrial world to understand the connection between people and place.” How do you think the connection to place differs from a rural environment to an urban environment?] I think a lot of it has to do with where you were raised and the emotional connection you have with it, I think the connection someone can have with the land is not affected too big amount by the rural or urban environment it definitely plays a part but the way you are raised and the people you have around you, the connection to a place to me is what you do or experience there if you had a bad experience in a city then you might not like big crowded cities and would prefer small local communities, [Consider your connection to the place you live. Do you know any stories about the land or territory where you live? How might knowing the stories of the land we live on change the way we treat the land?] I live in I would say a more rural than urban area so I know people who care and treat the land amazingly, especially the ones who garden but with me knowing the stories would not affect the way I treat the land itself I don't really know how to be more respectful than I already am and I doubt I would go out of my way to do things for the land I'm just not that kind of person but I never litter and respect it by just not damaging it. [Why do you think “scientific” knowledge and “traditional” knowledge are often seen as in conflict with each other? Have you heard stories, other than this story of the archeological project in Hauyat, that show “scientific” and “traditional” knowledge working together?] There is a difference between the ideals of a traditional story and the truth of science while both can mix I find it more effective knowledge about the truth of the matter, I still love hearing the stories of the land and the idealization of the land that the stories describe from the people I meet, but in my opinion its all on perspective again your brain thinks of how it was raised (I'll answer this too) [How do know that the things you believe are true? How do you prove or disprove your beliefs?] It's complicated I base most things off what I've seen or read I strongly believe that there are many things it's all in the way we word it, facts I believe are unable to be argued or changed, truths are all in perspective it may not be able to be changed in the heads of other but it isnt something that is set in stone it can change take the dark matter as an example as a truth we know it exists and does things we don't understand, as a fact we are currently unable to understand what it is or what it does yet, but as just idealization, they can believe what it does what it is but there is no real proof behind it, I don't want to be offensive but a religion in my eyes is a big idealization they believe a lot to be real with no real proof but a lot of it is just faith.\ I'll ask a few little questions what's your connection to the land you live in do you feel the same way I do or different? What’s your opinion of the way I think with my facts idealizations and truths do you agree with me or not? What similarities do you see in yourself and me with the way we both think? What do you think of the place you grew up in? Do you have good memories of it? What about the place you live in currently? How different is the connection between the place you grew up in and the place you live in currently? Before I send this off I just want to re-apologize for my sloppiness or slowness I am really hoping to get back to you quicker next time ill just hope for the best! Your mentee Xavier Mentee 2022-12-25, 18:57: Hey jamine merry Christmas sorry I haven't been doing anything I've been distracted a lot lately, actually I'm struggling mainly terrified I won't get my capstone done before the break is over I haven't worked on it at all and I need it to grad but I can't force myself to get it done even if needed so I was trying to but off everything untill I get it done... to no avail either way I hope you had a merry Christmas and enjoying the warmer weather after that cold snap I've been planning to ski very soon and I hope to do that but my capstone must come first! I doubt we will be able to get the work done by the end of the semester and to that I apologize my bad and I thank you greatly for sticking with me even with the lack of work i did I hope you enjoyed the year as much as i did Mentor 2022-12-25, 23:58: Hey! Merry Christmas, first of all. I see you're pretty stressed and I want you to know that everything is going to be alright. I didn't want to bother you over your holiday, but if I knew you were feeling this overwhelmed I would have reached out sooner. Please don't worry, I will help you through this (and try to enjoy your holiday without thinking too much about falling behind, because I'm sure you'll be able to make it). Please remember that, while I would like for you to engage with the material, you don't have to write responses that are absurdly long. Try to just get your thoughts across on my prompts and send them over, and then we'll move on to the next conversations. If you want, you can also send me a picture of your school schedule so I can make you a plan of what you should complete for this program and by what date. Scheduling is key to finishing, and if you're feeling overwhelmed I think this could really help you. I'll go ahead and write the next prompts in advance so that when you're ready we can move on ASAP. Go out and enjoy your holiday! I recommend setting an hour aside to just do some deep-focus work on this course so you can finish :) Mentor 2023-01-05, 12:56: Hello Xavier, I just wanted to let you know that I've made the next conversation, ""Strategic Studying,"" available for you. I'm going to post my prompts for you momentarily. Now that you've completed the first conversation (congratulations by the way!) I encourage you to attempt the Extention Activity. In doing this, you would connect with an elder, grandparent, or someone in your community who has the life experience to offer guide ace and support to those around them. More inforamtion can be found in the link titled ""Extention Activity."" Hope your week is going well, and please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need help with anything or are feeling overwhelmed. Best wishes.",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-01-05, 12:59: Conversation 2 - Strategic Studying Hello again! I hope your first week back at school hasn't been as mentally draining as mine. Below are my prompts for our second conversation. If you need any help just shoot me a message! Warm-Up Reflection Questions: NOTE: I’ll be sharing some of my thoughts on what has and has not worked for me in terms of studying techniques over the years. This is just a prompt to give you an idea of some completely normal student challenges. I’d be more than happy to hear some of the challenges you may have had in the past with school, how you overcame them, and what you would do in the future to prevent similar obstacles. However, this part of the conversation isn’t 100% necessary for you to engage in if you’re uncomfortable: One of my most challenging experiences in school was finals season in my first semester of college. I had been studying engineering, and as someone who had excelled in high school quite easily, I overestimated my academic abilities and enrolled in way too many classes to handle. A significant contrast between secondary and post secondary school that I’ve noticed is the difference between how long you can postpone studying without there being any noticeable affect on your grades: in high school, I was able to cram a few days before my exams and still score well, however, in college I soon learned that the large and detailed amounts of information presented in a single class make the class content nearly impossible to retain in less than a week. Ever since my experience during finals in my first semester, I have kept a detailed daily schedule that allows me time slots to exercise, study about 3 subjects (daily) for 2-3 hours each, cook and eat, and socialize. In making such schedules, I have been able to keep ahead of the assigned readings from each class by at least a day or two, which gives me the opportunity to clarify any confusions I have with the professor during class hours (meaning I can save time and skip office hours, which I typically use to socialize or start assignments). In this current semester, I currently have more on my plate than I’ve ever had, so I’m trying to make a decent sleep schedule so that I don’t have to spend so many hours in the morning half-asleep, surviving on caffeine. Discussion Questions: as before, I’ll propose a few of the discussion questions with my own views. Please respond to a minimum of 1 of my prompts. I think that this conversation is of particular importance— especially if you ever decide to pursue post-secondary education, it’s important to have an idea of how you best retain information before you go further in your education. Question 1) Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? My Answer: I currently use every single one of the study methods mentioned in the video. As I mentioned in the warm-up, I use to be a notorious crammer, but since i started college/ university, cramming has proven itself completely ineffective if your goal is to even get a C+ in a class. I typically structure my study time so that, in the few hours I spend studying for a particular course, I can utilize about 3 different study methods: my fav Orion the are Elaboration, Dual Coding, and Retrieval Practice. I find that it’s best to use one or two methods consistently, and use the others passively. For example, when I make notes from a lecture or my textbook (I write my notes on my iPad) I’ll take pictures of useful images (e.g. of the human brain) and insert them into my written notes, while also making labels to explain what’s going on in the image. The process I use when implementing Dual Coding is “passive,” because it doesn’t really require me to retrieve information from my memory and actively engage with it, but I find the images very helpful when I look back on course material to study for exams. I find Elaboration to be one of the most effective methods for active engagement with material, and I use it when writing all of my notes: when I read a paragraph in a textbook, or listen to a lecture, I will then use my past information on the topic to write a summary of what I’m learning. Then, I insert the summary at the bottom of a page of notes. Using these skills, I have found it easier and easier to maintain a high GPA. For students who are use to cramming, or use to trying to simply memorize information, it can feel overwhelming to attempt these study methods. However, after practicing these methods for a few weeks, class work and material just becomes so easy, because you begin retaining information extremely well. Question 2) Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. My Answer: I find Retrieval Practice to be the most effective strategy of all studying methods, and this is the method that if scientifically proven to be most effective for exam preparation: when you force your brain to recall previously-learned information, you are actively engaging with concepts and, in repeating the information to yourself, you are enforcing what you already know. Question 3) Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? My Answer: I think note-taking that is active and engaging is a great way to study because you can interact with course materials while note-taking while simultaneously preparing a guide to study with for exams. When I make note for a class, I like to make them in a flash-card format on Quizlet. This way, when an exam is approaching, I can quiz myself with notes that my professor or the textbook have provided, so I know that I’m studying exactly what I’m going to be tested on. Please note that passively copying things from a textbook, or passively writing what a teacher says is NOT effective. Rather, after reading a passage in a textbook or listening to a lecture, think about what the words means and write the information in your own words, while highlighting and defining any key terms. This method of note-taking is extremely effective because it works in a similar way to retrieval practice: it forces you to recall what you’ve just learned, and apply it (when you re-write it). Mentor 2023-01-12, 12:11: Hi Xavier! I hope you're doing well. The beginning of the new semester certainly has me tired, but I'm finally starting to settle into the rhythm of things again. I'm just reaching out to see if you need any help with the next conversation. I realize that I sent all of the prompts at once, just because this conversation seems a bit shorter than the one we previously completed. I understand that all of the content I sent may seem a bit daunting, so if you would like us to go over it together please let me know. If you're having trouble, I'm open to us setting a time where we can both be online and finish the conversation through this messaging feature. Best of wishes with school and recreation, and please don't ever be shy to reach out! Have a great week. Mentee 2023-01-20, 17:20: Hello Jasmine, I am currently working on the discussion you last sent. I am still stressed over ending classes, as we start new classes at the end of this month. I have been receiving a plethora of emails/messages bringing to my attention the opportunity to keep in touch and work on the discussions even after my class ends. I do wish to keep in touch with you, and though I feel disrespectful for leaving you with no messages for a long time, I still think it's important to finish what we started. What are your thoughts? Either way, whatever you may choose, I am going to try to finish this next discussion topic, but I cannot promise a specific time that it will happen. I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Xavier",,"Mentor 2022-11-07, 23:13: Hi Xavier, this is Jasmine! Your teacher assigned me to work with you to complete this course (by January 20th, 2023), so I just wanted to introduce myself! Since this is the beginning of a new chapter in your high school career, I guess this course might seem like a bit much. I've been looking through the conversations that your teacher has assigned for us to cover, and I think we'll be able to cover some really interesting topics that might interest you (based on what I read on your profile). I saw on your profile that you're quite artistic, and that some of your career interests are in fine arts and therapy. Since I'm a psychology major I think I could definitely give you some tips on how to pursue either of those career paths, so don't be shy to ask me anything on your mind! Also related to therapy, I saw that you're interested in learning how to be supportive of/ help your friends deal with mental health. I'm not sure if there are any specific topics you'd be comfortable with sharing, but based on my knowledge, and the knowledge my professors have shared with me, I'd be more than happy to pass some strategies onto you. Remember that everything we talk about is confidential, so you can share whatever you want, judgment free. Anyway, that was a pretty long introduction, so I'll just quickly touch base about what your teacher has assigned: firstly, please make sure you get a chance to read the ""how the program works"" section, and get back to me whenever you're ready so I can start opening up the conversations. Luckily, your teacher didn't load up a huge amount of ""Conversations"" to cover, so we're doing a total of 6 out of the total 13 conversations (and we gotta finish by January 20th, which shouldn't be a problem). Also, if we finish early and you see anything interesting that you wanna further explore, just let me know and we can do that too! I hope you have a great week, and I look forward from hearing more about your interests and what you'd like to get out of this program. Chears. Mentee 2022-11-14, 11:48: hello jasmine, I'm Xavier nice to get to meet you! sorry for taking so long to reply here I had problems with my account login but that's all fixed up I'm hoping I can answer more (and more accessible since I have the app now) I didn't have much that I thought up to put into my profile and anything I say to introduce myself will probably be a repeat so don't hesitate to ask questions and ill do the same I'll make sure to keep in mind the confidentiality of our conversations because as much as I could share I wouldn't cross any lines for the things my friends told me to keep secrets but having strategies would not be a bad thing at all hope we will be able to talk about all the things the teacher assigned to me ill double check with how the program works but I think I was informed enough by my teacher to have a well enough grasp I'm sure we will be able to have all the topics done by then and maybe there will be more I find out through this experience I hope to be able to answer more quickly next time Mentor 2022-11-17, 11:44: Hey! Don't worry about late responses, this time of the school year before holidays is always a bit hecktick. I'm glad to hear that you're comfortable with the introductory material, and I think we'll be alright with opening the first ""conversation"" that your teacher wants you to cover. I've taken a look at the first conversation on the list myself and written some questions for the material (I think I'll upload them for you tomorrow, so you can expect to get some notifications from me). Feel free to take a look through the conversations yourself, and don't be shy to let me know if you have any preferences to what you'd life to cover first. Also, if we finish anything early and you're interested in dabbling in some of the other topics, feel free to let me know and we can do that casually. Anyway, I hope you have a great weekend coming up, and I look forward to hearing from you some time next week with your responses! Mentor 2022-11-26, 18:27: Thank you for letting me know that everything's going alright. I hope you don't feel overwhelmed by any of the material. I'm going to go ahead and upload part 2 of conversation 1 just so you have access to it, but please take your time and don't feel rushed. Looking forward to reading your responses! Mentor 2022-12-03, 12:26: Hello, Xavier. I hope you're feeling well since starting a new prescription. I know that it can take a few weeks to feel completely settled on antidepressants. Especially when starting a new medication I try my best to spend as much time outside and active as possible, just so I don't get lethargic. Anyway, it's totally understandable that you've been busy because you seem to have had a lot going on for you. Thanks so much for sending me such detailed responses! They definitely gave me a small glimpse into who you are. This post will be in the following format: I'll respond to your responses, answer the questions that you sent me, and then I'll post the questions for the second video along with my prompts. You can then get back to me in the same manner as you did in the first response you did (followed up with some questions for me at the end). After you get a chance to go through all of the questions I will send you my answers back, and then I beleive there are some independent exercises your teacher wants you to do on your own-- although I have to double check before I write to you next. My Thoughts on Your Responses: #1: I agree with your point about living on the land, as opposed to studying the land, gives a greater understanding of one's environment. One of my professors (from Madagascar) taught children in Sub-Sahara Africa for several years. While studying geography he described the structure of mountains to the children, and explained what mountains looked like. The children were able to answer questions regarding goegraphical structures like mountain when writing exams, but when they were shown actual images of mountains they were blown away-- despite the fact that they understood what a mountain was from a theoretical perspective, they had not been able to conceptualize the concepts at all! This is a rather drastic example, but I think that we've all experienced something similar to this: it's challenging to fully appreciate something unless we've experienced it. #2: I like your point about the people/ social upbringing you're raised around can have a greater impact on one's relationship with the land than whether you're from an urban or rural background. I'd have to agree with you. I do beleive that different geographic environment expose us to different cultural experiences and different survival challenges, which both shape our relationship with the land. However, at the end of the day, how we're raised by our parents and community have been scientifically proven to have some of the greatest impacts on our personalities in adulthood. #3: I can understand why having a ""folk lore"" type knowledge of the land you live on may not affect how you treat the land. I think for people who are more ""evidence-based"" or ""fact-based,"" stories don't have a huge affect on how they think or behave. However, looking at a cultural experience in childhood, I certainly do think that the emotional experiences evoked by storytelling can impact a person's relationship with anything-- including the land. #4: I totally agree with you about our cultural experience during ""child rearing"" (the immersive socio-cultural process we're exposed to during infancy and throughout childhood, which shapes our personality) being what shapes how we think. That being, whether we apply a more ""traditional"" or ""scientific"" way of thinking. Personally though, I see traditional knowledge of not so much a ""way of knowing,"" but rather ""a way of discovering."" Have you ever heard the saying ""philosophy is the mother of all sciences?"" Basically, this means that man kind's curiosity, inclination to ask questions, and try and create answers through logical reasoning are what created scientific thought. I think that traditional ""ways of knowing"" are a part of the process by which people make discoveries, although they often don't go further to ask questions about ""why"" things are the way they are. #5: You're very right in saying that ""truth"" is subjective: how people interpret, process, and apply information is based on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the culture they were raised in, if they've experienced childhood trauma, theological background, etc. However have some uncertainty regarding if ""facts"" are as ""set in stone"" as was once thought by science, because new research so often provides data contradicting old data. It's very difficult to be 100% certain of things, and many people would argue that it's impossible: even many scientific theories with a plethora of supporting data must be taken with a pinch of salt, and beleived with a dose of faith, because it's not entirely possible to consider something absolute. My Answers to your Questions: 1) I try to stay connected to the land by seeing myself as a part of it: we are, after all, evolutionary products of the land that we're on. The land is also our provider: food, oxygen, liquid water, appropriate temperatures needed for life, etc are all provided by the Earth. I do my best to have as much respect for the land as possible, because in the absense of it's health and preservation life as we know it would end. I spend a lot of time in nature learning about my environment, such as the chemical and medicinal properties of plants and fungi, how to forage for food, and ecololgy, and ""respect the land"" by practicing a low-consumption lifestyle. I'm not sure how similar we are in terms of our connection with the land because I haven't met many people who geek out about nature the way I do: a lot of the people I meet respect the land for spiritual or religious purposes, and connect with it through ritual, but for me it's really just out of scientific curiosity. I do find the historic stories and rituals behind earth-worship interesting, but I don't really find them productive or meaningful in my life. 2) Personally, I try and stay as neutral in my beleifs as possible: i try to remain ""data based."" When I choose to beleive something (take Darwin's Theory of Evolution, for example), I am actively deciding that there is a greater amount of supporting evidence that overrides any remaining uncertainty. However, I remain ""neutral"" in the sense that I am aware that contradictory evidence exists, and I am willing to change my opinions in the event that an opposing argument one day becomes more powerful than my own argument. To be completely honest, there are some things that I just beleive because it's impossible to either prove or disprove: in situations where there is just a rabbit hole of rebuttals and support in constant conflict, I either don't pick a side, or I choose a side based on evidence that makes the most sense to me. I think we're quite similar in how we're both fact-based and I beleive this is a good quality to have in a world where everything is becoming increasingly polarized and politicized. Being ""fact based"" as opposed to ""opinion based"" can really protect us from a lot of conflict, in my opinion. 3) I personally love where I grew up becasue everything in the lower mainland is so accessible. I can be in a decently sized city, and an hour's drive away I can be in literal wilderness. I've lived in quite a few different areas in the lower mainland (Surrey, Langley, Vancouver Island, and Vancouver) but to be completely honest, they're all very similar. The differences in socioeconomic status definitely created educational barriers in some areas, but because of how close everything is I was never isolated completely from the opportunities I desired. Anchor Text #2: My Thoughts on the video: In the video, Jeff Ward speaks on some major differences between Western and Indigenous forms of knowledge, and how he has been impacted by being raised in a bi-cultural family. I certainly thought he had many interesting points that contrasted the foundation of the two cultures quite well, but I personally think that despite all the differences, there are still more similarities. Basically, I think that people like to accentuate what makes their culture unique, but when you look at the behaviour of different ethnic and cultural groups throughout evolutionary history, we all behave very similar and hold beliefs that don’t differ too greatly on a fundamental level. I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on this matter (if you’d like to share). Maybe take a moment to think about your own culture in comparison to others around the world, and ask yourself how different they are. In many cases, I find our clothes, forms of music, religions, etc to appear different at first glance, yet around the globe these are still cultural creations that all humans partake in. Discussion Questions: (I’ve written some prompts for a few of the questions. Please respond to a minimum of 1) #1: What do you think Jeff is trying to accomplish with this talk? What attitudes do you think he is trying to change or challenge? If he successful? I felt that Jeff was trying to educate the general public on aspects of Indigenous Canadian cultures that have been erased due to hundreds of years of British and French colonization. When a culture has nearly been eradicated, and the only remaining history of that culture has been documented by a foreign party (in the case of Indigenous Canadian history, Europeans), it shouldn’t be surprising that there are many misconceptions about and knowledge-gaps about the culture and its people. I feel that some of the only representation that has put the spotlight on Indigenous cultures has been Hollywood, which of course, is not a reliable source of information. Although Jeff didn’t mention this in the video, one major misconception most people seem to have about the Native population of North America as a whole is that Indigenous peoples never had any written system. Many people don’t even believe when they learn that Natives in modern-day Mexico, Southern Texas, and regions across South and Central America had very organized systems for written languages, astronomy, and mathematics. Information in Canada regarding any first-hand written documents from Indigenous people is a lot more scarce, but South American anthropology certainly makes me wonder about how much we don’t know. Overall, I think Jeff was successful in driving home the point that Indigenous cultures are a lot more complex than more people are aware, and that Western innovation is not the only form of progress. #2: Which of the Seven Teachings seemed the most difficult to live by, and why might this be the case? Personally, I find “Love” to be the most difficult teaching to live by. I know from a moral stand-point, it’s important to show everyone love, and “turn the other cheek,” so to speak, when you are wronged by others. But although I’m successful in not harbouring any ill will to people I don’t like, I’ve never been successful at showing kindness and humility to people I genuinely detest. I think this is because when we actively choose to give “love” to others in our daily life, we often leave ourselves exposed to the worst type of treatment from others who do not share our behaviour. The idea of loving everyone is nice to be, but I see it more of an unrealistic ideal that cultural moral teachings prop up. In the real world— whether modern not ancestral— I don’t see it as realistic or practical, and I think that not harbouring hate is a more attainable and safe goal. #3: Are there any Indigenous innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovations. Although this might sound idiotic of me, I was under the impression that Scandinavians invented Kayaks (mostly because they’ve always had the most powerful navies, and are famous for travelling across the open ocean in small row-boats), so I was surprised to learn they were actually a local innovation. Along with the Chinese and West Asians, I do know that Indigenous peoples on the West Coast of Canada are famous for their knowledge of plant- and fungi-based medicines. For example, Natives of Western Canadian coastal regions have historically harvested chemicals from the Ghost Pipe flower (which turns to power a few minutes after being picked) to use for eye medications. What are some innovations that you’ve heard about? Your Turn! Those prompts conclude the second part of the conversation. In your next response to me, please ask me a minimum of 1 of the Discussion Questions, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. I also wanted to let you know that your last response to me was perfect— and yes, you did do everything correct! Keep up the good work, and enjoy the rest of your weekend! Mentee 2022-12-05, 10:41: Hello, Friendly reminder to send your message in the conversation you are currently working on so that both parties are able to follow each other's responses :) Mentor 2022-12-22, 17:07: Hello Xaviar! I know you're not obligated to do any school work (including work on our conversations) during the winter break. I just wanted to wish you a happy holiday season, and check in to see how you've been fairing this winter. I know for me, as a Vancouverite, I'm not really use to it getting colder than -10 degrees Celsius, but tonight it's expected to be as cold as -25 degrees??. Anyway, I've been enjoying the change of the season and doing a lot of snowboarding, although I am quite terrible at it. What kind of activities have you been up to over the winter break? Mentee 2023-01-03, 21:07: Hi Jasmine, I hope this message finds you well. It's been a while since we last spoke, and im sorry so I wanted to reach out to see how you've been doing. Since we last communicated, I've been busy with school, I've been focusing on my studies and trying to stay on top of my coursework. and i got my capstone done which im proud of. ill watch the video and reply quickly i hope im not too far away from topic it may seem a little rushed but i am very stressed at the moment i hope to hear soon i doubt we will get through the work which isnt your fault its mine i hope to be better once i graduate. #1: I agree with Jeff's point that Indigenous knowledge and Western science can complement each other and that it is important to respect and value the contributions of traditional cultures. By combining traditional techniques with modern technology and research methods, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world and preserve and build upon traditional knowledge. #2: I found it interesting to learn about the use of controlled burning as an Indigenous innovation for land management and promoting biodiversity. I had not previously considered the role that fire can play in maintaining healthy ecosystems, and it was informative to learn about the traditional knowledge and techniques used for this purpose. #3: The teaching of ""Respect"" seemed the most difficult to live by, as it can be challenging to always show respect to others and to the world around us. This can be especially true in situations where there are conflicts or differing viewpoints. It can be easy to become caught up in our own perspectives and to neglect the feelings and perspectives of others. Additionally, it can be difficult to always stay mindful of the impact our actions have on others and the environment. What inspired you to study Indigenous cultures and traditional knowledge? Could you share an example of a time when you experienced the complementary nature of Indigenous knowledge and Western science? How do you think incorporating traditional knowledge into modern practices can benefit society as a whole? Do you think it is important for non-Indigenous people to learn about and respect Indigenous cultures and knowledge? Why or why not? In your opinion, what are some ways that non-Indigenous people can show respect for Indigenous cultures and knowledge? Mentor 2023-01-04, 12:48: Hello again, I hope you enjoyed your holiday! I’m so happy that you found the time to finish this conversation, and I wanted to give you my congratulations! I also find the Indigenous innovation of controlled fires for promoting biodiversity so interesting, because in our era, where we increasingly rely on food from grocery stores, we often forget the process by which people once had to promote plant and fungal growth. Answering your questions: 1) I honestly can’t put my finger on anything in specific that inspired me to study Indigenous cultures, mostly because I grew up in a very diverse area and was always encouraged to learn about different cultural customs. There were also lessons about Indigenous history in Canada since about second grade in my elementary school. 2) I personally feel like the modern concept of taking daily vitamin supplements, or the recent trend of using more natural medicinal alternatives for common ailments is very linked to Indigenous cultures (also, this doesn’t strictly apply to Indigenous North Americans). Tribal peoples relied heavily on the chemical properties of things that could be found in their environments, such as plants, or in some cases, the venoms of different reptiles. Since the early 1900s, the western world has gained an incredible amount of knowledge on the human body and how illnesses related to psychology, physiology, and more are causes, and as a result, how they can be treated. However, only in the past few decades has this knowledge been used to actively strengthen the immune system and prevent illness. I haven’t read many historic accounts of direct trades in medicine between Indigenous peoples and Westerners (mind you, much of the innovations of Indigenous peoples have been excluded from European accounts of history, or rebranded as European innovations), however, I think examples of Indigenous influence can still be found when we look closely: for example, aspirin (a medication used as a mild pain-killer, partially for headaches) can be found naturally in the bark of willow trees. Long before the invention of aspirin pills, Indigenous peoples would extract the bark of willow trees, boil it into teas, and use it to treat pain. 3) Although many forms of traditional knowledge do not have scientifically proven explanations, I believe that much of the information is based on trial and error, and has been passed down from generation to generation due to the fact that there is truth in the information— even if no explanation exists. It seems like there would be many potential advantages to further researching traditional knowledge to better understand why/ how such beliefs came into being: in better understanding the sources of the knowledge, applications to modern problems may be observed. 4) Yes, I do believe that non-indigenous peoples should respect Indigenous cultures (really, we should be understanding and open to all cultures). My reasoning behind giving respect to Indigenous cultures really isn’t limited just to Indigenous peoples: I believe that there is a fundamental amount of respect that people, as individuals, should give each other. Even if we disagree with a particular aspect of a culture, freedom of thought is a fundamental component to a free society, so I believe we should protect everyone’s right to practice their beliefs. I also do believe that non-Indigenous people should do their best to educate themselves on Indigenous cultures and histories for multiple reasons, such as: i) colonialism has destroyed numerous cultures and languages around the world, and with their destruction, information regarding things like sustainable living, natural medicines, literature, etc have been lost forever; ii) it’s difficult for people to empathize with what they don’t fully understand, so in better understanding the truth about Indigenous history in Canada, as well as the many cultures of our native peoples, non-indigenous people may be better prepared to take social and/ or political action in reforming policies related to the past oppression of Indigenous peoples. 5) I think that there are tons of great resources to start learning about different cultures, such as reading/ watching media made by Indigenous peoples, observing their art forms, or taking classes with Indigenous experts in a particular field (e.g. I took a few foraging classes ran through Salish Nation to learn more about identifying edible native plants). Mentor 2023-01-25, 10:24: Hi Xavier! Thank your for reaching out. I'm sorry I'm a bit late with my response, I haven't really had any access to technology these past few days since my computer broke. I was in contact with the program organizers and it seems like whether or not we continue working on this material is completely up to you, since your class will be wrapping things up soon. I personally think that the content in these lessons can be quite insightful, so I believe you would see a benefit if you decide you want to continue working on this program. However, I don't want to you feel as though it's disrespectful not to finish. If you are feeling stressed, please take a step back and look at how much is on your plate. You also have the option of writing down some of the topics in this program and researching them on your free time. If you decide you want to continue I'd be more than happy to stay in contact, but please don't feel pressured. Of the responses that I did recieve from you I can tell that you're an insightful person, and it has been great getting to know you!",,,,,

I definitely don't have the skills to play running back but I definitely would have liked to try being a QB (never actually played football before though). Yeah, definitely take a look at the first text (I think it really fits into what you're planning on doing). Kinda goes over the fact that not everyone has to follow the ""traditional"" path after high school and there's many more options out there too! My goal is to become a doctor, so in order to go down that field I have to do an undergrad and then medical school and a few more years after that as well. Do you have any finals or tests coming up before the holidays? As always, feel free to keep asking me any questions you may have. Hope you have a great day! Mentee 2022-11-28, 10:22: Hey Ryan, Yes it really was. I do not anymore I played in kelowna and every where else I moved didn't have football so I sorta just lost touch with the sport and it sucks because I really enjoyed it. I don't completey understand how that post secondary thing works. Ye I am still curious about other jobs. Was becomeing a docter your first career choice of was that when yopu became more interested in life science? Is the course you have to take hard like very hard? As far as I know I do not and hopefully it stays like that:) How does Post Secondary work when are your finals and tests? how many do you have to take if you do? Sorry for the late response Mentor 2022-11-28, 17:42: Hey Seth, That is unfortunate, but hopefully, you can get to play it during PE class. Do you play any other sports? Sorry - I should have been more clear on the Post-Secondary topic. So on the big green circle (the navigation wheel) there's a whole bunch of different topics. One of these topics that I thought would be interesting is the ""Post-secondary &amp; Career Planning"" one (I hope you can see which one I'm talking about). Once you click on that it'll take you through a few slides/notes that talks about how there's more options than the traditional ""4-year degree."" In fact, one of the first websites is WorkBC which shows you how what requirements you need for your ""dream career."" I'm just curious as to what requirements you need for the career that you are choosing. It's always nice when you don't have a ton of assignments or tests before the holidays! In post-secondary, there's usually between one to two midterms/tests that happen during the class and then at the very end there's a final test. But it depends on the class. There have been times when I've only had 2 tests (that was my entire grade...) or there have been times when I've had multiple tests, quizzes, and finals. No, to be honest, Seth I realized I wanted to become a doctor probably in the middle of my second year of uni. As a kid I really wanted to be a police officer, then for the longest time, up until grade 11, I wanted to be a pilot (but then I was told there was a lot of physics involved so I didn't really want to do that)! Then I really loved dogs, so I thought I wanted to be a vet, before finally deciding that what I really wanted to do was become a doctor! There's definitely a lot of courses you have to take and there's a handful that are very tough. But eventually you just learn to ""deal"" with them ahhah. I would say there's more courses that you would enjoy than those that are tough (which is nice). Apologies for the really looonggg message but hope I answered all your questions. Please keep asking me more and I hope you were able to find the WorkBC website useful! Hope you have a great day! Mentee 2022-12-01, 22:08: Hello Ryan. I havent played any sports recently just sorta lost interest in them. Yes I think I have found what you are talking about but not 100%. I was going to do welding and what I need was grade 11 english and 11 math, in trades you dont need a lot to be able to do them and I find that pretty good ahah. Now I have decided to try and get into a program called duel credit and that allows me to get a millwright certifacate which does envolve a bit of welding and I think I will start there and then go into welding later I feel this will open my job opertuinitys. Also this will be at my home town college. Yes I am not a big fan of tests and I am very happy not to have any. I havent had school for the past two days because of the weather and temurature. So when you changed what you wanted to be did you have to completely change your courses or how did that work for you was it hard to if so or an easy process. Its all good, I love the imformation and its very helpful. I hope you have a good day too Mentor 2022-12-03, 16:52: Hey Seth, That's unfortunate that you don't play any sports recently - do you still watch any though? That's so cool you want to get into welding - one of my friends actually went into that (I think it was in some sort of shipyard though). If you don't mind me asking what's a millwright certificate (tbh all I know is that there's something called a ""Red Seal"" and that's pretty much all I know about trades, unfortunately)? That's awesome you don't have to leave too far for school! Yeah trust me I hate tests too - I wish school was just learning and a few assignments and no tests hahah! Lucky you - no school for two days! Even though I had one ""snow day"" we still had classes on Zoom :( And no, I didn't have to change any courses cause being a vet or a doctor basically required the same classes. I did have to change like my extra-curricular stuff (so say like instead of volunteering at an animal shelter I would now volunteer at a hospital and that kinda stuff). Hope you're staying warm and safe! Mentee 2022-12-05, 14:10: Hey Ryan, Yes I still watch some sports here and there and I watcha few clips of Football. I also play the football video game. Yes I would love to get into welding eventually. Millwright includes quite a few trades and I don't completely Know what it is but I can do it in my second semester and probability have it fully paid for which is good. Red Seal is basically what everyone in trades probably wants to get to it allows you to work anywhere in Canada and maybe even in the world I know quite a few trades have it. Yes I like the idea of staying Oh that sucks I hate zoom classes it's very confusing and yes I actually ended up having more days off. I had a five day weekend. Oh that makes it easier that you didn't have to change any courses. Also so if you were to become a docter and wanted to be Vet instead would you have to go back to school or how would that work? What exactly do you need to start like the way to being a docter? Like what grades would you need and classes and such? I hope It's warmer where you are and you don't have any more zoom classes:) Mentor 2022-12-07, 13:50: Hey Seth, Glad to hear you keep in touch with football in some way hahha. I was just curious do you play any instruments or anything like that? That sounds awesome that you can get paid to do it while you're still in school. I was wondering have you had a chance to check out the second website - the one called BC Education Planner? It shows you all the school's that offer the program you're looking for. I've actually personally used this website when I was in high school and had to apply to universities so it def would be a good idea to take a look at it whenever you get a chance. Staying close to home definitely has its benefits (especially home cooked-meals hahah)! So the thing is with being a doctor or vet you can basically do any kinda undergrad but the test you have to do to get into the vet or doctor school is different. So the courses I take for the first 4 years (in my undergrad) can basically be the same between both career choices. Yup - I only had that one Zoom class and was back in-person the next day. You're so lucky that you got a 5-day weekend hahah! Haven't had one of those since like high school! As always if you have any questions feel free to ask them. Hope you have a great day, Seth!",,,,,"Mentee 2022-11-15, 14:37: Hello Ryan, it's Seth. I just logged on today and saw that I have been matched with you, then I read over your bio and saw some interesting facts about you. I saw that you enjoyed watching Football and Hockey, I personally love football but never was really interested in hockey. I found it interesting that you liked Harry Potter and I really enjoyed that too, I enjoy movies like that too, fantasy and Action along with other similar themes along those lines. I also enjoy animes, the first one I watched was Naruto and then Dragonballz. I haven't really done the best in science but in is interesting to learn about your body and the bodies of other animals and to see how they function, I took grade 11 life science. I hvae a question, How has your post-secondary experiance been and what are some of the obsticals you have had to over come in school and entering? (I mean like how you applied did you encounter any problems that I should be aware of?) Mentor 2022-11-16, 16:46: Hi Seth, Thanks for the message and sorry for the late response! That's great you love football (what's your favourite team)? Yeah, I do like hockey, but the Canucks are just not making me too happy right now hahah! Yup, I absolutely loved the Harry Potter franchise (I think the books were better than movies but that's just me - what do you think)? To be honest, it wasn't until grade 10 that I actually found science to be interesting, and I think the further you move up in high school the more interesting it becomes (I hope)! My post-secondary experience has definitely been interesting. I initially started off at a smaller university before moving to a bigger one (there's definitely a lot of pros and cons between the two). I think overall there aren't any ""apparent"" obstacles. I would say the biggest thing that helped me is to plan ahead. Like if I was in grade 11 or 12 I would make sure to take the right classes that the university wants me to take so I can apply to their program (hope that makes sense). Feel free to keep asking more questions or if you want me to talk about something specific! Hope you have a fantastic week ahead! Mentee 2022-11-18, 09:58: Hello Ryan, How has your week been? My week has been pretty good so far we got wenseday off. My Favorite football team is the Kansas City Cheifs, thanks for asking. Now that you asked what is your favorite team? I loved the Harry Potter movies! Sadly to say I have never been one for reading so I have not read the books, but usally the books are better then the movies so maybe I will read them one day. Honestlly I'm grade twelve and I have not taken science this year because I'm doing all the classes I need right now to grade in the first semester. I would still say that life science is by far my favorite science when I took it I felt I would get more out of it then the other sciences. You said there is pros and cons to being at a smaller or bigger university, what would you say those would be? I took courses for trades because they were easier sometimes I think about that and I regret it because I didn't want to do much more school and think I could have a more interesting job. I believe I could have done those courses if I studied but I've never been on for studying and neither trying very hard in school. Thank you I will think about what more to ask because I am curious about what I have to look forward too. I hope you have a great weekend! I'm sorry for the late response, but I was very happy when i saw your message I feel like this could give me more insight on my future. Mentor 2022-11-18, 15:10: Hey Seth, You're a Chiefs fan? (Disappointing)! Just kidding, hahah! I'm a Patriots fan (even after Brady left haha). Fair enough, the books are pretty long and to be honest I wasn't a fan of reading UNTIL I read the Harry Potter series though. The movies are great (don't get me wrong) but I honestly think you'll like the books too. Yeah life sciences are definitely interesting but I totally understand it's not for everyone. To be honest, if I was more of a ""handyman"" I would have loved to get into trades too but it just seems wayyy too difficult for me. Honestly Seth, you have sooo much time to decide if you ever want to try something else. Like during my time in university I've had friends go from sciences to arts (or another program) and vice versa and they've been very happy about it. School is definitely not for everyone, I just personally think it would open more opportunities (just in my opinion). Some good things about a smaller university is the small class sizes (kinda like high school), you get to meet your profs on a more personal level. However, there are more limited opportunities in terms of research or involvement on campus (that's just what I found). I found the bigger university I'm in has more opportunities and more people you can meet, but unfortunately, the classes are quite big! By all means please keep asking questions and I'd be more than happy to answer them! Hope you have a great weekend! Mentee 2022-11-21, 10:44: Hey Ryan, How have you been? Sorry for the late response, anyways yes I like the cheifs and personally not like a huge fan of Tom Brady but i do see that he is an amazing QB. I want to try and read more but it's hard to keep my attention to it, I think I will try reading the Harry Potters one day I have no idea when but eventully haha. I might wanna change my plan but currentlly i'll stay on track with my origanal plan but if things do change i will keep that in mind that it is posibble, maybe I'll see if there is a path I want to go down when I get to collage or university. So why did you chose life science anyway like I looked and your bio and am still curious what you are going for like career wise. Yes thanks you I will defenitly keep coming up with quesntions what you have told me so far has opened my eyes in a way and maybe I can do more. Have great week Mentor 2022-11-22, 18:40: Hey Seth, Nice to hear from you! Love him or hate him, Brady is definitely one of the best QB's hahah. I chose life sciences cause to be honest it was the most interesting science for me. I wasn't a fan of math or physics, and chemistry didn't really interest me. So the life/biological sciences was wayyy more interesting (because often you learn about your own body too)! I'm hoping to eventually get into medicine and become a doctor (hopefully). There's definitely many different careers out there and it's a good idea to always keep an open-mind! Since we're on the topic of careers I've opened up one of the ""topics"" Post-Secondary and Career Planning. Whenever you get a chance if you can take a look at it and ask me any questions you have that would be awesome! And please don't hesitate to ask me any other questions about universities or just other general post-secondary questions! Have a great week! Mentee 2022-11-23, 21:01: Hello Ryan, Thank you for the response love that chats! My favorite postition personally is RB because that's what I played what about you? Yes life science is defneitly more interesting then the others, it interesting how are body's work and what's inside. Thank you by the way it is true that I alway's have time to change my choice on my career. I will have to think more into it. Oh thank you I will take a look into it, it could help thank you. I'm still curious what are you trying to achieve with life science like what field and what job are you trying to get because I don't exactly know where that goes? Mentee 2022-12-09, 12:47: Hello Ryan, Yes i love football. I used to play flute did that for a year or two then I tried saxiphone for a but that's about it. Do you play any? I looked at it for a bit when I was in class but that's about it never really used it,Is that how you entered your university? Yes I love home cooked meals it will nice to stay close to home for a bit longer. Oh i see that sorta makes sense. So how long is like the whole process of working your way up to being a docter? Is it very long also after you're done school what hospital would you like to work at? I do have one question how did you get introducted to this website and what made you want to mentor people that are planning to go to college? Mentor 2022-12-09, 13:06: Hey Seth, That's awesome you played the flute and saxophone - I used to play the trumpet and French horn but not anymore, unfortunately :( Yeah, Education Planner is how I had to apply for some universities but there's somewhere you have to apply directly through the school. The entire process (from university) to be a doctor can take up to 8-12 years tbh (depending on what kind of doctor you want to be). And I've honestly never thought about what hospital I want to work at and even when I'm writing this I still don't really know hahah (at this point I'm just trying to survive my finals). I actually got introduced to this website last year when they were looking for mentors. And I've always wanted to help practically anyone and give them as much advice as possible, especially in their education. I constantly tell my friends the mistakes I've made to make sure they don't do it and things that have worked out well for me. I was particularly interested in helping high school students because honestly when I was in high school I did not really have any proper guidance from teachers or anyone really that told me what university would be like or what classes I need or just general stuff after high school, so I thought this would be a good opportunity if I can help someone like yourself. I just want to say I appreciate your messages and questions and I hope you continue asking more! Have a good week, Seth :) ! Mentee 2023-01-04, 08:49: Hey Ryan, Sorry for the very late response I was busy over decmeber and I forgot to message you back in class. How was your christmas break, what did you do? Yes I was going to apply to TRU today actually after school, and I will be taking the welding course. That's a long process to becoming a docter I don't think I could do that to be honest. It's way to long haha. What are the finals are they hard? You said you made mistakes what would that include? what kind of mistakes did you make on your process of going to university? I hope you had a great christmas!!! Mentor 2023-01-04, 10:29: Hey Seth, No worries at all - I understand the last thing you want to think about over the winter break is anything related to school haha! Christmas break was definitely relaxing - just spent the majority of time hanging out with family and friends (had a huge dump of snow again so had to spend a lot of time indoors too) - what about you? Good luck with the application to TRU - I have never personally applied to that school but if there is anything I can do to help or look over your application or anything please let me know and I would be more than happy to. I'm still in my undergrad and some of the finals are definitely harder than others but I guess over time you kinda figure out the best way to study. So that's definitely a ""mistake"" I made was just trying to memorize everything, cause I feel in high school its a lot of memorizing stuff and then ""spitting"" it out on a test, whereas university tests have more ""critical thinking"" (If that makes sense?). I also made the mistake of only studying like a few days before, so that didn't help as much either. For the first year or so, I also didn't get too involved in university life (like joining clubs, activities, etc.) so although I think studying is important it's also definitely good to have a balance. Hope you had a great Christmas too! Mentee 2023-01-09, 14:19: Hey Ryan, I was going to message you at school today but it was cancelled haha Happy to hear you had a good christmas. I had a good christmas too mymom came down to see me and just spent it with my mom's side of the family. Yes about the TRU, I am worried I havent recieved an email back... The application was simple but there wasn't much to fill out I did it on this site my teacher showed me. I see thats good you got ajusted to the university life, I am curious how it will be for me. Would you recemend joining clubs? Have you joined any so far? Have a great monday:) Mentor 2023-01-10, 11:09: Hey Seth, Your school was canceled - wow lucky you haha! I had my first day of classes and I miss the holiday season already :( That's awesome to hear you got to spend some time with your mum - Christmas is always better with family for sure! Yeah, I remember when I applied for universities I didn't hear for a couple of months either. Which specific program did you apply to btw? I would 100% recommend joining clubs and enjoying university life. Don't get me wrong, I think studying is important but it's also good to have fun and join clubs or maybe even a sports team or whatever interests you (it really helps trust me)! I know we haven't really progressed with these modules but I hope that I have been of some help to you and as always please feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Have a great day! Mentee 2023-01-11, 08:43: Hello Ryan, Yes I got the day off haha, I wish I had more time off though. It's ok though after this semsester I am done school then I don't have to do anything until TRU hopefully. I agree christmas is better with family! At TRU I applied for welding and I just got a message back now I'm going to take a test accuplacter test or something. What clubs have you joined so far? It's ok I feel I have learned a lot from you and gained a lot of knowledge on how school will be and things I might encounter so I am very happy with how us talking has helped with my info on University and such. You have a great day too!!! Mentor 2023-01-12, 11:06: Hi Seth, Awesome - I'm glad to hear that TRU got back to you. I did a quick Google search for what kinda test it is it looks like it's just a standard test that goes over reading, writing, and maths (to best place you in a course). When are you are taking it? Is there like a textbook or something you have to study from? I joined a few clubs, something called PADS (it's basically a dog kinda club haha - I love dogs), a Vaccine Equity kinda club, a club for my biology program and yeah that's about it. There's definitely way more fun and ""unique"" ones. I'm so glad to hear that our conversations have been helpful - please do not hesitate to ask me any more questions too. Have a good day! Mentee 2023-01-12, 13:33: Hello Ryan, Yes there is a practice test i can do online and I also sent my transcript in. I am really excited but also worry because what if I don't pass the teast i fear to fail. Oh that's cool, I really like dogs too. I wonder what kind of clubs TRU will have and I doner if there will be any I am interested in. how was it registering for your school? Have a great day! Mentor 2023-01-13, 13:05: Hey Seth, That's great you sent your transcript in and stuff - one step closer to uni haha! Trust me, I completely understand - all tests are scary but I am sure you will do well! Did you take a look at the TRU website for the Accuplacer test? I took a quick look and they mentioned something about a free study app - maybe check that out. The good thing is that most of the test is untimed (except the English written part) - so at least you won't have too much of a time crunch. When are you writing the test btw? What's your favorite dog breed haha? I'm sure TRU will have plenty - its a pretty big school (you can always check this link out to see which clubs you might like: https://trusu.ca/campus-life/clubs/directory/). Applying for school wasn't too bad - it's just a bit of a struggle when it comes to getting classes (because they tend to fill up fast hahah). Hope you have a great weekend! Mentee 2023-01-13, 18:33: Hello Ryan, Yes I send the transcript in and it'll take a bit before they get it I believe. Yes I will be looking over that soon but my top prority is my capstone and It's due monday and I'm just touching it up because I just need to pass more courses and I'm done after this semester. I will look at it though it's very improtant too and yes i got an email and I believe I can do it anywere between the next 90 days or so when I am ready, they said it could be earlier. I love Husky's, I have a Husky wolf hybrid and I also like pugs. Yes I will look into the clubs that could be helpful. thank you! Yes Hopefully I can get my classes I want to live in the dorms with my uncle because he is going the same time I am. I don't really know what classes I should take though to be honest. You have a great weekend too! Mentor 2023-01-16, 10:48: Hey Seth, Just curious - what did you your Capstone project on? And for sure, good luck on all your other courses (I'm sure you will do well on them)! Aw that's so cool you have a Husky/wolf hyrbid (what's their name)? I have a golden retriever, named Simba (his 7 years old). I think everyone should have a dog hahah! That's awesome you get to go to uni with your uncle (always good to know at least a couple of people when you go to uni beforehand). I wouldn't worry too much about classes just yet cause I think it'll become more apparent once you have done your test and know which program your placed into. Hopefully you had a good weekend and lmk if there's anything else I can help you with! Mentee 2023-01-16, 20:39: Hello Ryan, It was on my research on TRU and for the welding program and my future career options.Thank you! Yes I love my dogs, one is Elsa, Nova, Smokey, Millie. I agree everyone should have dogs. Yes hopefully I get accepted. Me and my uncle are exited to go if we both get in. Ok thank you that helps but I can't wait to see you know. So what are you doing in school now, is there like an end of term or something? Have a Great tuesday! Mentor 2023-01-17, 10:49: Hey Seth, Oh that's nice that your Capstone project is relevant to what you're trying to do in the future! Wow you have 4 dogs?!?! So lucky hahah! Its my final semester of uni and I'm taking 5 classes this semester. What about you is your term almost done (I just started mine a week ago). Have a great day! Mentee 2023-01-25, 09:18: Hey Ryan, I am very sorry about the late response I thought i sent something but I guess I didn't send and I am so sorry. Yes the capstone helped me find stuff for the school anyways so that was a huge help. i love my dogs Haha! Yes this is my final semester and then I am done school. Mine ends tomorrow actually. Have a great day! Mentor 2023-01-25, 10:30: Hey Seth, All good - happens a lot to me too (I think I responded to a message but never actually did haha). Wow - so you're done high school tomorrow? That's exciting!! I hope I've been a little bit helpful during these last few weeks and as always even after tomorrow you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to message me (the admins will keep this connection as long as you need it for)! Have a great day! Mentee 2023-06-01, 16:25: Hello Ryan. thank you for helping me, with school and such. i just wanted you to know I got accepted into dorms and my course Sincerely Seth. Mentor 2023-06-01, 19:42: Hi Seth, THAT'S AMAZING - CONGRATS!! I'm sooo happy for you! I'm sure you're going to have a great time at uni! If you ever need any help with navigating uni or just have general questions you can always send it through here (I believe this will be open). Im honestly so glad to hear you got in! I hope you have an amazing Summer! Best, Ryan",,,,,

I'd like to talk about the ""From Rural to Urban"" section first. Living in a small town, I'm excited to move onto a big city after I graduate, but I don't know what to expect or how to approach it. Mentee 2022-12-01, 13:35: Hey! Sorry for taking so long to respond, I'm a busy guy. I just wrote my whole response here but the website decided to delete it randomly :( ANYWAYS, I like living in a small town for the nature. It's a lot prettier here, and things like hiking and mountain biking are easily accessible. I also like how easy it is to commute, it doesn't take long to travel across town, so I don't have to worry about leaving super early in the morning for school. I also like the general ""small town feel"" if that makes sense. People are friendly here for the most part, if you smile at someone walking down the street, they smile back. that doesn't really happen in the city. With that being said, not EVERYONE is friendly here. There are a lot of racist cowboys here with nothing better to do than rev their junky trucks in the school parking lot. I'd like to escape that personally, they aren't really my vibe. I also don't like how little there is to do. Nothing ever happens here, and it's so easy to get bored. What do you like and dislike about the city? Are there racist cowboys there too? Hope you have a good day :) Mentee 2022-12-07, 11:47: Friendly reminder to be cautious of which Conversation you are posting your messages in, and to send messages in the current Conversation thread you guys are working on so both parties can follow along :)","Mentor 2022-11-16, 12:29: Hi Jacob!

Let me know if there are any problems/questions completing this. Emily Mentor 2022-12-05, 21:51: Thanks for commenting on the many advantages of living in a smaller town! You also noted some very valid things that might make life in a smaller town boring. Some things that I like about the city include the diversity of food and cultures, the accessibility to recreational activities, and the convenience of transportation around town. As a student, I used public transit to and from the university every day. However, like you mentioned people in the city can be less friendly and it seems like everyone has their own busy schedule to attend to. The rent in the city has also become very expensive and the cost of living can be a huge financial burden. I personally have not encountered many racist people in the city, but there are definitely these folks scattered around town, unfortunately. Let's move on to Anchor Text 2: Same but Different!",,,,

Dirt biking with people you love to spend time with is a great way to make yourself feel better when you're feeling low. Great self-reflections! When I'm feeling low I try to go outside and enjoy the beautiful BC nature with my friends or family. Getting some fresh air and chatting with people I love to spend time with is very helpful when it comes to mindfulness, something I think that you would agree with too. When it comes to managing work and socializing during post-secondary school it sure can be tuff. However, I see my friends everyday as most of our classes are the same. I appreciate this very much. When it comes to finding downtime, it's really hard during the school year because there's always so much work to catch up on. But, I think that with a good schedule that can keep you organized and some great friends that support you everyday, it's possible to get the work done while also finding time to have fun.

Here are some questions to get you started if you're stuck on what to share: - what are your favourite past times? - how is school and outside-of-school life in general? - do you have any pets? - what do you want to gain from this mentorship program? - anything else that you'd like to share! Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:25: Good Morning Parsa My name is Owen and I am currently in grade 10. Some of the things I enjoy riding my dirt bike, quadding and snowmobiling. I am the youngest of four siblings. Mentor 2022-11-09, 15:01: Hello Owen, It's great to hear from you! Those are some pretty extreme activities that you take part in! I've always wanted to try dirt biking. Anyways, I have opened up the 'Well-Being and Self Care' conversation. You can find it by scrolling to the top of this page and clicking on it. We'll start with the first activity. Please aim to read and watch the YouTube video by the end of this week. We will also do the discussion questions together. Let me know if you have any questions or if we are going to fast/slow. I'm looking forward to hearing your responses for the first discussion question! Mentee 2022-11-17, 10:37: Hi Parsa. I find I have low energy because not enough sleep and i'm often tired. What lifts my mood and brings me joy is dirt biking with my girlfriend and friends. What do you do, when you are feeling low ? How did you manage to do your work and socialize while being in post-secondary ? Mentor 2022-11-24, 17:03: Hi Owen. How have you been? Just checking in as I haven't heard from you in a week. Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:47: Hi Parsa I couldn't get in to my mentor city because my password wouldn't work. I'm good now &amp; will be able to write you back. I will now ask you qustions on the wellbeing site. Thanks for checking in. Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:25: Hello Parsa, I have tried to message you three times. It says I have no mentee &amp; I haven't heard from you since Oct 24th. Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:57: Hi Parsa, Yes, I have saw your messages. We are done with the self care. I watched the video, sent some questions and answers from the self care module. I have moved on to the Urban questions. Mentor 2023-01-26, 23:37: Hi Owen, I think that your class is near its end with this mentorship program. I'd like to thank you for sharing your ideas and I hope you learned something new. Please let me know if you'd like us to continue our connection even after your class has finished the program and I can let the mentorship directors know. Also, if you've got any last minute questions or want any advice please ask. Thank you Owen!","Mentor 2023-01-03, 13:57: Hi Owen, Please let me know if you have seen my previous message which can be found under ""In activity Well Being and Self Care"". After you have let me know that you can see it, try to begin the warm-up activity found near the top of this conversation: ""Create a 3-part KWL Chart"". Send that over to me when you have the chance and we can discuss and share ideas! Mentor 2023-01-16, 23:13: Hi Owen, that's great! If you could send me your answers to the questions then we can begin dicussing and sharing ideas!",,,,

My name is Christine and I am currently in my final year at UBC Vancouver studying biology. Feel free to check out my profile to learn a bit more about me. I noted that you are working hard to find a career path that truly interests you. I hope that the activities we will go through will provide you with some more insight about that! I also saw that you like playing volleyball and that's amazing! I also play intramural volleyball at UBC. I play with my friends against other university students and we have games every weekend. There are definitely ways to continue volleyball after high school without playing competitively if you enjoy the sport! Feel free to tell me a bit about yourself and anything you would like me to know or want to talk about in the future before we get started with the modules. Mentee 2022-11-22, 09:37: Hi Christine! I recently applied to a couple schools, and since I'm not really sure what I want to go into, I applied for a couple different programs, including a bachelors of science in biology. Is there anything in your experience with biology that stands out as particulary difficult or interesting? Mentor 2022-11-23, 17:39: Hi Nora! A bachelor of science in biology can be slightly different for each school as the curriculum and requirements would differ. If you are interested in science in general, there are definitely a lot of other majors you can explore. There is always the option of changing your major in your second or third year if you find out you like a specific field more after taking a few courses. At UBC, all the science kids take pretty much the same science prerequisites in first year. This includes biology, chemistry, physics, and math. In second year is where we specialize in a specific major. For biology, we would have a list of core courses in biology we need to take in order to graduate. I like my major because it has a good blend of topics including molecular biology, genetics, ecology, and animal/human biology. There is also a good blend of easy and hard courses. From the courses I've taken, I realized that I enjoy genetics more than cell biology/ lab-based courses. At UBC, there is also a major called integrated science where you can pick any major you want and combine it as long as you can explain why it matches your interest and career goals. For example, you can combine genetics, physiology, and nutrition and make this into one major. It allows you to design your degree and take any courses related to the topics you choose. It may be worthwhile to see if any of the schools you applied to have this option! It's also helpful to take electives in your first year to explore your interests! For me, I took elective courses in public health and nursing which I really enjoyed outside of my biology courses. If you are interested in physiotherapy, you could also take some courses in kinesiology. Just make sure to check if there are any prerequisite courses that you need before you can take them! Mentee 2022-12-08, 10:47: Hi! I didn't actually know you could take electives in university outside of the curriculum. That might be a good oppurtunity to look into areas related to the sciences that aren't included in core courses. Am I able to get started on the modules? I don't think there's any particular order that my teacher requires us to go in. Mentor 2022-12-11, 22:31: Hi Norah, Yes! Is there a specific activity you are more interested in? Let me know and I can go ahead and open up the module! Mentee 2023-01-05, 10:33: Hi, can we start with career exploration? Mentor 2023-01-05, 14:03: Hi Norah, I have opened up the career exploration topic. Please feel free to start with the quick write-up about your career aspirations at the top, then we can start the discussion questions from anchor text 1.",,,,,

If you could start by reading/completeing anchor text one and the associated discussion questions, that would be great! If you can send me a reply with the answers to those questions, we can continue with the Conversation. Thanks, Sasha Mentor 2022-11-22, 23:32: Hi Angus, I just wanted to check in on your progress with this convseration/my previous message. Please let my know if you require any assistance or need anything! Sasha Mentee 2022-11-27, 09:36: Hello, sorry for the long delay, here's discussion question one. How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? Thanks in advance for the response, and have a nice day. Mentor 2022-11-27, 18:42: Hello Angus, Thanks for the reply! Here is my answer to your question: I do think it's fairly important to be good/adequete in subjects related to your career, however there are a couple things to keep in mind when I say this. Just becuase you are interested in a particular field of study, you may not encessarily be naturally exceptional in it's related courses. However, if it is your passion, you should try your hardest to do well in theose courses, because they may be important to your future career. For example, in high school, Math was not my best subject, I was adequete but I didn't always understand or do well on the tests. However, because I wanted to study Science in university (and eventually Paleontology), I knew I had to do well in the course. So I spent alot of time stuyding fot the course (in high school and university), knowing that it would be important to my future and my eventual career interests. I finished with a decent grades in the Math over the years and have come to actually like the subject! Hopefully that helps! To finish up the conversation, I would like you to read through anchor text 2 and complete the relevant discussion questions/assignment. Please send me a message once you've done so and let me know if you have any other queries! Mentor 2022-12-11, 16:34: Hi Angus, I hope you're having a nice December! Just wanted to check in about finishing up this conversation. Let me know once you're done (ideally before your winter break, so you won't have any work to do :)). Thanks, Sasha :) Mentee 2022-12-14, 09:56: University of Victoria: Biology: Bachelor of Science – Major Vancouver Island University: Biology: Bachelor of Science – Major Both universities are quite similar options in many ways, so I think it is better to talk about them in together. At least for the first few years (if I end up going for a Master’s or PhD this might change) I want nearby either to my family in BC or my family in Ontario, so that it’s easy to visit them during breaks. Since I think this is supposed to be about BC, I picked the two options that are closest to where most of my family lives. These programs have similar and quite reasonable academic requirements for entrance. VIU seems to be slightly cheaper, but their prices are displayed differently so that may not be true. Either one of these universities seems like it would be a good choice for me. Oh, and the career is either paleontology, which is my dream career, or something else to do with biology. Those might be too similar for this, but if I couldn’t do either of those I would probably just work in a trade or something.",,,"Mentor 2023-01-11, 18:11: Hi Angus! Happy new year, I hope you had a nice winter break! I opened a new conversation, called Strategic Studying. The conversation involves watching a short video (under 10 minutes) and answering/asking a question. We'll move forward once you've completed this. Let me know if you have any questions! Mentor 2023-01-18, 15:03: Hello Angus, Just wanted to check in on how you're doing with my last message/assignment, let me know if you have any questions! Sasha :) Mentor 2023-01-29, 13:00: Hello Angus, Let me know if you need help with anything! Looking forward to your reply :) Sasha",,"Mentor 2022-11-05, 11:30: Hello Angus! My name is Sasha and I'll be your mentor for the eMentor program. Perhaps you've read my bio but I am also very interested Paleontology, I'd be happy to discuss this topic anytime :) With regards to the program, I think it would be best work us to schedule a time for when it is best for us to work through the activities. Is there a particular day of the week and time when it would be best for you to ask me questions? If so, I will try to organize my schedule to resopnd as soon as possible. Lastly, if you could complete the Introduction Conversation, that would be great! Looking forward to getting started! Sasha :) Mentee 2022-11-07, 14:27: Hi, this is Angus. I'm assuming that this message as the Introduction Conversation? The afternoon on most weekdays works fine for me. I mostly want to work on my Capstone Project in this course/workshop if that is possible. I am very happy that they could find somebody who is studying paleontology, I would definitely be up for talking about that. Thanks, and have a nice day. Mentor 2022-11-07, 18:05: Hi Angus, Thanks for your message! And yes, this would be our introduction conversation. My understanding is that you'll be assigned modules/lessons from your teacher but I'll be here to help with/answer any questions that you have. So I think the first step is to read through the following materials: What's the point, Program Instructions, Conversation Instructions, Communicating with your mentor, and The Rules - which should be visible above this text box. Let me know once you've read through these and I can check them off and you can get started on the next lessons. Also, out of curiosity, is there a particular area in paleontology that your interested in: either a group of organisms (vertebrates, invetebrates, plants, etc) or a time period (Mesozoic, etc.)? My favouite subject in paleontology is Paleozoic paleobotany and paleoentomology (plants and insects). Here is a cool video about giant prehistoric bugs if you are intersted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wQLKMUWANg&amp;t=231s&amp;ab_channel=PBSEons Sasha Mentee 2022-11-09, 19:07: Hi Sasha, Thanks for the message, sorry it took me a while to respond . I've read through those links and I'm rady for the next activity. As for what specfic area of Paleontology I'm interested in, I'm not entirely sure yet. Probably terrestrial vertebrates, and at the moment I'm particularly interested in Permian Therapsids but I don't think I'll stick with that. Carbiniferous arthropods are super fascinating, I can see why you focus on them. Mentor 2022-11-09, 21:14: Hello Angus, No worries about the delay and thanks for letting me know! I check off these activities now then. I agree Permian therapsids are super cool!! Sasha Mentor 2022-12-15, 15:27: Hi Angus, These sound like great options! I would also consider either studying Geology (either through a double major, a minor or as extra courses). My university (UBC) does not have a Paleontology major, so I decided to do a major in Geology and a minor in Biology. This means that I mostly take geology courses, but I get to select the biology courses I want to take (this is helpful because I am not required to take the less relevent ones, such as genetics). If you want to, you could just study biology (my Paleontology professor also studied biology in university) but I think geology also provides helpful context as well. Let me know if you have any questions about this or about planning for your post secondary career! Also, I pressume your winter break is coming up, so I won't give you any more work to do. I will be back in school by the second week of January, so I think we can start with a new conversation then. Have a nice break! Sasha :)",,,,,
1047584898,10/19/2022 13:01,1047585791,56286,"Mentor 2023-02-22, 19:02: Welcome to the ""different ways of knowing"" module! This module explores the importance of respecting and embracing different ways of knowing with respect to varying cultural frameworks. :) Give the warm up activity and the discussion question(s) a try! We will discuss one (or more - whatever piques your interest) of the questions presented for Anchor Text 1 before moving onto the next Anchor Text! Mentee 2023-02-25, 17:23: The prompt I chose is,“I think it’s hard for a lot of people in the industrial world to understand the connection between people and place.” How do you think the connection to place differs from a rural environment to an urban environment? For a rural environment, I feel as the people may have a greater understanding of the connection between people and place due to them being more surrounded by the natural world like forests, rivers, mountains, etc. Whereas people in an urban environment have more of an 'unnatural' world due to the limitation on trees, plants, and forests. This limitation is caused by the need to expand, therefore they chop down trees and wreck the land to make room for businesses, homes, transportation ,etc. A rural envirnoment of course does this as well, but I feel as they are more connected to the land due to them being more exposed to nature and getting to experience the beauty of it. They are more exposed as they don't need to expand to make room for a large population. For example, the rural area I live in I can be in a forest almost any direct I want within 10-20 minutes (walking), and an even shorter drive. Whereas when I go to bigger cities this is not as easy and takes much longer to reach a forest. An example that comes to mind is when I was in Kelowna, even though they have trees growing I wasn't able to just walk to a forest. The closest thing I was able to find was an enclosed, more man-made environment. It was pretty, it had a pond and trees and plants, but it didn't feel nature and felt more like it was planned. I think this provides a good example between how different rural and urban environments are and how the connection to the land differs between the two. I would like to hear your opinion on this topic if comfortable, and what's your connection to the land you live on? Mentor 2023-02-27, 09:42: I completely agree with your statement that people who live in rural areas have a greater understanding and connection between people and place due to being surrounded by a lot more nature than those in urban areas. I lived in a big city for my whole life, and although BC has so much beautiful nature, it's not as prominent in big cities like you mentioned. Going away to more rural areas in BC made me realize how out-of-tune with the environment many of us are. We don't have as open access to forests, lakes, etc. that you mentioned and if we were to see them, we'd have to drive pretty far out. I think the closest forest to where I live is a 25-30 minute drive. Walking to a forest is pretty much unheard of. You also mentioned in another module that you can take a walk in the forest if you ever feel like it, and I wish here we could have the same experience! Of course there are parks around, but there's always so many man-made components incorporated into it that it doesn't feel like you're surrounded by the true beauty of nature, as you mentioned. Overall, I completely agree with the points you made and I wish ""real"" and the natural beauty of nature were more accessible like it is in rural areas. Going out of town throughout BC is always one of my favourite activities because you get to see waterfalls, walk nice hikes and trails, etc. which isn't always possible in places like Vancouver. However, to feel connected to the land here and there are a few hikes people can do that overlook the city, mountains, and the water and they're very beautiful. I really enjoy doing hikes with family and friends because the end result of being able to overlook the lower mainland makes me appreciate how beautuful BC is and how lucky I am to live in such a beautiful province. :) Mentor 2023-02-27, 09:44: Great insight for Anchor text 1! If any other thoughts come to mind, please share! If not, let's attempt Anchor Text 2: Valuing Cultural Knowledge and give the discussion questions a try! :) Mentee 2023-02-27, 19:10: Yes! I love waterfalls the most, I find them peaceful to watch :) I also really enjoy the smell of nature so I'm very grateful to be able to go to a forest anytime I want! Anchor 2: Which of the Seven Teachings resonated most with you? Is this something you embrace in your daily life, how so? If not, how could you incorporate it in your daily life? The one that resonated with me most was Respect. I do this basically everyday as it makes me feel good. I think it's nice to respect everyone around you and therefore it makes me feel good about myself. Not only am I respectful to others around me, I also try to be respectful to nature and it's creatures. Sometimes when I come across a worm burning in the sun I will move it to a shader spot, or a snail thats in the middle of a path :) I enjoy treating everyone with respect no matter how small! How can living by the Seven Sacred Teachings help me succeed during post-secondary and even while 'adulting'? Mentor 2023-03-01, 08:38: Respect is also the teaching that resonated with me! For me, this extends to people and beings of nature as you mentioned! With people, I make sure to treat everyone the way I'd like to be treated (ie. respect), especially because you never know what someone is going through, and a small act of kindness can be a very positive factor in someone's life. Being extended that same gratitude, especially on days where I'm not feeling my best, can change the trajectory of my entire day, so I always try to do the same. Plus, it's nice to know that you treated others well because it makes you feel good about yourself too. Plus the saying “kindness is free” is a term I like to guide myself with. :) Respect also extends to nature, including plants and animals, and your very kind example with the worms and snails reminded me of this scenario! I remember one summer I was in Arizona at the Grand Canyon for vacation. The Grand Canyon is extremely dry and hot in the summertime (40+ degrees), so animals often have difficulties finding sources of water. I remember there was a small chipmunk circling around our area and it kept coming towards me, then running away (it almost felt like a game). I had a feeling it was thirsty so I took the cap of my water bottle and filled it with water and placed it towards the chipmunk, and it ran towards me and started drinking the water. :) It was one of the best moments of my trip haha. In post-secondary, the Seven Teachings (love, respect, courage, honesty, wisdom, humility, and truth) will help you stay true to yourself and guide you through challenges using the best version of yourself and you will face obstacles in post-secondary academically and when learning to be an adult and living on your own. Tackling these challenges with the Seven Teachings in mind, whether it’s friendships, conflicts with others, uncertainty of yourself and/or your abilities, will bring out the best version of yourself in any obstacle you face. Thank you for sharing your experiences with the Different Ways of Knowing and Being module :) There is an extension activity as well called “Learning from stories” that you may have looked over while going through the module. If comfortable, feel free to reach out to someone you know for the activity to share a story with you. Do you have any questions/concerns, or would you like to discuss anything else within this module? If not, I’m happy to open up our next module of your choosing! Mentee 2023-03-01, 15:15: I agree! I always keep the ""treat others how you want to be treated"" saying in the back of my mind as well as how being kind is free. I love the story about the chipmunk! That's so adorable. I don't have anymore questions. Could you please open Career Exploration? Mentor 2023-03-01, 16:12: Absolutely! I will open Career Exploration.","Mentor 2023-06-23, 08:36: Welcome to the wrapping up module! A very bittersweet moment as we close up our conversation, but it was great getting to know you, guiding you through applications and scholarships (and witnessing you being awarded some!), and witnessing you being accepted into university!!

Sorry for taking so long to respond, I had graduation this weekend and I've been busy. I'm actually shocked they asked you acronyms in an interview, I would've never saw that coming. Something I'll keep in mind lol. I can't believe we're finished already!! Thank you so much for all your advice. You helped me a lot and even confirmed that I picked the right program. I really enjoyed talking with you and I will for sure reach out if I have anymore questions later on!","Mentor 2023-02-06, 23:18: Welcome to the well-being and self-care module! I really enjoy this module and think it can be very beneficial when it comes to going away for university and taking care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically. I'll get you to give Achor Text 1 (the video) a go first, and if you're comfortable, we can discuss that together. After that's completed, we can move on and discuss the remaining anchor texts and whatever additional questions you may want to cover in this module. If you need any help, let me know and we can walk through the anchor text together! Mentee 2023-02-11, 12:16: Hey! Anchor text 1: My warning signs that indicate I might need some self care are when I feel really irritable, I tend to get annoyed by anyone around me and it doesn't end up good for either of us. This is a big sign for me and I typically tell them I need some distance for a few hours and do something that will relieve my stress. Another few signs are when I feel like I have very low energy/mood or don't feel like doing my typical hobbies like art, etc. Activtities I enjoy: I have quite a feel things I do to either bring my mood up or relieve stress. I typically do some form of art like painting, or I sew or embrodier. Sometimes this isn't always the best option though depending on my mood as it can make me more irritable at times. Aside from art I like to spend time with my closer friends as they always improve my mood! I also like going for walks in our local forest when it's nice or doing a family activity. It's actually funny, sometimes just doing school work helps improve my mood as well because I feel like I was productive and it makes me feel better about doing other activities. I also enjoy sciences so doing that homework isn't that huge of a stress on me unless I don't get it haha. Questions for you: What mental health challenges should I be prepared for upon entering university? Also do you have any tips to overcome these challenges. How have you managed maintaining a good mental health while still doing well during university. And just overall any tips on maintaining a good mental health. Mentor 2023-02-11, 14:36: Hey! It's really beneficial to know when you may need some time to yourself to meet your mental health needs, so it's great that you're aware of what feelings suggest you need self-care. It'll be very useful when it comes to university where you're exposed to more stress that you're normally used to. I remember you mentioned art (painting specifically) and embroidery when we first began talking. I agree both can feel very therapeutic. I personally like both as well because they're so different from what I do in school, so the change is refreshing. Hahaha I agree with doing schoolwork to ease stress This relates to one of your later points but a lot of stress in school is because you feel like there's so much work with not enough time in a day. Everytime I felt stresssed at school, I would only feel better if I actually did school work. Also, super cool that you have a forest nearby!! I bet it's nice taking a walk and giving yourself time alone. Answers to your questions: 1) In general, I think you should be prepared for academic stress, mostly due to the change in education and learning-style from highschool to university. It can be difficult to adjust to and can really overwhelm students. Don't be afraid to give yourself breaks if things are getting overwhelming, and don't be afraid to ask professors/TAs/other students for help. For you undergoing such a big move from BC to AB, I think you may face challenges with missing your friends/family back home (maybe I'm wrong tho!). If this is your first time away, it can be challenging not having any familiarity around you and practically having to start from scratch. As we talked about in another module, making time to catch up with friends and family or scheduling calls with your loved ones is always a great stress-reliever, and for me, this really helped me get through tougher times of my undergrad. Familiarity feels nice when you are feeling overwhelmed :) 2) Scheduling!! I really like having structure in my life, so if I can jot something into a calender, it works for me. This is obviously easier said than done and takes a lot of accountability on oneself, but if you're able to dedicate yourseld to your schedule, it really helps to not only to make time to complete school work, but also to make time for activities unrelated to school, which are just as important for your mental health! Other tips: join clubs to make friends with similar interests. Having others do something you enjoy can build strong bonds between people, and those friends may be someone you call if you need a day to not think about school or if you need to have fun :) Any questions? If not, let's give the anchor text and the extension activity a try! Mentee 2023-02-12, 12:53: Thanks! I am very nervous for the change in how university teaches compared to highschool. My physics teacher actually set his class up as if it were a university setting. It's hard to explain but as you mentioned before during highschool to pass tests etc it was more based on remembering certain steps and repeated patterns. Instead my teacher for physics this year exposed us to different material on the test than we actually learned in class, therefore we were forced to ACTUALLY learn the topic. It was certainly harder and took awhile to get used to but I'm glad he did it because I feel as if it's a little closer to how university classes are gonna go. I will for sure miss my family and friends! I'm going to try to make a schedule like you suggested and call them every once awhile :) I will also join clubs for sure! I'm super excited about those actually. Anchor 2: I'm going to share the think part which asks me to think about how good I am at self-care. I believe I get enough sleep for the most part, I tend to go to bed around 10 and then get up at 7 on weekdays ans for weekends I get up around 9-10. I know this is a lot more than the recommended sleep-time but if I don't get around 9-11hrs I am super tired. For eating healthy I think I do super weel on! My mother taught me growing up the importance of it and I always have quite a few vegetables and fruit every day. But for drinking water I'm super bad at, I definitely don't get enough but I will work on it. For excercise I'm not sure, with winter I don't get out as much but in summer I do quite a bit. Recently though I've been going for hour long walks and runs at our inside track. 3 things I can change right now and how. Action Plan -Drink more water! Lol --&gt; I plan to achieve this by taking a water bottle with me everywhere and when I'm thirsty get a glass of water instead of juice, milk, etc. -Make more time for things I enjoy --&gt; Everyday I will set an hour out of my day to take time and do something I enjoy, this will most likely be after supper and it'll help me wind down before bed (maybe haha). -Get more physical activity --&gt; I plan to go to the track at least 2-3 times a week. I plan to do this by going with my friends, making me more motivated to actually go! Questions for you -Aside from setting a schedule, do you have any other tips to help priortize self care? -Can you share any time management tips? Mentor 2023-02-15, 20:13: The teachers that set up highschool courses like university lectures really help to prepare you for university!! I was unlucky and didn't have a teacher like that in grade 12 so the change was a lot more drastic for me. It's funny because in highschool when i was ""prepared"" for exams it was just me repeating facts I memorized, and like you said, having to *actually* learn the content is very different! It's great to know you've been exposed to that early. You will thank them for it :) Whatever helps you feel energized should be what you strive for! So if it's 9-11 hours of sleep, aim for that! I was pretty bad with my water intake too, but having a water bottle nearby at all times makes it a little easier to get to your water goal every day. It's good that you incorporated this into your plan! Having a balanced diet is really good. I struggled with this in university because I wanted to eat the quickest thing available, but realized the lack of fruits/veggies/enough protein, etc. made me look super tired and my skin looked dull. Overall, it seems like you have self care down pretty well! Exercise is a bit harder to achieve I agree, and Calgary gets pretty cold and snowy which makes outside activity difficult. Your university may have an indoor track that you can utilize if walks/runs are your thing. :) Answers for your questions: Aside from scheduling, I feel that the people you surround yourself with will have a big impact on your own self-care and mental health. Surround yourself with like-minded, kind, and friendly people who share the same goals and values as you, including hobbies, and goals. This has a great impact on mental health too :) Time management tips: Prioritize your tasks for the day. Essentially, work on your most urgent as well as hardest/most challenging tasks first, and then work your way to the easier ones or the ones due later. We tend to procrastinate our more challenging work by completing easier tasks first, and by the time we get to our harder tasks, we're exhausted from the other things we've already done. Another tip is to start things early!! This will be what I stress the most because of how much it changed by overall stress levels in university. You'll be surprised the lack of stress you will experience just by starting things a week or two earlier. You're no longer scrambling to study the night before a test, grocery shop before a big assignment is due, cooking a meal before finishing a paper, etc. Last tip: keep your phone in another room when doing your work. When i have my phone on me, i ""think"" i spent 20 minutes studying, when in reality, i spent 5 minutes skimming nots + 15 minutes looking at my phone. It really helps you become aware of how you spend your time, and you'll be surprised at how much you finish and how quickly! Mentor 2023-02-15, 20:18: If you're ready to move onto the next activity, try the extension activity (Adulting 101). Let's give it a try and see if there are any skills you are not comfortable with yet, and whether we can create a plan on how to overcome that discomfort and apply it to your life away from home :) Mentee 2023-02-18, 11:19: Hey Thanks! I really like the idea of prioritizing harder tasks and leaving my phone out of the room. I will for sure try that, I'll actually start right now lol. For the Adulting 101 I had to make a list, so here is the doc. Adulting 101 Doc And for the question, what did you find most surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? Also if you have any tips on how to improve skills I'm not confident on, please let me know! Mentor 2023-02-21, 02:32: Great job with your chart! It's clear that you have a good understanding of what skills/responsibilities you're confident in, and which you need some extra practice with. I may be able to lend a hand on some of the skills you felt unsure of :) - Taking transit: there's this great app for iPhone (and Android too I believe) called ""Transit."" It's a green coloured app that can be used throughout major cities in North America and it basically shows you all the busses/trains/etc. around you and what time they are departing from your nearest location. What's even better about this app is that you can plan trips to and from places based on time, so you can change the time you leave your house or the time you want to arrive somewhere. It also considers transit service disruptions, which is really handy. Even if you're in an unfamiliar area, you can always find your way back with the transit app, so it's a very useful app for getting around the city, and I've been using it since I began university. A good alternative to this is Google Maps, but changing the driving option to transit :) - Doing household repairs: This only applies to simple tasks, and for more difficult ones I suggest finding a professional, but you can find Youtube videos for almost any minor repair! I've patched holes in the wall, built a desk, and even set up a ceiling fan (except I had to call someone to actually connect the wiring once I was done LOL) just by watching tutorials! You'd be surprised how much you can learn from a short video. My parents went away for a while and I also learned how to use my laundry machine properly with Youtube :P - Banking: the concept of a bank draft is like a cheque! Some people have cheque books where they can write out cheques to pay for things. For ex. if you're paying for a car, you're probably not going to want to withdraw $7,000 cash from your bank account to keep in your pocket. In this case, a cheque would be nice to give, but many of us don't have cheque books, especially being young. A bank draft is essentially a cheque that your bank will provide you (with a small fee) and the funds are taken out of your chequing account. You can usually just go into the bank and you can ask for a bank draft if you need large amounts of cash to pay for something. As for improving skills, the only piece of advice that actually works is to practice! You mentioned practicing things on your own/with your family in your document and this really will be the way to help you feel comfortable developing these skills. Although things like transit in Calgary will be a bit more difficult to navigate in your home town as of now, practicing things like laundry (once or twice a week just to get the hang of it) or cooking a healthy meal for yourself/joining your family when they're cooking will help you feel prepared. For bills, watch your parents pay them and try to follow them step-by-step, or even try on your own! As daunting as it is, practice will be super helpful in developing these skills, even if it's a handful of times before you go. And the nice thing is, you're not completely alone when you're away for university. Giving your family a call if you're feeling unsure of how to do something is always an option :) Mentee 2023-02-21, 15:13: I love the idea of using the transit app! I didn't even know there was such a thing lol so thank you! I will for sure use it because I am so nervous about getting around in a city I've barely been in. I also really like the idea of using youtube videos to help repair things, will definitely try! I also had no idea what a bank draft was so thank you for explaining it :) Thank you a lot! I enjoyed this section. Would you be able to open 'Different ways of knowing' Mentor 2023-02-22, 18:55: I'm glad this section was helpful! Feel free to circle around back to it if you have questions that come up later. I will now open up ""Different ways of knowing.""",,,"Mentee 2022-11-06, 19:34: Ahh! The email letting me know you responded went to my junk mail and I just saw it, I'm so sorry! Sugar cookies are super good! I like to eat those little pasteries with the jam in the middle, you used to always be able to get them during all-included breakfasts at hotels but ever since Covid I never see them anymore. :( I think final acceptances are sent out sometime in March, so still quite awhile away. Thank you! Mentee 2022-11-13, 18:11: Yes I can see the anchor texts, the first one is what education I need. It also says to answer some discussion questions about both my dream career and realistic career. and share it with you. My dream career would be a neurologist and my 'realistic' career that I'll probably end up in is a neuropsychologist. What education I need - For both of these careers I need to go for a bachelor of science in either biological sciences or neuroscience. I then need to complete a masters for the neuropsychologist and a PhD for the neurologist. Three reasons I'd benefit from attending post secondary - Higher level of education. Higher chance at getting a good job. New experience and learning that leads to growth. Three factors that might make it challenging to obtain this experience - It'll be my first time away from home so I may have trouble being by myself for awhile. I'm not sure how hard a degree in neuroscience is, so I might struggle there. It's also expensive to go to post-secondary. How I feel about the education I need - I'm really looking forward to it because I feel like the neuroscience program is going to be very exciting to learn about, and this will be my first time by myself so I'm looking forward to having that type of independance. Do I think my careers are achievable - I do feel as if they're achievable, but it's definitly going to take lots of hard work and some time to get used to. I feel as I'm prepared though and I'm super excited. Now the next discussion question is to ask you a question. I'm still curious about what a day in the neuroscience program looks like, what kind of things do you learn and what do you get to do? Especially at the masters level. Mentor 2022-11-16, 20:05: Great answers for the activity questions, Jessica! Overall, you seem to have a strong understanding of the background you'd require for your dream careers. Fun fact - to be a neurologist, you would also require completing medical school after your bachelors! Neurologists are doctors that specialize in the brain/nervous system. :) As for a neuropsychologist, you're correct about needing further education after your bachelors. A PhD tends to be the main route to achieve such a career. Great job. :) Great reasoning behind the benefits to attending post-secondary. Being a university student has provided me with so many experiences and opportunities I know I wouldn't be able to attain without my education. It's really shaped me to be a strong candidate for further schooling (eg. medical school), and I've gotten strong job opportunities due to it. With your schooling, I have no doubts the same will be provided for you. It's great to hear the excitement you feel for post-secondary. Independence is definitely one of the major changes you experience when transitioning into university, and moving away from a small town will present its challenges. However, change is exciting! The initial transition into university life will feel very different - even for me being from a more urban city, it was still a drastic change in my everyday life and felt overwhelming. But with time we all become accustomed to our ""new normal"" and with some time, you will too! Your excitement and passion definitely exemplify your ability to achieve your goals. Be positive, stay focused, and you will realize that time has flown and you're getting closer to your dream career as the days go on! Mentor 2022-11-16, 20:25: On to your question - what is the day in the life of a neuroscience masters student? I want to preface this first by describing my life as a bachelors student in biology, as you may relate to this more. Then, I will describe my life as a masters student to show you how different each program is! With my bachelors degree, a lot of time is spent on course work. In my first year, I took 4 courses each semester (and 2 in the summer semester). Since science students are required to take arts electives, I highly suggest balancing your science/neuroscience coursework with 1-2 arts electives based on how many courses you plan to take. In my program's first and second year (and even for your program), you will begin with more general science courses and sometimes, it feels that it may not completely relate to your interests. Because of this, i felt like I required a lot more effort and brain power to focus on school work. With that, scheduling my study times were VERY helpful and helped me stay on track. Throughout my bachelors degree, I spent most of my days studying, and since I lived far from home, I didn't have the opportunity to join many clubs. Most of my free time I spent with friends and family as they were a strong support system for me and really helped me through my transition into university. Later into my first year as I got accustomed to my university schedule, I began to work part time (only 1-2 times a week) at a pharmacy to try and save some money. If you hope to work, I would suggest finding jobs that are student-friendly (aka flexible hours, allow time off for exams). In my fourth year, I began hunting down research volunteer opportunities to help with my entrance into my masters program. I got a role in a hibernation lab (completely unrelated to my masters work haha), which I did 2-4 hours a week. I continued this trend up until the end of my undergraduate degree, and thankfully it worked well for me. Overall, most of my time in undergrad was spent studying! For my masters, I found that this was a complete change from my undergraduate degree. Although my first year required coursework, I found the content to be a lot easier to understand (probably because I was interested in it!) and it felt like there was less of a course-weight compared to my undergrad. Since I began my masters during covid, I didn't do much lab work until labs were allowed to run again. I ended up completing my coursework then stepping into the lab. Every student's lab experience is different, but for me, initially I went in for my animal research. This ranged from 5-10 hours a day, but only for one week each month. This was to make sure I had all my samples required for my experiments. This went on for maybe a year-a year and a half. After that, I was in the lab a lot more frequently (4-5 days a week) running experiments. My lab work at this point was essentially a ""9-5"" job where I would be in the lab most days, then I'd go home in the evening and this would repeat over time. I also work 1-2 days a week. This has gone on for about a year, and I'm slowly transitioning out of going to the lab almost everyday so I can begin writing my thesis. This will take me about 2 months (I hope!) and then I will graduate. Overall, the workload course-wise is much lighter, but you're essentially ""working"" in the lab and it feels like you have a job now. I find that it definitely helps you transition into the workforce if you plan to complete schooling after your masters, but also provides you the skills to move onto a PhD if you see that as your future. But every masters student's schedule is different! Some students are in the lab 7 days a week, others run most of their work from home - it really depends on the type of work you are doing. :) If this raises any questions or you'd like some clarifications on anything, let me know! I'd be happy to elaborate on any part if you'd like to know more. :) Mentee 2022-11-17, 18:14: Oh yes haha, I actually remember discovering I needed to go to med school to be a neurologist and that's why it became my dream career because I'm unsure if I want to go through med school. When you say art electives what do you mean? Like in high school I'm taking pottery and textiles which would be considered an art elective, is it the same idea in university? In your first year of your masters you mentioned some coursework, would you be able to go more into depth on what you learned? I'm just curious what is kind of covered/talked about in neuroscience just in case it's different than what I thought lol. Also, you went for animal research so I'm interested in what you got to do in the lab? A main concern about going into neuroscience for me is if there's any animal testing, more so inhumane animal testing? Mentor 2022-11-19, 16:31: Hey Jessica! Totally understandable about your choice of not wanting to pursue medical school! It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, plus your current career goal of becoming a neuropsychologist don't require it! Electives are essentially courses that aren't based on your primary study's focus, but are still required to graduate. However, unlike ""core"" courses, elective courses aren't as strict as to which courses you have to take. It allows for a bit more freedom/flexibility with your degree. For example, since I did a bachelor's degree in science (specifically in biology), my ""main"" or ""core"" courses that I needed to take were mostly science-based, along with some first year English and math courses. My science-based courses included cellular biology, anatomy courses, etc. You will most likely have similar core courses in your first year. Electives, on the other hand, are additional courses you take to fill your degree requirements to graduate, but there aren't specific courses you have to take to fill these requirements. For example, for my degree, I was required to complete a certain number of arts credits, so I chose elective courses like gender studies, philosophy, etc. Based on my degree, I wasn't required to take these specific courses, and you may notice that courses like gender studies differ greatly from my original degree, but I took them to complete my arts credit requirements, so since they weren't required courses, they were my electives. :) If you need some more clarification, feel free to ask! So for my masters, we are required to take 2 neuroscience courses and 2 electives (these elective courses just had to be related to neuroscience). I did end up taking some more electives for my own interest, but this isn't common. For the first required/core course (called NRSC 500), it was mostly about the cellular aspects of the brain, such as electical signalling, proteins involved in brain signalling, etc. This first course related neuroscience a lot to circuits, electrical currents, taught us about changes in voltage in the brain, etc. and was very focused on the cellular-level of neuroscience. The second course (NRSC 501) was more on behaviour and perception. In this course, we looked more into how the brain processes information from the outside world and makes sense of it, the brain's role in regulating our body's hormones, brain region activity and their relationship to our emotions, etc. NRSC 501 was my favourite of the two, especially because my neuroscience interests fall under the behavioural side of neuroscience. Plus, NRSC 500 was pretty difficult :P. Keep in mind that not all schools will offer the same courses, so course requirements in the neuroscience masters program at UBC may be very different from the neuroscience masters program in (for example) the University of Alberta. Just based on the program, some may have more course requirements, some may have less, and some may have additional courses outside of neuroscience that are required (ex. statistics). ?My elective courses were my personal favourite however - I took a class called abnormal psychology, which is a course that looked into mental illness and the genetic and environmental aspects that might influence the development of depression, anxiety, psychopathy, etc. That was one of my favourites! Another coure I took looked into neurological diseases (Alzheimers, dementia, etc.) and I specifically loved both of these elective courses because they really dove into the health side of neuroscience and it felt more relevant to me since I want to go to medical school. Great question about animal research! Since I'm in the neuroscience program, a lot of my work is on the brains of mice. All universities must adhere to very strict policies for animal welfare and labs will be shut down and fined if they do not follow animal welfare rules. Some students I know do research on spinal cord injuries/spinal surgery and since ethically we are not allowed to do these surgeries on humans for research purposes only, we must do them on animals like mice. In these cases, animals MUST be anesthetized, they MUST have proper pain medication so they are not feeling pain during or after the surgery, and many of these animals are on very strict watch lists, where researchers sometimes have to check on them every single hour. Essentially, a lot of these animals are treated like humans especially for research that requires surgeries. Animals are normally housed in an ""animal facility"" where there are additional staff that do welfare checks, feed them, provide pain medication, ointments, water, etc. Overall, I had the same concerns as you but I've been fortunate to say that regarding health-based research in animals, all have been very humane. For my research specifically, we are looking at how pain and sugar affect the brain's development, so mice are given a tiny prick by a very small needle on their paw, as well as sugar. We basically do this procedure 10x per day over 7 days, then we must collect brain tissue. To do this, we are required to anesthetize the animals until they are in a deep ""sleep."" There are certain checks you must do to ensure the animal is in a deep state of anesthesia (ex. one of the checkpoints is a toe-pinch on the mouse. If the mouse curls their toes, you know they are not in a deep enough state of anesthesia and must sedate them more). After that, there are various methods to kill the animal as quick and painless as possible (not that the animal would feel it as they are already deeply sedated, but just as a secondary precaution). However, keep in mind that not all animal research is health-based and many don't require tissue collection or surgeries. I have a friend teaching rats how to play poker hahaha. It really depends on what research you are doing and the purpose of the research! I know this may sound daunting and it's understandable if so, so I'm happy to provide more clarification on any of the ethics behind animal testing/procedures to ensure no pain is felt, etc. if you have more questions. :) Mentee 2022-11-20, 18:08: Hey, Ohh okay. I understand about the electives now and I didn't know that! So thank you :) Would you be able to tell me a bit about the gender studies course? When trying to pick a program that one had actually caught my attention so I find it interesting you took it and want to know more about it lol. All of the neuroscience courses/related courses you took sound super interesting and I'm happy to hear that it's what I expected of the neuroscience program. I hope U of A/C has similar courses but I'm sure since they're all neuroscience they can't be too different - maybe just a few things haha. It's kind of hard to find exactly what the schools are doing in this specific program. I'm also very glad to hear they have strict policies and humane methods, that makes me feel much better. I love disecting animals in my biology class so I'm okay with this type of animal testing (since it's humane). This has actually made me even more interested in neuroscience and I feel as I've picked the perfect program, I'm really looking forward to it! Your research sounds super fascinating, along with your friends. I think it would be funny to tell people ""I'm teaching rats to play poker"" lol. Your information was super helpful and (for now) I can't think of any other questions - other than the one about the gender stuides course. Thank you so much! :) Mentor 2022-11-23, 14:28: Hey Jessica! I would expect U of A/C to have similar courses! Since they have a neuroscience-based undergraduate program, I would expect them to have an even broader coarse range for neuroscience than UBC, especially since we just introduced the UBC neuroscience undergraduate program this year! Thanks! The research is very fun and being able to see results at the end of animal studies is very rewarding, especially since the work can have an impacts on clinical procedures used in the hospital. The gender studies course I took was actually one of my favourite elective courses. It investigated gender expression through an intersectional point of view, meaning the course discussed gender expression and how it's influenced by colonialism, racism, poverty, ableism and culture (and other factors). Initially, it was not what I expected for a gender studies course, but it really puts into perspective how these outside factors can influence gender expression around the world. For my final project, I created a video compilation of feminism through the lens of race, and the injustices that women of colour face as well as differences in the fight for equality based on culture. I really loved the course - not only was it a refreshing change from a very science-based curriculum, but it really broadened my view of gender and how much outside factors can influence gender expression. If you have interests outside of sciene/neuroscience, I highly suggest filling your elective courses with courses you are intersted in outside of science (just make sure you complete all your other degree requirements!). It makes your undergraduate experience a lot more fun, and the variety almost feels like a breath of fresh air. Let me know if you have any other questions! If not, we can move onto another section based on what you want to dive into (eg. transitioning from rural to urban or ""getting hired"" if you're hoping to work during school). Mentee 2022-11-25, 15:14: Hey! Awesome, thank you for explaining so many things! I have no other questions. Could we open 'From rural to urban'. Also, Calgary finally give me an answer. They said they can not grant me early admission into Neuroscience but they'll review my transcript, etc again in the future when I've completed semester one. I'm very disappointed, but at least I still have another chance. They did give me early admission into my second program though, which is biological sciences. If I don't get into neuroscience after they review my application again then I guess I'll have to decide how badly I want to go to Calgary. I'm not too sure if I want to take biological sciences and since I'm already accepted into U of A for neuroscience I'll probably go there now. Disappointing for sure, but oh well lol. Mentor 2022-11-29, 03:01: Hey Jessica! I'm sorry to hear about the results of early admission from U of C, but don't fret! Early admission only grants acceptances to a small subset of people. Although it may feel disappointing, a lot of people I know weren't granted early admission to schools like UBC, U of T etc. but were granted admission during the regular cycle. Keep pushing and your hard work will help you shine! Plus, you have a very strong backup school for a program you are passionate to pursue! Completely understandable if you're hesitant on pursuing a biological sciences degree with your focus and passion being on neuroscience. As a word of advice, sticking closer to your interests/passion will create a better university experience for you. Transferring between programs is also a bit tedious, plus school just ends feeling like more of a burden when pursuing a degree you're not as interested it. However, weigh your options if that's what it comes down to. Go with what you believe will be best for your future. :) Yes absolutely - I will open up the ""from rural to urban"" module and close this one. Feel free to follow-up with any of the points made here in the next conversation if you have additional questions/concerns regarding your admission or just this module in general. Mentee 2023-02-04, 10:59: Okay thank you! Also I completed the chart but I don't know how to add it to my portfolio so youu can view it. Mentor 2023-02-04, 13:29: Hmm, you can maybe try making it a Google doc and I can look over it? Or, we can just discuss the more major points you've written down that you believe are worth looking over. It's up to you! :)","Mentor 2023-04-28, 08:54: Welcome to the finding inspiration module! This module explores different ideas about what inspires and motivates people to do the work that they do. Try out the warm-up activity to explore things that inspire and motivate you, then watch the short video for Anchor Text 1 and we can give the discussion questions a try. :) Mentee 2023-05-02, 16:56: 5 things I want in life &amp; why -One thing I really want to experience is travelling different parts of the world, specifically Europe. I want to do this because I want to experience different things like what it's like to be in certain countries, their cultures, etc. I also really want to do tourist things and site seeing. I believe since we only live once, why not experience other parts of the world! -Another thing I want is to have a stable job with a good income so I can experience things I want without having to live paycheck to paycheck. I feel like this is probably something most people want and I don't really have a specific reason other than I want to be able to live my life, etc. -I want to complete an undergrad degree and then hopefully a graduate degree. I want to do this because I've always looked up to people with degrees and I thought it was cool to have one. I want to be well-educated. It's also exciting because I'm the first people between both my mom and dad's side to even apply to university let along (hopefully) get a degree! -In addition to a stable income I also want a stable relationship. I'd like to get married and have a good relationship where we do fun things together and go on dates once awhile, etc. I want this because it just makes me happy and my whole life I've wanted to get married to someone I love. -This ones a little silly but I also really want a Mazda Miata. It's so dorky but it's actually a goal of mine to own one lol. I love the pop-up lights and I think it's the neatest thing. These cars just bring me a lot of joy and make me laugh. What keeps you motivated to do certain things? For example, I have a hard time keeping in touch with my friends even though we still go to school. I just sort of don't have the motivation to make the plans, ask how certain things went, etc since they don't return the energy. Mentor 2023-05-04, 08:44: These are great goals and it seems like overall stability is a common theme among your goals. I agree that stable income, a stable relationship, and education can not only feel fulfilling, it brings a lot of comfort later in life to do the things we want (like travel). Traveling Europe is also a wonderful goal. I feel that people get so caught up in school and work that they forget there's so much more in life, with travelling being one of them. Like you said, we only live one life, and the world is so beautiful so why not give ourselves a chance to experience it all. I also love your goal on wanting a Mazda Miata hahaha they are very cute! I remember this one time I was driving and I let a Miata turn before I drove forward, and it winked its headlights at me to say thank you and I couldn't help but laugh. I really hope you achieve this goal just for the giggles! Motivation has honestly been a struggle for me especially now writing my thesis. I tend to procrastinate a lot and talking myself into writing my thesis has been a battle I've had to face over the last few months. I think the only thing that's been helping me (slowly) move forward is reminding myself of the bigger picture - why am I completing my thesis? What will I achieve after it's done? What am I currently missing out on because I am not putting in sufficient work to complete it (like travelling, new work opportunities, being done with school and relaxing for a bit, etc.). It may not work for everyone, but it helps me continue moving forward. Do you have ways you keep yourself motivated? Mentee 2023-05-08, 18:09: Hi! Sorry for the late respone, I have been sick :( Hahha I love when the car owner winks! I also hope I achieve that goal just because it's funny. How I keep myself motivated is similar to yours. I remind myself why I'm taking certain classes etc when it's hard and I normally relate it back to my future goals and if I don't get these things done I won't be able to achieve what I want to. I also like to remind myself that even though I am sometimes missing out on certain activities, those won't really matter in the future compared to the things I need to get done. For example, yes I may miss a party to study, but studying is far more important because this will help me reach my goals. Whereas the party, even though it's fun, won't help me reach anything and will eventually just be a memory that doesn't contribute to my goals. I'm also going to answer anchor 2 where I turn some things into goals and how I can do it to meet the goal. -Something I'd like to improve on is studying for tests in advance. I could do this by spending 30 minutes each day reviewing the topic we covered the day before. I can also start studying 2-3 days before the test so everything isn't crammed. -This one I've just recently started, but this it's a recent goal I want to share it! I've been wanting to go the gym for awhile now and I finally motivated myself to sign up for a membership. I can continue this goal by packing my gym bag the night before and have it in my car so I can go straight from school to the gym. I have been doing this and anytime I feel unmotivated I just remind myself of the pain of cancelling the memebership. I also remind myself that even if I don't do a super good workout one day, at least I showed up! -My last goal is to get back into doing art. I've felt super unmotivated lately and haven't been doing any art work. It's so hard to get out of a creative block and I honestly don't know how to overcome it. One way I've thought of is asking my friends if they want anything made, I did this approach because I enjoy making things for others. A part of my creative block is because I have nowhere to put my work anymore, so by giving it to other people it will help me want to create again! What habits have you built, and how have they helped you achieve your goals? Mentor 2023-05-13, 02:13: No worries! I want to apologize for my delayed response as well. I’m in Banff for a conference and I’ll be in Calgary for a few more days so things have been busy. Great ways to motivate yourself! I feel that so many people (myself included) look at things in a smaller scale and things can get overwhelming, but we are doing all these smaller things to reach our larger goals. It really helps to put things into perspective. With that being said, don’t feel that you should deprive yourself of all fun either. It’s nice to have a break and party once in a while. ;) Thanks for working on Anchor 2! I think you have a great plan for your goals, and applying them earlier will be very beneficial in university. Especially with studying early, you’ll soon realize university content moves QUICK and is very content-heavy, so it’ll be very helpful practicing these skills, and I believe you mentioned some of your high school courses are set up like university courses, so I think that gives you a leg to stand on. :) I love that you got a gym membership and integrating exercise into your life! It’s funny because I had the same experience. I dreaded joining the gym mostly because I had no experience, no strength, and I felt slightly embarrassed because I’d be using little to no weights while others around me were very advanced. I started off working out in the girls-only section and soon realized people really don’t care what you do in the gym haha. I put myself in a corner alone and did workout videos and learned along the way. And I love the line where you said “at least I showed up!” Because I asked my sister 2 weeks ago to come with me, even for 30 minutes, because it’s better to go and do light work than not at all. It’s almost like she had a revelation and she was like “you’re right. What‘a 30 minutes of my life going to the gym when I’ll be laying down anyways?” It’s also nice to have a gym buddy so you both can motivate each other. If you ever feel unmotivated, at least you have someone to lean on! You seem super motivated, and maybe when you move to Alberta for school you can also find a gym buddy. And yes, cancelling the membership is another annoyance, and losing money by not going also is a pain. I really hope you can find your way into doing art again! As wonderful as science is, you don’t have as much creative expression as you do with art, and it’s a beautiful way to express yourself and feels like a breath of fresh air away from science sometimes. I recently began volunteering to paint and draw for seniors here in Vancouver (the organization is called Letters for Rose if you’re interested) and it feels so good to step away from science and give myself the time to do art. My main habit started early in undergrad and it was one of your goals - beginning to study/do work early so I don’t cram. It’s really helped me excel a lot more than I did in first year, and I’m really glad you’ve recognized it early because it will be so beneficial for your success in university. Mentor 2023-05-13, 02:14: You can also try the extension activity if you are interested! Otherwise, we can wrap up this module and move onto a module of your choice. :) Mentee 2023-05-16, 18:15: Wow! How has Banff been? That sounds nice. hahahha I feel the same about having no experience etc because I feel so goofy trying to figure the machines and stuff out, but I also came to the conclusion no one really cares and when I feel embarrassed I just remind myself that no one cares. I like to think about how often do I even look at what other people are doing (I don't) and others are probably the same since most people are just worried about themselves. I also have the exact response as your sister lol. I say to myself a lot that if I don't go to the gym or study etc what else would I be doing (most likely in bed on tiktok). Your volunteering sounds cool! I'll check it out. Could we move onto Agency in the World please? :) Mentor 2023-05-19, 08:35: Great, I will open up Agency in the World. :)","Mentor 2023-03-01, 16:15: Welcome to the Career Exploration module! I like this module because it brings you awareness as to what types of careers are out there for your degree, and you may learn that there are a lot more opportunities than you may be aware of! Give Anchor Text 1 a try by watching both videos and trying out the discussion questions. Once that's complete, we can touch base on your thoughts and any questions you may have for me! Mentee 2023-03-04, 10:42: -What do you value in life? For me, I of course value what most people do - family and friends. In addition to these, I also value living life to the 'fullest'. Moreso I enjoy getting out and doing things either with my friends or family, or by myself. I personally don't like to spend a lot of time on electronics anymore (when I was younger I loved to though). I do spend time on tiktok or watch tv everyday, but I try to limit my amount or I have a certain time I do these things. My idea of living life to the fullest is trying new things, giving myself challenges, going for adventures, spending time with people I enjoy being around, stuff around these lines. I also feel like once I move away from home I will be able to try more things since I'll be in a bigger city. I also value being respectful and kind to others as I enjoy giving to people when I can. -How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? For my community, I like to volunteer and help people in need when possible. I also like to recycle since pollution is such a big problem in the world, I know it's small but I still believe it helps and where I live is less polluted as well. For the world, I have some life goals that I would love to complete, but at this time they're only dreams. Firstly, I would love to become part of the medical field and use my knowledge to travel to other parts of the world and help families, children, etc that can't afford health care or have poor health care. I don't know how likely this is of happening, but it would fall under my 'living life to the fullest' idea for me. Secondly, I would love to be a role model for other women around the world. I look up to women who have made a change in the world or just overall achieved a high level of education. I think it's amazing when women are well-educated and use their knowledge to help others. If I could, I would really enjoy being an inspiration for younger women and help them achieve their goals :) -Careers that might incorporate the first 2 points. Dream careers? I think most types of doctors would revolve around my second point, and personally for me it would also work for my first point. I also think someone that has a degree in tourism (i think) would work with my point of living to the fullest since they get to travel lots. I also have a dream of traveling most of Europe and other parts of the world that aren't Canada or the USA. But even though that works with my first point, it wouldn't satisfy my second point and I believe I would be unhappy in a job like that. My dream career is to be a Neurologist, or something that uses neuroscience and lets me help others. But I'm unsure at the moment if that will happen. I'm planning to see how well I do in university and then if I have the money I may try medical school, etc. But as of now I'm just aiming to finish my undergrad degree. Do you have any ideas of careers that may suit my values, and how have your values helped you decide on your career choice? Mentor 2023-03-06, 09:14: Great overview on your values! I think you did a great job highlighting your core values and the dream careers you have described really encompass the values that are important to you. Good to see that you're playing a part in your community/our world's health as well. I can see that the things that are most important to you are also displayed in your volunteering roles. Nice job! I really love the mention of wanting to be a role model for women, especially in the realm of education. As I'm sure you're aware, women have less access to education in certain parts of the world and it's important that there are people who are like them (ie. women, and this applies especially to minority women) that are pursuing education that can be role models and see that not only can we pursue an education, we deserve it just as much as men do, and we are capable just as much as men are. Not only does this apply to other parts of the world, but even for those close to us in our own communities. Tourism! I didn't even think about that degree possibility so that was very insightful! I agree that tourism, especially if you can utilize the degree in other parts of the world, can be a fulfilling degree for those who want to travel. And if you think about it, tourism still helps people, just in a different way from what we conventionally think helping others is. Great ideas for your dream careers! I agree that medicine/neurology is a career that aligns well with your interests and values. Other careers also include counselling, social work, therapy, or any realm of psychology as they are quite neuroscience intensive. Plus, you get the ""help"" aspect in there and if you want to apply it by going to other countries to provide services to those who need it, these would be other jobs that you can consider as well! For me, my initial thinking on a career choice was motivated by very similar factors to you. I was interested in helping others, and it was a pretty broad statement that was reinforced as I went through my undergrad and masters degree. In undergrad, my program made me realize I really love science with the human body, and in my 3rd and 4th year when we were able to pick more specialized courses, the neuroscience subject further enhanced these intersts. At the end of undergrad, I realized that ""helping"" others doesn't always need to be direct, and with my masters research, I can be helping people with the research I do (specifically preterm babies, which is what my research is focused on). University helped me realize that helping others doesn't need to be direct patient-side care. However, I do hope to go into medicine one day, and this career choice was solidified during my masters because I now had experience indirectly helping others with my research. On top of that, my dad was diagnosed with cancer last year and seeing this direct level of care with doctors and nurses and how they did everything they could for my dad (he's cancer free now!) made me want to extend that ability to others, almost as a way of showing gratitude and saying thank you! I also work at an eye clinic with opthalmologists (eye doctors that went to medical school), and seeing how they change the lives of patients and their vision also inspires me to go into medicine, especially all the female doctors! I actually have a question for you now! I remember initially when we began our mentorship, you weren't too interested in the medical school route. Did something specifically change your mind, or are you keeping your options open? :) Mentee 2023-03-08, 14:56: Hey! I agree tourism helps others in a different way. I wish it was more science based because I would enjoy doing that lol. Thank you for the job suggestions! I have also considered a career related to psychology incase I end up not liking neuroscience as much as I think I will. Off topic but, I was wondering if you can explain more about your research on preterm babies. I'm interested in what you're doing with that. Also, I never considered that conducting research is helping people, thank you for broadening my insight! I like the idea of still helping people but indirectly. I'm glad to hear your dad is cancer free! That's amazing. For your question, it's a bit of both. I have a friend that is also going into Neuroscience (which sucks because I've been competeing with him on almost every school) but he is planning to go to medical school and after talking with him I feel sort of inspired to try and do it as well. I'm moreso keeping my options open though because I'm not completely decided on what I want to do as a career yet, but I would really like to be a neurologist and I know that requires med school. But I'm also basing it off how I do in my undergraduate and if I feel like I can pursue med I will try! Plus, I want to be a role model for other women so it helps support my values :) I also think it's amazing that you're planning to attend med school, so you also had an influence on me! Lol Mentee 2023-03-08, 17:26: Also, another off topic thing. For my capstone project I have to do an interview on you. It can be a google doc so I created one with some questions I need to know for my presentation. Whenever you have time can you please fill it out. Interview Doc No rush. I dont need it right away so just whenever you have time :) It doesn't need to be long, just enough so I can answer the question. Mentor 2023-03-10, 02:12: Yeah absolutely! So to provide some background, the professor I'm doing my masters with, she did some work seeing the effects of sugar for pain relief in preterm babies. Preterm babies are often hospitalized because they are underdeveloped and in the hospital, they experience a lot of pain in the form of blood draws, needle insertion, etc. First, she used an animal model to see the effects on mice early in life, and later, noticed that similar changes occured in human babies as well (for example, brain sizes were significantly smaller in the mice and human babies that were given sugar for pain relief, both of their memory was poorer as well, and several other findings). Her work is actually what caused several hospitals to quit the use of sugar as pain relief for preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) so they don't have these negative effects later in life, and her work also found that things as simple as holding your baby can provide them with a feeling of relief from pain. My research now dives a bit deeper into it. When our bodies are under stress, fight infection, or experience pain, we release things called inflammatory markers and my research looks into how these inflammatory markers change in the brain and blood. Later on after I graduate, others can look into the blood of babies if they've been given sugar after getting their blood drawn and see whether the changes are similar in mice and humans. We (for obvious reasons :P) cannot use their brains to test for these inflammatory markers, so we will have to compare blood samples only. And yes absolutely! I didn't think of research in that way either. My undergraduate and masters degrees really broadened my views of the role of research in the lives of real people. Hahaha oh the high school competition! I know all too well about that. It's good to be open to all the career possibilities and I'm glad you've had so many individuals that broadened your interests! You'll be surprised how many more careers you'll learn of that relate to your interests once you start post-secondary. People's interests can really change overtime, so even if neuroscience isn't your cup of tea in the end, you will learn of so many other careers that fall into your interests. Mentor 2023-03-10, 02:16: I think editing is closed for your doc, so I requested access to edit your doc! I will do it ASAP once it's open. I just want to note that I will be in Asia starting tomorrow until the 22nd. I'm not sure whether the mentoring site will allow me to log in from there, so in case you don't hear from me for a few days or I am unable to access your Interview Doc, that is the reason. :) Mentee 2023-03-11, 12:21: Wow! The research is super cool. That's amazing that lots of hospitals stopped using sugar for preterm babies due to her work! I can't wait until I get to do stuff like that lol, even though it's gonna be a few years haha. Oh shoot, you should have access now. Don't worry about getting it done, just enjoy being in Asia! I'm leaving to Edmonton on the 19th until the 25th so there will be a small time when I cant respond either. Have fun!! Mentor 2023-03-12, 20:49: It's definitely a great experience being a researcher and knowing you've contributed to the health and wellness of others, even if it's indirect! During your undergraduate degree if you decide to volunteer or get a small paid role in a lab to get a feel of research, your impact may be earlier than you think! Surprisingly, I have access to our rural mentoring page, so I'll have time to respond! I hope you enjoy your trip to Edmonton! I heard the weather will be nice there! I filled out the form a few days (?) ago (I'm having trouble keeping track of time due to the time difference haha). Take a look to see if it worked. If you need more in-depth answers, let me know as well and I can go back to modify it. :) Mentee 2023-03-13, 18:00: Yay! And yes, the form worked. It is enough, thank you so much! Anchor 2 For the quizzes, some careers I got that interested were: biologists (and related scientists it says lol), psychologists, specialist physicians, university professors/lecturers, and post-secondary teaching and research assistants. Pick 1 career : Typically I would've picked the specialist physician or scientist, but I feel as if we've talked about these enough so I'm gonna switch it up and pick the university professor career. Strong personal interest in this type of work? I actually have a bit of interest in this career path, although it's not as strong as my interest in being a neurlogist, etc, I still have an interest. This job would allow me to still specialize in a subject (probably neuroscience), and then educate others on it. I am also able to conduct research, so thats a plus side! Allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? I think this career allows a good balance between work and life. I get to teach about something I'm (hopefully) passionate about which I think would be fun! Work BC says they have about a 40+ hour week and may work evenings and weekends. I think this is acceptable since a neurologist would require I think more hours. So I'd actually get more time to do things not related to work. WorkBC also says every 5-6 years a full-time professor is eligible for a sabbactical, which frees them from their regular duties for a year, allowing time for projects and research! Offer financial security? The annual salary on workbc is $90,244. I'd say thats pretty good lol! Although I would say this is an estimate of someone who has experience, etc. The hourly rate ranges from $21.63-$69.71, the lower end kind of sucks and I would assume that's the starting wage. But overall I think it provides financial security after a few years of exeprience. How much opportunity/job security does this career path offer? I think it offers quite a bit of opportunity since there are tons of universities! Professors are able to teach in the classroom, online, or even outdoors so there is a range of ways teach, which provides flexibility. Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? I would need to live anywhere there is a university that offers my speciality. So quite a few places! Off the top of my head it could be in Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, and Lethbridge. Questions for you: What are some things you wish you knew about career choices while in high school? How did you choose your career? Mentor 2023-03-22, 00:06: Hey Jessica! Sincere apologies for the late response. Things got busy on vacation and I wasn't able to check in as often as I'd like. Hope you're enjoying Edmonton! Yes!! You got a lot of the details spot on for a university professor. After some time, the profession offers significant job security as well. Usually after 10 years or so, professors are given something called tenure, which in short, basically means the professor has a permanent position with the university given they are strong lecturers, have good student reviews, have strong research and publications, awards, etc. University professors (depending on the school and faculty they're teaching in, how many courses they are teaching, their research, whether they have tenure, etc.) can also make more than $150,000 annually. It's a pretty secure job and like you said, the work-life balance is a lot more feasible than medicine, which is nice. On top of that, university lecturers are needed everywhere, so there is definitely room to travel with the job if it's what you desire! In highschool, I wish I was aware of how many opportunities there are in science fields. In grade 12, I genuinely only considered medicine and we weren't well-versed in other careers in science. I shied away from research because we really didn't talk about it enough for me to grasp what types of research there are, what positions you can hold in research, the level of education required to attain these careers, etc. I learned a lot of other science-based careers in my undergrad, and some even during my masters! Especially for some research jobs such as a clinical research coordinator (for this job, you help run clinical trials in a hospital/research setting, and it pays a comfortable salary), I wish I knew of them earlier so I could provide myself with more opportunities to pursue such a career in case medicine doesn't work out. Now, I feel that I have a slightly late start in pursuing such careers in case I do not go to medical school. I chose my career pretty early in life, but it was a pretty vague ""I want to be a doctor"" statement because I wanted to help people. That reasoning didn't further develop until I was in undergrad, and especially in my masters. As mentioned before, this career choice was solidified during my masters because I had experience indirectly helping others with my research, and with my dad was diagnosed with cancer last year and seeing this direct level of care with doctors and nurses and how they did everything they could for my dad made me want to do the same for others and make them feel the gratitude I felt for them. I also work at an eye clinic with opthalmologists and seeing how they change the lives of patients and their vision also inspires me to go into medicine. However, as mentioned for my backup career (research coordinator), I mostly was inspired from my masters program and volunteer work in another research lab. I liked being involved in human research and directly communicating with families and patients. I felt like although I am not a doctor, I have a special role in research involving these patients, and these patients hold the same gratitude for researchers like myself who try to help people with their conditions as much as they appreciate doctors who care for them. Both my dream career and backup career hold special relationships with others and help them, which is what drew me to these careers! Great job with this section! I really like that you used this opportunity to explore an additional career choice and provide yourself with insight to several careers, even if teaching isn't your first chioce. Do you have any questions for this module? If intersted, you can try the extension activity with someone else you may know in your desired field of work. Other than that, is there a specific module you'd like to open next? Mentee 2023-03-25, 14:17: Hi! Edmonton was so fun, the university is so much bigger than I expected though lol! How was Asia? Also! Exciting news, I got some funding from Metis and then U of A also awarded me a $4,000 scholarship! So now I'm not so worried about how I'm going to afford my first year. I actually like the idea of being a university professor if my other career plans don't work out, so I'm happy I discovered a bit more about it. A research coordinator also sounds cool! I'll have to look more into it. Would you please open Dis &amp; Misinformation? Mentor 2023-03-25, 14:33: Glad to hear your Edmonton trip went well! Hahah I was shocked too seeing how large the UBC campus was when I first went to university. It's nice that you got to take a look at the campus beforehand! Asia was good too! I went to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It was great! Still trying to fix my sleep schedule unfortunately. Wow!!! Congratulations!!! The awards are well deserved and you must be so proud! Great news to hear! I will now open Dis and Misinformation. :)","Mentor 2022-12-27, 16:02: Hey Jessica! I've opened the strategic studying module. I think this will be a great module to get you prepared/familiar with what to expect with studying in post-secondary, and trying to use good study habits as you move onto university. Learning in university and staying on track can definitely be challenging, and learning study habits that work best for you is a learning-curve in itself! Give the reflection question and the anchor text/video a try and feel free to share your thoughts! Strategic studying was definitely a valuable lesson I wish I was more familiar with going into university, so I'd be glad to share some of my insight as we dive into this module. Mentee 2022-12-30, 13:50: I want to share the warm up activity with you so I can explain how I study now and maybe you'll have some tips on how to improve! I actually change my study methods depending on what class it is. Although lots of people say not to do this, I've actually found rewriting my notes the most effective for myself. When I rewrite the notes though, I don't take it word-for-word. Instead I reform it into my own words and I have found this much easier to remember. By using my own words I gain a better understanding, and I also sometimes come up with sayings or similar things that I can recall during tests. I also go against the video because instead of spreading it out I typically do this the night before the test hahha (bad idea I know). I'm hoping to fix that because I know it will end terribly in university. I normally do this method for my Physics and Chemistry class. With chemistry, when I rewrite the notes I'm able to find certain patterns that I can remember or create sayings. For physics though, I don't really rewrite the notes. Instead I just pick out certain parts that are important like x=fgsin0 or whatever or certain laws that I will need. With physics I of course have to practice doing the questions more than reviewing the notes. For biology though, I found it effective to create a unit-web. This is where I take just one unit and put the name in the middle. I circle this and then I go through the notes and pick certain things. Its sort of hard to explain and I think I'll just provide a picture, but the end result looks like a web and this way you can connect certain points with other things. Unit Web Mine look slightly different but thats the idea. Now for English I probably study the worst. I'll do a quick reread and just tell myself it's common sense. My English teachers quizzes and tests are fairly easy so this has worked most of the time. Other than that though, I don't really know how to study for English or Socials. I also found I learn better when I try and help others, this shows me what I actually know and what parts I need to improve on. Discussion Questions Which strategy seems the most useful? For me, I think I would do the one were you just try to recall what you know. I think this would be very effective as it would tell me what I know, where I'd be wrong, and what I need to study more. Asking you I'm curious to know how you study for your university classes and if it's different from how you studied in highschool. I'm also curious on how different the classes between high school and university are and what was the most challenging part for you? Mentor 2022-12-31, 13:59: I really like that you switch study methods depending on the class and I agree that based on the material you're learning, it's good to find a method that works best to learn the content, and the same methods may not work for all classes. I do the same! I completely agree with the study method of re-writing your notes in your own words. I used this method in almost all of my courses - It tells you whether you truly understand the content, and the act of re-writing it really helps to store it in our memory, so that's a great study method and I think you'll be using it a lot in university too! It's great that you already do this in high school because it's a very useful skill for studying in university. The one thing I agree you should be mindful of in university is last-minute studying. This will be your downfall!! Start early, even if it's a little bit each day, but you'll be surprised how much better you do on exams and how much more prepared you feel. I speak from experience as I've had to do a few too many all-nighters and they're just not worth the lack of sleep. Try going over your notes immediately after class while you're still familiar with the content. That way, it'll be easier to form questions you may have for your professors. I love unit webs! We call them ""mind maps"" and they're really helpful. I haven't made one in a while, but I made one for a course a few years ago and it made me realize how many of our class concepts were connected to each other. It was a pharmacology class, so similar to biology. For midterms and finals, I think this will be a great way to study! I agree with what you mentioned about English - it's just a difficult course to study for. In university, english courses were mostly essay-based and you kind of had to prepare points for what you think the essay questions will be, so sometimes I just make bullet points of key concepts from my english lectures. However, high school english was pretty different and I did the same ""it's common sense"" type of studying LOL but I don't recommend that for university hahaha. This may be silly, but I find this is probably the most useful studying method to me, but explaining things out loud as if you're teaching someone else/an audience has also been a big part of my studying in university. Being able to ""teach"" the content to someone else (or imaginary people haha) really shows me whether I know a concept or not, and walking through a concept with words step-by-step helps me identify where there are gaps in my knowledge (plus, if I don't have enough time to rewrite all my notes, I use this method to cover the remaining topics in my courses). The talking-out-loud method also helps me prepare for written answer questions since I know I can word my answers in a variety of ways and I'm not just memorizing what was on our lecture slides, so in a way it's similar to your method of re-writing notes in your own words. My friends and I did the teaching/talking out loud method a lot before exams for our undergrad, and it was very helpful, so it may help you as well. :) This is pretty much what you mentioned when you said you try to help others and that helps you study! All of the methods I described above are the ways I learned to study in university. High school was definitely a lot easier given how the teaching and testing styles differ between high school and university. I found that with high school, a lot of the testing was memorization, so you didn't really need to ""understand"" the content. However, university really forces you to apply a concept into different situations, and learning how to adjust to those types of questions in exams was my biggest challenge, which is why re-writing notes in my own words and ""teaching"" an audience was so helpful for me, because it showed me how much I knew the content and helped me reflect on my learning. Mentee 2023-01-03, 18:45: I feel better knowing I'm on the right track haha. I'll work on studying over periods instead of the night before so I can get in the habit now. I have a physics final on the 24th so this will be a good time to try it out! I will also try your method of talking out loud/teaching, I think it'll work perfectly :) I have a quick question. To be able to graduation I have to complete a thing our school calls a ""capstone project"" [I don't know if you had to do one or it might've had a different name], but it's basically something I have to learn and put 30+ hours into. I'm doing mine on post-secondary and how I picked a program and university. Anyways, where I'm going with this is I need a mentor, and since you're my mentor and this relates to my capstone, I was hoping to use you? I just need you to fill out a form (I'll attach it) and then I need you to answer/sign in the three places I highlighted, don't worry about anything else. I talked to my teacher about not giving personal info and he said it's okay so I just put N/A. Capstone mentor agreement I hope this works hahha. Mentor 2023-01-07, 09:58: Yes! I would love to be your mentor for your capstone project. We had similar requirements when I was graduating highschool. Thank you for considering me! I opened the link and it said file could not be found :( Would it be possible to attach it to a Google doc and I fill out the information on that page directly? Mentee 2023-01-08, 13:19: Hey! Awesome thank you so much! :) It's a PDF and google docs doesn't like that, so I just took a screenshot of the page I need you to sign on. I'm not exactly sure how to do this hahha. If you are able to do a 'mark up' like on IPhone and just sign that would work otherwise I have no idea. Google doc Mentor 2023-01-09, 04:48: Hey! I think I made it work. Take a look and tell me if that's okay :) Mentee 2023-01-09, 15:38: Yes, it's perfect! Thank you so much :) I think we're done with Strategic studying, if you agree can you open funding your future please? Mentor 2023-01-12, 21:02: Perfect, I will open funding your future!","Mentor 2023-01-12, 21:36: Hi Jessica! I've opened the Funding Your Future Module here. Use the warm up activity as ""warm up"" for the anchor texts. Dealing with finances in university can be daunting, especially after moving away from home and not having as much fincncial responsibility with your family. It's very helpful that prior to moving away into a big city, you have a general understanding of how you will budget for tuition/tectbooks, food, and housing, and whether you will be provided with financial help from your parents/student loans/your savings. Many people I knew that moved away from home were not fully aware of the financial burden that can fall on you during university, and that comes with not knowing about scholarships to apply to, not having a balance of work-school-life, and even buying ""quick"" meals, which ends up costing more in the long run. Finances are very confusing and a topic not many talk about. Give these activities a try, and if you're comfortable, share your questions or concerns with me and I can try to provide some clarity on anything you may be unsure of! Mentee 2023-01-15, 15:28: Warm up activity: What I think I know - Well for finances at university, I know there's tuition, books, supplies, housing, and meal plan you have to pay for. U of A housing and meal plan is optional, but I think I'll be paying those fees for my first year at least. Outside of university, I know if you live off campus there's apartment rents/fees, parking fees, groceries of course, stuff along those lines. For budgeting, I think it's good to set an amount on how much you spend on certain things. The required fees for university are most important, and if you have money left over - depending on how much, you can put limited amounts towards other things. I would try to keep a good amount saved though incase something happens, only a few hundred every few weeks for personal spending (clothes, decor, food -like eating out, etc). I feel like this is low, but may help in the future when money is needed. Questions that puzzle me - I'm actually puzzled on how people can afford to go to university. I've been looking at the cost lately and I will certainy need student loans. I know many get scholarships but sometimes that still isn't enough (unless you get a HUGE one). Explore/learn more about finances - I can do my research online, or I can talk to people who deal with finances and get advise. Anchor 1 How I might fund my schooling - I have a few different ways, firstly, my mother has been saving since I was young, so I will have some money from her to help with my degree. Secondly, I have been working and also saving my money for university. Although between these two it may cover the first year, maybe year 1/2. I also have applied on many scholarships already, and plan to continue. I applied on a big Canadian scholarship, but did not get it (knew it but worth a shot), I've also applied to all of U of A's scholarships, and when our local one's open I will apply to them as well. Since I'm Metis, I'm able to apply on Indigenous scholarships, I have done a few but I plan to apply to more. I'm eligible for U of A's entrance awards, their Turtle Spirit Pathway Award, and Discover U of A award. I have applied on these three as they're the only one's I'm eligible for. I have been finding applying for scholarships a bit harder than I thought. I thought they would be more grade based than community based (I was so wrong). I have little volunteer work as most of my highschool years were during Covid. Along with that I had to focus more on school and getting money than volunteering. I also didn't do sports so I have a harder time trying to fill out these applications. Haha, it really sucks. Questions: I'm curious how you funded/funding your education? Especially since you've completed your undergrad and started a grad degree, that has to cost quite a bit hahha. I was also wondering if you can share any websites/resources for scholarships or funding. Mentor 2023-01-19, 03:08: I really like your idea of planning a budget for necessities vs. leisure spending! Overall, you seem to have a great sense of what you should be preparing for when allocating your finances! Do you think you will be getting a car, or will you be using transit? If you are planning on living nearby campus, transit is often quite reliable, and I believe your tuition may include a transit pass. I'm not 100% sure if that's the case with U of A, but with UBC where I go, it was automatically put into our tuition. I agree that paying for school is hard. Many students are offered help from their families, otherwise they often turn to student loans. The nice thing about student loans is that the interest rate is much lower than other forms of loans, so you don't end up owing drastically more. However, it's definitely tough having to deal with the debt in the long run! In the future if a student loan is required, try to save all the money you do not need and avoid leisure spending. A major burden will be lifted knowing you have some money put away to pay back some of your loan. :) I'm really glad to hear you and your mom have some money put aside for 1-1.5 years of your degree. With regards to scholarships, I completely agree that they are extremely difficult to find or even win, but I always think that trying and failing is better than the ""what if"" feeling. It's great that you're also applying for the U of A scholarships! Have you heard on the results from any that you've applied to?Keep your eyes out for additional Indigenous scholarships. You may be able to look into Indigenous scholarships that are provided by the government/province/city rather than the school if you haven't searched for them already :) I fell into the same realm as you when applying for scholarships in grade 12. I too didn't have a significant amount of extracurriculars/volunteering in highschool, and I wasn't an athlete by any means so finding grade-based scholarships felt difficult, if not impossible. On top of that, some scholarships were provided for very specific fields of study (ex. computer science, technology) so even if they were grade-based, I wasn't eligible. I wish there was a way for students to know what scholarship applications look for nowadays, but unfortunately, it's not discussed with students thorughout highschool, and very bright students miss out on funding because they lack additional experience they didn't know they needed! Answers to your questions: 1) I've been lucky with my undergrad where my parents saved as I grew up and I didn't have to worry too much about my undergraduate tuition. I also got some small scholarships from the Government of BC for my exam scores (back when they had provincial exams - I'm not sure if that's something they still do or if it's done outside of BC). Masters funding is quite interesting because I didn't know about this until I started applying, but if you're doing a science research-based masters program (ex. biology, neuroscience, experimental medicine, reproductive health, zoology, etc.), you actually have to be paid by your masters professor (or thorugh a scholarship) for a minimum of 2 years, and for a PhD, a minimum of 4 years. The amount varies by program, but it's a pretty significant amount that covers your tuition and basic living expenses (18.5-22K that I'm aware of for masters students). Many people also have part-time jobs to supplement their income (usually by taking roles as a teaching assistant at the university). For a masters program, it's a lot less of a financial burden, and I think funding undergrad is the difficult part! 2) I used scholarshipscanada.com back in highschool (but didn't win any from there), but since you are going to Alberta, studentaid.alberta.ca/scholarships may be helpful! They even have an Indigenous category and a Metis-specific scholarship you may be eligible for. :) if you're not currently living in Alberta, let me know and I can try to find some other resources for you. Mentee 2023-01-22, 10:53: Hey! I actually already have bought a car, but I'm not planning to take it to university untill maybe my second or third year depending on where I live. But for the first year I will live on campus and then take transit for the most part since parking and insurance costs a lot. I also think the transit pass is included in my tuition but I'll double check. I haven't heard about any I've applied on. U of A's scholarships just recently closed so I might hear from that soon. Our local scholarships aren't open until May and I won't know if I've gotten any until grad in June, which is sort of annoying lol. We still have provincial exams sort of? It's different I think but I've never heard of someone getting a scholarship from them ): I never knew this about a masters/phd, would you be able to describe it a little more? Also I'll give the canada scholar site a try! Thanks. I'll look into the alberta one but I live in BC so I don't know if i'll be allowed, but BC probably has a similar site. Another thing is I have many finals this week so I just want to let you know I might take a little longer to respond if thats okay? I'll try to keep within the 3 day limit but I'm stressing so hard haha. Mentor 2023-01-24, 15:30: Oh no that's a pain! Hopefully you're awarded a few of the scholarships you've applied for. :) For some reason I thought you were from Alberta so that's my fault. If you Google ""Indigenous Student Scholarships BC"" there is a government website with a few links to scholarships you may be eligible for. Take a look and hopefully you are able to apply to some! For provincial exams, they usually don't ""publicize"" that they provide awards. I didn't even know they were gave awards for provincials back in grade 12 either. I think they automatically provide them to high-scoring students. However, I don't really know if it's only for certain subjects or if it's still applicable now, so I may not have the most up-to-date information. Back when I received the award, it was for the grade 12 English provincial exam for the 500 highest scores in BC or something along those lines. Yes absolutely! So normally when you are enrolled into a research based post-graduate degree (Masters, PhD) where you are required to complete a thesis, many programs are required to pay the student for a certain period of time for the work they're doing in the lab. For masters programs, it is 2 years minimum, and for a PhD program, it's 4 years minimum. They pay you because lab work is very time consuming and it's so people don't drop out of the program due to lack of funds (this is what I was told. However, I'm not sure if this is the sole reason).The amount of money really varies by the program you're in, but the funding (usually called a stipend) you receive must be paid by your research supervisor (a professor that has a lab and does research), or through a scholarship. If you are unable to obtain a scholarship to fund you, your research supervisor must fund you for the minimum amount of time. Some research supervisors are nice and will pay you for your entire degree if you are there longer, but that's not always the case :P Good luck on your final exams! Please don't worry about the 3-day response time. Study hard and focus on your exams and we will touch base afterwards. :) You got this!! Mentee 2023-01-27, 11:32: Thank you! I will look at the scholarships you suggested. Also thats so cool! I didn't know that about graduate degrees either, glad I learned haha! I tried to start anchor 2 but it wants me to fill out a chart thing. The only problem is when I download it, it's set to viewer only so I can't actually type on it. So if its okay I'll just make my own 'chart' in here. If its not, let me know and I'll try to figure it out! Where I'm spending my money. Right now I only have to pay for any personal things I want so I rarely buy things. The only thing I really need to pay for is my gas which is 50-70 depending on the prices every 2 1/2 weeks. I've already paid insurance awhile ago, other than that I'm saving my money. While I'm at university including tuition, residence, meal plan, books, and other fees it'll be ~25k for the first year. After that I'm not too sure depending on if I live on campus or in an apartment. As talked about before my mom has saved and so have I. If I get any scholarships I should be fairly good. My mom said she may also send me an 'allowance' every once awhile so I can afford to do activities or go out for a meal etc. My question is what was the most challenging money management for you? Mentor 2023-01-28, 16:25: Right?! I had no clue either - Imagine my shock when I saved up just for my supervisor to tell me she had to pay me. It was a pleasant surprise :) No problem! Feel free to make your own ""chart"" and I'll let the program know that students can't edit the file. Thanks for bringing it to my attention! You seem to be going great with your spending habits. When people would overspend in highschool prior to moving away for university, I noticed their biggest difficulties were adjusting their spending habits since their money was mainly ""fun"" money. You're doing great! This may be looking ahead into the future too much, but I remember you mentioning your best friend is also hoping to move to Alberta and you planned on being roomates in the future. If that's still the case then great! Renting with a roomate is much cheaper than living alone, and living on campus is a lot more expensive than having your own place. I like the allowance idea! You still deserve to enjoy being in university and having money to spend for fun, so I'm really glad your mom is wanting to lend a hand in that aspect. For me, the most challenging money management was transitioning from working a lot in the summer prior to university, and having to cut my work hours, and therefore making less money. My money was ""fun"" money and it was nice working 5 days a week and having the money to spend. When I started university, the transition from highschool to uni was pretty drastic and it made me cut down my work hours significantly in my first year. This made a bit more difficult to leisurely spend as often as I'd like, but like you, I usually spent on necessities and saved the rest for the future specifically for my masters (which I didn't end up needing) and medical school. However, I do know that I've been extremely lucky financially since I had help from my family for my undergrad, which many students don't have, and I don't think I'd be in the same position with school and money management if it weren't for their help. Do you have any worries or fears regarding your finances and university that you want to try and navigate or discuss? If not, give the ""chart"" a try when you have a chance and we'll go from there! Mentee 2023-01-31, 15:22: Hey! The only fear I have is not getting any scholarships to help out. Otherwise I can't think of any right now. I'll work on the chart here, but in the meantime I thought of a question that is off topic. Last night I discovered I need to maintain a 3.3 GPA throughout university to be able to stay in the program. I'm worried now as that sounds fairly hard to accomplish? I don't really know. A lot of my teachers say they were A students in school, but C in university. Do you know how hard it is to obtain a 3.3 GPA in university trhoughout the 4 years? Mentee 2023-02-06, 18:55: Hey! Thank you! I totally forgot about used books etc. I will definitely use the site and looked for used books, thank you! Yes I figured I should note it's not every month because it seemed unreasonable or like I couldn't do math haha. I think we are done with this section, if you agree can you open Well being and self care. :) Mentor 2023-02-06, 23:13: Perfect! I will open up the well being and self-care module next!","Mentor 2022-10-26, 13:15: Hi Jessica! It's so great to finally ""meet"" you. I read over your profile and noticed that we both share a lot of interest in neuroscience, which is great! I'm a masters student in the neuroscience program at the University of British Columbia and I'm glad we've been matched together. I too agree that the brain is very fascinating and your interest in neuropsychology, diseases, and their impact on the brain and nervous system are very interesting topics! I also saw that you like to sew - I've been quite an amateur but I like to do easy sewing projects on my free-time. What do you like to sew? :) Congratulations on your acceptance into the U of A neuroscience program! The school offers great neuroscience courses (along with U of C) and the transition from a small community to city life can be quite scary, but also very exiting. :) Do you have a preference for which university you'd like to go to? I look forward to speaking with you more over the next few months. If you have any preference for a certain topic you'd like to discuss together, or would prefer some general conversation, let me know and I'll open up your preferred topic for us to chat about. :) Mentee 2022-10-28, 20:04: Hi Fermin! Sorry for the late response, I've been so busy lately. I'm super glad to be matched with someone that is in neuroscience! I see you're in a masters for neuroscience right now and I think that's super amazing! I'm planning to complete a masters in neuroscience as well. I just recently discovered I like to sew so I haven't made many projects yet. I just finished a drawstring bag and am now starting an 'upcycled' shirt! :) I see your dream career is to be a baker or cake decorater which I think is pretty neat but also funny as it's totally different than what you're in school for now, haha. I also noticed you enjoy baking lava cake, I've never actually tried it before but I bet it's delicious. What is your second favourite thing to bake? :) I'm super happy about getting into U of A, although U of C is my first choice (but they haven't gotten back to me). I'm going to do more research on the schools and then decide between the two, but at the moment my preferred choice is U of C. I'm not exactly sure what I want to start talking about. I'm kind of curious what it's like to be in the neuroscience program and what a day looks like for you. :) Mentor 2022-10-31, 21:11: Hey Jessica! No worries - Grade 12 is always takes up a lot of time so I understand! That's awesome! A masters program is very rewarding. It's wonderful to hear that you've thought so far ahead into your future. I have no doubts you'll achieve your goals with your passion and persistence, and based on your profile, it seems like you have a good sense of the type of career you hope to achieve from neuroscience. Those are some neat projects you're doing with sewing. A drawstring bag is so versatile and it's very cool that you made it yourself! My sewing projects are a lot simpler (ex. hemming or fitting clothing), so an upcycled shirt sounds like another very fun project. Hahaha oh to be a baker! I agree it's quite funny and everyone I tell this to thinks the same thing. It would be nice having a career more laid back, and if finances weren't a factor, I think my life would steer me in that direction :P But at this time, going to medical school is the true dream career I hope to achieve and I really love neuroscience, research, and healthcare, so merging those interests together in medicine would be amazing. My second favourite thing to bake are sugar cookies! I recently started baking them more often and they're so easy to prepare and they're so soft! I absolutely love them! Do you have any favourite baked goods you like to eat? Even if U of C is your initial option, U of A is a great backup option and a very prestigious Canadian school! Do you know when final acceptances are sent out? Sometimes acceptance letters are staggered and I know some people who were accepted to their first-choice unicersities in the summer. Awesome! Especially since you're beginning a neuroscience bachelors program in the fall, I think that looking into the day of a neuroscience student is a great choice. I'll open the ""Post Secondary &amp; Career Planning"" discussion to dive into that topic. Feel free to continue the conversation here, and/or move onto the other discussion. Mentor 2022-11-10, 00:32: No worries at all! Oooh yes! I think they're danishes right? I love them too. I agree - the free breakfasts at hotel always had them (before Covid) and they're soooo good. It really sucks that they aren't as available as they once were before. Nice! Like you said, it is a bit farther away but fingers crossed all falls into place for you by then. Let's give the post-secondary and career planning conversation a try - are you able to see the anchor texts? Mentor 2022-12-13, 16:17: Bringing a smaller canvas to campus is a really good idea! It's good to hold onto hobbies/traditions that are important to you when making such a major transition in your life because it gives you a time to de-stress. I love how you and your mom found a way to keep that hobby for your move. An art group will be super cool too. Universities often have many clubs you can join, and if your university has a clubs day (which is usually the 1st-2nd day of school at UBC, so I believe it'll be similar for UofA and UofC), you can definitely find an art, or even a painting club. Clubs meet pretty often so it'll be nice to be able to paint in a laid-back setting. Jumping ahead of our conversation a little - clubs are a great place to make friends especially since you're surrounded by people with the same hobbies, so it's a lot easier to connect with others. Plus, if your clubs meet often, you're more likely to stay friends with those people since you'll see them more! For traditions I found important, I scheduled time in my calendar (along with my other responsibilities) to ensure I have time for them and my schoolwork. I have a bit of a silly tradition with my sister where once a week, we will play Nintendo Switch for an hour and a half (we play the game Overcooked - I'm not sure if you heard of it but it's so fun). It's a fun way for both of us to de-stress and it helped me feel like I wasn't drowning in school work. Finding a way to organize my time really helped me spend time with my sister, but overall played a big role on not falling behind in school as well. I didn't move as I'm lucky I ended up in a universty that didn't require me to, but I did end up spending a lot time away from home just to study/complete assignments/prepare for exams. I'm a pretty big home-body and like to be with my family and sister, so it was a bit of a challenge adjusting to the difference in time I spent with everyone. Although I can't directly relate to such a major move like you'll be doing, my friends that moved away from home scheduled calls with their family/friends from back home. They said whenever they needed some extra support or just to hear a familiar voice, it was nice that loved ones were a phone call away especially in the first few weeks of moving away from home. Maybe try to find a designated day and time you can call your friends/family back home to catch up. It's always nice seeing familiar faces when you're far from home. :) Making friends in university is daunting when you don't have a lot of friends from your childhood going to the same school, but you'd be surprised how open and kind other students are! My biggest piece of advice: don't be afraid to start the conversation! I'm pretty shy myself, but university really forced me to come out of my shell and it was the best thing that could've happened to me because I still have a lot of good friends from my undergrad to this day! Also - sitting near the same group of people in a lecture is another great way. People love familiar faces, and seeing the same face a few times a week makes it easy for others to approach you. Also, since you're living on campus, your dorm/building is the BEST place to make friends. A lot of dorms have activities they do for students living there and many students attend these activities so they can meet new people, so seeing familiar faces around and starting conversations with those people is a great way to make friends. Just remember - a lot of the people on campus are on the same boat as you and want to make friends just as much as everyone else. :) Are any of your friends from your hometown also planning on attending UoA or UoC? Or any school in Edmonton or Calgary? Mentee 2022-12-18, 12:07: Hi! Yes! I've heard about the clubs and I'm super excited for them as they do seem like a great way to connect with others. Thank you for the advice on just scheduling time into my day, that seems like a great way to make sure I destress! Also, I accepted my offer at U of A for neuroscience because it worked the best for me to get there and for my family, as well as I was already accepted into the program I wanted (unlike U of C). I already have two friends that are going to U of A, but I'm not super close with them -although I might get close with them! And then my childhood best friend is planning to eventually go to Edmonton for school, but it won't be U of A. Still exciting as her and I could potentially share an apartment or something later on! Mentor 2022-12-22, 15:46: Congratulations Jessica! I bet you'll really enjoy U of A and the program will be everything you expect of neuroscience. How exciting!! It's awesome to know that you'll have some familiar faces at your campus. Although you may not be very close, they likely feel the same if they don't have other close friends attending too. Yay! I'm so glad your best friend will soon attend a school in Edmonton. Does she know when she hopes to attend? By then, I'm sure you'll be familiar with the city and you can show your best friend around. Sharing an apartment later will be so fun!! It seems like we're coming to an end of this module. However, if you have additional questions about moving from rural to urban, let me know! Otherwise, is there another module that interests you that we can transition to? Mentee 2023-01-31, 15:51: I completed the chart but I'm not sure how I add it to my portfolio Mentor 2023-02-04, 08:39: That's a very valid fear. Universities sometimes will offer need-based funding as well, so if you are unable to obtain scholarships, you may still be granted funding based on need (I think you'd have to apply for it, but I think if you Google ""need based funding"" or ""student bursaries"" for your university, you may be able to apply that way. I just remembered this is an option once you're already a student. :) Sounds good about the chart! That's a very good question and I initially struggled with the transition from high school to university too. For many, being a straight A student to getting poorer grades (at least initially) is common, but we all end up adapting to the change in study habits throughout the semester. With that being said, I do think it's very achievable to maintain a 3.3 GPA. And remember, you're not required to take 5 courses a semester - If 5 courses is taking a major toll in your GPA, don't be afraid to reduce your courseload to 3-4 courses a semester. Even less if you need to. Another note for GPA, I always try to find a way to balance my science and required arts courses. That way, you're not drowning in science content and it makes the course load more bearable if you're taking 4-5 classes each semester :) Mentee 2023-02-04, 13:45: Yep! Here is the google doc Doc Mentor 2023-02-04, 14:34: Nice work! The chart looks great and it seems like as of now, you have your budgeting done well. Of course as you mentioned, things may change in the future in case you need to take out a student loan, but for the coming year, it seems very well thought out. I also like the ""not every month"" notes that you had haha. One thing I noticed was for textbooks you had $3500. I highly suggest buying used books (or if possible, renting books) for your courses if possible. Normally, a new textbook edition comes out annually, but some professors are great and will let you use previous years' textbooks or older textbook editions and you can save hundreds of dollars doing this. I usually look on Facebook marketplace but sometimes there are buy-and-sell textbook groups on facebook for your school specifically. Sometimes, you can even find textbooks online for free. I'll send you a link for where you'll almost always find free textbooks (I have to hunt the link down, but I will find it), and this cite has helped me save near thousands of dollars throughout university. However, if you don't like to use e-textbooks, you may not like it. It's safe to give it a try if you ever need to find a textbook. :) Mentor 2023-02-04, 14:47: gen.lib.rus.ec &lt;-- that is the cite. Seems sketchy I know but I promise it's awesome and so many university students I know have used it for e-textbooks! Mentor 2023-09-12, 12:23: Hi Jessica! It's been a while but I wanted to check-in and see how you're liking your new city and new school. Anything exciting or noteworthy going on? How are you liking your program so far? :)","Mentor 2022-11-29, 03:13: Hey Jessica! I've opened up the ""From Rural to Urban"" Module here! Give anchor texts 1 and 2 a shot and we can build on those discussions and any additional qusetions you may have. :) Although I don't have much experience with living in Alberta/Calgary, my best friend moved there last year, so if you're looking for specific recommendations/activities, or questions regarding the area, I will definitely ask so you can familiarize yourself, especially Calgary since she lives there. :) Mentee 2022-12-04, 11:51: Hey! Thanks, I will think of some things I want to know about Calgary and get back to you about that. Anchor 1 3 things I like about living in a rural area: Mentee 2022-12-04, 12:10: Whoops I accidentally hit send lol. 3 things I like about living in a rural area: 1) My favourite part about living somewhere smaller is how easy it is to get around town. It only takes about 30-40 minutes max to walk across town and driving is even easier. It was nice to learn to drive in a less busy city and it doesn't take forever to get around since traffic is never too heavy. 2) I also like how quiet it is around town. Whenever I stay in a larger city, I hear steady traffic or sirens. Whereas here, we rarely here it; which is funny because we only live a few blocks from the hospital. I like the quietness because I find it easier to get stuff done or just go for a peaceful walk (when it's not -40 out). 3) The last thing I like is how it feels cleaner than a urban setting. We don't have very many homeless people that wander around nor do we have lots of garbage lying around. I know not every bigger city is like this but lots of the ones I've visited just feel, more dirty. I tend to see more homeless because the population is bigger. I also feel like I see more trash on the ground than I do in my rural city. I like this because I have a hard time seeing people suffer and as much as I want to help them, I can't help them all. I'm also very 'save the Earth' so when I see less trash lying around, it makes me happier. 2 things I dont like: 1) I really hate how there's nothing to do. Since our population is much smaller, we don't have access to big brand name stores or fun activities to do. Growing up going to walk around Walmart was the most fun we could have in town. I've become very bored with our town and I find it annoying that we have to travel hours away if we want to go any good shopping. 2) I also dislike how everyone knows everyone. Since it's a smaller city, there's not really any people you don't know. This could be a good thing but I find it harder to make new friends because people are stuck to certain groups and no one really is open to changing that. Also when things happen, everyone hears about it and that can cause a negative impact towards others. I just find it annoying and sometimes wish everyone didn't know everyone. Asking your mentor a question: I'm curious, as a female, how safe do you feel in a big city? I'm worried about feeling constantly unsafe or on my toes. I'm also curious what you like and dislike about living in the city? Mentor 2022-12-08, 19:32: Hi Jessica! I really like the positives you mentioned about living in a small town. Although I don't live in a small town, my neighbourhood is slightly secluded from the busy city so I completely agree with the quietness and cleanliness. I'm about 30 minutes away (driving) from the main city Vancouver, and it is definitely a lot louder and chaotic than where I live. Additionally, I completely agree with the cleanliness aspect and the difference in homeless population. I find that certain areas of Vancouver are a lot dirtier and one specific area, called East Hastings, has one of the greatest homeless population in all of Canada. My town is obviously not rural, but I find the positives/negatives very similar. Lucky for you, living in a big city provides you a lot of opportunities to try new things! However, you might run into a problem with the weather in Alberta :P It gets very cold, and reaches similar temperatures to what you've mentioned. And going to a major university such as UoA of UoC, you're bound to meet new people. If you're living on campus housing, you'll definitely make friends easily. Safety is a really good question, and unfortunately as women, we need to constantly worry about our safety. In areas where most of the population are university students, I actually feel very safe, mostly because I've always felt like the university community looks out for one another, especially the girls who look out for one another. Even in Vancouver's downtown area, if I'm with friends I usually feel okay. If it's just a group of girls we usually are a bit more vigilant. I've run into the rare scenario where I feel like I need to watch over my shoulder, but I've been quite lucky, as have my friends, that we've never experienced anything that put our safety in jeopardy. I would definitely go around with a friend or two when you're familiarizing yourself with a new area just to be extra cautious! One thing I dislike about living in the city is the traffic! Especially during 5pm when the workday is over, traffic is completely backed up and sometimes your car isn't moving for 10-15 minutes. Another thing, which is more specific to Vancouver, is how our city quite literally does not know how to deal with snow. We had our first ""bad"" snow day a few weeks ago, and people who left work at 5pm did not get home until 2am because traffic was not moving and poeple didn't have winter tires on. I don't think you'll run into this problem in Alberta since they're a lot better with snow. :) Mentor 2022-12-08, 19:33: How are you feeling about this module? Do you have any other questions given my answers? Anything still lingering in your mind on the transition to living in Alberta? Or the difference in culture between a rural and urban area? Mentee 2022-12-11, 15:42: Hey, Thank you for all the helpful info! I heard about Vancouvers snow day and thought it was kind of funny, although it probably wasn't funny for the people who experienced it. For now, I don't have any questions as I feel you covered them all! I'll start on anchor 2 - Same but different I picked the 'tradition' one. I don't feel as if my family or I have a set tradition but something I enjoy doing a lot is painting or crafty things. My mother and I recently discussed this because I'm unsure of how I can continue painting while living on campus since the dorms are so small, but I need a way as it's how I maintain my mental health. Our 'plan' is to bring smaller canvas and just little bottles of paint as well as some brushes just so I can do a small activity to keep myself happier. Another thing we came up with is, is to join an art group or find a place I can paint, etc. Questions for you: How did you keep up your traditions that you found important? How were you feeling when you moved (I don't remember if you lived on campus) and if you did, how did you deal with those emotions? Or any tips. How did you make new friends? Or any suggestions. Mentee 2022-12-27, 10:08: I'm not exactly sure where she wants to go to school in Edmonton but I know she wants to be a horse farrier - so wherever that is lol. I don't have any other questions. Can we open Strategic Studying? Also, Merry (late) Christmas. Mentor 2022-12-27, 15:56: Exciting! It'll be fun to have your best friend by your side eventually! Merry (late) Christmas to you too! I hope you had a great day with your family and friends, and you received some nice Christmas gifts as well. :) Yes! Let's open strategic studying. I will begin our next conversation in the next chat.","Mentor 2023-03-25, 14:41: Welcome to the Dis and Misinformation module! Information is readily available everywhere and it's difficult to fact-check and verify information as it rapidly spreads. For that reason, it's important to think critically of the information you are presented to make sense of it. We'll start off by reading over two articles in the anchor text, then I'll get you to go over the discussion questions. :) Mentee 2023-03-25, 17:23: The articles were actually quite interesting. Something I didn't know, or even thought of, was putting an image in the google search engine to see where it was first used. I think thats a neat way to see if something may have truth behind it ,etc. How much of a role do my emotions play in what I choose to click on and share? I feel as if it depends on what it is. I know there is a lot of mis&amp;disinformation on social media so I am not easily convinced on a lot of things like conspiracy theories, etc. But I do think my emotions play a part, especially if it's something I have a strong opinion on. For example, when I first heard about the US overturning Roe v Wade, I was shocked. But I reassessed because I saw this on Tiktok and Instagram, and not everything on there is true. So I started doing some searching and kept up on it and eventually I did realize it was an actual event that was happening. So in this example, my emotions did play a part and I ended up clicking, liking, and sharing the side that was fighting getting it overturned. But for other things, my emotions are not as strong and my interest is not held so strongly, so I typically don't end up doing research to find out if things are true, I will moreso be like if thats true, great, if its not, great kind of mindset lol. So yes, in a way they play a part in what I share, but I grew up very aware of how social media portrays certain things. Where do you get your news and how do you find reliable sources of information? What are some habits you have built to not get drawn into dis/misinformation? Mentor 2023-03-28, 14:30: Nice work! Agree with pasting the image into Google. I actually never thought of this myself, so it's a neat trick. I feel the same way regarding when my emotions influence what I interact with online. Like you, my emotions play a lot stronger of a role in topics I am passionate about (for example, the Roe v Wade situation in the US as you mentioned, kids locked in cages at the US-Mexico border, etc.), but I also realized that a lot of articles and headlines want to play onto your emotions so you click their content. I became hyper-aware of this during Trump's presidency, since he made so many comments that went directly against people's morals, religions, ethnic backgrounds, etc. that I found myself getting more angry at articles related to him. However, I also learned that outrage gets views, so I've become more cognisant that if a title is anger-inducing, it's because the author wants you to click their article, and sometimes, these titles can be an overexaggeration (but not always the case). With topics I have less interest in, I don't usually engage in the topics anyways, and I have a bit of a nonchalant attitude towards it. It seems we are pretty similar! I get my news from readily-available outlets (like social media, especially TikTok since I'm on it a lot), but it's not always reliable. Like you mentioned, if things don't play as big of a role in my interests, I too don't do additional research on it. If it does come to my interest, I try to Google the topic and read news articles to get a better understanding of the situation. That way, I know that I'm reading the facts that news outlets have obtained, and I stray away from regular author's opinions/conspiracy theories. I think this also falls into the habits I have to not get drawn into dis/misinformation. However, I really only ever apply this to topics that interest me, so maybe I should branch out myself and do it for general eyebrow-raising topics that others talk about. Mentor 2023-03-28, 14:31: If you're interested, you can try the Extension Activity (Digital Detective) where you find an article or video that you have a strong emotional reaction to, and use what you’ve learned to critically evaluate whether it's factual or not. Otherwise, do you have any questions/concerns on this module that you'd like to discuss? If not, we can move onto the next module of your choosing. :) Mentee 2023-03-31, 11:31: I agree with titles being overexaggerated, I've also noticed that sometimes they're just straight up click bait and the article isn't even related to the title. I don't have anymore questions on this module, but I do have some off topic questions revolving around university courses I was hoping to discuss. I have to register in my courses on Tuesday and I am finding it SO overwhelming. I spent like almost two days trying to create a decent schedule but I'm worried I won't get the classes since a lot of people have said to prepare like a plan A and B, etc incase the class you want fills up so I guess, how hard did you find it to get your first pick of classes? I also talked to one of my teachers awhile back and he suggested taking the 50 minute classes over the 1 hour 20 min and 3 hour classes so I've mialy focused on making my plan around the 50 minute courses. What do did you find you liked best? I also feel like these are going to fill up since it seems easier to take 50 minute courses 3x a week. Also, my chem class requires a lecture, lab, and a seminar but I don't really know what a seminar is so I was curious if you might know? And lastly, I'm not sure if UBC does this but while looking at my course I noticed some things will overlap. Like U of A kind of has a 'package' so when you pick your class time it also has a specific lab time to go with it, you don't pick them seperately. So say a class goes for 9:00am-9:50am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, but it has a lab at 8:00am-10:50am on a Friday, how does that work? Do you just miss class lol? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just a little worried and U of A's science faulty does not respond fast. Mentor 2023-04-02, 16:13: First pick classes can sometimes be difficult because people often like to avoid the super early courses (8am) or the super late courses at 4pm. First year courses tend to have serveral class options though, so this is not always the case! With that being said, it's good to have multiple backup options in case your first choice schedule doesn't work out. People do drop their courses to move to other sections though, so it's always possible to switch to a different course's time if you don't get your first choice later on :) Keep an eye out, especially before school starts/the first week of school. I also remember it being overwhelming, but things tend to settle alright! I vouch for 50 minute classes as well! I found 1 hour 20 minute courses to be too long, and near the end I felt I was counting down the minutes for it to end rather than paying attention. If you can do 50 minute classes 3x a week, I would suggest aiming for those options first. Seminars are essentially a much smaller class where you discuss topics from the previous lecture (your bigger class)! They're actually quite nice because it provides students with closer attention and more help than in a large class setting. Sometimes you do assignments in the seminar, and sometimes you review previously learned content, but overall, it provides a smaller group size where you're able to be more interactive regarding the lecture content and ask more questions. I think we had something similar to packages called standardized timetables! In the package, is the course with the overlapping lab for the same subject? For example, do you have Chem123 lectures Mon, Wed, Fri and a Chem123 lab also scheduled on Friday overlapping with the lecture? If this is the case, I would (with near certainty) assume that the lecture/lab schedule will be further discussed in your course. It may be a case where one week you have lecture on the Friday and the next week you have a lab, or there's a special schedule to follow that you'll know more about when you begin the course. When I had my first year chemistry course, we picked our lab separately, but our schedule was one week lab, next week no lab. I would assume your packaged courses will do something similar. :) However, if it's completely different courses that overlap (ex. english101 lecture and chem123 lab), I would be wary. Do you know if there's any information on whether the course is only done on alternating weeks, and the lab is also every other week so you alternate between both classes each Friday? If U of A assigned it as overlapping in the package, I wouldn't assume they'd expect you to skip classes, but it may be best to email or call student services if it's unclear! I know they're hard to get in touch with though. :( Please don't apologize for the questions! First-time course selection is so stressful, so I'm happy to help as much as I can. :) Mentee 2023-04-03, 17:03: Okay thank you! I am mainly doing 50 minute courses but 1-2 of them has to been the 1hr 20 one. Seminars sound great! It's good to know it's baiscally extra help. Yes, the lab and same class are overlapping. I asked them about it and they basically just said don't pick those. Kind of silly to have them in my opinion lol. Otherwise I have almost everything figured out. The only problem I'm having is for my second semester when I validate my classes to make sure I can enroll, it's saying some of my courses are restricted and I'm thinking it's because it requires some pre-courses but I'm taking them in semester one. I messaged them last week but they haven't responded yet lol. Hopefully it works out because I have to register tomorrow at 5:30am lol (it sucks). Thank you for your help! Could you open Confronting Discrimination? Mentor 2023-04-06, 18:46: That's so odd that they would make timetables with overlapping courses. I'm glad you have it figured out! And yes, most likely they are restricted because of the pre-requisites! How did your registration go? Were you able to get into the courses with the timetable you hoped for? Sounds good - I will now open Confronting Discrimination!","Mentor 2023-06-11, 01:31: Welcome to the getting hired module! Here, you will learn to identify your transferrable skills and use them to tailor your resumé for a job you are interested in. Feel free to give the warm-up activity a try, then move onto Anchor Text 1 (Transferable Skills and Your First Resumé) and try out the discussion questions. Once complete, we can discuss them together. :) Mentee 2023-06-14, 19:21: Communication -My communication skill is not my greatest skill, but I am working on it. Throughout school I have always been quiet and not very outgoing, lately though I've been working on trying to make more friends and do more things. I have been a bit more sucessful and made more friends than I have last year, which is great! I've also improved on presentations as I used to be super nervous and have a hard time with them, but over the years i've gotten a lot better and it's kind of easy now, but I of course still feel nervous. Responsibility + Dependability -This I believe is my greatest skill. Since I've grown up as an only child I had to learn to be and do stuff alone. I've always been resposible wheter it's with school or chores, or doing something for someone I've always been trusted enough to do things by myself. Overtime this has made me mainly dependant on myself which I think is good. My job also requires a lot of responsibility as I have to do lots of tasks by myself, entertain the public, etc. Quick Learner -I feel like I learn pretty quickly. School is kind of fast paced and it's taught me to learn quicker, which is good because my job is fast paced and I had to learn things in a short amount of time. If I don't learn something right away I'm quick to get onto learning it and eventually get the hang of it within a day or two. Team work -I HATE working in a team. This is for sure my worst skill which is funny because my whole job revolves around teamwork. But I think it's different because there's consequences for those people, whereas in school they're always like learn to work together etc stuff. I hate having to work on group projects, I'll admit i'm a neat freak and I can not stand when people don't do thigs 100% right. Technology -Since I grew up with technology I feel fairly good at it. I know how to use word, excel, google docs, etc. And a ton of other things. I also know how to work various technology or figure out how to make it work quite fast. For the resume part, since I already have a job I already have a resume created. Would I be able to submit that one? Or can we just skip this part if that's allowed? My job is no longer posted but it includes lots of cleaning, public service, setting up and running city events, birthday parties, court sports, etc. It has a lot of variety and I learn/develop pretty much all the skills listed above. Mentor 2023-06-16, 09:13: Great job describing your strengths and weaknesses for your employable skills! I would like to add that for communication, you've done an excellent job throughout the mentorship program expressing yourself, providing details for prompts, and communicating with me on a variety of topics we've discussed together. Although it may not fall under traditional in-person communication, I do want to highlight that your written communication is very strong and an important skill required in the workforce. :) I agree teamwork is definitely one of the most difficult skills to use in the workforce, especially if other members slack off and you're forced to take the brunt of the work. I oftentimes think of school projects when I think of teamwork which is probably why the skill tickles a nerve for me haha. But like you said, at least with work, there are consequences for those who don't contribute, which makes it a lot more fair! We can definitely skip the resume part if you prefer! As long as you keep it updated (ex. you add a new skill or new job duties when applicable) it will be easier to use for applying to jobs when you move to Alberta. A little note, especially if you're applying for jobs that require specific skills, try to curate your resume to exemplify the skills required for the position. This often makes your resume and skills more desirable for the position compared to someone that may use a more generic or ""one-size fits all"" resume. This applies to cover letters as well. I am always here to help or give feedback if you need someone to look it over. :) Nice job with Anchor Text 1! Let's move onto Anchor Text 2. Watch the anchor video and we will discuss the discussion questions after. :) Mentee 2023-06-19, 14:46: Thank you! Also I will keep in mind to tailor my resume skills to the job more often, thanks! :) For anchor 2 I have to talk about a job interview: how it went, what I did well, and what could I have done better. I've only had two job interviews in my life, and they both went well! I'm going to share the interview I did for my current job since it was a lot harder than the other one. My job right now is working with the city, and it's actually considered a government job. It was my first ever interview so i was SO nervous and I was even surprised to get an interview. I think I did well on being and coming prepared. One of the job requirements was to have a specific first aid course, so to have an advantaged over others I paid and took that course prior to applying. I also came prepared with any other certificates I had aquired to show proof. In addition to those, I also typed up a few answers to questions I thought I might be asked in the interview so I wasn't caught off guard and this way I could form a pretty good reply. This wasn't actually as helpful as I thought though because they didn't ask me generic, first job questions like I thought. Instead it was more what would you do in this situation, etc and required quick answers and actually stressed me out a lot. I think I did pretty good on these anyways, but I feel as I should've done a bit more research on what the job I was applying on might ask. But oh well because I must've done well enough lol! What's a memorable job interview experience you want to share? Mentor 2023-06-23, 08:24: I write out possible job questions and answers too! I think it's only helped once, and it was for the generic ""why do you want to work here"" question LOL. I agree it's definitely hard to come prepared for an interview when you begin working in a new field, but I think you were very smart completing your first aid certification and having everything ready prior to your interview. It shows that you are well prepared! I actually waited to respond to this message because I had an interview yesterday! This was mostly memorable because although I didnt have experience in this specific type of research (cancer clinical trials), a lot of my previous experience especially the work I took on during my masters was highly applicable to the position so I was confident going into it. However they asked a question that caught me off guard too, and like you, it stressed me out a lot and made me rethink whether I actually did well in the interview (they asked me about 3 acronyms and I only knew one of them... ended up figuring out another one later on and I let them know the answer). It was a bit of a more light-hearted situation during the interview but I just remember feeling like I bombed it after that stupid acronym question, even though I felt quite confident throughout the rest of the interview. Luckily about 3 minutes after my interview ended, they did ask for references, so I'm hoping they had a positive view on my interview. Fingers crossed I get the position, but I'm sure theyre interviewing several candidates and if I don't get it, it'll be a good learning experience for the next job I apply for. :) (and it has taught me to google dumb acronyms common in the job I guess LOL) Mentor 2023-06-23, 08:28: Seems like we've completed this section, and unless you are open to completing the extension activity, we've gone through the whole program together! Wow!!! I'm going to open up the ""wrapping up"" module now as we bring this program to a close for you. I also opened the ""general discussion"" section in case there is anything you need to reach out for. You did an excellent job throughout the REMBC modules and I know you will be extremely successful going into post-secondary. :) It was truly a pleasure being able to work with you and go thorugh the motions of transitioning into post-secondary together.","Mentor 2023-05-19, 08:39: Welcome to the Agency in the World module! This conversation introduces the concepts of ‘grit’, the passion and perseverance you need to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals, and “agency”, what each of us can do, learn to do, and achieve with support from our community. Take some time to go over the reflection question before exploring Anchor text 1. You are free to share (or not share - that is ok too!) your thoughts on the reflection question. Next, once you complete the video and discussion questions for Anchor text 1 (Grit and Agency), we will discuss them together. :) Mentee 2023-05-23, 17:52: Anchor 1 I honestly can't think of many moments I felt like an outcast so I'll answer ""How do you know when to ask for help? What are some obstacles we can face when asking for help? How might we overcome these obstacles?' I know when I need to ask for help when I feel super overwhelmed and can't think or make decisions for myself. I tend to get frustrated due to being overwhelmed with emotions and I start to lash out. When this happens I (try to) recognize it and take a step back. Typically I ask my mom for help and she downsizes the problem for me as in ""you're trying your best and thats good enough"", etc kind of way. This helps me calm down and think more clearly. I know to ask for help when I am having lots of negative thoughts and it's starting to effect how I think. When asking for help there are a few obstacles, I believe most people are scared to ask due to how they think people might react or think of them afterwards. Sometimes people make other's feelings feel invalid and that can be hard on the person reaching out. Another obstacle may be some people don't have specfic resources that allow them to get help, like they may not be able to afford therapy, meds, etc. Some obstacles can be overcome by reaching out to a trusted person that you feel won't make your feelings feel invalid. This can be a great start or even reaching out to a council at school or online (if money is a problem). If comfortable, what are your experiences of asking for help? Mentor 2023-05-26, 08:57: You've covered the topic of when to ask for help very well! Like you mentioned, there are definitely obstacles that may pose barriers for those who may not have access to the same resources others do (ex. therapy, counselling, even having a trusted person). I cope with stress and needing to ask for help in similar ways to you. Oftentimes, it begins with a feeling of being severely overwhelmed and I get quite snappy with people (definitely not my strongest quality) and I usually know that I need extra support when I feel like I need to cry LOL. Like you, I try my best to recognize how I am acting and adjust my behaviour accordingly. It can definitely be hard in times of stress, but normally when I am able to tell I need to ask for help and I go forward with it, I tend to feel much better. When I need help, first I usually talk to my sister or best friend regarding my feelings/experiences. They're quite objective, but also very caring, so they tend to help me rationalize my feelings and we brainstorm the best ways to move forward. Sometimes, talking to them is all I really need because they are such a strong support system for me. In times where I am extremely overwhelmed, and this is usually to do with school, I go to my mom, who provides a lot of comfort and helps me calm down so I can decide the best way to find help for myself. Like your mom, she also likes to mention that I am doing the best I can and is good at helping me recognize that the problems I am facing are only for a miniscule period of my life, and when looking at the bigger picture, it may hold no bearing to my future in any way. Great work with Anchor Text 1! Give Anchor Text 2 a try and we can explore allyship together. :) Mentee 2023-05-29, 16:54: I noticed with a lot of these discussions we think the same haha! I think it's neat. Anchor 2 3 people who are my allies and how they might support me -My mother: she helps offer emotional support, encourages me to do things when I don't believe I can, and helps me make choices. She might be able to share her own experiences to help me learn not to make those mistakes (or what to do). -My physics teacher: helps encourage me to challenge myself, can help share his own university experience so I feel as I have more knowlegde of what I'm getting into. He might be able to provide a reference letter for scholarships etc. -One of my friends: helps me with emotions, etc. She is encouraging and thinks similar to me. She also volunteers at the hospital so she might be able to recommended me if I wanted to volunteer. Do you have any tips for identifying a good ally? Whether it's professional, emotional, or personal. Mentor 2023-06-02, 08:55: Haha right?! Everytime I write out an answer you pretty much described in the previous message, I'm always thinking oh man I hope they don't think I'm completely unoriginal LOL. It sounds like those who you consider allies provide great emotional support for you and are individuals who strive for your growth. It's wonderful to hear that you have people in your life that can offer you support when you are in need of it. For me, I often think of a good ally as someone who is trustworthy first and foremost. Being able to trust someone with the issues you face and knowing that the guidance they provide you is from a place of good intention is foundational when deciding if someone is your ally. Furthermore, I also believe a good ally is someone who is non-judgemental and will provide objective support without letting their own biases affect how they help you. Lastly, I often think of allies as those who have more experience in life compared to me (in any aspect - school, work, relationships, anything!). Because these people have more experience in various aspects of life, I am able to ask them for guidance knowing they've been through similar situations as me. Getting advice from those who have similar experiences make me feel more comfortable and at ease when applying their advice into real life. :) Nice job with this module! If you'd like, please feel free to attempt the extension activity where you learn from someone who has overcome significant obstacles in their life. Otherwise, let me know which module you would like to do next! :) Mentee 2023-06-08, 17:42: Hello! Sorry I have been so busy with grad and finals coming up. Would you please open getting hired? Mentor 2023-06-11, 01:28: No worries! This is a very busy time of year for everyone. I will open up the module ""getting hired"" :)","Mentor 2023-04-06, 18:52: Welcome to the Confronting Discrimination module! This module offers an opportunity to talk about the reality of inequality and experiences of discrimination in our current society and how these experiences can shape and influence the goals we have for our own success and the improvement of our communities. Look over the warm-up reflection activity and share your thoughts if comfortable. Otherwise, complete the reading for Anchor Text 1: Using Shared Language and we can go over the discussion questions together! :) Mentee 2023-04-09, 15:11: Hi! I was able to get most of my course times I had planned for. Only one had to change but it had a lab and a seminar attached which kind of made my schedule suck. Oh well, a spot might open so we'll see but overall it went pretty well! Warm up activity: At this moment I can't actually think of a time I've been discriminated against, nor have I used discriminating lanuage. The only thing I can think of is I've kind of treated differently in class by males since I'm a female, moreso in my science classes this happens and they look down on me. But I'm not exactly sure if that counts lol. If it does count I just kind of felt hurt that they assume I don't know much due to my gender. Anchor 1: The website they provided must be blocked or deleted because it won't let me access it so I just googled each word they mentioned. The definitons in my own words: -Implicit bias is when someone is not consciously aware they have a negative attitude towards a specific social group. -Individual racism is when someone directs unfair/harmful behaviours, beliefs, and/or actions towards another person or other people due to their race. -Institutional racism is when an organization has specific policies or behaviours that discriminate against people of colour. (This one I had a hard time finding so please correct or add to it if I'm wrong). -Microaggression is when someone indirectly, unintentionally, or even subtlety discriminates against memebrs of a marginalized group with certain actions or statements. -Privilege is when a certain person or group has a special right or advantage. Questions for you: What efforts have you seen in the real world to minimize discrimination? Mentor 2023-04-14, 10:07: Yay! That's great to hear about your classes! And yes keep an eye out, especially closer to when classes start. By that time, people like to move courses around so there's always a chance you can enroll into the section you were hoping to get. Discrimination based on sex/gender definitely counts. It's horrible to hear that you've experienced that, and I agree that your abilities being doubted because you are a woman is really hurtful. However, you were accepted into the neuroscience program at your university, which is a huge deal and shows that you are just as capable as they are. :) Aw man, I'll reach out to the program regarding the link, but great job with the definitions. Your definitions look accurate to me, and although institutionalized racism was a more difficult definition, you explained it correctly. Nicely done! As for your question, I think the real world has done a much better job at minimizing discrimination compared to history we've read about. The most simple thing I can think of are anti-discriminatory laws that prevent employers/landlords/etc. from discriminating against age, race, sex, gender, or religious beliefs. I definitely think there is additional action that can be implemented to improve or ""fool proof"" some of these policies, but I do believe we are making progress in the right direction. If you have no other questions for Anchor Text 1, I'll get you to watch the video for Anchor Text 2, then we can go over the discussion questions together. :) Mentee 2023-04-18, 17:35: Yes! Thank you for reminding me I'm capable, that made me feel good! I agree they have done a better job and I'm glad they're working towards the right direction. Anchor 2: In what ways have Dr. Nadine Caron's experiences with discrimination shaped her as a doctor? In my opinion, I think it's made her a more understanding doctor, but also person. Not everyone experiences or understands discrimination and I think due to her personal experiences and hertiage, she has a greater understanding of how it feels compared to others. Therefore her knowledge has led her into being a supportive and understanding doctor towards everyone, but especially Aboriginal people. What I think of Dr. Caron's response to the fellow surgeon, was I surprised by what her other colleagues did? What would I have done if I was her, what if I was one of the colleagues? I think she handled it quite well, she calmed herself down and didn't lash out (even though he deserved a slick comment), and then removed herself from the situation. I don't think she could have handled this any better. I actually was a little surprised by how the other colleagues reacted. Typically people (from what I've seen) don't do anything when situations like this occur, so them leaving him and moving to the other table with Dr. Caron was actually quite heart-warming for me. I also think this spoke louder than what anything could've said, people don't really like being discluded from the others, so by them discluding them caused him to actually think about what he said (he definetly thought about it for 4 years). If I was in her position, I honestly might've made a comment, but I like how she handled it and this will help me think about what to do if situations like this were to occur to me. If I was a colleague, I would've moved to her table as well, his comment was unacceptable and I would want to make sure she was okay. What are your thoughts on these questions? Mentor 2023-04-22, 15:45: I agree with your perspective! I do think that lived experiences shape us, and the compassion she shares in her practice is partly due to what her lived experiences, her heritage, and her culture. I also believe that it makes her a much more compassionate doctor, especially to Aboriginal people who may have been through similar experiences she has been through. Dr. Caron was extremely professional with her response to the surgeon, and I felt that her leaving was symbolizing that she won't tolerate disrespect, and especially in a field where doctors work close to one another, it was definitely a power move in my eyes. I also really appreciated how the other doctors began to leave the surgeon's table - the feeling of invalidation when being intolerant towards others brings shame and forces people to reflect on their actions. Staying with the surgeon would also show a lack of allyship with Dr. Caron's experience, and I think for all the colleagues that left the table really highlighted the inappropriateness of the comment. With that being said, I too was surprised at the actions of the other colleagues! It was very refreshing to see that someone, no matter how much influence they may have, won't get away with disrespecting others. I also think that if I was in her position, I would be a lot more snarky, but I really commend Dr. Caron's response because it exemplified class, was straight to the point, and it really forced the surgeon to think about their comments. Furthermore, this may not be everyone's views, but I actually preferred that she did not try to educate the surgeon on why their comment was off-side. It shouldn't be the job of minorities to try and make people empathetic and understanding of other minorities. The surgeon is extremely educated themself and I'm certain has been taught about inequalities in medicine and society, and it shouldn't be the job of Dr. Caron to expel energy into educating an already-educated individual. I think this forced the surgeon to internally reflect on their biases a lot more. If I was in the room with Dr. Caron, I think I would also leave immediately. I'm a bit more expressive with my face, so I probably would give a look of shock, proceeded by disgust before leaving LOL. I'm trying to work on being less expressive in that sense for other situations hahaha. Mentor 2023-04-22, 15:52: I really enjoyed our discourse with Anchor 2! I think we dove into the situation and assessed it well, and I believe that our empathy towards Dr. Caron's experience was highlighted in our responses! Great job. :) If interested, you are free to tackle the extension activities ""Defining Moments"" and ""Response Strategies"" to explore this module some more. There is also some additional information if you are interested. :) However, if you're ready to move onto another module, let me know which one you'd like to explore next and I will open that up! Mentee 2023-04-25, 15:51: Yes! I also enjoyed this section. You summed up exactly what I was trying to say hahah. I'm glad we have similar opinions and perspectives.

Have you researched what credentials you would need? Is there a way to obtain these in British Columbia? Do you have other careers that you are also considering? I believe that its always important to lay out a plan for you number one choice, but also consider if there are different careers that you would also find fulfilling. You mentioned that you liked Math and Chemistry. How can you use your interest to find a career in which you will be happy? I remember that when I first wanted to be in medicine I had no clue on what to do. I was lucky that I had people around me that were already doctors and people that were 1-2 years ahead of me. Do you know anyone that is an astronaut or in the field you like? Anchor text one has some really good points. What are your thoughts? Mentee 2023-01-16, 10:13: Hey, i couldnt log in for a while.

The system has changed a bit since last year so I am relearning where everything is located. I am doing well! Been busy the past few days. Not sure if you have access to my profile, but I am a 4th year medical student at UBC and thing are getting a bit hectic with applications opening up. Right now I am working with an eye specialist so I get to see a lot of cool conditions (eg. google keratoconus or cornal ulcer). I will be in the OR on Oct 31, so I will get to see my first cornea transplant! I see that you are interested in exploring various careers (astronaut, engineering science, chemistry, physics). Good for you! I find physics and math to be challenging and it takes a special person to study/work in these areas. If you could be anything you wanted, what would you choose and why? I am excited to chat with you and see if I am able to help with your transition to an urban city. Do you have any specific topics you would like to discuss? Also, are there manatory sections we need to complete for your class? Mentee 2022-11-01, 10:37: that cornea transplant sounds gross haha, i probably coudnt become a surgeon or anything like that since i dont like to deal with those kind of things, but anyway. I would rather be an astraunaut or like a space voyager or something cause i think the earth isnt that interesesting and id wanna see new things and explore. It probably wont happen since we dont have the technology to go around space whenever we want. I alsogrew up in a urban city and just moved to the gulf islands last year. There arent any mandtory topics we need to talk about so you can chose whicheveer one you think would be a good place to start. What happened to wanting to be a musician? Mentor 2022-11-05, 09:39: Hye Maxime, sorry for the delayed response! I am currently finishing my rotation and have to pack to head to Nanaimo for 2 weeks. I will try and respond within 1-2 days from now on. Hahaha I completely understand that surgery is not for everyone. It's awesome to hear that you want to explore space. There is a chance that space exploration may be possible with people like Elon pushing for it. How does someone work towards being an astronaut? Is there a path that you can take towards that goal? Although I like music and think it would be awesome to be a producer, I just wasn't very good. I occasionally try and remix songs, but its more of a hobby at this point. It’s cool that you grew up in an urban city and then moved to the gulf islands. What kind of lifestyle do you like more? Do you think you would want to move back into an urban city or would you prefer to remain rural? It is awesome that we have freedom to explore whatever we like. I will open up post-secondary and career planning since you seem to know what you want to do! Mentor 2022-11-21, 11:30: Hey Maxime, How's it going?

I’ll begin with what I felt while watching the video.

I feel that these two ideas encapsulate the meaning of the chaos which is inherent in the creative process. For me, finding inspiration is the combination of planning, and working towards a “want”, coupled with the uncertainty and conflict of the path toward that goal.

I knew in high school that I wanted to go into some form of healthcare, but it wasn't until halfway through university that I found my passion for becoming a physician. Something I would have enjoyed having access to is a career fair in high school, as that is a great way to learn about different careers from those in the field.

I’ve gone ahead and opened this module on studying. How did you like the video? I found the video to be very informative and easy to follow. I agree with all of the strategies outlined in the video. In particular, I am a huge fan of spaced repetition and active recall or practice testing.

The most useful strategy for me is concrete examples . • Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? i feel like spaced practise i would ot like because after a day i would forgot everything i learned Why would this be the case? • Are there any strategies you would add to this list? normal studying? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective?it just woorks for me • How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? umm me not wanting to study Mentor 2023-03-07, 15:25: Hey Hayden! I'm glad to hear from you! I also enjoy using examples for learning, especially if I can find a concise “walk-through” video online. If you have issues adopting spaced practice, just let me know! I have tons of experience with the method, and I can share some resources for implementation if you are interested! I was wondering what it is you usually do to study. Do you re-read notes, watch videos, go over the textbook, etc? I look forward to hearing your responses! Talk soon!

It was great speaking with you at the event last week! I'm glad you have some strategies which you already enjoy.

And, it's only January (things are starting to pick up now). I have open this new conversation on Finding Inspiration! Procrastination is always around the corner (I know I struggle with it too), so let's focus on the positive things that we have created in the past or right now. I'm curious, what inspire you to want to be with nature and interact with the natural world?",,"Mentor 2022-12-07, 09:00: Hi Caity-Rose! I am back with my usual check-in schedule (check-in on Thursdays). To start off our new conversation, I watched the video on the different strategies. I think the first one works for me since I prefer to study with another person. Similar to co-working sessions, with my study group or partner, we would work on a set of questions together and then go over any questions we aren't sure about. Often, we will also quiz one another. Another thing we do is also trying to explain a concept to another person. It helps with recalling the material and seeing what stuff I might need clarification on. From the video, are there any strategies you are currently using or want to use? Mentor 2022-12-08, 13:06: Hi Caity-Rose, Winter break is starting soon! Woohoo~ I know there may be a lot more things to get done right now, but if you have time to work on e-mentoring, I will continue to check in on Thursdays. This week we begin strategic studying. Are there any studying tips that have work for you in the past or as of now? Mentor 2022-12-15, 11:53: Hi Caity-Rose! Second-to-last-day of school!! I'm excited the holidays are almost here. During the break, do you want to stick to the same check-in schedule? I can check in on Thursdays, and you can send me a message on Tuesdays or anytime! Let me know what works for you. :) Talk soon! Mentor 2023-01-07, 15:44: Hi Caity-Rose! Happy new year! Honestly, I can't believe we're in 2023 right now (still feels like 2022). ?? As we start the new year, let us revisit a bit of strategic studying. The module included a video on 6 studying habits for approaching those learning materials (and assignments). If you want for next week, feel free to share something (a response to any discussion questions). It can be on a studying method/habit that works for you, or what you want to try. Check out some of my responses from a couple of weeks ago. ?? I will check back on Thursdays! -Rachel ??","Mentor 2022-11-01, 11:07: From what I have read from the two articles, there are a lot of great scholarships or bursaries out there. But I find that those opportunities are not so easy to tackle. Have you ever found yourself staring at your applications and just thinking...what the heck am I going to write? And before that, you have to search for those dollars that you may/may not be eligible for. From one of the articles, I clicked on Student aid BC (https://studentaidbc.ca/explore/grants-scholarships). I chose a random scholarship and scrolled to see the eligibility. I went from one page: B.C. Scholarship Society Programs (this is still on StudentAid BC) to BC Scholarship Society's website to How To Apply (for transfer scholarships). That's....kind of a lot of work, right? Now, multiply doing this twice, five times, and a billion times. I think, what's holding me back to apply to these many scholarships is burnout. You mention a bit about a gap year, after checking out a couple of scholarships, do you have any thoughts on what might be holding you back from attending post-secondary right away? It can be related to wanting to travel, want to pursue something else, finances, etc. I'll respond on Thursday. :) Mentor 2022-11-03, 13:52: Hi Caity-Rose, I found some scholarships/bursaries that may be of interest: District Authority Awards This is a great award to apply for. There are different areas of interest (language, applied design, volunteering) ranging from academics to extracurricular activities. You can apply to more than one...I think (just have to double-check this before applying!) Usually, scholarships/bursaries deadlines are in the Wintertime (or before graduation). Some might be opened for those who are graduating from high school, and others might be available for youth who are starting post-secondary after a gap year. TCF Bursary No restrictions for the field of study. Open for students in their last year of high school. Check back for any updates. Mentor 2022-11-03, 13:53: Links District Authority Awards TCF Bursary Mentee 2022-11-08, 10:24: I had a look at the links and it is interesting to see how many options are out there. I found several others that I would be eligible for such as the Pathway to Teacher Education Scholarship. One of the question prompts that I'm curious about is why having a post-secondary education is worth the money for you? To answer your question, I want to take a gap year before starting post-secondary because I feel like 13 years in school will have been a long time and I want to do other things like work/volunteer in different places. I think this might help me understand better what I want to do and (kinda cliche) but have more well-rounded perspective on the world. ~ Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-11-08, 12:17: I think it's not cliche at all. Having some lived experience I think can actually connect with the material more when you have returned to post-secondary. As for the question, to me attending post-secondary allows me to take on tasks (assignments) that focuses on hard skills. A lot of my coursework is less theory and more focused on practicality. Often, things I have learned and created can now go into my portfolio for work/job hunting. So, in a way, it is worth the money to continue school for me. But on the other hand, it is difficult to manage finances A lot of times, I might have to forego certain fun activites simply because I need to keep some money aside for school. To sum it up, budgeting is hard. And it's something I recently started. *sigh* Mentor 2022-11-08, 12:18: For our second activity, check out the worksheet. If you have any questions, feel free to send them here. I will check back on Thursday. See you then! Mentor 2022-11-10, 11:42: Hi Caity-Rose, On Tuesday, I mentioned the worksheet for activity #2, I thought it might help to find some sources for the expenses. For utilities, I found a website called Moving Waldo that sort of sums up the costs for 2022. It might be useful. :) See you next week. Mentee 2022-11-15, 12:01: Hi Rachel, I have a few questions regarding budgetting. What was one of the most challenging things to budget for? Are you working? If so, how do you balance that with school work? Do you live at home or away and was that a difficult decision? I've started working on the worksheet but will continue that next week. Talk soon, Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-11-15, 12:11: Hi Caity-Rose, Great questions! For me, budgeting how to pay myself first instead of spending it on expenses is tough. It's important to allocate some income (put towards savings, sinking fund, etc.) is a lot to figure out! I am currently working right now as well, so I depend on my calendar a lot!! For the last few months, I have been using a time-blocking template to roughly pinpoint what are my to-dos for the next three days. This way, I can keep track of any upcoming due dates for assignments as well as other tasks I need to complete for work. I live at home, so the downside is the commuting and distance from my workplace. ?? I will check back in on Thursday. ?? Mentor 2022-11-17, 14:16: Hi Caity-Rose! If you're still working on your worksheet, I found some calculators that might help. CIBC has a resource page of different calculators (for budgeting, student loans, savings, etc.). Check it out! Intuit Mint also have one for groceries but their estimates/numbers is based on US dollars. Although, I think it's pretty cool. :) See you next week! Mentor 2022-11-22, 09:54: Hi Caity-Rose, For this week and next week on Thursdays (Nov 24 &amp; Dec 1), I will not be checking messages. It's almost the end of the term for me, so I will be finishing up my assignments. ?? Feel free to upload your worksheet anytime this week or the next. I will check it whenever I receive a notification. After Dec 1, I will be back with our normal check-in schedule. Stay warm and dry this soggy week!?","Mentor 2022-10-24, 14:03: Hi Caity-Rose! I'm Rachel - your mentor on e-Mentoring. It's so cool to see that you want to pursue teaching and other career paths! I know some modules here will be more geared towards attending post-secondary after high school but I think we can deviate a bit from the topics. Branch out a bit more and we can discuss stuff related to gap years (while sticking to the conversations...aka modules). Let me know what you think about this. Also, I'm thinking about using a check-in schedule as a guideline for us. I can check for any new replies from you on Thursdays. Does that work for you? Mentee 2022-10-25, 10:27: Hi Rachel! Nice to meet you :) I like listening to music too. I listen to all types, but mostly celtic, folk and mainstream pop. I like to study to jazz too. I looked up bossa nova and it sounds really interesting! Sometimes when I'm not in class I'll check it out. Have you lived in Vancouver your whole life? I look forward to our chats.

I will mostly be active on here on Tuesday because my school is in session Monday-Wednesday and I have Career Ed on Tuesdays. So that works fine if you check on Thurdays. Do we need to be online at the same time at any point? ~ Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-10-25, 11:18: Hi Caity-Rose, No worries! We don't have to be online at the same time. I will be sure to check e-Mentoring on Thursdays and if you have time to check Tuesdays, then I think we are off to a great start. And, Yes, I live in Metro Vancouver my whole life. Mentor 2022-10-27, 13:02: Hi Caity-Rose, First check-in for this week! In our last chat, you mention your interest in Bossa Nova as well, and I thought of a song by Nouvelle Vague called In a Manner of Speaking. I think the song is fitting for the rainy weather we are having all week. ? As well which conversation would like to start working on? I will have that unlocked for you asap. :) Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:40: Hi Rachel, I listened to Manner of Speaking and I can definitely see what you mean when you say it fits the weather we've been having. I'd like to start off with the ""General Discussion"" conversation please :) Talk soon, Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-10-31, 14:29: Hi Caity-Rose, Thanks for checking out the song! General Discussion -- is actually not part of the modules. Think of it as a chatbox on the side if you want to ask any questions unrelated to the actual module topics. Can you choose another one on the wheel? Sorry about that! Mentee 2022-11-01, 10:35: Oops my bad. Am I looking at the right thing? There's a grey circle with titles like ""finding inspiration"" etc. If so, I'd like to start with Funding your Future. Let me know if that is one of them. Thanks. Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-11-01, 10:50: Hi Caity-Rose, Yes, Funding your Future is one of them. All the titles you see in the circle are the modules (besides General Discussion). I will have that unlocked, right now. :) And, I will close this conversation. Mentor 2022-11-01, 16:02: Just to clarify--I won't be closing any conversations (there isn't an option anyways, so please feel free to revisit any other modules..once we have finish the first one!) Mentee 2022-11-22, 11:31: Hi Rachel, I'm finished the worksheet but I'm not sure how to upload it. Do you know? Good luck with your end of term time! Caity-Rose Mentee 2022-11-22, 11:32:  Mentor 2022-11-22, 12:01: Hi Caity-Rose, Wow! This is great. I like how you've decided to save 20% of your income. I think we are at the end of this conversation. Don't forget to save the worksheet to your portfolio. I will close this conversation and let me know in the chat which one you want to work on next. Mentor 2022-11-22, 12:01: And thank you for the good luck message! ?? Mentee 2022-11-29, 14:46: Could we do Strategic Studying please? ~ Caity-Rose Mentor 2022-11-29, 16:27: Sure! Mentor 2023-01-09, 21:20: Hello Caity-Rose! So e-Mentoring is trying something new where mentees and mentors can meet virtually (face to face). I have signed up for Thursday (also our check in days!), this week (Jan 12 I believe). I will be available from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm pacific time. Feel free to join! If not, that's okay. ?? Check out a bit of strategic studying if you can this week. Additionally, you can also try the extension activity, but it is not required. Talk soon! Mentor 2023-01-12, 11:49: Hi Caity-Rose! Unfortunately, Thursday's virtual event has been cancelled. But, e-Mentoring still has a Meet your Mentor virtual event on Monday, Jan 16th from 8:30 pm - 9:30 pm Pacific Time (if you're interested). I won't be attending Monday's event but it'd be a cool thing to do and see who else is part of the program! It's still the first few weeks back to school after the break so if you need to prioritize other classes, I understand. ?? (I'm in the same boat). Feel free to drop me a message (even 1 sentence is fine), if we need to readjust how we communicate with one another. Till next time! Rachel Mentee 2023-01-23, 09:04: Hi Rachel, So sorry for the radio silence from me, I've had some big changes recently. One of which being that I'm leaving the school I'm at right now. As I will have many new courses to focus on at my new school, I won't be able to continue with this eMentoring. Thanks so much for being my mentor, this has been fun :) Best of luck woth your studies! ~ Caity-Rose P.S. Does my teacher need to unenroll me from this or anything? Mentor 2023-01-23, 09:08: Hi Caity-Rose! No worries, thank you for letting me know. ?? Hmm, I'm not sure if you're teacher needs to unenroll you but it's best to let them know! I can let the eMentoring staff know on my end as well. All the best to new courses and a new school!! ?? Mentor 2023-01-23, 09:08: Oops typo; I meant your teacher * not ""you're"" Mentee 2023-01-23, 12:21: Hi Caity-Rose and Rachel, Now that Caity-Rose is moving to a new school we would like to let you know that we will leave your accounts active so you can stay connected together on the platform if you want. Good luck Caity-Rose with you new School! Pravaneh, eMentoring Team",,,,,

Did you enjoy the video? I found it informative and easy to follow. I agree with all of the strategies outlined in the video. Personally, I am a huge fan of spaced repetition and active recall or practice testing. One of the best ways I have found to implement both of these strategies is to use flashcards, which allow you to periodically repeat older information, while also testing your ability to recall information. Another great strategy is to pretend you have to teach this topic to a friend or classmate, the act of teaching others is a great way to determine what you don't know as well as consolidate what you do know! What are your study strategies? Do you use any which were not outlined in the video? As always, feel free to ask me any questions you may have! Talk to you soon! Mentor 2022-11-29, 08:25: Hey Matteo! Just wanted to check in and see how you are doing. Have you checked out the videos in this module? Let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help! I look forward to hearing from you soon!

I’m glad to hear from you! I had an excellent break, I got to spend lots of time with family and the gym was empty most days! I find it super helpful to have either an app on my phone or a notebook with me at all times to write down different pieces of information I see throughout the day. Would you enjoy writing things down more often on an app or in a physical book? If you have any more questions about strategic studying please let me know!

I’ve been an athlete my whole life, so I’ve spent my fair share of time in the gym! I also see you like to build things, what creation are you most proud of? I once spent a summer making a pool for my grandparents, and I was really proud of how it turned out.

It was great speaking with you last night! Great work on your resume! I have some comments attached below, please let me know if anything is unclear or if you have any additional comments! Also, in the future, please make sure to remove any personally identifying information (full names etc.) I enjoy how you listed out your skills, it really helps focus the reviewer on what it is you feel are your strengths. The “activities” section could do with a bit of reformatting (bullet points, etc.) to enhance flow and readability. It is great that you highlighted your experiences first, as that allows the reviewer to see that you have the ability to hold employment, as well as show a diversity of experiences. The only note for the experience section is to flesh out the descriptions of duties and job titles. This makes it simple for the reviewer to get a solid grasp of your past experiences, even if they are not familiar with your previous role (title, company, etc.) Great use of highlighting and large print to highlight your name, making it stand out will certainly help reviewers remember you when they are going through hundreds of resumes. These are some of my initial thoughts, and please feel free to ask for clarification if anything is unclear! With these edits in mind, let me know what you would change in your next draft and we can keep working toward a final resume! I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentor 2023-03-29, 15:58: Hey Matteo! How are the edits on your resume going? Is there anything I can clarify for you? Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear in my comments. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentor 2023-04-19, 16:50: Hi Matteo! How are you doing? Have you had a chance to go through the edits on your resume which I sent? Please let me know if you have any questions! I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentor 2023-05-06, 15:36: Hey Matteo! How have you been? Do you have any questions about the resume edits I sent earlier? I wanted to let you know that there is a Meet Your Mentor Event on June 1st!

1047549490,10/21/2021 15:41,1047585216,56184,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-01-31, 10:54: Hi Elvy, Those are really good questions! We can start by going through the first anchor text and then going through the discussion questions - I think they will be helpful in thinking about what considerations might weigh in to finding a suitable career path. Finding a suitable career path can mean a lot of different things to different people and I think its really positive that you value being stimulated at work and doing something you actually enjoy. I personally think its valuable to just study what interests you and hopefully that overlaps with what you're good at. Typically, I think what people enjoy, they tend to excel at or at least be motivated enough to put in the work to do well. It is also still very early so there's time to consider what might interest you and what you might to study when you start your undergraduate studies. Mentee 2023-03-06, 15:25: Hi Estelle! I just realized how this all works so i'll start off by answering the modual questions (Anchor question one.) So we did technically go over most of the questions but I'll write them out more formally. What do I value in life? I value having time alone but spending time with the people I love! I also enjoy making money and having financial freedom. Shopping is literally a hobby of mine! I do like doing work that I enjoy, epecially if I feel like Its complicaed but i'm capable of achiving it! I do love living in towns outside of citys aswell! I do value the importance of where I'll live because I believe it will affet my whole life. For the question,""How do you want to contribute to the community and the world?"" I think I just want to make the most difference in the world I possibly can! I'm not aiming for Greta Thunberg level difference but I want to improve the quality of peoples lives or the welbeing of enviroments! Being able to teach people things is always a quality I want to obtain awell. For the last question I pre wrote this so I'll just add it in here. -I’ve had many career interests including being a marine biologist, realtor, business owner, physiotherapist,art teacher, nutritionist and dental assistant. I think all of these jobs are within my capability. I’m interested in making a good salary while also enjoying my job. I don’t know much about any of these jobs so I’m not entirely sure where to start Do you have any ideas for jobs that could incorporate my values and career interests? Did any of your interests/values inspire you to pursue your career youre pursuing towds!? Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:07: Hi Estelle! I went through the second part of the discussion questions and took all the tests! Out of all the jobs that matched the test results, Physiotherapist was the one I'm most interested in. The following are the answers to the questions that were asked. -Do I have a strong personal interest in this type of job? I sort of do! I haven’t learned much about physiotherapy but I do know that I’m interested in helping people and health. I think part of the reason I want to be a physiotherapist is for the salary but It seems like a fulfilling job and I don’t think it’s dull work either. Physiotherapists seem to have many patients so I dont think I'd get bored. -Will this career allow me to achieve the work life balance I want? The average hours a physiotherapist works in a week is 30-45 hours. That seems like a decent amount of work in my opinion. That's enough work to make a decent pay if I'm getting paid hourly. Anything past 50 hours is too much in my opinion so I think that's a decent amount. Also because the pay is well, that gives me an advantage of financial freedom which is very, very important to me. -Will this job offer me financial security? I personally think it will. Physiotherapists have high salaries especially after years of working in the profession. -How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? Physiotherapy is in high demand at the moment and always will be. There are so many groups of people in need of physiotherapy including athletes, older age groups, people with desk jobs, pretty much any kind of person. -Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? I think living right outside of a big city or in a big city is the best place to live to pursue this career. In cities, there's a higher population which means more patients. There are also more job opportunities at different clinics in cities opposed to small towns. I think it would higher chances of success. Mentee 2023-03-07, 11:10: Anchor 2 Discussion questions- -How did you choose your career? -Did you ever consider a different career but change your mind? If so, how come? -What are some things you wish you knew in highschool aout choosing some career choices!? Sorry for burst of emails by the way! Mentor 2023-03-09, 11:43: Hi Elvy, its nice to hear from you! I can relate to you, I love having alone time and shopping is also a hobby of mine! I think your answers to the questions are very reflective and a great starting point for thinking about potential career paths. I think its quite difficult to say outright what careers might align with your interests and values at least until you think about what you might want to pursue in university (if that is something you intend to do!) Personally, I wanted to live in a new city, make lots of friends and study subjects I was interested in (for me that was history and political science). I also always knew I wanted to go to law school and there are no required pre-requisites so that gave me space to study what I wanted in undergrad which was nice. Your career interests are varied and all super interesting and its nice to have various options you’re considering. It seems like you’re quite science oriented so physiotherapist sounds right up your alley!","Mentee 2023-04-04, 11:32: Hi Etelle! I managed to get into the Strategic studying questions! Some of the discussion questions I chose were which study strategy seems most useful to me and if there are any effective strategys I would add to the list. Out of the 6 study strategys, the spaced practice works best for me. I've used this tequnique before, and I was much more calm and collected when it came time to take the tests. Throughut the week of the test,it felt productive and alot less of a weight on my shoulders! For the second question, I was wondeing if you had any effective study trategies that work well for you that you would recomend! Mentor 2023-04-05, 15:44: Hi Elvy, it's great to hear from you. Spaced practice is really helpful and its great that you know what works for you! For me personally, the one thing that is most important to my studying is the atmosphere. I like to study in a place where I am comfortable (not too cold, not too loud), where there is good lighting (I like natural sunlight ideally), where there is a clean bathroom nearby and where I have access to snacks and drinks. Studying in an environment where I feel comfortable physically and mentally significantly impacts my attention and patience and general willingness to sit down and have a productive study session. Sometimes I like to play ambient coffee shop music in the background too. In terms of specifically studying for a test, I like to take my class lecture notes and then make condensed versions of them that only highlight the important parts and then I just continuously edit and annotate them. The repeated looking over your own notes, class materials and synthesizing them into a new, organized document really helps me retain the knowledge and it also helps me pinpoint what areas I might need more clarification in. Also, from an aesthetic standpoint, I like to make nice charts and play around with color schemes to organize my notes which not only looks nice but helps me sort the information in my head too. Hope some of this is helpful and I'm happy to discuss any other questions you might have on the topic!","Mentor 2022-11-11, 09:05: The first anchor text is helpful in providing information on some of the ways the province can help fund your education! Mentor 2022-11-22, 19:24: No problem! And thank you for coming to me with this, but I feel unqualified to help you with this issue. A capstone project wasn't part of my high school program so I'm not familiar with it. Would you like me to help you find someone that can help with this?","Mentee 2022-10-25, 11:08: Hi Estelle! I'm Elvy and I'm super excited for you to mentor me. I'm 15 years old, I love baking, weightlifting, and art. I have a part time job as a cashier and I enjoy working and staying busy. I saw that you enjoy working out, baking and spending time with your friends so it seems we already have something in common:) How do you manage your time as a student practissing law while also maintaining a social life? (Or just having hobbies outside of school?) Mentor 2022-10-26, 14:06: Hi Elvy, I'm glad you're excited, its nice to be able to be a resource for students. Your hobbies sound super interesting! What kind of things do you like to bake? I love baking cinnamon rolls this time of year! And yes it seems like we have quite a bit in common so thats nice. Honestly I've always been the type of person to do a lot outside of school whether that be sports, volunteering or other extra curicular commitments so I'm used to balancing a lot while trying to have a socia life. I think its important to set boundaries for yourself and remember that socializing and maintaining your other interests and hobbies outside of school are just as important in order for you to succeed. Mentee 2022-11-01, 10:47: Thats great advice! I'm bad at self disiplin and normally put my social life before my school work.. When you say you set bounderies for yourself what does that consist of? Like making some sort of schedule for yourself maybe? I love baking cinnamon buns too, they're such cozy things to bake. Me personally, I like to bake cookies and breads! I find baking really theraputic! Mentee 2022-11-01, 11:12: Hi Estelle, I'm having difficulty finding the modules to complete on the website. Can you please advise where I can find the modules and which to work on? Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks always for your assistance and guidance. Best Wishes, Elvy Mentee 2022-11-01, 11:21: Oops, disregard that last email, I've found the module. I think the ""Funding Your Future"" topic is a good place to start! Mentor 2022-11-01, 14:01: Yeah I would say setting boundaries usually consists of me having a schedule for my week ahead and making sure I have enough time dedicated to studying, my extra curricular commitments and my social life/personal time and then being strict with sticking to the times I've set out for myself to make sure I'm not neglecting any part of my life. Mentee 2022-11-08, 10:25: Thats great advice, I think starting a schedule is a good place to start! i have a question about financing for after/during highschool. Is there any advice or things I should know when it comes to financing for my future? For example, mistakes I could avoid, where to start, etc? Mentor 2022-11-11, 09:03: I woud say its difficult to pass down advice regarding finances because everyone's situation is very different but the biggest thing is to be realistic about what expenses are necessary and what your short term and long term goals are with respect to your finances. I know that most post secondary schools also have a dedicated office/point of communication for students who want to discuss planning out their finances (some of the uni websites also have financial planning tools on them). So those are a good place to start! Mentee 2022-11-22, 10:07: Thank you for that advice! I'm starting a capstone project and have no clue what I should make it about or even really what to do? Where should I start? Mentee 2023-01-16, 10:01: Hi Estelle, I'm sorry for taking so long to respond, I've been having trouble with signing into my ementoring account. I appreciate you letting me know about the capstone project! I think it would be benifiacial if I had a mentor who was familiar with a capstone project! If you're able to find me someone that would be great, if not I totally understand! Mentor 2023-01-24, 13:30: Hi Elvy, no worries - its great to hear from you again. I have spoken with the people running the e-mentor program and they have informed me that your teacher will likely speak to you about the capstone project but that for now it is not a big concern as you are not in senior year yet. Once you are in senior year we can get someone to answer your questions, but in the mean time your teacher will be available! Mentor 2023-01-24, 13:31: In the mean time, would you like to continue with the odule regarding financing your education, or would you like to move on to a new module? Mentee 2023-01-31, 10:17: Hi Estelle! Thank you for getting back to me! I think it would be great to move onto a different module, specifically career exploration. I have an idea of some jobs I would like to expore mostly because of the icome but I want to keep my options open. I was originally hoping to open my own cafe, however because of todays economy I have no idea where I'd get the money to start a buisness. I have been thinking going into realty would be a good job as it pays well, and I think i'd enjoy it. My goal apart from having a steady income, is staying stimulated with my job. I don't wnat to be spending 40-60 hours each week doing something I hate. I am interested in lots of different career paths such as enviromental science, buisness, the trades or something in holistic lifestyles. My question for you is how do I learn what my passsion is and how big of a role shoud income play a part in choosing my career. Mentee 2023-04-03, 14:25: Hi Estelle! I'm back from my march break so thats why I havent been messaging! I would like to work on the next module and I think strategic studying is a great place to start! Mentee 2023-05-30, 10:37: Hi Estelle, I loved all your advice on strategic studying. I also appreciate a nice clear space to study its super calming! That sort of leads me to wonder more about the well being and self care module. This year has taught me lots about managing time so I can do efficiant work and reduce stress. I was wondering what some of your tips on how you balance your well being and personal life, wih your academic and possible work life are! I think I have like a general idea of how I could do so bt its always helpful to hear fom others what they triend and accompished for theselves. Or if youre still working towards well being and self care troughout your day to dy as a student! Mentor 2023-06-08, 20:31: Hi Elvy, I'm glad you found some of it helpful! Regarding balancing school/work with self care/wellbeing, it's a great question and I think I'm still learning for myself. But I would say it's important to always reserve time for yourself, and that can take shape in many different forms. It could be time you set aside to engage in your hobbies, meet with friends or just not do ""productive"" things directly related to school work. School and work are important but in order to perform to the best of our abilities, I think we need to be content and feel like we have/make time for ourselves. Mentee 2023-06-14, 15:56: Thank you for all your advice this year! I've made note of all of it all and implemented lots of it into my life regarding school and down time! This will be my final message as the year as school is almost over! Thanks again, good luck with your studies:) I'm excited to use your insight in my grade 11 and 12 years aswell! -Elvy",,,,,

If you want to continue over break thats fine with me, I would be happy to continue. If you want to enjoy the summer sun and your time off no worries! If you want the time off, if you could fill out the wrapping up survey that would be great! Otherwise I hope you enjoy your remaining time. Thanks! Austin","Mentor 2023-01-07, 00:17: Hi Ferris, I have opened up this section. We can start with the first set of discussion questions. Have a watch through the youtube videos and we can discuss different activities we enjoy and the warnings signs when we are feeling the need for self care. Also if you scroll down on that page feel free to ask any of the questions listed. Or, if you have another question in mind shoot me the question and I will try my best to asnwer! Mentee 2023-01-16, 10:07: Hi Austin! How are you doing? A quick thing about the movie before i ask question I guess its a romance little sad you dont got to see it welp okay. So I was thinking the ""What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult"" would be a good one well I guess the other ones sound cool but I like the look of this one if that's okay with you. I am truly sorry for whatever excuse for english this is okay well as always I hope your well. Mentor 2023-01-16, 10:33: Hey Ferris, I always appreciate you sending a message! They are always interesting :). I will see if I can stream the movie whenever I can. So to answer you question about some challenges about mental health in post secondary... I think the first thing is that in post secondary, there is no one there to constantly check in on you to make sure you are doing okay. It is up to you to say to yourself that you need help and its up to you that you are able to self regulate. There are always resources through school that are available like mental health benefits which you get as a student under the schools insurance plan. You can use that to seee counselleors, psychologist and a whole bunch of other health care proffesionals for mental health. So that aspect is different compared to highschool where teachers may show more consideration and care in your mental health. Another aspect that is a challenge in college may have to do with connecting with your peers. Unlike in highschool where you have rotations with the same people for prolonged periods of time, in postsecondary thats not really the case. You may see the person for one class only for a semesters which lasts only 3-4 months and never see them again. Because post secondary is much much bigger than highschool there are much more people to meet. However, it may be more difficult to make meaningful connections with people that you rarely see. One way to negate that is to get involved within the campus through clubs and extracurriculars. These things can help you meet people on a consistent basis which is huge when forming friendships. Lastly, a lot of students become lost in college and end up doing a lot of soul searching. Post secondary is where you learn the thing that you will be doing for the rest of your life in most cases. For a lot of people, this can be a huge stressor and can lead to them becoming burnt out. One way to help youself is to start early! Look into things you enjoy and pursue your passions instead of what you think other people might want you to do. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with pursuing something and eventually changing interest later on. Life comes at you when you least expect it so go with the flow. One huge mental health benefit is that you are able to control your life and be more independant. For me that was something that was amazing. Nobody is there to force you to do anything. It may be a huge responsibility but if you can handle it well then it becomes somerthing amazing. If you are a independant person and are responsible then you have tons to look forward to. Lastly, when you specialize in a certain topic, you become surrounding by people who have the exact same interests as you so that can be a bonus when talking to strangers you meet at campus. You know what they say, a lot of peopel end up making friends for life in post secondary! Anyways I hope that helps a little, I had a question for you, how do you overcome challenges currently and do you feel like that it works and if not, what do you think might help you more?",,,"Mentor 2023-05-30, 15:48: Hi Ferris, I have opened up post secondary and career planning as you have requested. I know that you were still unsure as to what to do moving forward so this section will help with exploring different ideas! I think it would be a good idea if we started with the warm u prediction section. If you feel comfortable, I was wondering if you would be okay with sharing? I can start with my side. I always wanted to be in healthcare and I loved the idea of having a degree that could be used towards a career right away. So, I initially applied to be an respiratory therapist but did not get in :(. So, my sisters who are both nurses suggested I try nursing and I have been doing that ever since. Thinking about my prediction of what I was going to do in the future, I think that its pretty much along the lines of what I imagined my life to be. Im hoping to pursue further education but that is something I will consider later on when the time is right!",,"Mentor 2023-04-03, 17:26: Hi Ferris, Im glad that you had a good break! So I opened the new prompt of career exploration as I thought it would be interesting and useful. So the first that you need to do is read the anchor text 1 and watch both videos and then answer the discussion questions. Hope that helps! If there is another topic that interests you we can do that instead no problem. Let me know and I hope to hear back from you soon!","Mentor 2022-11-01, 17:12: If you want to watch the video and look through this page that would be great! (PS the checklist helps keep track of what needs to be done). Okay, I will start us off! Personally, what I found works best for me is the spaced repetition method. This method is in fact discussed in the video! I think that it helps keep the information new and fresh and helps you build on top of knowledge that you know or may go on to know. Research has shown that memory decays very quickly, so it’s important to continuously review learned material. The challenge with this method are two things. One its necessary for you to review the material early on. So that means you cannot procrastinate and study the night before an exam. Secondly, the challenge with this method is it requires a lot of commitment because it so hard to find time to study after going home from working or being at school all day. You just want to relax. I think that you need to find a good balance between your goals, work, and fun. I think it takes some time to find that balance and what works for you. But when you do find the right balance for you it makes everything sooo much easier. What have you done for studying methods? You can ask me any questions you want, or you can even ask me the questions the program suggests! I look forward to hearing back from you. Austin Mentee 2022-11-08, 11:30: Hi Austin! How goes it hope you doing well. Couple of things quickly so the stategic studing works. You asked what study methods I use well I try for fourty five minutes a day but with staying at a cabin three nights a week with out internet I find it hard to find study material for some of my classes. at this time I think 45 minutes works for me. I have a question should I be responding in the strategic studying or in the one we've been writing in. one more thing how are your classes different from high school classes and how does that change how you study? What was the most difficult part of moving from high school to post-secondary classes? I was going to ask the other one but you already answered that one sorry taking a minute getting used to it I'll do my best. Ferris Mentor 2022-11-26, 13:38: 45 minutes is great especially when you don’t have Wi-Fi three nights a week! I think that if you find it sufficient in achieving the goals you set then that is perfectly fine. In terms of resources, I think that building good relationships with teachers of topics you enjoy is a good start. They should be able to point you to some things that you might be able to access outside of school. Also, the librarian may be another resource that you might be able to use. Yes, please continue to respond in the strategic studying section until we conclude this section. Post-secondary is a very big adjustment which is why it’s important to have good studying habits before reaching college/university. One of the major differences is the teachers. They will not hold your hand and wait for you to understand something. A lot of the instructors in big universities are there to research rather than teach which is evident by their teaching method of dumping tons of information at once via a PowerPoint. You are accountable for whether you attend class and how you learn. Nobody will demand that you attend class so it’s easy to slip into the habit of skipping classes. But I would warn you not to as you miss important things like deadlines and hints. There is also a lot more information that you are required to learn in a shorter time frame. The semesters are 3-4 months long so it’s like finishing biology or math’s 10 in 3/4 months and doing that twice a year as you have 2 semesters per year and summers would be optional. So, you must be very disciplined in terms of time management as you have much more freedom to do whatever you like. But there is a lot more information and nobody there to wait until you understand. The most difficult thing is time. There is a lot less time and much more material to go over. Second, the marking scheme is much more difficult so don’t be discouraged if you don’t achieve the same grades as you do in high school. For example, a lot of UBC science students are highschoolers who achieved 90+ averages when applying but once you are in university their averages being around 70%. The exams are much more comprehensive and difficult so having a good study method/behavior is key in achieving academic excellence in university. One big tip is, if possible, avoid 8:30 classes as you will end up missing a lot of them. For some weird reason, getting up at 8:30 for classes in high school and 8:30 for university is very very different. I hope that answered all your questions! Please keep asking me any questions that arise. I have one question, in the 45 minutes, how do you study? What is the method you use? What are your goals?",,"Mentor 2022-10-24, 12:18: Hi Ferris ? How are you? My name is Austin and I will be your mentor during the year. I am 24 years old and I studied Nursing in university. I saw in your profile that you like being active and sports? I do as well! I gym pretty much everyday and I have played high level soccer. In my free time I also like to be outdoors doing things like camping and hiking. I wish you could tell me a little more about yourself. What are your hobbies? And anything else you would like to tell me. If you have questions, send them to me and I will try to answer them! Also please have a read through the links above as it may help explain any questions you may have about how to use this platform! One last thing, if there is a specific topic you would like to start with in the wheel above let me know as we can start with that once we are done with introductions! Hope to hear from you soon, Austin Mentee 2022-11-01, 10:51: Hey! Austin just wanted to say sorry for not reponding sooner it wont happen again. I'm doing alright just a little busy. Did you do anything for holloween? As you know I'm Ferris and about me I like most sports other then Tenis which I'm rather bad at but I mostly play Vollyball I also like swimming and playing the piano. I think strategic studying would be cool to start with is there a way I could see more about what each one covers that'd be nice. Hope to hear from you soon though it'd be fair to take a minute with how long I mae you wait once again sorry for that. Ferris Mentee 2022-11-01, 10:58: after rereading what I said I noticed that diden't say alot about myself so yeah I'm 15 and have two siblings and I also like camping. I read the links you meant the whats the point ones right? Mentor 2022-11-01, 17:01: Hi Ferris, haha no worries! Theres no rush to reply, everyone gets busy with life. I honestly didn't do much for halloween. I hope you enjoyed halloween. I worked and came home to watch a movie and relax. Im working as a nurse in Whitehorse Yukon currently. I also like most sports but I also am bad at tennis and have two sibilngs as well so I guess we have things in common haha. And yes, the links I mentioned are the ""whats the point ones"" so great thank you! We can definately start with strategic studying! Also unfortunately I can't even see what the chapter or what each one covers until I unlock them :/. If you find the studying section boring just let me know and we can move onto something else. You should be able to access the studying section now, I will start that section off for us! Mentor 2022-11-09, 15:23: 45 minutes is great especially when you don’t have Wi-Fi three nights a week!

It may be a huge responsibility but if you can handle it well then it becomes somerthing amazing. If you are a independant person and are responsible then you have tons to look forward to. Lastly, when you specialize in a certain topic, you become surrounding by people who have the exact same interests as you so that can be a bonus when talking to strangers you meet at campus. You know what they say, a lot of peopel end up making friends for life in post secondary! Anyways I hope that helps a little, I had a question for you, how do you overcome challenges currently and do you feel like that it works and if not, what do you think might help you more? Mentor 2023-01-16, 12:04: Also, unfortunately I wont be able to attend the meeting tonight. But, there should be other mentors that can talk about their experiences and give you tips and also answer your questions if you have any :) Sorry! Hopefully you can read my comments below. Mentor 2023-01-16, 12:06: Also I think if we continue that disucssion not in tis section but the wellbeing and self care section that would be great! I have also left my response under there :) Mentor 2023-02-25, 16:31: Hi Ferris I will try to attend the meet your mentor on March 7th. I hope to see you there! Sorry I wasnt able to attend last time! Mentee 2023-03-06, 15:14: Ok so I JUST DELETED everything AAAAAHHH Ok Ok Sorry about that I know I havent gotten back to you for a long time! but aaagh I was so close anyways I hope you're well I just had some trouble answering your question about how I overcome challenges I still dont know but I'd be worse to make you wait longer I feel good though so I guess I'm doing a decent job dealing with the challanges around me. To me the mental health benefits in a post secondary seem good although I understand that there is less support from teachers and students. My teacher wanted me to answer the Discussion questions and I guess I should. Warning signs? I dont know! I guess I get irritable when I dont feel like being around people and I do procrastinate but that's its own thing. things I like I like chess, music, being active and reading. and then well I guess you know the questions anyways sorry about whatever grammer errors there are bound to be OH are you on the call tomorrow? well I guess I should've been done a minute ago I hope you're doing well Mentor 2023-03-07, 07:59: hahaha hey Ferris no worries. Its really good that you are self aware and know what your signs are. Its important to check in with yourself daily and ask yourself where youre at because it can get really busy! And, having those happies will definately help keep you grounded and life more enjoyable in times of stress :) Theres never a rush to answer my questions so please feel free to take the time you need. AND YES! Ill be attedning the meeting tonight so hopefully ill see you there? I hope youre doing well and lets continue this conversation hopefully tonight! Mentor 2023-03-07, 07:59:  Mentee 2023-04-03, 15:29: Hey Austin Been a while how are you. I just got back to school from spring break which is pretty sad but we got a long weekend coming up so there's something to look forward too. So yeah I guess I should get to the topic its just I dont really know what I meant to say so if you could gt back to me with what I should be doing that'd be great. hope you're doing well! Mentee 2023-05-24, 15:47: hey Austin! it's been way to long! I hope your doing well I'll be more regluar from here its just we kinda lost our teacher so its been loose for a bit not to say thats the reason anyways I'm still am hoping to learn more from you before the year ends. Well hope to hear from you Mentor 2023-05-25, 00:42: Hi Ferris, hope youve been doing well. Please let me know which section you would like me to open so that we can have a discussion. Hope to hear back from you soon! Mentee 2023-05-30, 10:28: Hey Austin I was hoping you could open the Post-Secondary and career planning",,,,,

A little bit about me, I am a physics major at UBC and my passions include creative writing, going to gym (although as of late school has been getting in the way) and watching movies. In the future, I want to pursue a career in medicine and I am preparing myself to head in that direction. I volunteer at the hospital, have particpated in a project with professors, and I am a club member at UBC. Over the years, I have seen a lot and done a lot, and I have been put in lots of unique, awkward, and even dangerous situations and that has taught me a lot so be assured that I can provide you adequate advice. If you have any more questions, about me or my hobbies feel free to contact me anytime through this chat and I will do my best to respond within 72 hours of your message.

I'm Dane and im working on completing my BA of Crim at Douglas College. 8 more classes and I will be finished :). Ive been at Douglas for 5 years; I started off doing an Associate of Science but changed my mind and switched into crim. I really love it and have been working on the Bachelors. After that I'd like to go into crime analysis. I'm looking forward to getting to know you Mentee 2022-11-17, 11:37: Hi Dane, good to meet you too. I'm thinking of going into RCMP and to maybe server the Reserve. But I'm more interested in becoming a Detective but that is in a higher level right? so I'll start out with being a Police Officer and work my way up from there. I'm Interested in learning Criminology and Physchology, and im looking into CNC, Douglas and UNBC but I don't know which one is best for me, But I'm going more towards UNBC because it's in my home town and is near my family. Looking forward to your help and advices. Thank you for your message Dane! Mentor 2022-11-17, 15:22: You are quite right. There are several specializations within the RCMP but first you must complete 5 years of field work before you can join a specialty. These shifts are 10 hours long and 'tumble' 2 hours earlier each day, with a 4-on 4-off schedule IIRC. I looked into this as I am interested in forensics. They told me I would'nt even need to complete the forensics program at BCIT, they prefer to do all the training themselves. If going to Regina to 'depot' for the RCMP training and 5 short years of field work does not bother you, you are on the right track. Just curious why are you considering Douglas, as it would be quite far and there is no student housing. But, the criminology department is very large. I think CNC has a criminology diploma but I dont think UNBC has any criminology department. Anyways, I would be happy to help you down the line if that is what you are interested in. If you have looked at all the different modules, do you have a preference which one we go through first? Mentee 2022-12-01, 11:41: That seems intersting and long hours to me, and what is field work? And I know that there is RCMP training in Regina, Saskatchewan but I forgot then I remembered. And no it does not bother me because my mom has family members there. My Parents said that I don't need to go to College or University for Police Officer unless its for like a career or something that you actually need to study on. And I'm just confused and I would like to see if you can explain all that to me if you don't mind. And what different modules on what? On Police Officer? Mentor 2022-12-01, 12:51: 'Field work' is simply being 'out in the field' aka out in public. Usually this is street patrols and responses to calls. Whenever you see an RCMP officer out in public they are doing field work. But, this is just a small part of the RCMP. They also have all kinds of different office departments: counter-terrorrism, intelligence, money laundering, mail fraud... etc. You dont 'need' a post-secondary education to apply to the RCMP. see for yourself: https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/qualifications-and-requirements However, they consider the life experience of the candidate. Someone who has recently graduated high school, and has not attended college or university or been travelling has not been exposed to different cultures and ways of life as much as someone who has. They would therefore prefer to hire the candidate that has more life experience. So, while you are not required to have a degree, you should have a solid background in terms of life experience. But, this is just for the RCMP, different municipal services will have different requirements and maybe some departments do require a diploma or associate degree. At the top of this page there is the navigation wheel (to refresh your memory: the navigation wheel is the green circle at the top of each page). Your teacher is requring the following modules: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning You are free to pick any of these, then I will unlock them for us. I would suggest starting with a light one, maybe different ways of knowing or strategic studying. Mentee 2022-12-09, 10:18: Oh that's what Field work is. Thanks! Ok, so I don't really need to go to College or University. But for being a Detective I need like Physchology and Crimonolgy courses don't I? For the Modules, I'll pick the Different Ways of Knowing. Mentor 2022-12-12, 15:28: The best advice I can give is to consult the entry requirements for the relevant force(s) you are considering, and keep in mind they are looking for plenty of life experience. Even a one year diploma or associate degree would be a big asset Ive unlocked the different ways of knowing module. There is a short video to watch and some questions to start.

Hope you are doing well. Judging by your profile, it seems like they did a pretty good job matching us:) So cool that you are a paramedic! That's definitley something that has always interested me, but I never got around to doing it. How long have you been a paramedic for? I see that you're interested in nursing/medicine - such a rewarding area to go in to! All of my roommates in undergrad were nursing students, and now I'm in my first year of medical school at UBC. I'm an open book with all of this stuff so don't hesitate to ask any questions:) I went into University without knowing knowing what a ""major"" was, or what I wanted to study, so there are no dumb questions! I've been informed that you are doign this for class. I hope that it doesn't feel like homework for you! Nice to meet you, Lindsay Mentee 2022-11-01, 14:21: Hi Lindsay! Im not actually a paramedic! Im thinking about possibly going into paramedicine or nursing. A possibility I have is to become a paramedic and while Im working as a paramedic I can study to be a nurse. im currently just trying to figure out which I want to do! It was great to hear from you! Taylor M Mentor 2022-11-01, 21:22: Great to hear from you Taylor! So sorry, I totally read that wrong in your bio. Still, it's very cool that you are interested in healthcare:) Are there any specific conversations that interest you that you would like me to unlock? I understand that you are doing this as a class, so your teacher might have a set order for you to follow. Also, I see that you like baking. If you have a staple chocolate chip cookie recipe I would definitley be intersted to try it. Or any other favourite recipes.. Mentor 2022-11-21, 12:09: Hi Taylor, Hope you have been doing well!

For us students, there is a difference between studying on the land and living on the land. Where I think when we just study, we don't truly appreciate and give back to the land we live on. I think on the land I live on, I have heard indigenous stories about its history and culture. And that has really made me appreciate how far back the use of the land goes. Today we just live on the land and use it to study, without really thinking about all of this stuff. After knowing the stories of the land we live on, we can change the way we treat it. We can give more respect and care to the land, and learn how to be more sustainable in our daily lives. Even if that involves things that may seem small to us, like recycling, planting trees, and not wasting food. It can all make a big difference at the end of the day. Summer, what is your connection to the land you live on? And how do you think it is the same or different from what we saw in the video? How does it compare to my understanding of the land I live on too? Looking forward to hearing your take on this topic, and let me know if you have questions :) Mentor 2022-11-08, 22:01: Hi Summer!

As you've probably read from my profile, my name is Agam and I'll be your mentor for this course. I'm super excited to get to know you and work through the interesting topics throughout the course. I've lived in an urban city for most of my life (Vancouver) and attend UBC for biology, so I'm excited to share my experiences with you and learn about your goals as well. I can definitely help with transitions to a big city, as I moved out of a smaller town into Vancouver when I started attending UBC as a first-year student. It's great to hear that you've made up your mind about what you would like to do in the future! I read on your profile that you also enjoy reading. What are some of your favorite books? I also enjoy hiking and camping! My family and I go camping almost every summer. What are some of the hikes you've done with the best views? I'll try to see if I can figure out how to attach an image of a view from near our campsite last year.

I was born and raised in Quesnel bc and I like to go hiking and camping with my friends and family during the summertime. At the age of 15 I was diagnosed with Pcos later in that year I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. I struggle with dizzy spells almost every day. Also how I also struggled big time with depression and anxiety growing up and still struggle with it today. A fact about me that I'm 25% blind in my left eye. My favourite movie is the twilight series I just like watching it because of how cringy it is. Favourite shows must be Riverdale and the chilling adventures of Sabrina. I like to spend my time helping people, working with them and I'm hopefully going to school in the future to become a pastor of some type. Mentor 2022-10-30, 13:00: Hi Summer, It's good to hear from you! I'm sorry to hear that you were diagnosed with PCOS. I really hope it becomes easier to deal with eventually. I was also diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at the age of 10, so It's definitely a tough journey. I also have seen Twilight, and I agree it was cringe!

Since some of the topics here and in future conversations can be quite personal, do note that the conversations between us (mentor &amp; mentee) are meant to be confidential. I'm very happy to listen (and maybe help if appropriate) to anything you want to share. I'm comfortable discussing anything really, and I'd like to think I'm very open-minded about stuff. It's also definitely possible you would like to reach out to other supports about some of the issues that we might discuss, and in addition to the resources in this module, I can help you look for those other sources too! That being said, there are a few things that I'm supposed to communicate to the ReMBC staff (not confidential) and it's generally when safety is at stake. So this includes: ""Child abuse and neglect; Abusive relationships (emotional, physical, sexual violence/harassment); Substance abuse; Illegal activity; Suicidal behaviour; Untreated mental illness"". That isn't to say you should keep that to yourself, but more just so you know ahead of time and feel comfortable sharing :) If you would like to clarify the bounds of this, then let me know, and I can also clarify with the other staff. Also the things listed here are a little fuzzy, but for the most part I intend to use my best judgement on what things should be communicated and what things should really just be kept private. Past all that, enjoy the article &amp; first video, and send your thoughts on the video / first discussion question(s) when you have a chance!

Congratulations :)) Do share updates on how the capstone is going, and if there's anything capstone related I can help with. Also, yea that's no worries, I'm pretty sure a lot of students may feel similarly. I'll try to keep the discussions concise so that we move through them fairly easily. I've opened up the first conversation and you should be able to click on it now. Take a look at the warm-up question (it's optional and you don't have to share any responses, but you can if you want to). Afterwards, watch through the video and take a peek at the discussion questions. Let me know once you're at that point and we can get started on them. Personally while I agree with a lot of the things they mention here, I find that I also don't always follow the tips (ex. cramming for exams etc.) Also I found that the right strategy depends on what kind of course you're taking. After I switched to computer science, I found that I had to change up how I was studying (less reading / memorizing, and more playing with things to see what I can do / screw up). We can get into more of that when doing the discussion questions. Have a good one :) Mentee 2022-12-05, 13:27: Hi Rafi, For my answer to one of these discussion questions, I don't think I'd use these strategies over what already works for me or other people similar to me. Something that would get in the way is probably motivation. For one question to ask you: how are post-secondary classes different than high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? Thanks, Sophia Mentor 2022-12-08, 04:21: Yea, finding motivation to study something can be rough, and I haven't really found a good way around that either. One thing I've found is that this is one of the reasons why some people find it harder to do well in certain ""easy"" or ""GPA booster"" courses. If the material is just that boring, and you don't really care about the content, it's that much harder to stay motivated. So if you're picking between 'easy' courses to balance out your course load, I'd recommend considering what you're more interested in rather than past average grades and the such. For how post-secondary classes are different, I think it comes down to being independent. There are a lot of different types of courses and other factors vary a lot, so you might find that the class size, difficulty, or content might be similar / different from high school classes. However, the thing that is almost always different is that no one really checks up on you. So you really do need to be checking your grades and going to office hours when needed. The teaching teams are usually very supportive and happy to accommodate what you need, but the difference is that you need to go and ask them rather than having them approach you. In terms of studying habits, in high school I could usually get away with not really studying until it got close to the quizzes/tests/exams. That's probably the biggest difference, where if you don't try and keep up a little bit, then it can be hard to catch up afterwards. That's probably what surprised me the most with my computer science courses because I initially did fall behind. Because some of these computer science courses go pretty fast, even missing just one or two days can make it so that the next lectures make no sense at all. It wasn't too hard to keep up usually (depending on the class), but you just had to schedule in some of that time between each lecture to check back in with the material. Also, if you are taking any courses where memorization is important, I highly recommend 'Anki'. It was like night and day when I finally started using it properly. You basically just make flashcards, but the algorithm is excellent for making sure you know the material. It schedules each card depending on how well you know the material and how likely it is that you would have forgotten it after a certain amount of time, so you only see the stuff that you need to study more. If you explore online, you might find that this is also what a lot of med school students use to study because it really does work. It's also free and open source, which I liked. If you wanted to look into it at any point, then I can send some more details about what extensions I recommend and how I usually use it. :) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Definitely feel free to ask more stuff from the discussion questions! If you want to move on to the next activity though: The extension activities in this conversation / module are optional for you, since your teacher didn't ask for them. You could still take a peek at the Pomodoro technique bit on your own time, since it does work for some people! I think you've completed the survey already, so we should just about be ready to wrap up this conversation once you are done with it. Feel free to ask anything else, otherwise let me know which section you want to go through next :) Mentor 2022-12-11, 05:17: Yea that's great to hear. One thing that has changed a little since I went through the first year courses is that a lot of places now record lectures. It does provide some safeguard around missing a lecture or two, but yea I agree you still would need to keep up if the course load is heavy. Yes it's also true that first year courses are a little stricter. I think as long as you can fulfill the requirements a certain way, I wouldn't worry too much about what is recommended. Especially if it's unrelated to your future career path. So taking the chemistry instead of physics sounds fine. Similarly, if it is possible to take a lighter course load and do your degree with an extra year, I'd recommend trying that as well. By the time I graduated and especially now, most of my friends had also extended their education past the usual 4 years for a variety of reasons (gap years, co-ops, etc.) That's definitely something I'd do differently if I got to go back and try things again. I actually went through something similar to the chem 12 thing, but for a math course. It does kind of feel bad when plans change regardless, and yea my parents weren't that happy either. In my case, they eventually understood why it was the right call, but it does still feel bad while it's happening. If you wanted, you could still take the course at one of the free online schools (eBus, VLN, etc.) so you could do it at your own pace. Although, you could also just enjoy your time/break and not worry about trying to get ahead. If you have to take certain science courses anyway, might as well do it at that point. Yea, having your own space sounds amazing! Really excited for when you get to enjoy that ??. I agree that it does help with motivation when you have more control over what's happening around you. Once I could set up my little 'workstation' a little bit, I found that I did enjoy working on stuff more. It also let me set up this extra monitor that I got second hand, which made such a big difference with schoolwork. You don't need one right away or anything, but if you do get one eventually, see if you can get one that can be used vertically (see IPS vs. TN monitors). I goofed that at first. Your tablet should definitely come in handy for future courses. Being able to doodle the diagrams and models in CS courses for how a program works (or just diagrams for the chem / other science courses) is so nice. A lot of people in lectures use both, and I do think it helps. I'll get that next conversation open :)",,"Mentor 2022-11-01, 04:49: Hi Sophia, I'm Rafi and I will be your mentor over the next few months. So far I've read through your profile, and I'm looking forward to working with the material with you and dealing with other things as needed along the way! I was a little unsure about what information about me was passed along, so I didn't want to bore you too much by repeating the same stuff. Can you see some of my background information when you click on my name? I'd also be happy to share more as needed. I already have some thoughts about the things you mentioned in your profile, for stuff like holding on to your interest in music as you build your career, or about getting on to different career paths. I am actually also in a computer science program right now, so I can totally share more about that whole side. I'm thinking as we explore the different sections and get to know more about your interests and strengths, I could share more specific advice? ?? While I don't think any of us mentors can guarantee we will have the right advice for you, I promise to do my best to send you honest and helpful advice for whatever you need help with (course material related or not!) To start off with, send me a message back to confirm that the system is working, and please do include any other thoughts you might have. If you have any worries or concerns (even if it's concerns about how helpful this program may be, or that it's missing something you were hoping to cover), then definitely feel free to share that as well. Also, don't worry about having to write long formal responses or anything! - Rafi :) Mentee 2022-11-01, 08:35: Hi Rafi, Nice to meet you as well. Since I sent that, I have chosen to make a website as my Capstone, and plan to apply to unbc for computer science (still believe that's my only option). Also, you can see the background information when you click. I would say more but I don't really have anything else. Have a good day, Sophia Mentor 2022-11-02, 04:20: Hi Sophia, That sounds great, thank you! A website should be a fun capstone project, and it should also introduce you to skills that will be helpful for computer science later on. UNBC would definitely be a great option, and I've heard nice things about the program there. The nice thing about computer science is also that any CS degree will open doors for you, and regardless of where you go, you will be learning from a lot of freely available material online. That being said, and while we will probably cover this in more depth when doing the assignments, what were the reasons you felt that UNBC was your only/main option? As for the program, I think I'm waiting to hear back about which things we can get started on. In the meantime, please take a quick read through the instructions on this page, and on each of the links under "" How the program works"". That should give you a good idea of what to expect over the next few months. Then we can most likely get started on the other pages this weekend? Mentee 2022-11-02, 14:27: Hi Rafi, I want to go to UNBC because I like the campus and it's close to home. I definitely don't feel trapped into going there, that's just what I want to do right now. Are you saying a CS degree is or isn't useful? Sophia Mentor 2022-11-03, 01:35: Ah ok yes that's good to hear! The campus is really nice, and I hear it looks amazing in the winter. A CS degree is definitely useful, and some jobs will specifically look for the degree. My understanding is that there is high demand for senior level workers, but it's a lot more competitive for junior and entry level roles. Within those lower level roles, the hiring teams will have a preference for those who did a post secondary degree, and more specifically for those who did a CS degree (or related degrees such as statistics, math, etc.). So while people definitely still can find success without it, the degree will help a lot with getting that initial CS job experience. Let me know if I should clarify or expand more on any of that :) Also, once you are done reading through the instructions, let me know which 'conversation' you would like to start with. I think your teacher doesn't have a preference on the order and would like students to pick: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity – Adulting 101: students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap: students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them. No rush if you still need time to read through the introduction stuff. Mentee 2022-11-04, 12:58: Hi Rafi, I'm glad that it's not a waste of time to get a CS degree, since doing the degree is not much CS. I am not excited to take math and physics courses that were way too hard for me in highschool, when they aren't relevant to what I want to do. They are required courses for my degree, though. As for now, I still can't apply to UNBC since the application Grade 12 marks is still broken, and the advisor stopped replying. As for the conversations, I haven't been told anything about them and they aren't available to click after you read the little rules/etc. I'm not sure if we are just supposed to pick them based on nothing, or why we are supposed to even do them. Thanks, Sophia Mentor 2022-11-06, 06:30: Yea, that's definitely fair! I was also dreading the university level math courses, and I'm relieved I don't have to do anymore now lol There are definitely a few courses that you just need to get through to fulfill the degree requirements. Whether or not they really help with upper year courses is debatable, but I found that they offered a little bit of confidence that I DO understand enough of the content to do the higher level science courses. What I did find though is that a lot of the first year university courses are similar to the high school level in terms of difficulty, they just cover more of the content. I think they structure it like that because they're not sure what kind of background each student might have, so they try to get everyone to the same baseline, if that makes sense. I'm not going to lie, those course definitely ARE annoying to go through, and I can share more tips on dealing with those requirements if you'd like (making your course load lighter so you have more time, taking the course online at a different school, etc.) - - - - - I'm not as familiar with the UNBC application system. Do you have others in your class that are applying there? Could be worth checking if others are also having the same issue. I can also get my supervisors to look into things when you need it, so just let me know :) - - - - - As for the conversations, I think I can unlock them one at a time. Your teacher might give you more details, but my understanding is that each one is like a module of the program with a number of related tasks for you to complete. The ones listed here are required by your teacher, although I think we can do other ones as well. So once you pick one, I can unlock it to get started. I did find these descriptions that might help you pick: Different Ways of Knowing: This conversation explores the importance of respecting different ways of knowing and the risk of getting stuck in only one way of understanding the world we live in. Anchor texts describe the ways in which a current B.C. research project is guided by connections between Indigenous traditional knowledge and settler scientific knowledge, and explore Indigenous innovations in technological advances and Indigenous values in business practices. Strategic Studying: This conversation explores some of the most recent scientific recommendations for effective study habits. It offers the mentee an opportunity to compare their current study strategies with their mentor’s and challenges them to try some new techniques. Well-Being and Self-Care: This conversation presents an important opportunity to talk about the responsibility we each have to take care of ourselves – physically, mentally, and emotionally. With the support of their mentor, mentees will learn some strategies for self-care and create their own self-care action plan. Post-secondary and Career Planning: Conversation asks mentees to view relevant Career Profiles on Work BC’s website to help them discover the level of education they would need in order to pursue a given career. Then, in the second Anchor Text, they will research schools that offer the programs they need. If your mentee needs help finding ideas for possible careers, suggest doing the ""Career Exploration"" Conversation before jumping into this one. Extension Activity – Adulting 101 (part of the "" Well-being and self-care"" module): Students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap (part of the "" Finding Inspiration"" module): Students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them.

I'm just checking in to see if you received the message, and if there's anything else I can help with in the meantime. Also, when you get a chance, let me know which conversation you want to start with and I can unlock it for you. Thankss :) Mentor 2022-11-21, 20:04: Hi Sophia, No rush at all in responding, as I know you must be busy with schoolwork and the such! I'm just checking in to see if you received the message, and if there's anything else I can help with in the meantime. Also, when you get a chance, let me know which 'conversation' you want to start with and I can open it up for you. Thankss :) Mentee 2022-12-01, 10:15: Hi Rafi, I'm not really interested in any of these conversations personally, but now my teacher says we have to keep doing the mentoring thing. If I had to pick, I would pick the studying strategies one. Right now, I don't have any classes that need studying, so I won't be able to put it into effect until the next semester. Since my last note, I have been accepted at UNBC and am continuing work on my capstone. Thanks, Sophia Mentee 2022-12-08, 10:52: Hi Rafi, I usually am able to be pretty accountable for myself. This makes me a little less worried about the classes since I know that if necessary, someone will be able to help me if I am willing to reach out. I am worried about the heavy courseload and not being able to miss classes. I know that I won't be skipping because I'm paying for them, obviously. I don't get a whole lot of choice in my first year for what courses I can take. There's not really any room for ""taking what I'm interested in"", except in the sciences. I am required to take two, and they recommend Physics x2, but it's not required. So, I might take Chemistry, since that's what I've always been more interested in. but, I know it is really hard and I worry a lot about this. I had to drop Chem 12 at the start of this year because I missed some days and knew it was going to be super hard. before the school year, I was super excited to take Chemistry, but then I had to drop it, which sucked. My parents were mad at me, too. Thanks for the studying suggestions, that sounds useful. I will most likely try it. I am excited because when I go to university I will live at one home and will be able to have my own space where I don't have to move EVERYTHING once a week, and constantly feel uncomfortable. I think this will be able to help me create a nice space, have motivation, and make a routine. I have a Samsung Tablet I recently bought. I was excited to use it for school this year but haven't had much need without Chemistry. I have been using my laptop lots at school for my coding project, which makes me happy. I will most likely use these two a lot more, and maybe even be able to have my own desk that I don't have to change and have super cluttered. We did the Pomodoro technique in class before, but I already knew how to use this. For the next conversation, we could do the well-being and self-care one? Thanks, Sophia Mentee 2022-12-09, 11:02: Friendly reminder to post messages in the current Conversation thread you are working on so both parties can follow along :) Mentor 2023-01-20, 13:11: Hi Sophia, I hear you guys are finishing up with the program this week. It was great getting to know you this term! If there was something else that you wanted to cover, then I'd be happy to go over it. :) Otherwise, best of luck with the rest of the school year and your program next year. It sounds like you do have a decent idea of what you want to pursue and that will help you lots throughout your program. Take care! Rafi",,,,,
1047551240,11/13/2021 20:31,1047585089,56069,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-01-08, 20:30: Hi Sierra! Glad everything's alright. I agree, I struggled with Math and Physics a lot in first year university. I found that subjects like Math, Physics, and Chemistry takes a lot more understanding than actual memorization. Unfortunately, I found that the only way to master those subjects is to do a lot related practice questions. It was really helpful for me to list out all the different types of functions when studying deritives and antiderivatives. Good news is, since your interested in Psychology/Social Sciences, subjects like those would only be required for your first year. Other science subjects like Biology that mostly require memorization were easier for me. I also used index cards and found that helpful, so that's a great start! I think another strategy that is really helpful is active recall. Whenever you're just about to study/after studying, you would try to recall as much as you've studied off the top of your head. That information will likely be those that stick, and the rest that you've forgot are the ones you would focus on more. You can also click here for a list of other study tips! Did you think the Pomodoro Technique mentioned above would be helpful?",,"Mentor 2022-10-23, 00:23: Hi Sierra! It's nice to meet you :) I'm Julia and I'll be your mentor for this program. A little about me: I'm currently in my last year at SFU studying Health Sciences (yay!) while doing a co-op work term at a parasitology lab. On my free time I enjoy art, painting/drawing, dancing, and exploring new pubs/restuarants with friends. Some of my interests lie in parasitology, mental health, education, and forensics! It's great to see that we have interests in similar areas as well after reading a little bit of your bio :) Would love to know a little more about you before we begin discussing any topics! What are some of your goals/hobbies/interests? Also, if you have any intial questions about how this platform works, what you hope to get out of this program, or any other concerns after reading the above text, feel free to let me know too. Mentee 2022-11-01, 09:36: Hello Julia, My name is Sierra nice to meet you! Mentor 2022-11-02, 21:52: Hi Sierra! It's nice to meet you too :) Not sure if you're able to view my previous message, but I did a brief spiel about myself. I'm currently a Health Sciences student at SFU and doing a co-op work term at a parasitology lab. My interests lie in forensics, art, parasitology, and psychology as well :) Tell me a little about yourself (goals, passions, interests, etc.)! I did send a more detailed message prev to this so hopefully you're able to view it. While your at it, the text above also give a thorough outline of how this program/platform works so give it a read when you have time too :) Mentee 2022-11-15, 08:54: I own a horse his name is Danny, I barrel race in my free time. My interests lie in the SFU, I would like to go there and take the joint major psychology and criminology bacholers of arts. I choose this path because I want to help people and this is the path I chopse to do it. I speak fluent english, french and lots of sign language, I have two dogs a pitbull and a german shepard. I am very excited to be a mentee and cant wait to get to know you! Mentor 2022-11-16, 12:43: Hi Sierra, Yay, that's exciting that you want to attend SFU! I'm able to answer some questions about the university if you have any. I really like the criminology program here and looking into getting a foreniscs certificate! If you feel like you have a hang on how to navigate through the program, I can open up the first topic of your choice. I believe you're teacher wanted the ones below covered: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity – Adulting 101: students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap: students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them.

Hope everything is alright. Let me know when your ready to move on to the conversation topics and which one you want to do first :) Mentee 2022-12-07, 13:45: Hey Julia, sorry I have been sick and in active latley. I think I would like to start with studying strategic! Mentor 2022-12-08, 23:35: Hey Sierra! No worries, I've just opened up our first topic. Please take a look at the anchor text above and watch through the video! Do you have any prexisiting study strategies that you prefer to use? As mentioned in the video, recalling works the best for me. This is especially the case when it comes to memorizing loads of terminology (which I'm really bad at). Is there anything you struggle with when it comes to effective studying? Mentor 2022-12-24, 00:01: Hi Sierra, Happy Holidays! Hope you are having a good one and feeling better :) Sorry to be bothering you again, but I'm not sure how much your teacher wants to prioritize the completion of the topics assigned. I want to make sure that you won't be losing any marks or anything if this program isn't completed! However as of now, please enjoy your break/holiday! Hopefully I hear back from you again in the New Year and we can continue our discussions on the topics :) Julia Mentee 2023-01-05, 11:05: Hello Julia, Sorry it has been a crazy couple of months and have not had the chance to message back. I have pre-exisiting study strategies and they workj gret for coarses like english Psychology and Social studies but I cannot seem to get help from them in Science and Math classes. Most of mystudy tecxhniques are based on having times that I study and breaks in betweeen and memorization from notes and index cards.",,,,,

Do you have time for sports, or to be a student athelete, or do you find that there isnt enough time to reliably be player? Mentor 2022-11-01, 12:15: Hello Samuel! I definetely found enough time to play sports when I was in university. I took 4-5 classes every semester, volunteered about 5-7 hours a week and played soccer. Of course some weeks its difficult to balance playing sports as you may have more work to do for that particular week. The main thing is that if you keep a schedule and stay on top of your school work you can absolutely be a student athlete. Being an athlete also allows you to spend time away from school and relax. I hope that answered your questions. Do you have any other questions? Mentee 2022-11-02, 13:56: Hey Amrit, thankyou for the help with talking about what each week looks like,i do have a few other queastions about applying for student loans. I understdn that i wont have enough money to pay for my tuition and will need to take ourt a student loan. I still have no clue on where to start to evn look into one. Mentor 2022-11-06, 11:29: Hi Samuel, in regards to applying for student loans, I talked to a few people and used some resources online and found you can apply for student loans provincially and federally. I personally did not use student loans. I have added the links below. Use these links to get started and if you have more questions you can ask me. Sorry for the longer reply, I wanted to gather all of the information to answer your question. Do you have any other general questions for me? BC: https://studentaidbc.ca/sabc-home-page Canada: https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/home Mentor 2022-11-06, 11:33: Hi Samuel, I know this course is a requirement for you so to ensure we stay on schedule, I will open up the conversation titled ""Different Ways of Knowing"". Take time to work on this and you can also ask your generel questions about university whenever you want! Mentor 2022-11-16, 11:04: Hi Samuel, I am just following up to check in with you as you have not replied in a few days. How is everyhting going? Mentor 2022-11-22, 12:06: Hi Samuel, just checking in as you have not replied back in a few weeks. Is everything going well? Mentee 2022-12-01, 11:03: Hello Amrit, sorry fo r the super late response i have been busy wuith exams and applying to univeritsys.I am doing well and the stduent loan infornmation helped alot . I Have on more quesion bout if you think its worth it do stay oncamppus the first year on not, housing rpices are preetty close to the same but if just bering on campus first yeear is better. Mentor 2022-12-01, 13:01: Hi Samuel, I am glad the loan information helped you out. Applying for univerisities can be stressful and very time consuming. In regards to living on campus, I think it totally depends on how far your university is from where you live. For example, in my experience people that lived around 45 mins from campus preferred to commute because there is less you have to worry about since you do not live alone. Personally I lived about an hour from school and I chose to commute becuase I did not want to deal with the extra stresses of living alone. Living at home worked for me. So in your situation I think the most important thing is to determine how far the school that you want to go to is away from home and whether you feel comfortable living away from home. Mentee 2022-12-05, 13:25: Peroally I live about a hour drive from the University that i will be attending, (Plus or minus about 20min according to the weather) Mentee 2022-12-05, 13:31: Currently i live about an hour away from the University i will be attedning ( PLus or minus 20Min according to the weather). I feel that with also being on the soccer team, being a student athlete that lving closer to capmus will help me more. Helping me avoid the cost of gas and generally being closer to School while also not being too far away from home. Just a quick question, how was it making new friends in classes or do you generally just stcik with people that youre roomates with? Im a pretty socially confident person and am able to make friends very easily. Mentor 2022-12-07, 18:48: Yeah if you are on the soccer team with all the practices and games it would be much more convient to live on campus especially since you would be having to remain at school for large amounts of the day. In regards to making it friends, its pretty easy to make friends with people in your classes as everyone is new to the school. Also, there are plenty of group projects so you will be able to make friends. Joining clubs and going to events on campus is also a good way to meet new people and make friends. I have opened the conversation titled ""different ways of knowing"". I would like you to start on this so you are able to complete it before your deadline. Mentee 2022-12-08, 10:51: Im not to sure if i have anymore questions, i think that most of my questions now are not as important and more just day to day questions like is the meal plan worth it not cost wise, just because it would cost about the same in the end. But generally how goood is the caff food compared to cooking your own? Also just for fun because imrunning out of questions, who do you have winning the World Cup and if you know (Hopfully) , Metro Boomin's new Album Hero and Villans or Drakes CLB? Mentor 2022-12-09, 10:17: Hi Samuel, what I have heard from classmates is that the residence food can be hit or miss. Usually there are lots of other food chains near campus so you could always eat there. And yes I have been watching the world cup and its been great. I just finished watching the Brazil game with Croatia. Personally, I want England to win but France look like the best team to me. What position do you play, I play centre mid. I have listened to the albums and to be honest I liked both of them. Have you listened to Drake's latest album ""Her Loss"". Mentee 2022-12-12, 12:58: Hey Amirt, Im still not too sure about ""Her Loss"", i listened to only a couple of songs but its kind of one of his Mid albums. I feel like there are better albums like Metro Booming new one and even Older ones like Rodeo by Travis Scott. Again im not really too sure if i have too many questions, I have until Early June to get most things done then i have to apply for student housing and other things corilated with the univerity. So im just going to keeep talking about other things. For soccer i play left mid which in wierd because usually mid feilds are pretty big and im not too tall, (only 5'8). I know that you to to UBC so have you ever gone skiing? Im also on my highschools ski team. Also if youre interested in how i look/better idea of who i am if you have instagram its _sammyr_ and so i dont get inrouble by my teacher or your organizer, I did check with my parents so its ok. Mentee 2022-12-13, 16:45: Hi Samuel and Amrit Pal, Mentors and mentees cannot share their social media. Please keep messaging each other only on this platform, and remove the post with your instagram handle. Thanks! Annie (eMentoring staff) Mentor 2022-12-15, 14:09: Hi Samuel, I do not really ski but I do spend a lot of time outdoors such as going on hikes and spending time at the beach. Who do you have in the final for the world cup. I would love to see Messi win but I think France is going to win. In regards to this program, don't you have to complete the conversations by January 20th? Mentor 2023-01-09, 15:48: Hi Samuel! I hope you had a relaxing break. I wanted to know until when you have to complete your requriements for this course. Is it January 20th? Mentee 2023-01-19, 10:43: Hey amrit, I have until the 26th to finish all of the requirements. As far as i',concerned i have completed everything invloving this E-mentoring and general classwork. Thankyou for replying and answering to my many questions and explained it in a very simple way. Mentee 2023-01-19, 11:02: As far as my break goe, it was pretty solid. Im on the ski team and play hockey so most of my break was filed withp[laying sports, which is fun.

Thats honestly the first time I've heard of this program! I personally have worked with a lot of instrumentation in my lab, like an inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometer! I would agree that there is definitely a growing need for such a job seeing first hand in the lab! Mentor 2022-12-07, 12:07: Ill let you read through this chapter and feel free to ask me anything!",,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-27, 15:28: Hey Robbie, I am Ahmad! I am 21 years old studying Health Sciences at University. Can you tell me about yourself? Such as classes you are in, things ya like to do for fun, and anything else. Also feel free to ask me questions. Ill leave ya with this joke. Have you heard of the rumor about butter? Never mind, I shouldn’t spread it. Mentee 2022-11-15, 14:34: Hey Ahmad, it's Robbie. I was looking at your profile and I saw that quite a few of our interests line up, such as learning different languages and playing technology, personally I am very much into the coding aspect of things, and of course I also enjoy playing video games, its probably on a more excessive level but I have more free time then not. I personally have a interest in a vast amount of academics with some of those beong chemistry, physics and some mathamatics. I just have one question for you right now, I am wondering what has post-secondary been like in your personal experience and are you finding it has enjoyable as you hoped it to be? Mentor 2022-11-19, 13:25: Hey Robbie! Its soo cool to know that we have lots of shared interests, out of curiosity what languages are you interested in? As for if I find my post-secondary experience enjoyable, currently, I do, but coming into it, It was more of a jumble because I knew a lot less about what I wanted to do than when I was in highschool! Also what games do you play? I am more of an fps and rts games! Mentor 2022-11-19, 13:28: Also Im not sure if ya had time but have you had time to read the quick little papers about this program? Mentee 2022-11-23, 09:05: Hey, I did end up reading all of the programs, as for what specific games i'm interested in I would have to say that my current focus has been playing Overwatch 2 but I have a history in playing several other games, these range from CSGO to Civilisation 6 then to the Minecraft as well. Aside from that I am interested in learning about either German or a Language more mative to asia but I haven't picked which one I would like to learn as it is a massive undertaking as long as having so many different dialects. Anyways to break into more of the Program do you have any tips that would help with planning going into Post-Secondary? Mentor 2022-11-28, 12:53: What the heck! I feel a bit older but I loved CSGO and Civ 5! My language learning also consisted much of german and now more heavily Korean! Honestly in terms of planning for post-secondary, do you have any idea what you like to do, or what you would like to work doing? Like do you like helping people, make stuff, discover things? its usually helps if you have done some part time jobs, like when I worked at safeway and learned interacting in a customer service capacity isn't for me. Mentor 2022-11-28, 12:54: But for the program is there a section you wanted to get started with? Mentee 2022-11-29, 13:58: I'm a little confused for the programs in the circle at the top for me as they all list as Chapter locked, the one I would wish to do would be the Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning. I read it saying you would need to give acsess so I am not sure how exactly that works, but aside from that I do have a rough plan for Post-Secondary. I am planning to apply to BCIT to get into the Industrial Instrumentation and Process Control Technician program as its both something that interests me and a lucrative opportunity from all that I've seen and from asking those around me what the current market is looking like for this job. Anyways the program I would like is the Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning, or if that one doesn't work Finding Insperation.",,,,,

Please watch the video titled ""The Creative Process: Where Do I Start?"". Consider the following statement from Mina Shum: “Everybody wants something…I think you plan everything. I think to even partake in creation, you start with an intention. Why are you bothering to put pen to paper? Why are you bothering to speak at all? You have an intention, a want, a desire that needs to be filled.” Think about what inspires you... What do you want in life? What are you passionate about and why? Share your thoughts, and try to write 5 things that you want in life, and why you want these things. They can be materialistic, experiential, etc!

I love being active, playing sports and hanging out wiht my friends. I am very excited to answer any questions you have for me this semester. My favourite kind of music is country, how about you? What grade are you in? How are you finidng this school year so far? Mentee 2022-11-02, 09:02: I am a grade twelve student at correlieu secondary in a small town near prince george area! i used to be a hockey player but i now team and tie down rope. i am apart of highschool rodeo which is a fun program! i like some country music aswell alot of older stuff. roping is one of my favorite things to do, I also enjoy snowmobiling and driving my truck around. Mentor 2022-11-07, 14:59: That's awesome, sounds like you are very involved in your high school! What kinds of courses are you taking? Have you looked into prerequisites for the trades programs you are interested in going into? Have you thought about where you would like to go to school, a college or a universty? When you are ready we can go ahead and start the first conversation topic!! Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:55: i have looked into some trades options and i am wanting to go to olds college in alberta and take a course in apprenticeship welding or meat cutting. both are good skills and could make me good money later in life, I take auto shop and metal work currently at my shcool and they help me alot in what i do. Mentor 2022-11-12, 11:52: That's awesome to hear! Seems like you have done a lot of research are going into something that you are genuinely interested in. Have you already applied for these programs? I know that applying out-of-province can be a little bit of a hastle and takes a little more work. Mentee 2022-11-18, 09:33: yes i have been i havent aplied yet due to me not knowing what work i am going into i want to get a apprenticship welding first and then take my level one instead of taking a beginners course due to it being expensive if i can avoid it. also im starting my capstone now and how did you do yours? who did you use for a mentor and such? im trying to get some ideas. i plan on doing my capstone on my growth and skill building in both operating and welding. Mentor 2022-11-20, 11:48: That sounds like a very good idea trying to find an apprenticeship first to make some money and immerse yourself in the field. It is very important that you enjoy the field you are planning on working in because school does cost a lot of money. Does apprenticeship pay a wage or is it more volunteer fro experience? My capstone projects were pretty simple,I had to write about my volunteer work and other work that I had to complete in order to graduate, write about my skills and what I would bring to the world, and complete a presentation about my plan in the world (what and how I plan on doing after graduation). As for my mentor, I had a friend that was a paramedic in my town who had always been a role model to me and helped me out throughout the years and worked in the medical field which I am interested in pursuing. Mentors can really be anyone that you look up to, whether it be their profession, drive, skills, attitude, or anything else. I personally find it easiest to do this sort of a project with someone that works in the field you are interested in, but really anyone would work! Mentee 2022-11-23, 09:02: yeah thats sweet! I am currently looking for an apprenticeship because i can make quite a bit of money and ill have hours and experience out of it so thats probably my plan! Mentor 2022-12-01, 18:19: Yeah that sounds like a great plan to get some experience and make some money for sure! Whenever you are ready we can move into the first conversation that you will pick!

I opened up the module so you would be able to access it from the mentor main page. Can you see a giant green circle with words around the edges? The word ""strategic studying"" should have been unlocked. If you click it, you will be able to access it. When you access it, you will see a video, and a link that says discussion questions right below the video. Try watching the video and take a look at the discussion questions.

I will be going through some of the activities here with you and hopefully, you will be able to get something out of this! I am currently a 2nd year student at UBC studying CAPS. My goal is to become a surgeon one day. Although it will be a tough journey, it is something I want to do no matter what. Actually, I was able to decide what I wanted to do with my life because of a similar class I had to do in secondary school! Although doing a mandatory class for something like this might seem like unnecessary extra work, I assure you that you will think otherwise in the future.

I play the trumpet, am trying to learn C++, and i love playing gmes on my computer. If youre comfortable, could you tell me a bit about yourslef? All the best, Mason Telkamp Mentee 2022-11-02, 14:05: Dear Jeongyeol, Please forget certain parts of the last message I sent, I didnt see your proir message. That is really really awesome, Ive always wanted to go there one day. I have settled down a bit on my career choice. I want to be a university professor when i am older. I want to get a degree in math and physics at UNBC, and then get a masters and hopefully a PhD at UBC. I am Thinking of maybe working for a bit after i get my bachelors, maybe as a teacher or some other math and sciance heavy job. The problem i have with this is just that i dont want to forget how to be a sudent, or get sucked into a career im unhappy with. But also thats just one idea and im acctually more lost then ever. Mentor 2022-11-03, 22:17: Hi Mason, Wow you must be really into math and physics if you want to be a professor for it. Math was actually my favourite subject too, which is why I'm doing a minor in it. And yeah, being a professor is going to be a tough road. A lot of my friends back in highschool that liked math and physics actually ended up going to engineering. There are more opportunities to get a decent job, and if you'd like, you can pursue graduate studies to become a professor as well. Also, if you do go into engineering, you will have to constantly learn new things even if you graduate and get a job. It is one of those professions where you will have to be a student forever. Because of this, it is quite easy to come back to school even after you have been working. If you insist that pure math and physics is your thing, you should pursue that my all means. Ultimately, it's your life and you should make the choices that you want. I believe that is the most important thing. I saw that you play trumpet! Are you a part of a school band? I used to play trombone when I was in my highschool band. I haven't played in a while so I probably forgot but it was really fun when I did it. I'm not too good with computers so coding wasn't my thing but I do play video games sometimes. What games do you play? I used to play quite a bit of video games but I haven't been having the time play recently. I mostly just watch youtube, listen to songs, and work out in my free time. I also like going around trying different foods from other cultures! What do you like to do in your free time? And by the way, I'm sorry for the late reply :( I just had two exams, yesterday and today, and I was wayyyy too stressed. Mentee 2022-11-04, 12:45: Hello Jeongyeol, I think i really am into math and physics, but i woulnt be opposed to engineering, in fact i had made a plan to go for mechanical engineering but i decided that i really really want to teach. i think i was drawn to teaching university, just because i dont wanna teach highschool. i would also LOVE to be like i full time reasercher? or lead a team of reserchers. i just dont know enough about that route and i didnt take biology so i cant do much oganic stuff. but i feel like that would be a really fun job to have. i see myself as a life long student, i intend on always being in and out of school because i love learning. thats also why i thought maybe being a professor would be good because i feel like there is a lot of freedom in that position in terms of growing my education. I also think thats why i gravitated toward grad studies, just so that i could learn so much more. I was also thinking of studying chemisrty as i feel thats where a lot of innovation is possible, so if i wanted to be a reasercher this would be the best choice of path for me? i havent picked a major or erolled in any courses, so i mean anyhting is on the table in terms of studies. i am just worried that i will pick the wrong thing and be stuck, but i know that teaching and reaserching are what i want to pursue. I do play the trumpet and im in jazz band. its so much fun ive also joined lots of little jaz bands with my friends and we would go play gigs and it was awesome. i played the tombone for a little bit, but then i gave up pn learning bass clef. ive spent a lot of time playing trumpet and brass insterments throughout middle school and grades 10 and 11. I love video games, i built a pc a couple years ago and have been playng minecraft and slime rancer. good chill games i can play to relax. i used to play a lot of competitive FPS games but that got too stressful and now i just play games to relax. Mentor 2022-11-04, 18:36: Hi Mason! I forgot to tell you but I usually go by Justin. Jeongyeol is my legal name but I use Justin as my preferred name because not a lot of people can pronounce that. If you think teaching is really something that you are passionate about, you should defintely pursue that route. From what I know, if you think the most important innovations are something that can change people's everyday lives, I would say biology and chemistry are where it mostly comes from. However, there are as amazing things being researched in other disciplines so don't try to restrict yourself too much. I am not sure about other univerisities but in UBC, you don't actually choose a major at year 1. You just go in as a general science student and pick majors for the second year. In my first year, I took all of math, physics, chemistry, biology, and of course a bit of English. I realized that I liked chemistry/biology the most and math second. That's why I decided to do CAPS as my major and math as a minor. Even if you have to choose a major first year, it is quite easy to transfer into other majors if you just have the grades. Since you are passionate about math and physics, I would say going into a physics major would be a good choice. Maybe as electives, you can try some chemistry courses! You can drop courses in the first 2~3 weeks without any penalty if you find out that really isn't your thing. If you do find that is really your thing, you will be able to change majors without being set back a year by taking ~2 summer courses. And the extra physics courses that you took doesn't have to go to waste if you decide to do a minor in physics. You will come to realize that there are soooo many overlaps between physics and chemistry and having that additional viewpoint to look at things from will help you immensely. 1st year math is a basic requirement for everything related to science so you don't even need to think about it. Wow you built a pc? That's amazing. I have a friend that is really into those things as well. He always talks about nvidia and amd and I just pretend that I understand what he is saying half of the time haha. He is in electrical engineering and really likes math and science too. I used to play league of legends sometimes but it was getting way too stressful. Games are supposed to be for fun so what is the point if you get more stressed after you play right? Minecraft is a classic that I played a lot too, but I've been cutting off playing games entirely these days :( By the way, I wanted to ask you about how this program is like on your side. Do you only have class time to do it or can you do it at home as well? I believe there are 6 modules that we have to finish until January 20 so I want to come up with a rough schedule that we'll follow. Maybe 1 module per 2 weeks? From the email that I got, it doesn't matter which ones we do so if you have anything that you want to try in particular, we can do that first. Even if unrelated to that, feel free to ask me any questions about university and career in general. I will try to help you as best as I can :) Mentor 2022-11-15, 01:18: Hi again Mason, I haven't heard back in a while so I want to check that you are doing okay. I know that you are probably busy with other things at this time of the year, but I hope you could find some time for this program. I was really looking forward to getting to know you! I love people with a strong passion like you. So whenever you can, feel free to message me. See you soon :) Mentee 2022-11-17, 11:10: Hey Justin, Sorry about the late reply, but ive been working lots recently and school has been pretty stressful. Chemistry 12 was kicking my butt for a while, the whole concept of equilibrium threw me for a loop, but i think it getting better now that weve moved onto more calculation orented stuff. we just had this guest speaker in careers class that talked about paramedic stuff, and that REALLY captivated me. so maybe i was thinking about doing that part time while im a astudent, as the pay is good, and the hours are extreamly flexable, so i was thinking about doing that part time. I built lots of PCs, my friends, dads, and my own has been rebuild many times. its like expensive lego really, just clicking things into place. i like it and its quite rewarding to do. Again, i am lost in my career journy again. Mentor 2022-11-18, 02:30: Nice to hear back from you! Having work experience in anything is good, so definitely try paramedics if it sounds like what you are passionate about. I honestly have the same problem as you do. If I could, I want to stay in school all my life and learn everything from every discipline. From math, to every type of science, to philisophy, psycology, law, medicine, economics, etc. However, you can't do that realistically. So, I decided to choose just one that I think is what I like the most. If you really like PC building a lot on top of math and physics, I feel ilke electrical engineering will be your thing. I think some of the modules on this program can help you guide through the lost feeling you are feeling right now. It's completely normal, and I know that plenty of my friends still don't know what exactly they want to do with their future. It's one of those things you have to keep thinking about all your life. If you can find somehting that can hook you, great! But that will not likely come without a lot of time and experience. Mentee 2022-11-18, 13:50: Hey Justin, I really hope i figure things out soon, i think i have a rough idea what my path is going to look like i just dont know the details. i still think that i want to do professoring, thats still something i come back to as an option. i suppose i could work as an ambulance driver throughout the summer, they made it seem like it was a pretty clear path so we will see. im totally ready to start working through modules, those sound fun. Mentor 2022-11-18, 15:05: Great! Do you have anything that you want to start with in particular? I believe we can do them in any order so if you have anything that interests you right now, we can start with that. I got this list of modules that we have to finish from your school. Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity – Adulting 101: students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap: students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them. Mentee 2022-11-21, 12:34: Hey Justin, I’m ready to start on whatever module, I was thinking maybe the Strategic Studying one? I am really bad at studying so I think that this is the right choice. I haven’t been told about any modules prior so maybe you could lead or just give me a little bit more info? If that works for you of course. Mentee 2022-12-15, 10:13: HIIIIII Justin, im still kicking lol! yeah no so its been SUPER busy over here i havnt even started on the module. is it too late to try? thanks, mason Mentee 2023-01-05, 10:20: Hey Justin, I am prepared to do it now? I know that we are nearing the end of January here so time is limited. I haven’t had my exams yet so maybe we could work on that studying one? Mentor 2023-01-13, 21:13: Hey Mason! How are you doing? There's a little event that is happening soon called meet your mentor. If you are not busy, you should attend! I think you should have gotten an email on how to join. It's a neat event where a bunch of mentors and mentees can mingle on some sort of a game-map area. It's probably a lot better for me to tell you about post-secondary with voice rather than over messaging so I think it will be really helpful. You can also hear from other mentors so you can get more perspectives! Of course, if you are busy with other things, you don't have to. However, it is almost the end and it is going to be close to the last opportunity that we'll get to talk.",,,,,

Well, I’ll just start off with a quick little introduction. I am 20 this year, and in my third year at UBC studying Chemical Biology. my favorite subject would probably have to be genetics or organic chemistry. Now I hope you could tell me more about yourself, it could be anything. For instance, what're your hobbies or what is your favourite subject?

For me personally, interviews can be quite stressful, but I'm glad to have gotten some experience over time. And you plan to pursue computer science? That's nice to hear! I remember taking a computer science course in my first year, and it was honestly very fun. Now that I look back at it, I probably should've taken another, haha. I really hope your application to UBC is a success! Introductions aside, let me know if you would like to start the conversations, and if you have a specific one in mind. Mentor 2023-01-17, 14:53: Hey Madi! It's been quite some time since we last chatted. How have you been?

At this time, have a read through Anchor text 1. You will get the chance to explore career profiles for both your dream career and a more ""realistic"" career. Once you have read through Anchor text 1 and finished the necessary research on the website linked, you'll get the chance to answer some discussion questions and send your responses to me.

One of the things I value the most about the work that I do is I get to meet and collaborate with so many different people! I know thinking about the cost of post-secondary can be stressful. I would highly encourage you to apply to as many scholarships as you can. These can really help with paying tuition. Your school might have a career centre that provides students with a list of scholarships they can apply for. For next steps, you can now move onto Achor Text 2 ""Choosing a school."" This will give you the opprtunity to look at some schools that offer programs for heavy duty mechanics. Let me know if you have any questions!

I just graduated from Simon Fraser University (SFU) with a degree in education. I am planning on becoming a teacher and still have to do my teacher education program at SFU before I offically become a Social Studies teacher. From your profile, I see that you are interested in potentially becoming a teacher, so if you have any questions I'm always here to help :) Right now I am working two part time jobs with students and newcomers to Canada and I am volunteering at the high school I went to. Like you, I also like to draw and paint. Since I'm in my festive spirits, I painted a pumpkin for Halloween and have attached a photo of it too (it's the one on the left). I also like listening to music before bed, going for walks to explore new places, and baking. I'm excited to read your introduction message and get to know a little more about you! Some questions I have are... 1) What classes are you taking this semester? 2) What is your favourite subject? 3) What's a cool memory/experinece you have had working at Walmart? Chat soon, Gurkirat Mentor 2022-10-21, 12:58:  Mentee 2022-11-01, 09:05: Nice to virtually meet you as well. In high school right now the classes I'm taking are English 12, French 12, psychology 11 and career life 12. I enjoy these classes. Im super excited to graduate this year but have actually had a change of career path ideas, instead of going into teaching mostly cause i can't afford it i applied and got a conditional acceptance into the heavy mechanical trades program at CNC. My favorite subject in school right now is psychology. I don't really have any cool memories working at Walmart; it's kind of just walmart. What made you decide to be a teacher, and what were the biggest challenges you faced getting there so far. Looking forward to hearing back from you :) Mentor 2022-11-01, 11:24: Hey Kenya, You have some awesome classes this semester! I took French 12 as well and really enjoyed it and have taken some psychology courses in university too because I minored in Educational Psychology. I totally understand your concerns with the cost of teaching programs. I wanted to break down this cost for you just in case you ever reconsider your options. At SFU, I paid approximately $2000-$3500 each semester (4 months). This is about $7000-$8000 a year. Congrats on getting a conditional acceptance into the heavy mechanical trades program, that is so awesome!! Thanks for your question, I wanted to be a teacher because working with students brings me a lot of joy. One aspect of my work that I enjoy the most is getting to engage in learning through laughter. The students always bring a smile to my face and I get to learn so much from them and their experineces as well. I have been working with students for 5 years now and many different challenges come up. One challenge I've faced is having to mamage disruptive behaviour. There will definitely be a handful of students that will not want to listen to you. I have had to learn how to be super assertive. Another challenge I have faced is having a language barrier with students. Since I work with newcomers to Canada, many of them don't know English at all. So, I use Google translate with them and aim to build their literacy skills through activities and reading books. In terms of post secondary, I've had some of the most amazing professors. However, you'll likely come across a professor that marks really hard or gives really horrible feedback too. Let me know if you have any other questions! Otherwise, we can start a conversation of your choice (it must be one that you are required to take for your class though) Chat soon, Gurkirat Mentor 2022-11-08, 11:17: Hey Kenya, Just wanted to check back in! :) Let me know when you are ready to move onto a Conversation.

I think id like to talk more about post secondary and career planning as ive been super stressed abought paying for schooling and everything. Mentee 2023-01-04, 14:16: Hey sorry it's been a while again i have been busy. The career i researched was heavy duty mechanics. In order to become a heavy duty mechanic I need to do a 4 year apprenticeship but there is also a 7 month foundations course at the college or university level that you can take. I think I would benefit from attending post-secondary because I don’t know what I’m gonna do with my life once there isn’t school anymore and it’s causing a lot of stress cause all I’ve known is going to school and working. I also think it would be beneficial to attend the foundations program before going into my apprenticeship because I get a competitive advantage. I think some of the challenges I’ll face are money and how I’m gonna be able to afford it. I also am thinking about the challenge of moving and not knowing where I can live and of course the fact that I might not even graduate this year. I feel stressed about gaining experience especially as a female going into such a male dominated trade. I think it might make it hard to get an apprenticeship and find people willing to take the time to train me. I am looking forward to it though and I am excited to meet new people and gain more experience. Overall I do think my career choice is achievable but it will take a lot of effort. (Sorry I only chose one to talk about I’m stressed about everything else but I figured I should take the time to message.)",,,,,

1047549501,10/21/2021 20:08,1047585076,56055,,,"Mentor 2022-11-16, 20:52: Hey Josiah! Thats a great question. For me, I like to say my name out aloud and reflect what do I want it to represent and I try and reach that goal. Similar to how when you hear or think of the name ""Michael Jordan"" you instantly know it represents greatness in basketball or ""Nike"" and know that it represents a good atheletic brand. I too also do some mediation or going for a walk to freshen my mind and for self care purposes. Building upon that topic, I opened the Self-Care and well being activity for us. Take a look at the video link I posted below this and let me know you think of self care and what are some signs you feel when you need to make time for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0iVTQS8ftg&amp;t=268s&amp;ab_channel=HowtoAdult My thoughts after the video are that if I were to define self-care, it would be that there is a life beyond school and work and that its important to value and do things you enjoy in life too. Personally for me, I know I need to give myself some time to do things I enjoy when I have trouble focusing or I am very tired. This usually means for me just putting on some music and just sitting and relaxing, playing some video games, or as mentioned earlier just going out for a walk. What are some activities you enjoy to make yourself happy or do to relax? Mentor 2023-01-05, 12:53: Hey Josiah, Good to hear from you again. Those are some great points you mentioned and it is really good to hear that you know the signs when you need some self care. Before we move on to the next activity, what are some some things in terms of self care that you feel you could be better at? For me, I feel that while I get enough hours of sleep, I dont really get it during the right times. So, for example I get 8 hours of sleep, but I get it from say 4am - Noon. A goal I've tried to set for my self is to try and sleep the 8 hours during the times of 11pm-7am so that my body clock is more adjusted. To try and follow this better, I typically remind myself that work can always be done the next day and set alarms on my phone to let me know it is time to go to bed. If you feel comfortable enough, think and share of 3 things in terms of self care that you can do better and what steps are you going to take to follow through. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! Mentee 2023-01-06, 12:57: Something I struggle with in terms of self-care is knowing when I'm overdoing it to begin with. When a dude gets in the zone he sort of gets numb to mental pain and can't quit unless he purposefully checks in on himself, you know?",,,"Mentor 2023-01-07, 23:25: Yeah, I understand what you mean. It's why its important to rely on friends to keep you on the right track. Do you have any plans or methods of self-care if you do feel that sort numbness to mental pain? Moving on to the next activity, I have opened the next converstation for us which is the post-secondary and career-planning conversation. Take a look at this job website on the following link: https://www.workbc.ca/Jobs-Careers/Explore-Careers.aspx Take a look at it and see if you can find a dream career on it and a career that while it may not be your dream, you would still be pretty happy with. Once you found both, let me know what kind of steps it would take to reach that ideal job and what about those 2 jobs that interests you. For my current situation, being a pharmacist was not and probably is still not my dream job, but it's still something I am satisfied with as I can still make a difference in my community while making a pretty good earning. In terms of the steps it requires, I know it needed at least 2-4 years of post-secondary education and after that another 4 years of dedicated pharmacy education. Looking forward to hearing what kind of careers you're interested in! Mentee 2023-02-05, 22:19: Philip. My man. You're a real one and I do wish the best for you and I pray for the best for you in general. Man, I gotta tell ya- I won't be able to keep up with this eMentor stuff no more... Matter of fact- I'm going to my first day of early college, tomorrow. Carpentry course. I've kind of gone past the point of needing to keep up with an eMentor program. Y'know what, Philly? Philly cheese? Philadelphia flyer? Lemme tell you, man... This whole eMentor thing was barely of interest to me- but YOU, brotha... YOU are a REAL one. THAT'S RIGHT, HOMIE. YOU! YOU, DAWG!! YOUUUUU!!!!!!!!!! The eMentoring program's been an unneeded part of my life, but lemme tell ya- YOU, brotha, the man the myth the legend Philly Cheese... YOU made eMentoring a cool experience, not cause eMentoring itself has been of much relevancy to me, but 'cause YOU are CHILL! LOVE YOU HOMIE. Good odds you may never hear from me again after this convo... But man, I'll say it AGAIN- you made this whole gig CHILL. Peace and love, man. I pray that Jehovah God bless you. I MEAN IT!

My name is Philip and I am excited to be your mentor this semester! I am currently studying at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Outside of school, I enjoy swimming, watching sports (my favorite teams are: Vancouver Canucks, Toronto Raptors, Buffalo Bills, and Toronto Blue Jays) and spending time with friends. My favorite type of food is anything related to barbecue! My least favorite food is probably cheesecake. I'm interested in learning more about you! Share as much as you feel comfortable with such as goals you have, things you like or dont like, hobbies etc. Look forward to hearing from you soon :) Mentee 2022-11-01, 09:00: Yo Philip. Nice to meet you man. I appreciate a dude who is enthusiastic about barbecue food, though I am bewildered that I've heard the phrase ""My least favorite food is probably cheesecake"" spoken to me... That's fine mate. We all got differences. You like Snapple though? I'm sipping a Snapple right now brotha. 'Mango Madness' flavored Snapple. I've picked up intermittent fasting, dieting n whatnot, and Tuesday is my rest day for workouts and my cheat day for dieting. That explains the Snapple. What kinda luxury drink do you usually choose mate? Alcoholic, non-alcoholic... whatever suits you man. Mentor 2022-11-03, 00:37: Hey man, I for sure love a good Snapple. Favorite flavored Snapple is probably the Iced Peach. Best kind of luxury drink for me is probably those Mexican sodas called Jarritos. Whats your favorite cheat day meal? For me it has to be the classic burger and fries Let me also know what conversations from the green circle above that you would like to start with. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Mentee 2022-11-15, 09:24: Hey Philip, how do you like to find inspiration? I enjoy going for a walk to get the mind going. Also, meditation through prayer or simply sitting silently get my mind a fresh perspective. Mentee 2023-01-05, 11:24: Nice to be talking to you again Philip. i think self-care is mad important. it's like the dude in the video said- you are your own responsibility. One of the biggest signs that I need time to myself is when I stare blankly- and another one would be messing around on the computer when I should be working. To cope with that stuff, I get a drink of water, tea, MAYBE coffee if it's sometime in the morning... I like to take a break with some video games, talking a bit to someone, prayer, silent meditation... Or maybe an odd conglomorate of all of those at once if I'm mad out of tune. I got other stuff- but that's what I think of cardinally. Whatchu got for the next activity, mate? Mentor 2023-02-06, 22:57: Josiah, I wish you all the best in any of your future pursuits! It was great having the chance to talk to you and listen to some of your thoughts. Thank you for your kind words and I know you will do great out there. Feel free to reach out to me anytime you want through this platform. Wishing you nothing but the best -Philip",,,,,

I have opened up the module for you.",,,"Mentee 2022-12-01, 11:29: Hi, i like to start with the first anchor for getting hired. I have some experience in most skill areas. I dont know any examples of my communication, but in terms responsibility and teamwork, i have led multiple projects and even otheractivities, such as a band. I have experience as a quick learner by having to adapt to a completely different ways of doing things when covid started, and I have a lot of experience with technology, having built multiple computers. Mentor 2022-12-01, 19:28: Hey Jonah, that's a really good start! I remember when I was drafting my first resume and only had a few things to put down, soft skills like the ones mentioned in the article are a great way to have something to talk about not just on the resume, but during interview as well! Over time, we grow and develop new skills through new experiences, so you should enjoy yourself along the way! There's a starting point for everyone, including me :)) Communication is definitely a big one. Most jobs require you to communicate to clients, customers, and fellow employees in an efficient and kind manner. Luckily, it's a skill we use everyday! Even through just our regular conversation here, I can tell you communicate your ideas well. Perhaps you've written essays to argue for a point or have done a few presentations for school. Those are all instances where your communication skills are in play. You also mentioned leading a couple projects and a band. I'm curious, what kind of projects were they and what responsibilities did you have? I'd imagine you would have to communicate effectively there as well! We both play guitar but leading a band in particular sounds so interesting. I've always wanted to jam out with some friends but I don't have too many friends that play instruments unfortunately :(. This is definitely something that requires a lot of responsibility and teamwork, playing in sync and all that. Did you form the band yourself, or was this for a school activity? I'd love to hear about it. Most jobs will have you go through some form of training period to get you started, so being a quick learner is a huge asset. I agree that COVID had ruined a lot of plans and continues to do so. Being able to adapt on the fly is a skill a lot of us have had to develop these past few years. Now building computers caught my eye. That's very impressive, sometimes I clean my computer and I don't even know what's what. I do have some tech friends that build PCs but they're way more knowledgeable than I""ll ever be ahaha. Do you do it for fun/with your friends? Technological skills don't necessarily have to refer to the physical components though! It can also include knowledge of software and applications. Perhaps you may be familiar with some or have used them for school before? A lot of companies may use programs that you may already be familiar with, and is something you can put on your applications/resumes! Overall, really nice brainstorm! I love how you connected your skills with different experiences. Let me know if you think of any other examples after reading through this :) I look forward to talking about the resume portion of the anchor and what job you might consider applying to. Mentor 2022-12-24, 15:08: Hey Jonah, I haven't heard from you in a while, just wanted to make sure you're doing alright. I really enjoyed hearing about the skills you've obtained from your various activities, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your resume building!",,

I know the holidays are coming up any plans for that? How is school? Are you busy with school stuff because I know I am, I have 3 finals coming up and 3 major papers. But I am happy I am done with 1 and I am almost done the second one. It has been so hectic especially studying for my finals and getting my paper done. Let me know what you want to talk about.",,"Mentor 2022-10-23, 16:10: Hey Jessica, How's it going? I see that you like playing guitar, what songs do you like to play. I also play guitar but not as often as I want to because I have a lot of classes this semester and work as well. So my free time is just catching up on sleep or assignments. What kind of things or books do you like to read. I like reading mystery stuff because I never know what will happen. Feel free to share hobbies or interests or things you want to ask me. Or any interesting things that happened in school because I know high school can sometimes be boring. I can also share my day-to-day life with school or work if you want to know that as well. Looking forward to getting to know you as well as answer any questions about life or uni :) Mentee 2022-10-23, 17:14: Hi Jham! I'm doing okay right now, slightly stressed with school things but it's totally fine. how about you? I also haven't been playing my guitar as much as I used to but when I do its mostly Lovejoy (one of the bands I'm obsessing over right now) related songs and stuff by Mal Blum. Do you main with an acoustic or an electric? Book wise I really like fantasy and anything that wouldn't really be considered ""realistic"". However, currently I've been really into Alice Osemans writing, mainly one of their books called solitaire. I'm slightly bad at talking to people so this kinda thing is a bit foreign to me. I'm not entirely sure what kind of stuff I should ask and what not right now, but I would like to hear about your day-to-day life. Mentor 2022-10-25, 11:43: Hii, not a problem at all, it does take time feeling comfortable talking to people and I get that because I'm an introvert myself and social setting is definitely something that is hard for me. Can I ask what grade you're in and how many classes you're takiing? Ooo I checked out some of the songs from Lovejoy and it is pretty good :) I have a couple acoustic guitars in my room but recently have become decorations with my limited time but I play songs here and there. I can give a couple of suggestions on things/topics we can explore and talk about it. In high school, I struggled with time management, so that was something I wanted to work on because when I got to university, life just became so hectic that if I didn't know how to manage my time I would've been behind in all my assignments. I read on your bio that you want to know what is like moving out and uni life. I dont live on campus which is kind of unfortunate because of transit but I have managed to survive 3 years going in and out of campus for class and it wasn't too bad. I usually catch-up on reading or take a little nap. My day-to-day life differs everyday of course. I usually work on weekends and a couple weekdays. I go to school tues and thurs with back to back classes from 11-4. After classes I usually go home and take a nap before I start my assignments. After work, I usually meet up with my friends to study even though we are not in the same class but it is still nice to have someone to accompany me. Mentee 2022-10-27, 18:46: Hey :) Yeah, social settings in general are kinda just bad unless it's with people I know. I'm in grade 12 right now and thankfully only have 3 classes. The free block I have is definitely very needed, I think I'd die if I had a full schedule. I'm hoping I'll be able to drop one of my classes next semester to get another one. Yo I wasn't expecting you to actually look into them, definitely one of my more recommended bands. The guitar I have has also basically became decoration sadly due to me messing up the strings the last time I played. Topic suggestions are very appreciated. I kind of have difficulties with time management, partly due to major time blindness, how did you better it? I want to move out as soon as I realistically can but the thought of it also slightly terrifies me. I have some plans to move in with a friend for the gap year I'm taking once I graduate but I don't know too much about the actual process of leaving and getting a place on my own. Also, the whole thing with living on campus once actually in college or whatever, I don't know if I should go for that or not. I feel like studying with people either makes things better or incredibly more difficult, no in between. Mentor 2022-10-31, 09:36: Hii :) Ooo what classes are you taking right now/what class do you want to drop? I gave 2 of my guitars to my family friend because i simply did not have the room. There are conversations that you can choose to talk about, just depends on your interests and such. As for time management. My best advice for uni is to look at your syllabus (which is usually given to you prior to the first class so you can look ahead as to what you are expected to do) and write it down. I then transfer it to google calendar or something similar so i can keep track. You can also just have a list with the due dates so you won't miss anything. I didn't start doing this until my second year and it made my life so much easier. My friends think im crazy but I like to start half of the assignment way in advance (either just randomly writing down ideas or writing half) and I don't look at it again until it is a week or two before the due date and I finish it. This way i can feel confident that I have started something and if you do feel lazy or something comes up you have time to procastinate/catch up. But that is just how I work because of my busy schedule. The biggest thing for uni is how limited each semester is. I feel like after midterms everything is so chaotic that next think I know it is finals week and im exhausted. As for moving out, I would join a group (theres facebook groups you can join) where people post room for rent or places for rent. I think also connections once you have move out is where you find places to live at. I personally think living on campus is the easiest way to make friends especially in a new city. This way you can make connections and easily access your classes and such. You can always move out after a year on campus but at least you have established something. We can talk about finance, budgeting, school work and work... Literally anything you have questions in. HAPPY HALLOWEEN btw.. Mentor 2022-11-10, 20:35: Hii, how's it going? how's school? I'm sure you're busy with classes. I have a week break this week and it's so nice to just relax. anyways, I was wondering what conversations you want to start with. I can open it once you have decided what we should talk about. Mentee 2022-11-12, 10:48: Hey Sorry for taking so long to reply. I've been aggressively busy trying to work through scholarship and bursary stuff and kind of forgot this existed. I assume the conversation topic stuff is the circle thingy at the top so maybe we could start with the strategic studying one? To answer your question from before, I'm currently taking the career life connections course, English 12 and French, I'm not entirely sure why they put me into that considering I haven't taken a French class since like 8th grade but whatever. And next semester I'm hoping to drop photography and possibly my law class, I haven't decided yet on if I actually wanna attempt that or not. Do you have anything planned for your break? Mentor 2022-11-15, 21:04: Hi It's all good. I know school can be a lot. I will open up strategic studying so we can continue our convo there. Oh that is weird that they put you in a french class if you have not taken any classes prior to it. Anyways, were you planning to go into arts for your undergrad or something else, because if you take any courses under the faculty of arts you would need a language and it will be beneficial to finish it because you can skip the language requirement if you have taken French 12 in high school. If you want an easy course maybe keep photography because law is a lot of to handle if you are already swamped with assignments right now. Ya I also feel you, the semester is ending in the first week of december and I have exams and assignments due every week and it is a lot. I just handed in a major paper due half my grade and that was stressful but im glad i finished. I have one midterm on thurs before the final and im a little nervous for that class because the final is on everything. But im happy with the results of my grades for my other class. My break was so good. I went to Victoria for a couple days with my partner and that was super fun because I have not been since Gr.8. We were stuck in a blizzard on the first day which was scary but we were stupid and still went to go see what downtown victoria has to offer.",,,,,

My name is Brookelyn and I just finished a biology and psychology degree at UBCO in Kelowna. I grew up on a farm in a small town and one day would love to be a doctor. I see you love nature and biology, especially because of your parents. That's so cool! I'd love to hear more about that :) Mentee 2022-11-15, 14:26: Hi Brookelyn, I'm so excited to be mentored and learn from you! I am from a small town as well and would love to move somewhere bigger, I'm sure you probably experienced lots of change moving from farm in your small town to Kelowna was a big adjustment.

I have unlocked the ""Strategic Studying"" tab - I believe we are now messaging within that activity. I hope you had a chance to watch the YouTube video, I found it quite useful. I think it went over very relevant techniques for studying however, in the end it is ultimately up to you to decide what works best for yourself. I personally prepared well for tests using practice tests and recalling what I already knew so that I could focus my time better on things I didn't know. Have you used any of these techniques before? Which one(s) do you think would work best for you? Feel free to send any questions that you may have for me! Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2022-12-15, 10:28: Hi Mckenna, Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking The stratagy that seems most useful for me to use to study is taking breaks throughout my studying peirod and switching subjects or tasks up; unless i am on a roll. this makes sence to me as brain stops working with me if I work and study for to long. The school does this by switching subjects and the block rotation. This is my question for you. What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? -Jaeana Mentor 2022-12-15, 12:57: Hi Jaeana, I hope are enjoying your week! Taking breaks is really useful, I completely agree. What do you usually do on your breaks? I like going outside for walks or having snack breaks (I love snacking!). That's great to hear that you have already figured out some techniques that work well. To study and prepare for exams I usually find success in summarizing my notes and using the more condensed recap to study. This makes it less overwhleming and gives me a chance to review material from throughout the entire term. I also like using cue cards to memorize and test myself if the subject allows (that doesn't work well for topics such as math, unless you are memorizing formulas). If you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Otherwise, if you agree, I think we can move onto the next topic. What topic would you like to do next? Your mentor, McKenna",,"Mentor 2022-10-22, 18:24: Hi Jaeana, It's great to (virtually) meet you! I'm very excited to be your mentor and I hope I can share some of my post-secondary experiences with you. It is awesome that your class gets to participate in a program like this. It would have been really good if I had something like this when I was in high school because it is really helpful to bounce your questions off someone who isn't judging you. You will be my first mentee (I am new to this program as well) so hopefully we will both be learning lots from each other. I see that you are interested in forestry! That's so cool! Do you have any family or friends in the industry? I can't wait to learn more about why you are interested (it definetly seems like a very exciting career path). I saw in your profile that you enjoy lots of adventurous activities! Where is your favourite place to snowboard? My family just got a sea-doo this summer, they are so much fun! To get to know each other, I was thinking we could do 2 Truths and a Lie. Basically I will share 2 facts about myself and 1 thing that is a lie and you will have to guess which one is a lie. Then you will share 2 facts (and 1 lie) about yourself and I will guess the lie. Here are mine: 1. I spent a year travelling Australia after finishing high school. 2. I have never broken any bones. 3. I have a pet dog named Brooklyn. Can't wait to chat with you :) Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2022-11-01, 09:40: Hey Mckenna! Its your favourite mentee, Jaeana*dramatic wave*.Its my pleasure to meet you visually, as you know I'm Jaeana and since its a strange name its pronounced Jay-Anna. I am extremely excited to have a knowledgable person to ask all my questions to and trust me I have alot. I am well known for asking stupid questions. I learn by asking questions and regurgitating information. Heads up spelling and grammer is not my strong suit but for some reason I love english and get good grades in it. Math for sure is the death of me, it makes me want to cry. Science is interesting to me but its very fast paced which is funny because I'm going into forestry which is heavily science based. I love the idea of being in the bush and being surrounded by nature, its calming. I will actually be doing my final career project (capstone) on the affects of nature enviroment on the human brain. I don't have any family in the forestry industry but it just seems to make sense for me to follow that career path. I love working outdoors which was confirmed by my flagging job during the summer, altough some bears got a little to close for my comfort. I am very adventorus which ties in with my interest for forestry. I like to snowboard but I havent done that for a couple of years now. Its just so expensive to drive to the hill and rent all the equitment. The only place I have ever snowboarded was at the Troll ski resort. I think your lie is number 3. ""I have a pet dog named Brooklyn"". Which is my two truths and a lie!? 1. I am Portuguese 2. I can control my anxiety 3. My friend gives me the rest of her French vanilla almost every morning. Your Mentee, Jaeana Mentor 2022-11-01, 15:03: Hello favourite mentee! It's great to finally hear from you! Thanks for letting me know how to say your name. I'm terrible at butchering names so I'm glad I know now :) Trust me: I don't believe any questions are stupid questions - I ask so many odd questions, especially to my friends and family, yet I generally learn something from their response (even if they make fun of me first). Also, don't worry about spelling, I'm usually pretty good at interpreting mispelled words (perks of texting/messaging people). Your capstone project sounds so cool! Will that be due in the spring? Hopefully I will get to hear more about it throughout our discussions. Ahhh bears are always a bit scary especially if they are close! Where were you doing field work? I was once working in Sudbury and there was a momma bear and her 2 cubs like 200 meters away from us in the field: definetly a bit terrifying despite it being super cool! My lie is NOT number 3 (I've attached a few photos of Brooklyn below as proof - she is a golden doodle). My lie is actually number 1 - I have never even been to Australia though it seems like a really interesting place to explore! I'm going to guess that your lie is number 1. I hope numbers 2 and 3 are true! If number 3 is true, you've got a really sweet friend! Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2022-11-15, 09:08: Glad to hear were on the same page and similar people. My capstone is due in January near the end of the month. If you mean my summer job by feild work i was a flagger, so i was basically on the side of a highway or a road stopping traffic. Making all the drivers mad and keeping my crew safe. Also the picture of your dog is not showing up, sadly; I love dogs.So my lie is number 2 lol and yeah my friend is pretty sweet. Your mentee, Jaeana Dumais Mentor 2022-11-15, 12:39: Hello Jaeana! Hope things are going well! November seems to be flying by!!! Ah sounds like a somewhat stressful job, but it was probably a great experience :) If you are ready, I think we can move onto the next topic! I'm not too sure if your teacher has mentioned the next steps, they have given a list of topics that they would like us to discuss: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Let me know which topic you'd like to do next! Your mentor, McKenna Mentee 2022-12-02, 13:27: Sorry I""m a bit late, my bad. I believe strategic studying is somethimg I would love to work on and excel at to help me in my future studing.

I'm in my 5th year at the University of Victoria studying biochemistry so I was excited to see that you're thinking about schools on the Island. I'm (hopefully) in my last year of classes and then I'm going to be applying to med school next fall to be a doctor :) Although school definitely takes up a lot of my time, when I'm not studying or working I love painting, reading and exploring around the island since its such a beautiful place! I saw that you were hoping to learn more about living on your own, staying focused, etc. and I definitely have some experiance with that and I'm more than happy to answer any inital questions you might have or questions that come up at anytime. Enough about me! I hope that you're enjoying your last year of high school, are you feeling excited about graduation/plans after graduation? I remember that some of my favourite classes in high school were in grade 12 so are there any classes that you've been liking (or not liking too haha)? Let me know if you've got any questions right off the bat and if not just tell me a little bit about yourself and what you'd like to get out of the program and then we can start working through the convos! Mentee 2022-11-01, 14:32: Hi Izzy, my name is Claire! I'm very excited to be participating in this program and glad to meet someone who is up on the island. Victoria has been a dream of mine for years, just being there feels more like home. I have alot of questions around keeping organised and keeping on task since I have always struggled with disaplining myself and getting tasks done. I've developled little to no healthy study habbits, I do know that once I get to work I cant accomplish alot its just figuring out how to feel motivated. Mentor 2022-11-02, 20:50: Hey Claire, It's great to hear that you're excited about the island! I absolutely love it here, the location is awesome and even though its a much larger city, it still feels like a super tight-knit community so you never feel that isolated. Both UVIc and Camosun are also great school so regardless of which one you potentially end up at your experiance will be great! I hear you about staying motivated and organized! That's a very common thing to be struggling to do probably because its so unique to each person (which also makes it hard to find an easy answer for)! In my experiance, I've also found that I've had to play around with different methods in order to find what works for me so its definitely some trial and error as well sadly :( If you want we could start with the ""Strategic Studying"" conversation which would look at different studying methods - we can also cover different ways of just staying on task and being motivated in that section as well - let me know what you think! Mentor 2023-01-09, 09:47: Hey Claire! Welcome to 2023 (I still feel like it should 2021 honestly), I hope you had a lovely winter break! Since school is starting back up, I wanted to check back in with you to see if there's any questions you may have about life after highschool or anything that you'd like to go over before the mentoring program fiinishes up. I know that it's a busy time getting back into classes after the break but I wanted to reach out to you to see if there's anything that I can help out with.

1047583343,9/27/2022 9:37,1047585060,56040,"Mentor 2022-11-03, 18:13: Hey Chloe, I'll just kick off this first Conversation with a small discussion on the first Anchor Text to get us going here. I'll just be sharing my thoughts on this topic, so you're free to do the same as you do the first Discussion Questions. Anyways, last semester I took an Indigenous course in SFU and the course emphasized the value of Indigenous practices and ways of knowing. It was an enlightening course so to say, and I realized Indigenous ways of knowing is supposed to mix well with Western ways of knowing. It was concept known as ""Two-Eyed Seeing"" which combines traditional Indigenous ways of knowing with Western ways of knowing. Are you familiar with any Indigenous ways of knowing? Does your school make any attempt to expose you with these kinds of education from Indigenous sources? If so, does it affect your way of thinking or approach when learning new things? If not, do you think it's beneficial to learn such sources? Don't worry about having to answer my questions, it's just food for thought as you do the Anchor Text. Important Notes Apparently we can do the Conversation in any order you want so after this Conversation you have free reign to choose which one you want to do next. If you don't have any in mind, we can just follow the order from before. Also, feel free to take your time; if your going to take longer to finish a discussion just say so that I know you just need more time. 'Till next time. Mentee 2022-11-07, 09:31: Hey how are you doing? Sorry for once again taking a while to reply. Life has been pretty busy recently. Yeah things have been tough since she passed but we're working through it. I'm glad that I have so much family in the same town as me, that definetly makes it easier. I am pretty nervous for post-secondary at the moment because I know it will be more difficult than high school. Also that's so cool that you were in choir! I've never really enjoyed singing much. I used to be part of a swimming group when I was still homeschooling but I haven't really taken on any after school activities while in highschool. I'm glad you're enjoying your vacation! I totally understand how the heat can be bothering though. A few years ago I went to Mexico with my family and one day we were touring the ruins of Tulum and it got to over 40C. It was unbearable. I have actually been hearing of a lot of places that are dealing with power outages right now though. I'm glad that my town isn't having that issue it makes life a lot more difficult lol I completly agree with you, I think my job would have been more bearable if I had scheduled days off. I would often just take on any shifts I could even if it was forfeiting plans I had already made. You have an interesting view of your job it seems. I would never be able to stand a boring job. I always need to be doing different things every day to keep myself entertained at work. I think that's why I enjoy customer service so much because there's always something new. I agree with you about coworkers though, it makes work a lot better when you're working with fun people. That's what I miss about my job, all the people I worked with there were so cool. I have been doing some Japanese lessons with the people that I am going on the trip with but I don't think that will be enough to be useful to me once I am there so I might take up Duolingo or something. Thanks for all the websites I think they will be really helpful to me! And thanks for the song suggestions too I always love exploring new music. Thanks for always being so patient when waiting for my responses lol Mentee 2022-11-15, 09:13: Hey Jericho! I just finished the first anchor text video. I have grown up being taught Christian values which I think can sometimes be related to some of the Indigenous principles. I believe in the value of caring for our land and our community greatly. However, I do not know a lot about Indigenous ways of knowing. With my schooling I haven't often been taught about Indigenous beliefs and people. This is the discussion question I chose to reflect on... • Consider the following quote from Dana Lepofsky: “I think it’s hard for a lot of people in the industrial world to understand the connection between people and place.” How do you think the connection to place differs from a rural environment to an urban environment? I think that in urban environments the focus is less on caring for the land but rather caring for community. My grandparents have always lived on a farm and it was an important place for me growing up. I loved being surronded by nature. Me and my sibling would just explore the property. Sometimes we would prentend like we lived out there, we built a few shelters out of logs, moss and bark. We would even collect berries, special stones, tadpoles and other things. It is a really neat feeling to just be in nature alone. My grandparents had such a large property that it was easy to forget about our town and other people when we were out there. My grandpa specifically instilled a care for nature in me. He would talk to me about his property all the time, the fields, crops and animals. I really loved the time we spent together. Though my family does not have Indigenous roots my grandpa grew up on a reserve in Saskatchewan and he would share stories with me from his past quite often. Do you feel any connection to the land you grew up on? Thanks for being patient with my responses school's been getting a bit hectic Mentor 2022-11-15, 21:46: Hey Chloe, I hope you're doing well! I just got back from the Philippines and the change in weather is quite drastic; going from a really warm place to a colder one is going to take me some time getting used to lol. Anyways, I don't think its uncommon for you to have not been taught about Indigenous beliefs and practices, most of the time high school education on Indigenous peoples focus on the Residential Schools and their colonized history. If you ever decide to take an Indigenous course in post-sec they go way more in-depth about Indigenous peoples and their history. I've never been exposed to a rural environment so hearing your experiences with your grandparents farm was really cool to see. As per my experiences I think it may be harder for me to see a connection between people and place when I'm more engrossed in materialistic things, so I tend to forget a meaningful connection with nature. When I went camping I really enjoyed being outside, so I can see why people can have a strong connection to nature and growing up with forests and wildlife beside you. I suppose it can be the same for Indigenous peoples who has experienced so much of their history and ancestry with nature that they find it a part of themselves and their culture. I guess one way or another I feel some connection to the land I live in, whether that be in a specific house or the environment in general, but I don't find it too meaningful. Although, when I moved to Abbotsford briefly I really missed where I used to live, so my family went back. All my friends were there and I grew up knowing the places that were close to me so, perhaps in this way I also feel some connection to the land I grew up in. You're free to move onto the next anchor text and discussion. Thanks for your replies as always. I hope all goes well at your school. 'Till next time. Mentor 2022-11-25, 22:42: Hey Chloe, I hope you're doing well. If you're taking longer than usual to finish up the next discussion questions it's okay to write something short; as long as you can get your main point(s) across. The sooner we can finish this Conversation, the sooner we can get to the more interesting Conversations (in my opinion). Remember I mentioned ""Two-Eyed Seeing"" earlier, I supposed thats a way of uniting Indigenous and Western ways of knowing together. Anyways, a good way to think about it is what can we learn from Indigenous knowledge that we can also apply to the more scientific/methodical ways of thinking? It can be something as abstract as how Indigenous peoples take care of the land or how they use/make medicine. Indigenous knowledge can be found in objects or oral histories (generational stories passed on from one generation to another). Well that's all I have to say for now. 'Till next time. Mentor 2022-12-01, 17:21: Hey Chloe, Unfortunately, I haven't really encountered any businesses founded by Indigenous peoples or principles, or rather I may have but can't remember at this point. Perhaps, I should try to expose myself to these sorts of businesses but I haven't seen any that has caught my attention. At most the only thing I can say that may resemble something like this is when SFU hosts something Indigenous related and they manage to get Indigenous vendors to sell their own arts and crafts. I didn't buy anything, but it's nice that SFU mananges to put a spotlight on Indigenous peoples and their crafts. Don't worry about taking too long, you can take your time. Also, we're free to move on to the next Conversation and you have the choice to pick the next one. Hope you're doing well in school. 'Till next time. Mentor 2022-12-01, 17:22:  Mentee 2022-12-01, 21:23: Hello again! I was hoping we would be able to do the Funding Your Future topic next. I'm not sure how to move on to the next conversation so I'm just sending this now and maybe we'll be able to start the next portion tomorrow. Also, I just got a new job at a restaurant here in my town and I had my first shift tonight which was really exciting! But getting back to work again will mean I have a bit less free time after school so I'm hoping to try and work on our conversations while I'm at school from now on. Have a great night! Talk to you later.",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-12-02, 19:29: Hey Chloe, I just opened up the Funding Your Future Conversation. Feel free to start on Anchor Text 1. Also, congrats on your new job! How was your first shift and what kind of food does your restaurant serve? Do you have a favourite food? I love ramen so I tend to go to Japanese restaurants more often. Hope all goes well. 'Till next time. Mentor 2022-12-06, 20:57: Hey Chloe, I'm doing well - I just applied for my next semester in SFU. I'll be starting early January, and the courses I took were: Japanese 100, Intro to Global Asia, and Directed Studies in Histories. As you can see I'm quite interested into Asian culture lol, in fact I think I'll focus my research in my directed studes towards East Asian history. It's nice that your career's class is making you apply to scholarships! My career's class never really focused on that, or maybe they did but I wasn't paying enough attention lol. I don't have any experience with scholarships unfortunately, my mom had some money saved up to cover 2 semesters worth of tuition and after that I applied for student loans. Though I am looking at some of the scholarships being offered in SFU right now; fortunately I'm eligible for some of them. It seems that for most of the requirements being offered in SFU you need to have a minimum CGPA of 3.5 and you have to be full-time. On the other hand the thing with student loans is that, at least in my case, they give me a grant on top of the loan that's used to pay off my tuition. I don't know too much about how this works, or wether or not you could be in the same case as me for this kind of a student loan - that is if you ever find yourself applying for a student loan. While I'm working I've been trying to save up and stay at a budget so that I have some money to repay some of my student loans. As for that grant I mentioned earlier, I actually just save up all of that money to repay my student loan while I use my work money for other stuff. My experience in applying for post-sec was very narrow, what I mean by that is I only applied to SFU. I didn't even bother looking at any other post-sec, I just thought I'd get in for some reason. Anyways, what I want to say is that don't try to be like me and only apply to one post-sec lol, well from the looks of it you don't seem to be in a similar path as me back then. The reason why I was so committed to SFU was because I kind of already planned and knew what courses I would take there so I found myself easily committing to it. I was inflexible in trying to look at other post-secs because of this. Anyways, something to think about on deciding where you want to go should be based on the variety of courses being offered, because at the very least you have a wider selection of courses to choose from rather than a limited one. And besides courses you should take for pre-requisites, literally just take any course that sounds interesting - take risks and explore other courses which could end up being something you like. Thing with post-sec is that you should also explore what other things you may take an interest in. I do not think that post-sec is worth if you have no real idea whatsoever of what you want to do. If you're really lost and can't think of anything, I think it's better to work and find things that may interest you. However if you have like a general idea, say like you want to go to post-sec because you like programming but you don't know what career to go for with programming, I think that's fine and it's worth to go into post-sec for it. You just need to find something in general you can take an interest in, it's not so much about the career but rather what it entails. I like history, but there's more to it than going into teaching, and the fact that there's more to it means that you have more choices to pursuit when being a teacher doesn't work out. Well, I think I got a bit carried away, but that's all I have to say for now. Sorry if I went on for too long lol. I hope you're doing well. 'Till next time.","Mentor 2022-10-21, 13:47: Hey Chloe! My name is Jericho and I'll be your mentor for the program. I hope we get to know each other well during our time. If you haven't already read my profile (yea I know it's kinda long lol, i didn't know how much to write when i was signing up for this), I'll give you a quick - and short - introduction about myself: I am second-year student in the Simon Fraser University in the Faculty of Arts, and I am majoring in History. I noticed that you want to be a high school teacher, I do too - more specifically a history teacher. Why did you want to become a high school teacher? Do you have any particular interest in a specific subject to teach in (for ex. math, english, etc.)? For me, I've always done well in Social Studies during high school and I liked learning about history so I thought I may as well do something I'm good at (which is mainly writing essays in History). And so I thought that a being teacher would suit me well because I want to share what I learn. As a side note, don't hesistate to ask me any questions about becoming a teacher. I also saw that you're going to take a gap year; I did the same too! Mine only lasted for about a year but during that time I worked at a local dollar store to save up money. It was my first job so earning money was nice, especially so when I finally bought my own computer. What kind of jobs do you want to pursue during your gap year(s)? Also, if you need any help creating a resume, feel free to ask me for help. Some Important Notes Apparently we're supposed to do these Conversations: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity – Adulting 101: students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap: students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them. We have until January 20th to complete the program. We'll be following the order in which the Conversations are listed from top to bottom. After we finish these we're free to do the other Conversations if you'd like Be sure to do the checklist just above. Finally, I'll be going on vacation to the Philippines in a couple days. As such, when I arrive there the differing time zones may hinder my ability to answer to you in time. I'll be on vacation from Oct. 23 to Nov. 14. I may not be able to answer your messages in time when I leave on Oct. 23 and when I come back on Nov. 14. Sorry about that, but I'll be sure to try my best in answering you in time. Alright, I don't want to bore you any longer with a wall of text so I'll leave it off here. I look forward to hearing from you, and when were done with introductions we can move on to the next Conversation. Mentee 2022-10-25, 19:47: Hey Jericho :) Its really nice to hear from you. Sorry I took so long to respond I find that I don't check my school email often enough. I guess I should give you a short introduction to myself. I checked out your profile and you had a lot written I didn't realize we were supposed to write that much so I guess my profile is pretty lacking lol Right now I'm finishing my last year of school. Being in public school is still really strange for me since I was homeschooled most of my life. I am very outgoing though and I enjoy being around people. Some things I'm really passionate about are music, makeup, cooking and art. I'm not really sure how much of an intro I should give so I'll just move on to your questions. I think the reason I want to become a teacher is because of my mom. She went to the College of the Rockies and got a Bachelor of Ed and had a great career as a teacher. I really admired her and found her job quite interesting. I don't have any specific subjects narrowed down yet that I would want to teach but I find Psychology and Art really interesting so I would potentially pursue one of those areas further to become a teacher in them. It was really cool to read about your experience with taking gap years. Recently I have begun to realize that I will just want to take a break from school after graduation and give myself a chance to mature and really think about the careers I'm interested in before jumping back into school. I have had a bit of experience with work already though. I worked at Booster Juice for about a year and a half before I quit recently because of some personal issues. I will be taking a break from work until I finish high school but I do have quite a bit of money saved up already. During my gap year I think I will pursue a job in waitressing or working with food in any way because I enjoy serving people. Also side note, what kind of music do you enjoy? I spend a lot of my time listening to music because it helps me focus. My favourite artist currently is Tame Impala. I hope to hear from you soon but no worries at all if you aren't able to. Have a great vacation! I love travelling and I'll actually be going to Japan next summer which I am very excited for so you'll have to share some of your travelling tips with me lol Mentor 2022-10-28, 17:45: Hey Choe, I hope you're doing well, and I hope that the weather there in Canada is better than the Philippines right now - it just rains A LOT here. I was quite surprised to see that you were homeschooled, it's my first time hearing someone that was homeschooled - if you don't mind me asking as I'm curious - how was your experience transitioning to public school? It's really cool that you're mom is a teacher, I'm sure you can ask her for a ton of support in how to proceed in becoming a teacher. I have a couple friends who also plan to become a high school teacher specializing in Psychology and Arts. It's nice to hear about your gap year, unlike you I didn't work while I was in high school so you're already a step ahead lol. Well, in general you're already quite prepared if you've worked, and saved up, so much already. How did you manage in balancing a work-school schedule? Working while in uni isn't that bad actually, depending on what courses and university you take it can be quite flexible to work and study at the same time - like what I was doing last semester while I was working at an Old Navy store. Right now I think I'm liking listening to a sort of hip-hop/lofi rap songs; a more specific artist that I have been loving listening to right now is Nujabes. Also, I have listened to Tame Impala's songs before, two only though to be exact, they are ""The Less I Know the Better"" (i also like the mashup of this song and ""Sexyback"" by Justin Timberlake, i think it sounds quite nice together lol you should give it a listen) and ""Borderline."" ALSO, I'm so jealous that you're going to Japan! I'm actually trying to learn Japanese right now. And, a quick travelling tip is be sure to have something to kill time with, idk about you but it's so easy to get bored waiting for the plane and being in the plane itself so I made sure I had some music and some things to read and watch beforehand downloaded on my phone. Be careful of motion sickness during the plane ride so I would suggest that you search up on the internet how to avoid it. If you've already done the checklist above, we can move on to the next conversation when you're ready. We'll be proceeding with Different Ways of Knowing first. I look forward to our next conversation. Mentee 2022-11-01, 09:10: Hey! How have you been doing? I've been doing ok. It has been snowing a bit here which is exciting. I hope your trip is going well. Transferring from homeschooling to high school was a bit scary but I had a few friends here that it made it easier. The schoolwork at my highschool is way easier than the stuff I did while homeschooling. Since my mom was such a great teacher she made sure me and my sibling had the best curriculum and did lots of work lol It would be really nice to be able to have my mom's advice and input on becoming a teacher since I know she would be very helpful with all that stuff but she passed away recently so I'm having to reach out to others for help. I think that working while in high school has helped me prepare more for honsetly any career I pursue since I have that experience now. Balancing between work and school wasn't hard for me because I wouldn't often have homework but one thing I found tough was balancing work and personal time. I found myself struggling with my mental health when I had to go straight to work after school and not having that time to relax and spend time with family. That is one of the main reasons I quit and right now I'm just taking a break from work. What were some things you enjoyed from working at Old Navy? I haven't considered applying for any retail jobs because I kind of just assume that they would be sort of boring. I definetly prefer working in the food industry. I listened to a few of Nujabes songs recently after reading your message and I really like them! To me they kind of remind me of another artist I like called Mag.Lo, specifically one of his songs ""Never"". That's so cool that you have listened to Tame Impala before! I think I've heard that remix before too, it is nice. ""Borderline"" is probably the song that got me to listen to more of their songs. My current favourite's of his are ""The Boat I Row"" and ""Feels Like We Only Go Backwards"". I'm so excited to go to Japan but I am definetly struggling to learn the language right now. It's hard to learn a whole new alphabet. During school I've only really looked into learning French so Japanese is quite different. I do often struggle with motion sickness even just when driving but I still really like flying lol so hopefully I'll be ok. Yeah I think music will be what keeps me going when on the flights because they are going to be a lot longer than I am used to. Also, I'm ready to move onto the conversation checklist whenever. Thanks again for writing and I hope to hear from you soon :) Mentor 2022-11-01, 19:12: Hey Chloe! I'm very sorry to hear about your mom, I can't imagine what you went though during that time. I'm sure you got a lot of support from your friends and family. Your mom must have been a great teacher if you found the work in highschool to be pretty easy! I for one struggled in math lol. I hope you make lots of fun memories while in school, although I pretty much disliked high school and its work, I can say for sure that I can look back fondly while I was still in school. Plus, you're gonna wish for high school work when your in post-secondary - the homework can be pretty daunting sometimes in post-sec! But anyhow, I have a feeling you're going to be able to pull through quite well when you get into post-sec. By the way, are you in any after-school activities or clubs? I was in a choir for all of my high school years. I've been doing okay here in the Philippines, it's quite hot so it can get quite uncomfortable sometimes. A couple days ago it rained so much that I was without electricity and wifi. Those couple days felt like an eternity lol. It can be pretty hard sometimes to squeeze in personal time with work and school, I have the same problem at times. It gets pretty bad during midterms and finals to the point where I basically only eat and do work in a day. I find that the best way to get in some personal time when you have work is to set some off-days from work or to literally schedule a day where you can for sure it'll be only for mental health day or a break. My work at Old Navy is pretty monotonous, it's folding clothes and putting them away 85% percent of the time. I'm pretty indifferent towards it, while I don't enjoy it, I don't mind it either - to me it's a good way to kill time and ofc earn money. But I guess the one thing I can say that enjoy is my co-workers, they're all pretty easy to talk to and they're all really nice. I actually wouldn't want to work in the food industry, I dislike just having to handle food and I guess the work environment isn't for me. I'm glad you listened to Nujabes! My favourite song from him is ""Lady Brown,"" I think it's gotta be favourite song of all time ngl. I can see why Mag.Lo reminds you of Nujabes, I think they give off a similar vibe and rhythm. I also recommend listening to CYNE, he's the one who did the vocals for ""Lady Brown."" Some of my favourite songs from him are ""Paradise"" and ""Pretty Apollo."" It seems like you're also learning Japanese, are you learning it by yourself? I am teaching it to myself too currently, I've basically memorized the Hiragana and Katakana alphabet at this point (I'm learning very basic grammar right now). My advice is to just keep practicing writing it and doing quizzes for memorization. I'll link some resources that I used that helped with learning Hiragana and Katakana. https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/ https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana-book-pdf/ https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana-book-pdf/ The first link is a quiz on Hiragana and Katakana; just keep doing this quiz and you should be able to memorize it within a week or so. The last two should help you memorize it better and shows you how to write them properly. Alright I'll open up the next conversation and you can proceed with it when you're ready. Thanks to you too for being so engaging and making our conversation such a pleasant one! 'Till next time. Mentor 2022-11-09, 04:45: Hey Chloe, I've been doing well, thanks for asking - I hope you're the same. Recently my family just celebrated our grandparents 67th anniversary. We went to a resort and I got to swim and spend time with my cousins. I had quite a fun time. I'll be coming back soon to Canada on the 14th. So just heads up that I may be unable to respond to your messages during that day. About postsecondary work; don't stress too much about it. Take it in your own pace and don't be afraid to take the lesser average amount of courses if it means you'll be able to do better with fewer courses. The average amount of courses taken in SFU is usually 4 or 5 courses. However, I'm only taking 3 at a time. I actually do better with 3 courses and it gives me more free time to work, relax, or study. And never be afraid to ask for help, there are a lot of resources in postsecondary intended to help you. For the Different Ways of Knowing Conversation, be sure to do the checklist and only do Anchor Text 1 (then we move to Anchor Text 2). There's no rush, so take your time and don't hesitate to ask anything about the Conversations. If you're going to take a little longer to finish or you need more time, just shoot a message so that I'll know where you're at. Thanks for reading as always! 'Till next time. Mentee 2022-12-01, 11:37: Hey Jericho, sorry once again for taking such a long time to respond. I just finished the second anchor text video. I found it quite interesting. I think that through this TedTalk Jeff was trying to spread awareness of the accomplishments and values of Indigenous people. I found it quite inspiring. I really liked what he said about how if the human race died out that plant and animal life would still thrive without us and probably even improve. To me this makes me think more about the principal of leaving things untouched. I believe that it is important to try and not leave a trace when you're out in nature. Perserving parks and other natural areas is incredibly important. I think he's also trying to challenge the idea that Indigenous people aren't creators or entrepreneurs when they truly created a foundation for westren culture to build off. I agree with what you mentioned about uniting Indigenous and Western ways of knowing. Western people should try to value the land that we are building off of more. Have you had the opportunity to encounter any businesses founded by Indigenous peoples or principles where you live? In my town we have something called the Friendship Centre which is actually pretty close to my house which is neat. They host pow wows, meetings and they even provide breakfasts for people. I believe it is really cool that my town provides such a resource for the Indigenous people in our community. Anyways thank you for continuing to message me and I hope you aren't too frustrated with my slow responses lol I hope you're doing really well! Talk to you soon :) Mentee 2022-12-06, 08:53: Hey! How are you doing? My first couple shifts were good. The waitresses are pretty friendly but the kitchen staff is a bit scary. The restaurant I am working at serves greek food. I haven't tried many of their menu items yet but I know their fries and their baklava is really good. My favourite restaurant food is probably just plain fries lol so I guess I'm at a good spot. I just finished the first Anchor Text. I've actually already been looking into different scholarships with my careers class. I've written a couple sample essays and letters but I haven't applied yet since I don't think we have to submit them until April 13. I'm not too worried about getting scholarships since my parents have a couple grand set aside for my school and my dad is giving me and my sibling a large portion of my mom's life insurance as well once we are old enough. Another way I'll be financing my post-secondary is with the money I'm making at my job. The only thing I'm having an issue with right now is deciding WHERE I actually want to apply and what kind of courses I should take. Do you believe that post-secondary is actually worth it if you don't have a real idea of what you want to do? Thanks for being patient with me. Talk to you soon!",,,,,
1047499279,11/12/2019 0:33,1047585059,56039,,,"Mentor 2022-11-21, 21:10: The module called ""Well-Being and Self-Care"" has now been opened. Please complete the extension Activity first and then we can move onto completing the actual conversation. As you work through the Extension activity feel free to send me any questions or topics of discussion if you have any so we can work through this together. Most importantly, have fun with it! Mentee 2022-12-06, 22:50: Some 'warning signs' that I might be in need of some self care is when I start to procastinate, have low energy, and start to feel overwhelmed. Some actions or activities that I enjoy that lifts my mood and brings me joy are reading, cooking and baking, spending time with my family and friends, and learning new things. I feel like adult life and post-secondary life are pretty different than highschool life, you now have more responsibilities and more things expected from you, so how have you navigated managing your mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? And what mental health challenges should I be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can I do to overcome them? Some changes I can make to my life right now that will allow me to take better care of myself is drinking more water, I sometimes go like a whole day without any water which I know is not good, as of right now I am trying to bring a water bottle with me everywhere I go and keep it in my sight to help me remember to drink water, and so far it has been working and drinking more water as helped me feel less tired and just more healthy. Another change I can make is going to the gym, I have actually started going with my mom because she used to be a personal trainer when she was younger so she knows a lot about fitness, my mom and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and I feel like having a gym partner helps keep me motivated to go. Another change I can make is making time for the things I enjoy, I am going to try to not fall behind in my school work, and also make the time so I can actually have the time to do the things I enjoy. How has the way you approach self-care changed now that you are an adult? And do you have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? Also, what did you found surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? Some skills I feel confident about are grocery shopping, cooking myself meals, and house keeping/cleaning, because I know how to do those things because I already do them around the house. But with finding a doctor, dentist, etc., making appointments, paying bills, and finding somewhere to live you can't really prepare for those things and just do it when the time comes. Do you have any advice when it comes down to things you can't really prepare for? Mentor 2022-12-07, 16:58: Wow, great work! I really enjoyd reading your response. I share some similar warning signs which tell me that I need to start working on treating myself some more. When I begin to procrastinate, have low energy or start to feel too overwhelmed with tasks I also enjoy doing some relaxing activities to allow my brain to rest. I like to take ""brain breaks"" between really intense study sessions and also enjoy reading as well to put my mind elsewhere. I also like spending time with my family and friends as well during moments or stress or procrastination. You are correct, adult life and post-secondary life are quite different compared to your highschool years as there are a lot more responsibilties for you to do and have. And with this in mind, I will answer your question since maintaining and managing your mental health is always the first priority over anything else. For my mental health, as mentioned above, when I encounter moments of lots of stress, feeling overwhelmed or feeling really bored I try to keep myself busy by either doing relaxing activities during my brain/ study breaks so this could be going for a walk or hanging out/talking to my friends and family or I just exercise in general. In the new year I am planning on joining some spin classes as I have heard many great things about this activity. I also try not to put too much pressure on myself as well, and I space out my tasks by using a planner/agenda and calendar. I have found that planning out my tasks and essentially my life have helped with my mental health quite a bit. Some mental health challenges that you will most likely encounter during your time in post-secondary and during adulthood will most likely be related to academic stress (managing coursework, test prep, juggling life and school balance). You may experience moments of anger or have test anxiety but the good thing to remember is that you are not alone. There are resources and people (clubs, mental health services, professionals and of course your family and friends) who can help you overcome the challenges and help you find coping strategies. Mentor 2022-12-07, 17:07: I really admire how you have taken the time to reflect on your life and to really dissect parts of your life you think need improvement. Identifying the areas where you can improve your health, self care and well-being are important. I completely agree with you that drinking more water helps with staying healthy but also helps mentally. Especially when it comes to studying for tests and it also gives you more energy, essentially waking your body up. Going to the gym with your mom is a great idea and hobby! Again, you are really starting to hit all the important factors (exercise, diet, water intake, etc...) which help with keeping your mind and body healthy. Great work and ideas!! I completely agree, having someone else with you helps with motivation for sure, I also either go with a friend or my mom and/or sisters because not only are they there for motivation but also to keep me company. Also, I think you make a really good point of making time for yourself and the things you like to enjoy. Life isn't all about school and work, its important to carve out time for yourself which again helps with your mental health. What are some activities or other things you would like to make time for? How do you plan on making time for the things you enjoy as well as keeping up with school, work, etc.? Mentor 2022-12-07, 17:22: I will continue with answering your last couple of questions: When I was younger, I didn't really think about my self-care if that makes sense. I feel like as I grew up it became more of a priority and I think this was mainly due to the idea that I was transitioning from the childhood or adulthood part of life. That is a tricky question to answer, but I will try my best. I think some good tips that I can suggest which help with breaking bad habits would include: avoiding tempting situations, preparing mentally, enlisting support and to reward yourself for making small steps/changes. What I found surprising about transitioning to adulthood was how much of what others said, what I would hear others say about how adulthood is harder and there are more things to do compared to childhood, was actually true haha. When we are young, we never really think about adulthood and the various responsibilities that come with it. Transitioning to adulthood is a stepping stone, but having the right support system and people along the way really makes facing the challenges and transitioning to adulthood way easier. I am happy to hear you feel very confident about your skills! You are already showing so much responsibility, that is awesome! I agre with you on the things you feel confident in doing. If you have experience doing those things, it definitely is easier. Hmmm when it comes to doing things you can't really prepare for I would suggest first of all, taking things slowly. Secondly, to be confident in how you do it and thirdly, just know that there is help along the way. Whether the help comes from asking your family and friends about how to find a doctor or how to make an appointment to visiting your bank and talking with a financial advisor, I feel that there is always some guidance and I would definitely take advantage in using it when you can. I struggled with making appointments but with practice and time and after getting support from my mom, I now make appointments myself. Family connections can really help with finding medical doctors and dentists as well. If you have a relative that suggests their dentist to you after you have asked, there is no harm in visiting that dentist and evaluating the experience yourself. Mentor 2022-12-07, 17:27: Great work for this module!! Please answer any questions that I have asked and if you have anymore questions please feel free to ask away. Also, I just wanted to make sure if you were able to navigate the wheel correctly? In the Well-being and self-care module did you complete the warm-up reflection questions as well as both anchor texts and the questions/links/videos in each of them? If so, please remember to complete the checklist at the bottom of the module and to complete the survey. Once all parts have been completed and you are feeling ready, only then can we move onto the next conversation :) Mentor 2022-12-07, 17:28: I know I have sent a lot of messages, but please have a read through them all very carefully and make sure you are comfortable with all the parts in this conversation. If you have any questions about the material, please ask!! Mentor 2022-12-28, 11:56: Hi Carsen, Happy Holidays! I received a notification that you completed the survey for the Well Being and Self Care conversation, which is great. Now that you have done that, which conversation would you like to start next?",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-21, 18:18: Hi Carsen, My name is Zaraah and I look forward to mentoring you! After reading through your profile, it seems that you are interested in pursuing a career also in the medical field, which is awesome. A little bit about myself, I have recently graduated from UBC with a degree in Applied Biology. At the moment, I am currently working at two clinics. I enjoy hiking, swimming and playing soccer from time to time. I love playing video/board games with my family as well. I also enjoy having time to myself, but most days I am with friends or family. I also like to travel and hope to visit more places in the near future! Do you enjoy travelling? What is your favourite vacation destination? We both seem to have one hobby in common, baking! Do you have any other interests? I like how you already have an idea of what you want to study once you are in post-secondary school and where you would want to study. Have you started your school applications yet? Lastly, I'd like to mention that I am happy to answer any questions that you may have, so please do not hesitate to ask. I hope to hear back from you soon and here's to a fun mentoring experience! I look forward to reading your introduction. Mentee 2022-11-05, 14:10: Hi Zaraah, I love your name by the way, I'm also looking forward to doing program. I do enjoy travelling! I just got my N in September so I am hoping I can do a road trip this spring break, maybe down to the island because it is so beautiful there. I also just got back from Las Vegas with my family which was really fun, we saw a lot of shows, my favourite was the Michael Jackson show put on by Cirque du Soleil, we also did a helicopter ride above the Las Vegas strip which was very cool to see. I haven't been to a lot of places, mostly just places in Canada and the States, but my favourite place I have been to is Hawaii, I haven't been there in a long time but has to be my favourite vacation destination because it's Hawaii, it's so beautiful and I love the beach and the ocean, and the Luaus are so fun. I really want to go to Europe and Asia especially England, Germany, China, South Korea, and Japan. Are there any places you want to travel to in the future? I also enjoy hiking, going on walks and playing video games and board games with my family, my favourite video game right now would have to be Minecraft. I also enjoy learning new things, especially things I find interesting, right now I am really fascinated with the human body, I have Anatomy and Physiology next term and I am really excited. How did you like learing about Applied Biology? I really enjoyed Life Sciences when I had it last year. I haven't started applying yet because I keep changing my mind of what I want to do, I don't know if I want to go to Universiry and get a degree or go to Collage and get a diploma, if I do go to University I would probably get a degree in Biology, and if I go to Collage I would probably do the Diagnostic Medical Sonography Diploma, but I don't know yet, I might take a year off and do some courses I am interested in at the collage. If you have any advice I would love to hear it! Mentor 2022-11-05, 18:31: Thank you for the compliment! A road trip to the island sound really fun. I've been to most places on the island except for Tofino (which I have heard is a great spot to visit)! I have also wanted to visit Las Vegas as well, I have heard and from what you have described there are many fun things to do. I agree with you about Hawaii, I went there a few years ago and plan on going back very soon because it is such a great vacay spot. I also think the beaches and the ocean are very beautiful. I'd much rather be in the hot weather right now versus this rainy/windy weather we are experiencing. Thanks for the question, I also really want to visit England in the future as well as tour around all of Greece and Italy. What would you say is your favorite board game? Mine would have to be Monopoly or Clue. I also enjoy learning about the human body (that is mainly why I chose my degree haha). I have a feeling you will definitely enjoy your Anatomy and Physiology courses too. Applied Biology was good, it's basically like biology but applied haha so more related to animals and humans and like specific diseases for example while also learning about general topics/subjects such as chemistry, physics, and biology. Not having a set goal and changing your mind about what you want to do is completely normal! I was the same way when I started applying to university and I feel like it is a great way to try different courses and to see what really sparks your interest. University or college are both good choices. The experiences you make at either institute or it could be both are what matter and make you who you are. Taking a year off to figure out what you want to do and trying courses out is a good idea. Just know that there is no deadline for when you have to complete your degree or your diploma. This is what I like to think. The medical sonography diploma is very interesting, I was actually thinking of applying to it as well back when I started my applications. In general, my advice would be to take things slowly, try new courses and to not rush. Enjoy every moment of your educational journey because all of these different changes and experiences help to make you who you are and unique from everyone else. If you have any specific questions or advice you would like to hear, please feel free to ask. Also, I was wondering if you had time to read through and complete the ""start here"" conversation and checklist yet? If so, please let me know so we can move onto starting the program when you are ready since I understand that you are being graded for completing this program, so I want to help you successfully complete it. And if you happen to run into any issues or fall behind, please let me know and we can work around it together. If I am unable to help you with specific problems (i.e., technical issues) then the e-mentoring staff will be able to help and their contact info is above. Mentee 2022-11-16, 12:32: My favourate board game would have to Clue too, I also really enjoy Sorry and Trouble and card games, like Uno, Cards Against Humanity, and Poker. Whenever my family goes to our cabin we have a big game of Poker or Rummoli with my auntie, uncles and my cousin and it's really fun. Also thak you so much for the advice, I am thinking of taking university math and science courses at the collage here, so if I do decide to go to university I will hopefully already have some of the courses I need and don't have to start right from the begining, and also for the medical sonography diploma they like you to have some university courses, so if I do decide I still want to do that I have a higher chance of getting in. Yes, I have read through and complete the ""start here"" conversation and checklist so we can move onto starting the program, also sorry it has taken me so long to respond, we are doing this with my Careers class and we haven't done this in like two weeks but we can start the program now :) Mentor 2022-11-16, 13:56: Those are some fun board and card games you have mentioned. I am also a fan of Uno as well and Cards Against Humanity, but when it comes to Poker I'm not that great at it haha. As for the advice, no problem! That is what I am here for, to help you and offer any advice that I can. The plan that you have sounds like a good idea, always being prepared for either college or university is good. I like that you have looked into the requirements for the medical sonography diploma as well, thats very proactive and is a great way to plan. Great! So since you have read through and completed the ""Start Here"" conversation and checklist, lets start the program! Also, thank you for telling me about the delay in your response its totally understandable :) Which conversation would you like to start working on first? These are the following ones you have to choose from that your teacher would like you to complete: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self Care Post-Secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity- Adulting 101 Extension Activity- Photo swap Please let me know which one you would like to start so I can unlock it and we can begin working through the program. Thank you!! Mentee 2022-11-21, 20:10: Lets work on the Extension Activity-Adulting 101 first :) Mentor 2022-11-21, 21:03: Great choice. I will go ahead and open that conversation for you. I just wanted to let you know that the extension activity- Adulting 101 is part of the Well-being and Self care module (which is also one of the conversations you are required to complete). But we will start with completing the extension activity first. Once opened, we will continue our conversation and working through the program in that module. Have fun with it and I will send you a message in that module. Mentor 2022-12-03, 20:51: Hi Carsen, I hope all is going well! I just wanted to check in to see how everything is going with the module?

My name is Caitlyn as you probably already know, I'm looking into either doing school in Alberta (Edmonton or Calgary) or staying up north. I'm planning to get my bachelor of arts for psychology just like you and hopefully eventually get into vet school. I'm sure my profile has everything you need to know, feel free to ask me anything! :) Also, do you have any nicknames you prefer? Mentor 2022-11-22, 14:15: Hi Caitlyn! My sincere apologizes for the late response, I missed the ""go ahead"" from our team that I was allowed to reach out! Now that I know we're good to start the program, I am so excited! If there a certain module you would like to start with, please let me know! I absolutely agree, it looks like they matches us perfectly! Psychology is such an excited degree and there are SO many amazing courses for you to take. You also mentioned that you love theatre and singing, and while I am most definitely a terrible singer, one of my close friends is in a drama club at her university and loves it! There will probably be a musical theatre club at your university as well, which might be something exciting for us to look into :) Out of curiousity, do you have a favourite musical that you recommend I watch? I've only seen a few myself (Hairspray, Rock of Ages, Mamma Mia). I've been to Calgary a few times myself, and it's a really beautiful province. (Though, I'll admit, it was a little chilly last time I visited! Haha). As for nicknames, I usually go by Sam, but I have no preference! Is there a nickname you would prefer I use for you?

Mentee 2022-12-15, 10:15: Okay, so I did the first anchor text and then in the discussion questions, it says that I have to answer some qeurstions and then ask you some of the discussion questions. The first question I'm going to answer is What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? - I think the difference between living on the land and studying the land is that when you live on the land, you really use the land. What I mean is that when you live on the land, you use all the resources you can from the land. You learn to adapt to the land you are living on, so where you should grow everything, where you should live, where the best water is. You learn all that by living on the land. When you study the land, you are just taking samples of everything. Not really trying to learn the land. My question for you is How well is your connection to the land you live on? Mentor 2022-12-19, 13:27: Hi Amber! That is a great response! I agree that when you live on the land you are actively using and relying on it to provide you with things, therefore you must know the land pretty well to be able to survive. If you're studying the land, you are learning only what is available to be learnt and things might get missed. In response to your question, I feel like growing up I did not feel that I knew the land I lived on very well. I find that it is only since I've been in university that I am taking courses that allow me to interact with the land and become more familiar. Do you have any more questions for me? Or anything you want to discuss? Rhianna :) Mentee 2022-12-29, 09:46: Okay, so I finished the second text, and the disscusion questions I pick is Which of the Seven Teachings seems the most difficult to live by, and why might that be the case? My answer to this is, I believ that truth would probably be the hardest one to live by because no one tells the truth all the time. Everybody lies, so if everybody tried living by the seven teachings, it would be very hard for basically everybody. My question for you is Which of the Seven Teachings have you struggled with, and have you done anything to improve in this area? Mentee 2022-12-29, 09:48: As for what topic to do you next, you can pick this time. Mentor 2022-12-30, 11:42: Hi Amber! I hope you are having a good winter break! My answer is similar to yours. I believe I have struggled the most with honesty. Although I hate lying, there are some situations where I have lied to try and spare someone's feelings or even to protect my own feelings. I think in the end, it is always better, to tell the truth regardless of if it is the harder option in the present. That is something I always try to remind myself about when I find myself in a situation where I think I can spare someone's feelings by lying. Have you had a chance to complete all of the discussion questions for both anchor texts? If so, we can move on to the topic of ""Well-being and self-care."" How does that sound?",,"Mentee 2023-01-02, 13:07: Great. Thank you Mentee 2023-01-02, 15:45: Okay, so I did the first anchor text and it said to create a list of things, or activities that I enjoy. - I enjoy reading books. - I enjoy spending time with animals. - Sometimes I enjoy playing card games. - I also enjoy spending time with my family. My question for you is What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? Mentee 2023-01-02, 15:51: The second anchor text was small, so I finished it already. The discussion questions aren't really questions, but it told me to make a list of some self care actions I can change in my life now and how I will do them. 1. Get more and regular sleep. - How I will do this is by staying off electronics roughly 1 hour before bed. 2. Exercise more. - How I will do this is by setting aside some time in my schedule to exercise. 3. Drink more water. - I will start bringing water bottles everywhere with me. My question for you is Do you have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? Mentee 2023-01-02, 16:17: I'm done this conversation hing, I guess. So, I feel as though we should do funding your future next, if you don't mind. Mentor 2023-01-04, 17:15: Hi Amber! For the first anchor text, I will share my list of activities I like to do! I also enjoy playing card games as well as other board games. I also love spending time with my animals and my family. Another activity I like to do is going for walks. As for your question regarding things I do to maintain good mental health, I use a lot of the activities I mentioned above. For example, I make an effort to go on daily walks as I find that helps lower my stress levels and keep me grounded. I would suggest finding a form of exercise you enjoy doing and trying to incorporate it into your daily life as it will most likely help you deal with stress. I would also suggest journaling. I recently started doing this and I find it has helped me process my emotions and acknowledge how I am feeling to allow me to deal with my negative feelings. Personally, I can get overwhelmed when I feel disorganized, therefore another one of my tips would be to get an agenda that you use daily to keep all of your assignments and exams in order. Hope this helped! Mentor 2023-01-04, 17:24: To answer your question regarding the second anchor text, I think the first step to breaking bad habits is to recognize that you are doing them. It can be easy to get stuck in cycles of bad habits without noticing they are harming your mental health. As I mentioned in my last response, I think journaling is great for becoming aware of your negative habits. Once you have recognized these bad habits, you can actively work towards breaking them. You can do so by setting yourself goals for every week and writing them down so you don't forget about them. I would also suggest setting up a time with your friends to complete tasks together as sometimes it is easier to get stuff done if you are doing it with friends. This way you can keep each other accountable! Let me know if you have any more questions :). Since we have completed this conversation topic I will open up the next one!",,,"Mentee 2023-01-15, 15:43: Okay so I did the first anchor text and it says that I have to answer all the questions for my dream career and for my realistic career. Here are my answers. What education you need for BOTH careers you researched.? - For my dream career, which is a veterinarian, I need two years of pre veterinary medicine uni studies or college studies, and a 4-5 year veterinary medicine program. - For my realistic career, which is a pet groomer and animal care worker. I need training courses in animal handling, grooming or dog training, a veterinary technology diploma or an equivalent combination of education, experience and certification, and a certification by a reputable training school for pet trainers Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending post-secondary - I would recieve a good education that can help me get a good job in the future. - I would also get to experience different things from what I am used to. - I would also make new friends and gain more knowledge. Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. For example: cost, taking a gap year, going to school far away, grades, length of schooling, etc. Your mentor might offer some solutions. - One would be money for both of my career options. I know that I will need to work a lot for money, and also get a lot of scholarships for schooling. - Another challenge is my grades. I don't get perfect grades all the time, but I do manage to stay honour role and principals role, but that may not be enough. - one more challenge I may face is living by myslef, so rent costs and everything. How do you feel about the education and experience you’ll need for the careers you explored? Are you looking forward to it, or do you just want to get it over with? Why? - I feel as though the education for the vet career will be a lot and a big work load, but if I manage to study a lot and maintain good grades I could do it. - I am somewhat looking forward to school, but I am also just wanting to get it over with as there is a lot of schooling needed to be done, but I am excited to learn more. Your conclusions: do you think your careers are achievable? Why or why not? - I do belive my careers are achievable if I work hard enough and always try to learn more. My question for you is are you happy with your decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not? Mentor 2023-01-16, 15:51: Hi Amber! I also want to be a vet! I definitely understand your concerns about living alone and therefore having to pay for rent, food and tuition. A solution I can offer would be to apply for as many scholarships as you can, to work during the summer if you aren't taking any classes and to apply for student loans if necessary. To answer your question, I am very happy that I chose to pursue post-secondary education. Although it can be extremely stressful and requires a lot of preparation and organization, I have met so many amazing friends and love taking classes. I understand that it can be very scary to think of the possibility of moving out and taking on a heavy workload but I find it gets a lot easier after your first year! Please let me know if you have any more questions!","Mentee 2023-03-28, 14:52: Hi, Sorry I haven't talked to you in a while. I have had to work and aply for scholarships. Anyways, how have you been? I did the first anchor text and it says that I have to tell you 5 things I want in life. 5 Things I want in life are - I want to get through university. - I want to get accepted into vet school when the time comes. - I want to become a successful vet. I don't really have any other things that I wanto in life, but when I think of them I will let you know. Now, my question for you is What inspired you to start down the path your on now?",,"Mentee 2023-01-07, 14:18: Hi, so I did the anchor text, here is the question I got Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? What was your experience with those skills? My answer is that I have never used any of those study skills. I don't really study that much, but I'm going to have to for exams. My question for you is • What strategies do you use to study and prepare for exams? Mentor 2023-01-08, 19:31: Hi Amber! I was in the same position as you in high school. I never really studied and it was something I had to learn when I got into university. So this great you're thinking about study strategies now! Personally I use a lot of the tips you would have seen in the video in anchor text 1. Of course studying is different for everyone and you'll have to find what works for you but I will let you know my course of action and hopefully that will be helpful! The first thing I do is create a schedule for myself for a week or two before exams. In this schedule, I write out when I will work on which subject and I make sure to rotate the subjects so I'm not working on one class for too long (similar to what was said in the video). When I start studying, I read over my notes from the semester to refresh my memory about what I have learnt. Once I feel like I know the basics from the course, I start working on practice questions. I find these an efficient form of studying as practice questions really get you to understand the content you're learning rather than memorizing! If the teacher does not provide practice questions, it's also a good idea to get you and a friend to make some and then switch and answer each other's questions! I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any more questions! :) Mentee 2023-01-09, 11:06: So there are some extension activities that we can do. It's not a requirement though, so if you want to do them we can, but if you don't want to we don't have to. The firs one is to track our study habits over one week. The other one is for me. Mentor 2023-01-09, 13:33: Hi Amber! We can definitely do the extension activities if you would like! Just let me know what you decide and we can complete them :). Mentee 2023-01-09, 13:40: Okay. Here is what the first extension activity is. Create a calendar documenting your study habits over a one week period. Challenge your mentor to do the same. Include: • When and how long you were studying for • Who you were studying with (alone or in groups) • What you were studying (subject) • Where you were studying (in the library, at home, etc.) • How you were studying (with music, on the computer, reading, flash cards, taking notes, etc.). I guess we will start today, if thats alright. Mentor 2023-01-10, 12:31: Hi Amber! We can definitely work on that extension activity. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to classes until February 20th. If you agree, I think it would be a great idea if you were to complete your study log for this week and I will answer these questions with how I usually study. As this activity will take a week, I suggest we start working on the last conversation topic we have which is ""Post-secondary and Career Planning."" If you think that is a good idea just let me know and I will open up that conversation topic! I will post my response to the extension activity here: -I tend to study mostly in groups as I find it easier to stay focused if I have people around me to keep me accountable. -I usually study at the library as I find it hard to stay focused at home. -While studying I use my computer to access my notes and flashcards if I have to memorize any information. Have a great day!","Mentee 2023-01-04, 18:59: Okay, so I went throuh the first anchor text and it is asking me to look for at least three scholarships I am eligable for. One scholarship I am eligable for in the Interior Logging Association $1,000.00 membership scholarship. Another scholarship I am eligable for is Live Your Dream Award, and then I am also eligable for the Gorsline Family Bursary Fund Scholarship. My question for you is How are you funding your education? Mentor 2023-01-04, 20:17: That's great that you are aware of scholarships available to you! To fund my schooling, I have gotten some scholarships throughout my studies and I have student loans. I also work 2 jobs every summer to save up! Have you thought about how you will fund your education? Mentee 2023-01-05, 10:18: I hope to apply for lots of scholarships. I also save money from the job i am currently working at. My family will alsso help a bit, nad I have a little bit of money put away for schooling as well from my grandparents. I also plan to work summers while I am at school. If that's not enough, then I might apply for grants or student loans to help me through school. Mentee 2023-01-05, 10:59: Hi, the second anchor text told me to fill out this budget thing, so I did, but I wanted to let you know that the numbers in the budget aren't exact numbers. They are guesses. Anyways, here is the link for my budget. Any feedback you have on it please let me know. Thank you Amber's Budget The question I have you is What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? Mentor 2023-01-05, 20:56: Hi Amber! Unfortunately, I cannot access your budget, however, that is great that you filled it out with estimates! I think it gives you an idea of the costs related to university! To answer your question, I didn't expect groceries to cost me so much every week. Once I realized this, I worked very hard on saving money on groceries by shopping at cheaper stores. I also wrote down what I planned on buying and made an effort to only buy those items. I would recommend looking into places to rent in the city you plan to move to to get an idea of how much rent might cost when you move out! As for our next conversation topic, we have a few left that we need to complete! Which one would you like to start on next? Our options are: Strategic Studying Post-secondary and Career Planning Let me know which one you'd like to work on next!","Mentee 2022-11-01, 08:41: Hi. Mentor 2022-11-02, 22:27: Hi Amber! How are you? My name is Rhianna. I am a 4th year student studying Biology at UBC in Vancouver. Currently I'm staying at home in Kelowna to work for a term to save up some money. In my free time I like going for walks, reading and spending time with my animals. What do you like to do for fun? What are your favourite subjects in class? I look forward to hearing from you!! Rhianna Mentor 2022-11-06, 22:26: Hi Amber! Just checking in :). How are you doing? How is school going? Mentee 2022-11-07, 13:37: Hi, Sorry I'm just replying now, I have been super busy with school and work. What I like to do for fun is to read books. I love books. If I was aloud to I would read them all day, and I am not too picky on the genre. I don't really have a favourite subject. I like all of them. I have been doing fine. I've been super busy though with trying to get all my work done at school and to try and stay caught up. How have you been? How is school? Mentor 2022-11-10, 00:00: Hi Amber! No problem at all! I hope you're feeling more caught up now :). At the moment I am taking a term off of school to work! But it's going good so far. I love reading as well! I love mystery books. Which topic would you like to begin with? Have you had a chance to read the instructions? Mentor 2022-11-12, 11:56: Hi Amber! I wanted to include the options for conversations we could start with since we need to complete these: Different Ways of Knowing Strategic Studying Well-Being and Self-Care Post-secondary and Career Planning Extension Activity – Adulting 101: students evaluate what skills they know and what they still need to learn in order to “make it” as an adult. Extension Activity - photo swap: students and their mentors swap photos of things that inspire them. Mentee 2022-11-15, 08:51: Hi, So for which conversation we should start first, I believe that we should start with the Different Ways of Knowing, if that is all right with you? Mentee 2022-11-15, 08:52: Also, how have you been? How has work been? Mentor 2022-11-16, 16:08: I am good thank you for asking! I have been very busy with work! How is school going?

I hope school is going well! Mentee 2022-11-29, 08:25: Hi, I'm doing good. How are you? I haven't had a chance to read the text in ways of knowing, but I hope to go through it this weekend. And school is going well. Mentor 2022-11-29, 11:13: I'm good thanks! Just getting over a sickness but I'm feeling much better now! That's perfect!

Mentee 2022-12-19, 14:01: Hi Rihanna, I don't really have any more questions for you right now. Mentor 2022-12-20, 20:29: Hi Amber! No problem! Did you get a chance to finish all the activities in this topic? There's a checklist if you think that might be helpful! Please let me know when you are done and we can move onto the next topic :). Which topic would you like to start on next? Rhianna Mentee 2023-01-02, 08:49: Hi, I had a good winter break. Hope you had a good one as well.

Thank you Mentee 2023-01-09, 11:04: It was super helpful thank you Mentee 2023-01-12, 10:15: Okay so, I will answer the questions now. - When I study, I usually study by myself, cause if I have other people there then I would get distracted by them. - I usually start studying with that hard subjects, and go through what I know about those subjects, then move onto the next one. - When I study, I am usually at my dining room table. - Also when I study, I put music on as it helps me focus on my work more then just having silence. Here is my responses. Mentee 2023-01-12, 10:16: Since this text is done can we move onto the next one. I would like to do finding inspiration next, if that's alright. Mentor 2023-01-13, 11:33: Hi Amber! Those are great studying strategies! It's great that you know that you would get distracted by studying with others and therefore study on your own. We can definitely do the conversation topic ""Finding Inspiration,"" however we have one more required conversation topic to complete before! I will open up our last required topic which is ""Post-secondary and Career Planning."" How does that sound? Have a great weekend! Mentee 2023-01-13, 15:05: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Have a great weekend as wel! Mentor 2023-01-15, 15:13: Thank you! Please let me know if you have any questions :). Mentee 2023-01-18, 13:49: Hey, I know that this program is going to be ending for the calss soon, but I was wondering if we can keep talking and doing the program as it has been fun and very informative for me. It has also been nice to have someone to talk to, even if we didn't talk about ourselves very much. Mentor 2023-01-20, 11:07: Hi Amber! Of course, we can continue the program! It's been great talking to you and I'm super happy you have been finding it informative :). Once we finish ""Post-secondary and Career Planning"" we can move onto ""Finding Inspiration"" like you had mentioned or any other topic! Have a great weekend!

Been busy. How are you? How have you been? As for conversation topics, I was thinking we could do finding inspiration, if that i alright with you? Have a great day. Amber Mentor 2023-03-10, 18:53: Hi Amber! No need to apologize! I completely understand when life gets super busy, it can be very overwhelming. I am good thank you! Also busy with school :). I will open up the conversation topic ""Finding Inspiration."" Have a great weekend! Mentor 2023-03-28, 19:54: Hi Amber! It's great to hear from you :). I am doing well thank you! How are you? Those are great things to want in life. Have you thought about things you plan on doing to achieve those wants/goals? To answer your question, I have always loved taking biology and chemistry courses in middle/high school therefore I knew I wanted to pursue a degree in science. I have always loved animals and decided I would pursue a career where I would get to help animals. That allowed me to determine a bachelor of science majoring in biology was the right move for me as this would allow me to apply to vet school in the future. Have a great day!",,,,,

It's awesome to finally meet you! My name is Rayyan and I'm extremely excited to get to talk to you and be your mentor for the next few months. There are a lot of interesting topics we'll get a chance to explore and learn about, which hopefully helps you with whatever you decide to do after high school! Before we do anything, let me introduce myself properly. I'm a current biomedical engineering student living in British Columbia. I enjoy the math involved in engineering and I like solving complex problems. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, playing video games and taking short walks. If you have a favourite book or video game, please let me know! Just as a sort of introduction, I'd like to share one cool piece of music that I like with you. You might recognize some of them. The first one is called ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" by Edvard Grieg. Here's a link to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLp_Hh6DKWc. You might recognize the music if you haven't heard of the name. Either way, let me know what you think about it! I'd really appreciate it if you could also include one of your favourite pieces of music (or book/movie) with your introduction. If you have any questions please let me know, I'll do my best to find an answer. And once again, I'm thrilled to be your mentor and I look forward to learning alongside you over the next few months!

First I really like being able to have some basic knowledge on almost everyone I meet as where I live has under five thousand citizens. Second, I really like being able to dirtbike and easily travel and use things like horses very easily compared to living in a city where that is not as feasible. Lastly I like how close the community and everyone is especially in our sports like hockey or baseball. Two things I dislike about living in a rural area are as follows. First of all I highly dislike the lack of opportunities like not being able to do certain sports and the lack of jobs and new things to try. The second thing I dislike is there aren't very many ways to ignore and avoid people that you dislike or have problems with. Thank you for taking the time to read this message from, Jainic Brown Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:20: Hello again Rayyan, Today I will be asking one of the questions from anchor one. How was moving from a rural to city area for you and what do you like about living in a city? I am also curious on how it is with alot more people and if that is nice or a nuisance? From, Jainic Brown Mentor 2022-11-09, 11:08: Hi Jainic, It's great to hear about some things you like and dislike about living in a rural area! I've lived in a few smaller areas before (around 10-15,000 people) and I can definitely resonate with some of your points! Although there are some downsides, I am glad you found some things to appreciate, and hope you can find a good solution to the things you aren't a fan of. As for your other question, I was quite young when I moved from a rural area to a city, but I remember being quite excited. I enjoyed the idea of getting to see all the big skyscrapers. My favourite part about living in the city is being able to access lots of different facilities, ranging from sports to parks to restaurants. I know this is something you might be a bit frustrated by, so if you ever choose to move to a bigger city, you'll be able to find a variety of these opportunities. As for your other question, I find that living in a city, in terms of the people, can be a bit challenging. Depending on how populated your city is, there can be very crowded areas and lineups for nearly everything. It's also hard to connect with people sometimes because everybody is always busy with their own life. Back when I lived in a smaller town, it was great to be able to know everybody in my neighbourhood and school. In a city, however, that's impossible, since there are thousands of other students, usually. Despite this, I've met lots of great people living in the city, so there are some upsides to being around lots of others. :) Let me know if you have any more questions about our discussion! If not, go ahead and move on to the second anchor text, and choose one of the two activities to work on! -Rayyan Mentor 2022-12-07, 15:33: Hi Jainic, I know it has been a while, but I just wanted to quickly check in to make sure everything was going okay. It's been a while since we last messaged, and I just wanted to make sure you didn't have any urgent questions or concerns. Let me know how things are going and if you need any help, and be sure to check out my last message if you haven't already! -Rayyan Mentee 2022-12-14, 08:44: Hello Rayyan, Sorry for my absence. I have just been sick and forgotten to respond and also have been having problems with the program. Anyways I am happy to be back. For my anchor 2 conversation I chose the childhood tradition option. For me my tradition is hockey as it is the main connection between many members of the family and the community I live in. To keep this tradition alive I would watch hockey and try to go the the local recreation center or hockey arena and possibly play to make new friends and play with other hockey players in a non game sitation which would be new for me as I don't do that very often. For my question I would like to ask how you were able to keep your important traditions alive and what were they? -Sincerely Jainic Brown Mentor 2022-12-15, 11:09: Hi Jainic, No worries! I am glad you hear that you are feeling better now! If you have any other problems with the program, feel free to let me know and I can help you sort them out. It's great to hear that you are into hockey, it's definitely something you can look into playing at any local arena or sports centre. As for me, I have always enjoyed playing badminton. I would train weekly with a small group of people I knew pretty well. After coming to university, I was a bit worried that I would have trouble finding people to play with, or even the time to play. After arriving at my university and exploring for a bit, I found that it was not the case. The university had enormous sports facilities and I could always ask any of my new friends if they wanted to go and play, and it would be easy to walk to the gym and play badminton. If you choose to move into an urban environment at any time in the future, although it may be a little intimidating, there are countless ways to continue playing sports, especially with new people. Let me know if you have anything else you want to talk about! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-01-16, 12:08: Hello Rayyan, It is good to hear that there are many opportunities to play sports and meet other people. I find it important and was quite worried and thought it would be hard to get out and exercise in the ways I prefer. I would probably also try sports other than hockey as well as I like teamwork and playing games with others. I would also like to go to hockey games a lot more as I love the energy and cheering for the teams, specifically the NHL but NCAA and other junior leagues are also very fun to watch. Anyway thanks for the information and have a good day. Sincerely, -Jainic Brown Mentor 2023-01-17, 15:46: Hi Jainic, No worries! I'm glad it helped clarify your concern. You'll find no shortage of opportunities to meet new people and play lots of team sports here. You just have to be willing to put yourself out there, and you'll be in great shape. As for hockey games, I occasionally watch them on television, but if you live near a team, you can pay a visit. I've been to one game before, and it is quite thrilling to watch and is something you should check out if you can go. Let me know if you have other questions or if you want to continue with another discussion question in Anchor Text 2. If you'd like to move on. We can either progress to the extension activity or a new module. Be sure to let me know which module you are interested in if that's the case! Hope you have a great day! -Rayyan Mentor 2023-01-20, 15:55: Hi Jainic, Sounds good! I'm glad you were able to ask all your necessary questions. Please let me know which module you would like to start next, and I'll unlock it for you as soon as I can! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:29: Hi Rayyan, For the next conversation I would like to unlock strategic studying as I have really bad study habits. Thank you Sincerely - Jainic Brown",,,,

Best of luck!","Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:40: yes that does make more sense now thank you now i know how to plan my money better. another thing i was wonder the best way to keep my metal health in good shape and no still feel like my self.",,,"Mentee 2022-11-01, 14:15: What were some of the challenges that you had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? Mentor 2022-11-03, 14:12: One of the first things that came to mind was moving away from home. I did have my high school best friend as a roommate which definitely helped, but it was still a bit of an adjustment. I was independent enough in high school that I didn't struggle too much with doing chores and paying bills etc. But more of an adjustment with the living situation. You've probably heard this before but ""you don't really know a person until you live with them."" So just something to keep in mind if you're thinking of bunking with a friend. It can still be fun of course, but there can be things that surprise you about that person even if you think you know them very well. And school wise, university, or even college I believe, there's just more time outside of school that I had to dedicate to doing on schoolwork. So in university you really just have to be in school for the lectures (and exams) which is like 3 hours a week per class . And so assignments and studying had to be on my own time, unlike high school where we had time in class to work on assignments and study. So there was a lot of effort on my end for time management. Are there any specific conerns you have about going in for your heavy duty mechanic courses? Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:14: 3 things i like about rurel areas is its small, easy to get to places, and sort of cheap housing and other things. 2 things i dont like is they dont have much places, and not much for jobs",,,,"Mentee 2022-11-23, 08:06: why is having a post secondary educatin so important for me atleast i think its just a waste of time and dont learn much that will help me in the future. can you tell me why its so important Mentor 2022-11-23, 10:52: Yea that's totally fair since going to university takes a lot of time and can be very expensive too. But I think it's important depending on the job you want. As you probably know there's certain jobs that requires going to university to be able to do that job or to get licensing for that job like a doctor, etc. So I think if the person knows what they want to do and if it needs a degree, then there's kinda no way around it. But if what the person wants to do doesn't need a degree then it would make sense to not go. Especially since I know people who go to university for the sake of going and it's never a good time for them because it can be quite hard Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:24: im not very good with my money like saving and spending. do you have any tips so i can budget my money better","Mentor 2022-10-23, 22:59: Hi there, I’m Jihanne. I’ll be your mentor for the next few months. I read your profile and saw that you are planning to go to trade school and unfortunately, I did not, I went to university to take psychology. But I do know several people that have gone to trade school so hopefully, I can still be helpful. Let me know if you have any questions. So I will be unlocking all the required conversations. For each conversation topic, there are anchor texts/videos/pictures and guiding questions to help us out. Usually, I would answer them first and then we do a bit of back and forth. Once you think you’ve gotten the most out of the conversation, then we move on to the next topic. There is also the “Resources” page and section on “Program tutorials” for more instructions on how to go about the program. Also let me know if you have any questions. Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:43: My name is Walker My plans are to go do my trades program for Heavy duty mechanics and then work for a long time. My hobbies are working on things quad/sledding, Mentor 2022-10-31, 00:11: It's great to meet you, Walker. What got you interested in being a heavy duty mechanic? Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:16: Hello again, I think we are meant to start on the modules/conversations now, so please click on ""From rural to urban"" on the Conversation wheel. Thanks! Mentor 2022-12-05, 10:21: To be quite honest, I still struggle with saving money too. But one tip that I need to implement myself is this one form of budgeting. So you'll start with how much you get paid per month, and first subtract all your necessary expenses for that month. For example, like your tuition fee, rent and utilities, car insurance, car payment, estimate on groceries per month etc. I don't know if you've heard about the 10% rule, so it's just taking 10% of what you earned and putting it in your savings. Of course if that's too high or too low you can always change it, even to a certain amount like $50 month or something. Once you've subtracted your main expenses and savings then you'll have left over spending money. But by prioritizing your expenses and savings then you'll know you'll have enough for necessities and your putting some away, and you'll know how much you can spend on your ""wants"". Of course, try not to spend over the amount you have left over. With getting a credit card sometimes it's easy to spend more than you make, so you want to try to avoid that. And one tip with getting a credit card is try using it like a debit, by that I mean, personally I use my credit card all the time but I try to pay it off in full as quickly as I can so I actually know how much money I have left, almost treating it like a debit card. And by paying in full, you also build your credit that way. As a student you can get low interest rates, but those interest rates add up to if you don't pay your bill in full at the due date. Hopefully that makes sense, let me know if you have any follow up questions. Mentor 2022-12-08, 21:33: No problem at all. I think even asking about how to maintian your mental health is a good start. You're already aware that it is something that you have to think about. But mental health is very personal and you can maintain it in different ways. One of the ways is making sure you give yourself enough breaks and also noticing your warning signs when you're stressed. Pushing yourself and challenging yourself is important, but of course there is a limit where you will have to take notice if it's doing more harm than good. There are things that you can do related to your physical body that will affect your mental health such as exercising, getting enough sleep, and eating healthy. Finding a balance is important to setting goals but making sure they are realistic and that you're not pushing too far that instead of working towards your goal it's counteracting the work you're trying to do. Of course, accesssing mental health resources is important too. I do just want to share that accessing therapy services isn't just for people with diagnosed psychological disorders. Counsellors are meant to help with day to day problems too. Hopefully that makes sense.","Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:18: Following the questions on Anchor text #1: 3 things I like about living in a rural area: I like how everything was close to each other, so it didn’t take long to get to school, to work, or anywhere really. I like how almost everybody was familiar, which made it kinda home-y if that make sense. I also like how peaceful it is for the most part. Sometimes urban centres can just be a bit chaotic, so it's nice than in small towns the pace is much calmer. 2 things I don’t like about living in a rural area: I didn’t enjoy that there was barely anything to do, so at times it can be a bit boring. Similar idea where certain things (stores, etc.) are not easily accessible and you have to drive to another town just to have more options for shopping etc. Please share 3 things you like and 2 things you don’t like about living in a rural area. And as the Anchor text said, please feel free to ask me any of the discussion questions. Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:11: from my yesterday message I like rural ares becouse things seem to be cheaper and easier to get around reasons I dont like rural ares is they dont always have everything you need to get things done Mentor 2022-11-09, 14:48: Yes, I totally agree, it's nice that it's cheaper in rural towns but sometimes it can be hassle that there's not a lot in town so you're forced to travel. Do you have any questions for me about living in a bigger city? You can use the discussion questions too if you want.",,,,"Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:35: what is some good ways to avoid discrimation and to avoid bias people and people sterotyping others in the workplace Mentor 2023-01-14, 14:49: This is a good yet very tough question. One thing that is important to note is that we cannot control how other people think and feel. So if you do experience it, companies have different ways of dealing with it. Definitely tell your supervisor/boss if something happens. You can be honest with your supervisor/boss and let them know what working with people who may be discriminatory is uncomfortable and I believe you have the right to request different shifts or to not work with them. I think something we can do ourselves is think about how we treat others. I'm not sure if you've heard of the ""self-fulfilling prophecy"". This essentially just means that if you treat people with the assumption that a stereotype is correct, that then may make them act in the same way that you assumed. For example, if you assume someone is lazy and you do their work for them because you're assuming that it won't get done. Then they may think that you'll just do it for them all the time and that way they'll never do it. And so you may end up proving your point that they're lazy for not doing these tasks but then you may have not given them a chance to show that they are not. I'm not sure if that makes sense but part of it too is being aware of your own biases. Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:27: what does knowing your privlage mean to mee and how can i know what my privlage is Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:27:  Mentor 2023-01-25, 18:54: Another good question, but once again a bit difficult to answer. Keep in mind that how I answer this is also affected by my position in life, background, and experiences. My understanding of privilege is advantages that a person may have based on their personal background and/or where they're from, including their ethnicity/race, gender, to name a few. So knowing your privilege is essentially knowing how your background and how that may put you at an advantage over other people in situations such as maybe how a person is treated in a workplace. Does that make sense? Also this may be the last message you'll see from me with the program ending. If it is, just wanted to say that it was great chatting with you. I hope I was of help in any way! And good luck on your future endevours! Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:43: Greetings Jihanna this is the last time i'll be on mentor thanks for your time and your help Thanks, walker"

If I'm understanding your question correctly, I think a good idea would be to keep a separate document with a list of all the scholarships you've applied for (for example, a google docs file). That way, you won't risk applying to one scholarship twice, and you can also keep track of deadlines/dates that you can expect to hear back from the scholarship donors. I highly recommend looking into applying to scholarships - most are very easy to apply to and you can get a lot of money from it!

Good interests - have you gotten a chance to look into what level of education is needed or which schools will help you get there? My guess would be comp sci or some sort of digital arts program would do it. Though probably would depend if you're more on the technical or art/design side of things. I believe my cousin is currenlty at Emily Carr heading towards the more art side of things. Sister had done Interactive Arts and Technology program at SFU which would give you more a mix of tech/design. Mom did comp sci at UBC - she went the route of code monkey though XD I have another cousin who's currenlty team managing animators - from a comp sci background I think. He did stuff for movies like Happy Feet!",,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-19, 17:52: Hello Nathan! It's nice to e-meet you! My name is Kathleen and I'm going to be your mentor! I'm 28 years old and currently a second year medical student at UBC in Vancouver. I see you're interested in gaming - what kind? I'm partial to board games but if on the computer, it'll be more strategy like Civilization 6 or Core Keeper (the better version of Stardew Valley). (your interest in making them is cool too - I have a couple cousins working in the animation/game industry and the work they do is fascinating) Also...what does the cool way of drinking coffee look like? TL;DR for the program: I'll open different topics that you can read and explore - lemme know what you think of them! Also, ask me any questions! Mentee 2022-11-01, 14:15: Nice to meet you as well Kathleen I am interested in computer gaming more than board games but I am interested in games like chess and other strategy things, I usually play games where I can play with all my friends together which is just fun to do. And I am interested in making games because one time I thought I would really enjoy it and I wanted to learn about it ever since then, drinking coffee the cool way is drinking the coffee while holding it as well for me. And my question for you is what kind of coffee are you into? mine personally is Nescafe, it is simple and tastes good with creamer. Also just a light roast coffee. Mentor 2022-11-04, 18:40: Oooo - my boyfriend really likes chess too. I can't keep up with him :P Coffee...I'm usually a medium roast with milk and brown sugar. Have more a preference for the sweet taste than the bitter taste xD I have had some really good expensive coffee made for me by family though...I must say it tasted goooood. Have no idea what it's called though. Do you know which module you want to start with? Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:48: Hi Kathleen sorry I have not been texting you I have not been on mentor because of being busy and I cannot show up for the event because of work. I had a pretty good new years and during christmas break I hanged out with my friends. For the question below about how I would feel is someone being told a racist thing I would walk away to tell somebody that it has happened and if they can help figure out something out and that would be great, but I would be to scared to stop it because I feel like they would beat me up. Mentor 2023-01-16, 13:33: Heyyyy no worries. Hope you have a good time at work today! Sounds like a good break with others :) Super fair response to a difficult situation. I 100% agree with you that you need to make sure you're safe in whatever choice you do. Kind of a follow-up quesiton to it - who would you look for to tell? Do you know anyone you could trust to tell/trust they'll do something about it? Mentee 2023-01-19, 09:37: For the question of who I would tell, I would tell my father since I know he is one of the people I trust the most and I know he would do something about it to calm the situation down. Mentor 2023-01-19, 17:42: I'm really glad you have someone you trust and can talk to! Keep those people close - they mean so much as you get older. Let me know what other sections you'd like to look at/topics to chat about! I've heard you only have a couple of classes left - I'm happy to keep chatting as long as you'd like even after that but want to make sure we don't miss anything!",,,,,"Mentee 2022-12-02, 09:16: Hi Kathleen so I just looked at the topic Confronting Discrimination and I tried to watch the video along with it but it was not avaible for students but teachers only. But I seen comics that was avaible, and I have a few thoughts and questions. One, I think it is important to always help someone when they are getting beat up over there race, but in the comics they I would say that they did not really show what to properly do in the situation. They just said stop and recorded it but then never showed evidence to anyone, but instead just said to a worker at the shop that someone is being racist. With no evidence she kicks the man out. Another scenario was a person pushed another person over and the same kind of thing happened, the person said stop and recorded it, but this time she showed someone which was good. Mentor 2022-12-06, 14:27: Hey Nathan! Can you check in with your teacher to see if they can help with your video? I'll also mention it to my leaders so they know there's an issue! I watched it - I found it to be an incredible story of what experiencing and responding to racism looks like. Glad you were able to look at the comics though. It's good you recognize to tell other people and get help! The other ways (recording,etc) are other things that can be done to help but does depend on the situation. How do you think you'd feel if you saw someone being told a racist thing? What would you do? Mentor 2023-01-05, 18:20: Hey Nathan! Happy New Year and hope you had a wonderful Christmas break - do anything fun? Just checking in to see if you've gotten a chance to think about the questions below! Mentor 2023-01-09, 17:09: Hello Nathan! Just a quick note - let me know if you're interested in the Meet your Mentor event! I'm not available on Jan 12 (I have class at that time :P) but I can make January 16th 8:30-9:30pm. Lemme know! It'd be pretty cool to chat!"

Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:44: how much would college or uni be in cost Mentor 2023-01-05, 18:19: Happy New Year Landon! Hope you had a wonderful Christmas break! That is a good question - I'd challenge you to look into the program you're interested in and how much it'll cost you. It can vary a lot depending what program, how long, where, what fees are included, etc. Google is really helpful for this or specific school websites. (I did find a fee schedule on Northern Lights College website! Let me know if you had any difficulty finding it!) Don't forget to include any fees (like UBC has a lot of extra fees that we have to pay for each year), cost for books/supplies, travel costs, living costs, etc when thinking about how much you'll need to spend. To give you a general idea though, I paid about $6,000 each year for full time science undergraduate degree at UBC (I finished in 4 years so that is about $24,000 total). Currently UBC medical school is costing me around $18,000 in tuition per year but when you add fees, supplies, books, etc I think I'm closer to $20,000+ (I'm expecting costs to probably be around $80,000-$100,000 by the time I'm done especially if I need to travel for interviews or elective rotations in 4th year). I'd highly suggest having an idea how much it'll cost you and then look into ways to fund it - there's many ways you can get money for education. I paid/am paying for mine through scholarships (they totally paid off my first year of undergrad and more), loans, grants (don't have to pay back grants!), RESP and savings :) Let me know what you think! Mentor 2023-01-09, 17:08: Hello Landon! Just a quick note - let me know if you're interested in the Meet your Mentor event!

In my free time i like to play video games like rainbow 6 siege and call of duty. What do you like to do in your free time? -Landon Mentor 2022-10-31, 16:00: Hey Landon! Good to hear from you. Had to look it up but that is one nice car! And nice - FPS and co-op games (is Rainbow 6 siege similar to Apex or League?). My games of choice would be more strategy like Civilization 6 or Core Keeper. Otherwise I do like the outside - hiking or kayaking or such :) Let me know if you wanted to get started with chatting about money! (the current section we're in) - Kathleen Mentor 2022-11-10, 20:52: We seem to be jumping around in the sections a bit! As a quick note - whichever section page you've clicked is where the chat will end up. I'd like to suggest sticking to one conversation area until we're done! What do you think? Also thanks for the saying the rav4 is a good one - I always like to hear I'm making good choices XD Job is a good idea - any thoughts of which one/what area? The career planning section can help with different ideas or I can ask some questions if that's helpful instead. I can definitely say I didn't realize just how many different jobs were possible until I got older and got to see more things! (like did you know you could work as a candy taster? terrible for the health but fascinating!)","Mentor 2022-10-19, 17:56: Hello Landon! It's nice to e-meet you! My name is Kathleen and I'm going to be your mentor! I'm 28 years old and currently a second year medical student at UBC in Vancouver. You seem to like cars and trucks - do you have a favourite? What else do you like to do? I'm looking forward to chatting about ""adulting"" (it's an ongoing thing let me tell you) and the other questions you have. Let me know if you have any you'd like to talk about now! TL;DR for the program: I'll open different topics that you can read and explore - lemme know what you think of them!

Mentor 2022-11-08, 12:46: Hey Landon, Not disrespectful at all! I don't know much about the game so it's good to learn something new! Favourite car...can't say I'm much of a car person. More of I need something that will get me from point A to B (including somewhat offroad for some of the more interesting hikes) reliably with all my stuff :P For that reason I like Toyota and looking to getting a Rav4 at some point. What are you thoughts about how you could make the money to buy the car you like/fund other things? :) Mentee 2022-11-14, 12:03: Hello kathleen i guess ive been jumping around alot throughtout the texts on accident im thinking about being a heavy duty mechanic as my career and i got a job at a company doing work around the shop and washing semi-trucks and that will be my first step. Mentor 2022-11-14, 13:43: Nice - getting that experience and exposure under your belt. Do you know what other schooling or certification/licensing you'll need to do to become a heavy duty mechanic? I know I had to go through a 2 week course and then a couple of exams to get my Emergency Medical Responder license so I'd assume there's some sort of licensing requried for becoming a mechanic? Mentee 2022-11-15, 13:19: i would need to get at a job where i gould start an apprenticship and go through trade school. and after a while i would go on to be a journyman and get my red seal witch allowes me to go to germany and still be able to work as a heavy duty mechanic. Mentor 2022-11-17, 12:07: Now I'm super curious (don't know a whole lot about the pathway to trades) - how long would the apprenticeship be? What school would you want to go to (I only know of BCIT here in Vancouver)? How long would it take? What are the pre-reqs (pre-requisites or the courses you'd need to be able to get into the program you want)? That's more of the school side of things...on the career side, what do your hours look like? How much can you earn? I know that's a lot of questions XD Feel free to answer as many or little as you want - I am incredibly curious to see what you know/what you'll find out though! Mentee 2022-11-18, 11:57: im pretty sure its like 4 years of the apprenticeship. i would like to go to the trade school in Dawson creek. for my school i need to pass with at least a 76 to go to trade school. but for my hours that i get right nown i work every day after schoo, till 5 and on saturday sometimes. Mentor 2022-11-19, 16:36: Nice - sounds like you have a plan and an idea of how to get where you want to go! Do you have any questions for me about planning school after high school out/getting a career? Or would you like to move on to another section? Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:11: what would you say would be the best way to fund for a apartment, food, vehicle, etc Mentor 2022-11-28, 13:28: Apologies for the delay in reply Landon! Funding for aparement/life...the budgeting and management section under Funding your future has a bit though with more around school funding. It'd be helpful to take a look though! As from me though there's lots I could suggest. One of the main things is always save your money first and then spend whatever you have left over! So, for example, if you earn $100 and you've determined you need to save 25% to get to your goal, save $25 first and then budget how you can spend the $75. Then you'll be able to get to your goal of larger ticket items like a vehicle or apartment. There's lots I could say about spending within your means (aka don't spend more money than you're earning) but this also has to balance with what you need (ex. you need a vehicle to get to school/work and other options like transit isn't an option). If need is more money than you're earning, loans, lines of credit, a mortgage, financing and others are all options. However, be really careful - you can easily get into deep debt and find it very difficult to get out. Personally I have a student loan out for education (as there's no interest on it while I'm in school) but have a plan to either pay it off when I graduate from savings or plan out for debt forgiveness programs (ex. working rurally as a physician). I would suggest try not to have debt on credit cards - it's REALLLLY high interest (aka you borrow $10 and until you fully pay it back you're paying $2.50 every month in interest alone). As for savings, you can talk to someone at the bank or other people you know but I find save up in TFSA or RRSP first (these accounts have tax savings - you'll see when you start working tax savings can make a big difference. One year instead of having to pay the government more money in taxes, I was able to get money back from them because of tax savings). You can do stocks (high risk), mutual funds (low-high risk), GICs/others I can't remember (low risk). Ask me if you're curious in any of these in particular! Whew - that's a lot of info. Lemme know if any of it is helpful/you have more questions! Mentee 2022-12-05, 11:45: thanks for the info waht would a good % of money saving Mentor 2022-12-06, 14:11: That's a good question - when I was working full-time but living at home with minimal expenses...I was probably saving around 75% of my paycheck. That said, I'm bleeding money right now as a student with no income (thankfully have savings supporting me). -_- I also have friends who are living on their own (paying rent, food, etc) and can only save 5-30% of their paycheck (if even that much). I would say the more you can put aside earlier, the better set up you'll be later for large purchases (car, home, retirement, etc). How much do you think expenses will be for you? (aka how much it'll cost you to live with rent/home, food, transport, etc) Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:41: for me it would cost aroud 100-200 dollars but i would probubly do around 30% Mentor 2022-12-08, 10:37: $100-200 per month? That's pretty low expenses! Nice! Do you have any other questions about finances? Or would you be interested in moving to another topic? From Rural to Urban would be interesting (depends how big Dawson Creek is compared to where you live) or Well-being/Self-care especially as it sounds like you're in school or working a lot! Mentee 2022-12-14, 08:12: do you think investing would be a good thing to do for extra funding Mentor 2022-12-14, 12:09: I think it depends on what you mean by investing... Like you should as much as possible be saving your money in something that will be making you money (like saving accounts, GICs, mutual funds, stocks, etc) aside from what you'll need to spend right away (ie ""cash flow""). This way your money is always ""working"" and making money for you. Now will it actually make enough money for extra cash, not really in the short term. There's all the wonderful math stuff that can prove compounding interest really works - but over YEARS. Invest early and you'll see much more money later. Does that make sense? Or were you more interested in like stocks vs other things? Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:45: thank you kathleen for all your time.thanks for all the advice you gave me and i will use it. i appreciate that you helped me. -Landon Mentor 2023-01-26, 13:39: Hello Landon, I'm glad I could be of help! All the best to everything you do in the future! - Kathleen",,,"Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:46: hey kathleen what would be good things to do before and in an interview Mentor 2023-01-16, 13:43: Good question - first, be thankful/happy that you got an interview! You've passed the first step of screening! Then there's lots of super good things including things talked about above that I really agree with like: practice answering interview questions (ask someone to help practice! parents/other adults are really good for this as they've all had to do it before themselves and can give you feedback!) be prepared - dress well for where you're going to be interviewed, bringing backup copies of resume/references can be helpful, know where and when to be AND BE THERE EARLY answer questions concisely but with a good amount of content - I've been an interviewer where I've had people give me super short answers (I'm like, this is not helpful and really difficult to get to know the person) and where the person kept rambling (takes forever plus didn't seem to really help/answer the question/not hiring that person) ask your own questions about the job/company when they invitie you to! It shows interest and that you've really thought about the job What scares you the most about going for an interview? Mentor 2023-01-19, 17:46: Hey Landon! Just wanted to check-in - let me know what other sections or questions you'd like to chat about! I've heard you only have a couple of classes left - I'm happy to keep chatting as long as you'd like even after that but want to make sure we don't miss anything!",,"Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:16: hey kathleen im first nations so what would a good way to confrunt discrimonation in class and work Mentor 2023-01-26, 13:52: Will also drop some suggestions here: 1) make sure you're safe (you can always follow-up with other people afterwards when you are safe!) 2) come from a position of curiousity - ""Just wondering, what did you mean when you said...?"" or ""Curious - did you know about the history behind that saying?"". People often don't think about what they're saying or unaware of the sterotypes/beliefs they hold because of what they've been taught/seen growing up. When you get them to think about it or provide more information it often helps them challenge their own beliefs. 3) keep looking for opportunities to have those conversations with people! I'm not first nations but I have definitely started to have those conversations with others as I have been learning more about colonial history. challenging beliefs is hard and a long process but there is definitely change as we keep going at it. Hope that gives some food for thought!"

Mentor 2022-11-10, 09:08: Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I am still left with a few questions before we move onto the next part of this module. Have you ever created a resume before? What are some skills/traits from the article that you identify with and might be able to encorporate into your (current or future) resume? Mentee 2022-11-15, 13:46: Yes i created a resum last summer I included the other sources of income such as cutting grass plowing snow ect. Mentee 2022-11-23, 08:13: I am a quick learner becuase I enjoy learning new stuff. I am also hard working becuase I dont wnat to not finish somthing by the end of the day. Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:31: Hi Rachel I'm having a hard time working on my social life. How do you juggle all your subjects &amp; still fine time to enjoy a book or a social life. Mentor 2023-01-25, 11:55: Hi Kayden, this is a great question! For me, it depends on the semester. I have had some semesters where I am in a lot of difficult classes, and I need to spend most of my time outside of class studying or completing assignments (or doing extracurriculars/working). During these times, I find it really helpful to try to make friends in my classes. This way, I can use a bit of time before and after class to talk to my friends, and I can also organize study sessions with them. This really helps me to not feel isolated when I get really busy. On the other hand, I have had some semesters with a much lighter work load, and during these times, it's not as difficult to balance school and other aspects of life. I just make sure to prioritize my school work above other things I have going on, and then I usually have time to relax or socialize at the end of my day or on the weekends once I get all my work done. Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:45: See you in a while crocadial. (good bye) Mentor 2023-01-29, 16:32: Good bye Kayden. It was great talking with you! Feel free to reach out anytime if you want to talk or have any other questions :)",,,"Mentor 2022-11-04, 10:39: So, what did you think of the Resume Skills article? Have you ever created a resume before? What are some skills/traits from the article that you identify with and might be able to encorporate into your (current or future) resume? I think that being able to make a strong resume is a very important skill. Even if you are not applying for any jobs right now, I think it is always helpful to have one ""on the go"" so you can add to it over time. It also can be helpful so you don't forget any important past experiences/skills and so you can have a starting point when you need to submit a resume in the future. Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:13: Hi Rachel, I found the resume module informative and legitness. And like totally tubular and intrestring. Mentee 2022-11-10, 10:46: Yes I have made a resume before. The traits that I have is I am punctual and hard working. In my traits section. Mentor 2022-11-14, 09:09: That's great that you have already had experience creating a resume! Could you share with me one specific example of your experience in each of the skill areas described in the article? Mentor 2022-11-20, 16:53: Those are great things to include! Thank you for sharing. Before we move onto the second part of this module, I would like to hear your answer to the first Discussion Question which asks you to ""share with your mentor specific examples of your experience with each skill area."" For example, for one of the areas, I might say ""For the 'quick learner' skill area, I am energetic."" Then I would repeat this with a skill from each category. Mentor 2022-11-25, 08:58: Hi Kayden, I am gald to see how you have reflected on what your skills are! We can move onto the second part of ""Getting Hired"", but in the future, just a reminder to try to answer the Discussion Questions in full and use examples from the content (such as the article we just read) to respond to the questions. Mentor 2022-11-25, 09:07: What did you think of the video? What were some points that they brought up that you had not thought of before? I thought it covered some very important issues that I have thought about in my interviews in the past. I think one of the most important things that is often forgotten is putting any cellphones or other devices on silent. If you ever have to do an interview over Zoom, I have also found that it's important to turn off notifications that might come up on your computer.

I am a fourth year undergrad student at the University of Victoria, and I am taking a BSc in psychology. I am currently in the process of applying to dental school, and I hope to work as a dentist one day. I see you are interested in welding and mechanics! I would love to hear about your career goals and if you plan to get any post-secondary education in this field. Also, if you would like, I would love to learn a bit more about you. Do you have any other career or educational interests, and where do you see yourself in 5 years? After I sent this message, I will unlock all the conversations that your teacher would like you to complete. Typically, we would work through these modules (listed at the top of this page) one by one and talk about the prompts and the content in each module, but if you need to, feel free to move onto another module (it is okay to start multiple modules before I respond). I will respond within three days after getting your messages. Everytime you write to me in a message box (like this one), I will respond to you. To see each of my responses, you must click on the module that you previously left a message on as each conversation/module has its own ""Send Message"" section. The program instructions are linked above on this page highlighted in blue. Please feel free to get started working on the modules whenever you're ready. As you go though the different conversations/modules, feel free to ask me any questions you have about anything really! For example, we can talk about things related to the conversation/module, or you can ask me more specific questions about things like post-secondary education, moving out, living in a urban community, your career path, etc. I am happy to try to provide some good advice and resources if you would like. So, do you have any questions so far? I look forward to talking with you :D Cheers, Rachel Mentee 2022-10-28, 10:01: Dear Rachel, Hello, My name is Jeremy Wiebe, I am 15 and I live in northern BC. Some of my hobbies are ski-dooing, dirt biking and hunting. After grad I am planning to go to trades school to get my red seal as a heavy duty mechanic and work at Brant Tractor for the foreseeable future Sincerely, Jeremy Wiebe Mentor 2022-10-30, 12:11: Hi Jeremy, It is nice to get to know more about you! I love skiing and snowboarding, but I have not tried ski-dooing before. It is on my bucklist though. I am glad to hear that you have a plan for your post-secondary education and career. Is there any particular module you would like to start with? I have unlocked all the ones your teacher would like you to complete. If you let me know which one you would like to start with, I will send a message in that module and we can work through it together. Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:31: Dear, Rachel In the last message you sent me you asked if I had any other carrer or educational intrests. So the answer to that question is yes, I would like to go in to equipment operating and possibly in to the logging industry like my father is, or possibly driving big trucks as a hiway hauler hauling things like logs, fuel and oil. Another job I would like to go for is an oil rid worker. Thank you. Jeremy Mentor 2022-11-10, 09:22: Thank you for sharing your interests! I think that it's awesome that you have a variety of options so that you can weigh the pros and cons of each as you do more research and think more about it. Based on our conversation so far, I suggest we move onto the ""post-secondary and career planning"" module as it can be helpful for exploring different careers, although you get the final say on which module we work through first. Which module would you like to do first? Once you let me know the answer, I will leave you a message under that module/activity. Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:22: I am planning to take a dual credit course for heavy duty machanics and I have a plan for it, how would I go about chosing my courses in order to get enough credits for it? Mentor 2023-01-25, 12:01: Hi Jeremy, I am not totally sure what you mean by this. If you mean enough credits to graduate high school, I would talk to a counsellor at your school to make sure you are on track with your credits to graduate on time. If you mean enough credits for post-secondary education, I think your school counsellor could also help you out with this, but generally it's not too difficult to get enough credits each semester to be in a full course load. Once you are enrolled in a post-secondary institution, you will typically get access to an online system which allows you to register in courses and shows you how many courses you are registered in. You can count up the number of credits you are taking and make sure you are in enough each semester. Additionally, post-secondary institutions have advisors that you can see who can double check that you are registered in the right courses each semester. I hope this answers your question! Let me know if there's anything else you would like to ask me!",,,,,

I've heard of a couple of those games but haven't tried...fascinating :) Fair enough - let's see if we can see what direction you could go and how to get there through our chats! Why don't we start in this section then about wellbeing - it's a bit more about mental and emoational health but physical health is super important in this too! Let me know your thoughts on the discussion questions - I can add mine in too! Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:54: HI Kathleen, I usualy end up being bored and have a procrastination habit. I am very calm and enjoy my games a lot. That is what I usually do when I am at home. I sleep 7 hours a day, drink lots of water and get a good amount to exercise walking. Sometimes I will play with friends online. I like to be a home body. I worry about transitioning into an adult because of all the daily responsibilities, such as bills and wokring. Do you have any tips on that or for procrastination as well as any ideas on bordeom that may be similar to gaming. Mentor 2022-11-17, 12:22: Ahhh procrastination - the bane of our existence. Definitely hard to get going with things. Let's see...what do I do...I like lists and checking things off lists - that way I can prioritize what is most important for the day and not forget other important things. Usually if it stays at the bottom of the list long enough I just get rid of it - I'm never going to get to it/it's not important enough to get to any time soon. (this way definitely helped when I was working an admin job and had a buttload of tasks to complete). Another thing I like to do it block off time (either on a calendar or in my head) - like I'm going to do hwk for an hour and then go play for an hour (pomodora timing can be helpful for this too - go google if you don't know what it is!). I find this a lot better than TRYING to do hwk for who knows how long and realize 2 hours later nothing has been done. Setting time apart and scheduling things (like a monthly reminder to pay my credit card bill in my calendar) helps keep me focused in the moment and then get to go do other things. Gotta be realistic though - for example, I know during exam time I basically block off the week before to study (no going out with friends). I don't actually study the entire week but it's the only way for me to get enough studying time when you add in the procrastination... Otherwise sounds like a nicely balanced life to me. Maybe a bit more active stuff (get your heart pumping!) but that's probably the medical student side of me talking about exercise prescriptions XD Let me know what you think about my comments on procrasination and what you think you could try doing! Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:42: Lists are something I don't normally use, it would be a new habit I would have to learn. As well as the calendar and trying to remember thing mentallly only works sometimes. Mentor 2022-12-06, 14:15: Sounds like there's some things you could try out - any one in particular you'd like to try? I definitely get you on the remembering mentally only working sometimes... Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to move to another section! Mentor 2023-01-05, 18:20: Hey Blake! Happy New Year and hope you had a wonderful Christmas break - do anything fun? Just checking in to see if you've gotten a chance to think about the question below or had another section you'd like to look into! Mentor 2023-01-09, 17:09: Hello Blake! Just a quick note - let me know if you're interested in the Meet your Mentor event! I'm not available on Jan 12 (I have class at that time :P) but I can make January 16th 8:30-9:30pm. Lemme know! It'd be pretty cool to chat! Mentor 2023-01-19, 17:46: Hey Blake - hope you've been well. I've heard you only have a couple of classes left - let me know what other sections you'd like to look at/topics to chat about! I'm happy to keep chatting as long as you'd like even after that but want to make sure we don't miss anything!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-19, 18:03: Hello Blaise! It's nice to e-meet you! My name is Kathleen and I'm going to be your mentor! I'm 28 years old and currently a second year medical student at UBC in Vancouver. I see you're interested in gaming - what kind of games? I tend to like strategy more than FPS - like Civilization 6 or Core Keeper. Post-secondary is just a fancy way of saying more school after high school xD. But what is really interesting is what you learn/experience during it and where you go from there! TL;DR for the program: I'll open different topics that you can read and explore - lemme know what you think of them! Also, ask me any questions! Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:44: Hi kathleen. My name is Blaise. I am in grade 10 and my hobbies are gaming. And my goals are to get a job after I graduate. Mentor 2022-10-31, 15:40: Hey Blaise - happy to hear from you! How's grade 10 been for you? Any particular job or interest you're thinking of? - Kathleen Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:28: HI Kathleen, My top 3 games are Elden Ring, Rain World, and God of War. I haven tried the games you mentioned. I havent thought about post education. I would rather go right into the workforce, but I am unsure of what career. I want to dicuss health and well being, more on physcial health. I walk to school everyday, it is about a 15 minute walk. I walk no matter what the weather is and listen to music. My music choice depends on the day and my mood. I enjoy walking when the weather is nice but the winter here are very cold and can make it harder to want to walk.",,,,,

I’ll be your mentor for the next few months. I graduated with a degree in psychology last year. I went to your profile and there wasn’t too to much info so is there anything about yourself that you’d like to share. So I will be unlocking all the required conversations. For each conversation topic, there are anchor texts/videos/pictures and guiding questions to help us out. Usually, I would answer them first and then we do a bit of back and forth. Once you think you’ve gotten the most out of the conversation, then we move on to the next topic. There is also the “Resources” page and section on “Program tutorials” for more instructions on how to go about the program. Also let me know if you have any questions. Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:26: hi Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:20: Hello Jack, nice to meet you! I think we are meant to start on the modules/conversations now, so please click on ""From rural to urban"" on the Conversation wheel. Thanks!

All you have to do is click on the conversation titles above in the Conversation Wheel. And then for each topic, there are guiding texts and questions that will help us talk about the topic. So I started the ""From rural to urban"" conversation and it asked us to talk about what we like and dont like about living in a rural town. And then we just go back and forth until we think we've gained enough from that convo and we move on to the next. But if you want to talk about something else, let me know which topic you want to go with. Mentee 2022-11-14, 12:02: thanks, i found your psychology carear interesting, i dont think its very common for my age but i have a little interest in psychology like how the brain and emotions work and stuff Mentor 2022-11-16, 00:22: Oh that's cool that we share the same interest in psychology! That is the part of psychology I enjoy the most, learning about how our brains and behaviour are connected. Do you have any questions about that? Like careers you can have, or how it was like going through university with psychology as a major? Mentor 2022-12-05, 10:00: Hello again, just following up on my previous message, if you have any questions about psychology. Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:42: no Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:42:  Mentor 2023-01-04, 11:54: No worries, did you want to discuss after high school plans? Any questions not just about school related stuff but just life after high school?

Or if you have any questions about life in a larger city or after high school, I can try to answer them! Also this may be the last message you'll see from me with the program ending. If it is, just wanted to say that it was great chatting with you. I hope I was of help in any way! And good luck on your future endevours!","Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:20: Following the questions on Anchor text #1: 3 things I like about living in a rural area: I like how everything was close to each other, so it didn’t take long to get to school, to work, or anywhere really. I like how almost everybody was familiar, which made it kinda home-y if that make sense. I also like how peaceful it is for the most part. Sometimes urban centres can just be a bit chaotic, so it's nice than in small towns the pace is much calmer. 2 things I don’t like about living in a rural area: I didn’t enjoy that there was barely anything to do, so at times it can be a bit boring. Similar idea where certain things (stores, etc.) are not easily accessible and you have to drive to another town just to have more options for shopping etc. Please share 3 things you like and 2 things you don’t like about living in a rural area. And as the Anchor text said, please feel free to ask me any of the discussion questions.",,,,

Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:18: What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? Mentor 2022-11-10, 09:02: I think my most challenging budgeting issue is trying to find a balance between being responsible with my spending while still making room every once in a while to spend money on fun activities or fun but unnecessary items. As I am currently in school, I do not have a full-time income to rely on, so I try to remind myself to be extra careful with my money during this time. Once I am out of school, there will be more room to treat myself if I want to. Mentor 2022-11-10, 09:06: Do you plan to take any post-secondary education? If so, have you started to think about how you might fund your education? Have you looked into any scholarships or student aid? I know you are in grade 10 right now, so these kinds of questions might not be urgent for you, but I think it can always be helpful to start planning for the future nice and early.","Mentor 2022-10-18, 19:21: Hello Fycher, It is nice to meet you :) My name is Rachel, and I will be your mentor as you work through this program with your class.

Mentor 2022-11-04, 12:43: Those are all really good questions, I'll do my best to answer them! I've been through many times where I have literally no motivation at all to do anything school-related (in fact I just went through another one)! It's completely normal. What I would suggest doing is to try to balance the things you want to do with the things you should do. For example, if you want to talk to your friends, you should try to get some schoolwork done first. Talking to your friends can act as a sort of reward for accomplishing something important. This might not work for you, but it's worth a try! :) I totally get the no motivation to do anything after school. I think a good place to start out would be to purposely set aside some time every day to do homework, starting at 20 minutes and slowly increasing to get into a routine. I find the best time for me to do schoolwork is right after I get home, because when I get it finished I can relax and do the things I want for the rest of the night. I know it doesn't sound very fun but once you get used to it, it'll become super easy. I'm sure you'll start to see your grades improving in no time! I moved way across the country for school, from Ontario to Vancouver. I'm really close with my family, so the first few weeks and even months were really hard for me. I knew nobody in Vancouver so I was completely alone! It was super scary, but I was able to make some friends who I loved being around and it made the experience worth it. I've been lucky to not experience serious financial difficulties, but I know that if you are experiencing this that there are tons of supports and resources out there that you can access. I was able to work a few jobs and save up some money for school, but my family helped me out a lot too. I knew I wanted to go to more school after graduating high school because I set a goal for myself around Grade 10 to become a doctor. That didn't work out, but I figured since I'm in university now I should stick it out and see what other careers I could do. It's perfectly okay to not want to do more school after graduating - I know a lot of people who took a year off to figure themselves out or who went right into their lifelong career. There are so many options available to you! I hope that answers your questions, let me know if there's anything else you're wondering about! Mentee 2022-11-24, 08:15: Good Morning Meaghan Those are all very good and bad things about a city and that cat cafe sounds really cool! When i start going to trade school after high school Im pretty scared t omove to a big city if i have to i seem to like smaller towns better beacuse they are nice and calm and arent as busy as a city. Mentor 2022-11-26, 13:45: I totally get how you feel, I'm the same way too. It is a bit scary but you can take it as an opportunity to get out of your comfort zone and try new things! After you're done school you'll have the freedom to move back to a smaller town if you still prefer that over bigger cities. Moving to a big city helped me realize that I definitely prefer smaller cities/bigger towns, so I'm excited to move back home once I graduate! Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:21: Good afternoon Meaghan These are all very good and useful tips for funding and how to keep track of money and will hopefully help me for when I get older.

Take care!! :) Meaghan",,,,"Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:46: Good afternoon Meaghan What are some of the ways you can keep tabs on the money you have spent or received?What has been the most struggle financially for you since you have gone to college?Do you have a job that supports you or do you get paid while doing schooling?What are some tips and tricks on ways to start saving money early and how to keep it saved? Mentor 2022-12-10, 10:24: Hi Elizabeth! Keeping track of how much money I spend is something I still struggle with. I usually budget how much I want to spend on food or other things each week and try not to go over that amount. It is helpful to go into my bank account and go through my past transactions to keep a record of the money I have spent and received. The most struggle financially that I've experienced is paying for my rent each month as that can be pretty expensive and adds up over time. I do have a part time job at my school which helps pay for my groceries, but other than that I use the money I saved up previously and I also have a lot of help from my parents to pay for other things such as tuition. I don't personally do this but my mom does and it seems to be pretty effective - she keeps a spreadsheet of all the things she spends money on and also her income/other sources of money that are given to her. This way she can visually keep track of everything and she doesn't forget anything. It might be helpful for getting into the mindset of how important saving money is. Hopefully that answered some of your questions - let me know if you want me to go into further detail on anything!","Mentor 2022-10-18, 09:42: Hi Elizabeth, it's nice to meet you!

Another thing I would like is to save money to buy myself a truck before I graduate high school. What I would like to do after graduation Is hopefully get into a trade school for being an operator taking part In the oil and gas industry close but not too close to home. My hobbies are dirt biking,camping,fishing and hunting. I enjoy these things because I have been raised around all of it since I was little. I really enjoy being with my dad and hanging out with him when I can since he works alot,I also really love being with my mom because she always knows how to comfort me when I'm down and likes most of the things I do.

What are the things you like most about the city and dislike? How does the place you live in now differ from your hometown? What did you used to do in your hometown that you can now also do or not do in the city you live in? Was it hard when you left your hometown to go to school ? How did you cope with it? Mentor 2022-11-21, 15:18: The thing I dislike being in a big city most is that everything is so busy. There are people everywhere, public transit is always packed... there's just a lot of stuff going on all the time. That might be perfect for some people, but I'm more of a quiet person so it isn't the greatest environment for me. What I like most is being able to try new things! I love going out to eat at different places and I never get bored. There are also so many things here that I didn't even know existed, like a cat cafe (with literal cats in it). I haven't been there yet, but I definitely want to go see what it's like! My hometown is way smaller than Vancouver, but it's still big enough to have some variety for stores and restaurants and other things like that. I don't think there are a lot of things that I'm not able to do moving from a smaller area to a bigger city, but I do miss hanging out with my family all the time. It was really hard leaving them for the first time, but now that I've been away for over a year it has become a lot easier. I coped by calling them a lot, and making sure that I focused on school so that I didn't spend my time missing them. I've been lucky to visit them a few times over the year, and of course I go back for Christmas break. I actually just flew back home to see them last week!",,"Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:48: Good morning Meaghan How did you do while getting your first job during the interview and on your resume? What were some strateigies you used to do well in your first job? Back in 2022 I got a job working in a shop and I loved it an I think I did super well and always was ready to do whatever I was told and help out with anything I can but I did get let go after about 3 months of working there but because there just wasnt any work for me. Mentor 2023-01-12, 20:36: Hi Elizabeth! I remember my first interview very well, it was super scary and nervewracking but I made sure to talk to my parents a lot about what to expect so I could prepare some answers for typical interview questions beforehand. I also googled a lot of mock interview questions and even watched some YouTube videos which I thought were helpful. It was for a cashier position at a local grocery store and I was 15. My resume was very simple because I didn't have any other work experience, I probably only had that I was a high school student, some of my volunteer experiences, any extracurriculars I was involved in at school, and perhaps an objective statement that indicated my dedication to the job if I was to be hired. I also went in person when I went in to drop off my resume so I met the boss - that's always a good thing to do and it might set you apart from other people applying to the job if you make a good first impression. Although it seems like a simple job, being a cashier required a lot of memorization and I was trained on a few different areas of the store. It was a lot of work at first, and I had a lot of bad days especially when it was super busy or I had negative experiences with customers. I just kept telling myself that it was a job, I was getting paid for it, so I've gotta push through it. Just make sure to reach out for help when you need it. Don't be afraid to ask questions to your supervisors, they usually welcome them! Mistakes happen and that's how you learn. And it wasn't all bad! I made friends with a lot of my coworkers and I have a lot of good memories with them. The highs and lows will come with any job you get, and I learned to accept that. So sorry to hear you were let go, that really sucks. It sounds like you were a really great employee who was very dedicated to the job and a lot of workplaces really value that. At least you were able to get some work experience and make a bit of money. This also puts you in a good position to apply for other jobs now that you can put this experience on your resume! Are there any places you're thinking of applying to or were you planning to take a bit of a break from work for now? One last note that has been super helpful for me is to make sure you have one or two reliable coworkers (preferably a supervisor or boss) who can advocate for your work ethic. A lot of workplaces require references that they contact during the interview process to make sure you're a good worker before they hire you, so it is important to build those relationships in any job that you have so you can use them in the future! I wouldn't worry a ton about that right now since you're just starting off though.",,

Best of luck!",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:13: Can they share any websites or resources for finding scholarships or sources of funding? Mentor 2022-11-09, 14:36: With funding, unfortunately, I don't have specific websites you can share. But I can recommend a couple things. From my experience, our guidance counsellor had a list of scholarships from around town or donors etc. So if you have a guidance counsellor or you can ask the secretary at your school if they have a list of scholarships they know and how to apply. My second suggestion is looking at the website or contacting the school your are applying to. Some schools have a general application form that you can complete and that'll kinda ""enter"" you into that scholarship competition. Some scholarships though may ask for additional documents, so for example they may ask for a resume or a letter stating your leadership skills. Sp sorry I don't have actual websites but definitely ask within your school and contact the school you want to go to. Mentee 2022-11-14, 11:58: i havent really thought about going to univeresty but ive thought about military ( i cant remeber if i told you or not) but i recall hearing from parents and school teachers that going to military when you resign from it they pay for you to go to universety after so thats a benifit.","Mentor 2022-10-23, 22:51: Hi there, I’m Jihanne. I’ll be your mentor for the next few months. I graduated with a degree in psychology last year. I read through your profile and unfortunately I don’t know too to much about hockey. But hopefully we can connect on other things. So I will be unlocking all the required conversations. For each conversation topic, there are anchor texts/videos/pictures and guiding questions to help us out. Usually, I would answer them first and then we do a bit of back and forth. Once you think you’ve gotten the most out of the conversation, then we move on to the next topic. There is also the instructions above or the “Resources” page and section on “Program tutorials” for more instructions on how to go about the program. Also let me know if you have any questions. Mentee 2022-10-26, 09:22: can i get your number bbg;) Mentee 2022-10-26, 09:57: (not trying to sound rude) but how come me and you got matched and i wanna do hockey/military kinda makes no sense at all Mentor 2022-10-26, 21:16: Sorry, I don't think we are supposed to be sharing other contact info. We're only meant to talk to each other on Mentor City. But totally fair question about being matched. I recognize that it is a bit of an odd match but we could've been matched for a number of reasons, maybe they just didn't have enough mentors that matched your interests, or maybe there just wasn't enough mentors in general. But hopefully, I can still be helpful to you. Even though we're taking different paths, perhaps I can still share some of my experiences out of high school that will still benefit you. Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:48: Hello Jihanne My name is Donald. I play hockey, and soft ball. I am also in grade 10 around two months in the year so far. I live in northern B.C surrounded by beautiful mountains. What I want to do is either play professional Hockey or join the Military after I graduate. My goals are to make the team I am going to try out for in early 2023. Sincerely Donald Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:52: where do you go to school? Mentor 2022-10-31, 00:09: It's great meeting you, Donald. What team are you trying out for? And I attended the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George. Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:08: i am trying out for fort saint john u18 trackers i was gonna try out for kamloops u17 triple A blazers but that is to far from home so if i play in FSJ my family can make a weekend trip to come and watch me. i also played a few hockey tournements in prince george. Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:22: That makes sense! Good luck on try outs! But I think we are meant to start on the modules/conversations now, so please click on ""From rural to urban"" on the Conversation wheel. Thanks! Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:24: how is prince george school? Mentor 2022-11-09, 14:41: So I went to UNBC and I really enjoyed my experience. UNBC is considered a small university, which meant there are small class sizes. But that is a benefit to the students cause that means you are able to connect with your profs more. To give you an idea, I think the biggest classes I had were close to 200 people, but in larger schools like UBC that's the norm. As the years went on, my class became like high school size classes. And there are lots of free supports within the school for any subject (tutoring, writing help) and for personal well-being too. The location is nice too because I was able to stay close to home. I think PG offers the same benefits of a small town but with the amenities that bigger towns have. There is another school in Prince George called College of New Caledonia (CNC). I don't know too too much about it but I've heard it's a great school too. Mentee 2022-11-15, 13:18: i havent really thought about going to univeresty but ive thought about military ( i cant remeber if i told you or not) but i recall hearing from parents and school teachers that going to military when you resign from it they pay for you to go to universety after so thats a benifit. Mentor 2022-11-16, 00:20: Yes, you have mentioned going to the military. And I have a cousin who is in the US Air Force, which would be a different from the Canadian military, but she has benefited from getting some schooling paid for so I'm guessing it's probably similar to Canada. I think they had some ""in house"" training where she was trained as a radiologist/someone who does x-rays. So maybe even while in the military you can get help with schooling. And I have also heard that when you retire, there are great benefits. Is there a specific branch you want to go to in the military? Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:40: i am trying to do infantry i do have some family past of military my great grandpa was a sniper in i bielive world war 1 or 2 or a different war i cant recall which one it was but it was one of the wars. Mentor 2022-11-18, 17:55: Oh wow, that's cool and not to sound to cheesy, but brave as well that that's the branch you want to go into. I'm guessing your great grandpa inspired you to joined the military, but what else inspired you to choose this path? Mentee 2022-11-21, 11:50: no i dont sound cheesy haha but also about the military and all i havent had no motivation behind it. its always been something that intrested me and ive been planning on doing it for the past 6 years ive found that if i can live in this great country then i can fight for this country Mentor 2022-11-23, 10:39: Again, definitely a very brave thing to do! So thanks in advance for your service! Have you looked into the steps you need to do to be able to enlist? Mentee 2022-11-25, 13:08: since i am an aboriginal student also there is this program that taks place in prine george for aboriginal student its a boot camp its a lil head start to getting the fitness levels in for the military, after when i turn 17 i am going to get parent consent to join infantry because at age 17 you just need parents consent to join. Mentor 2022-11-26, 20:42: Oh I see, so the first step is getting your fitness sorted and that good that there's one in Prince George so sorta close. Are there other requirements? Mentor 2022-12-05, 10:01: Hi again, just wondering if you'd had a chance to read my previous message. Mentee 2022-12-05, 11:52: hi sorry was busy with some of my school work and hockey yes there is other rrequirements i havent got a chance to look into but there is a few common ones i know they are 15 pull ups max which is easy 100 push ups and so on just basic fitness. But the military is a second option only if my hockey career doesnt work out i am planning on going to FSJ within these 3-4 months coming up and hopfully i make it. Mentor 2022-12-08, 21:21: No worries at all. But that makes sense, having a plan A and a plan B is good. Will you be living alone in FSJ or with a billet family? Fort St John is still a rural town but it is bigger than Fort Nelson so do you have some questions about more ""urban"" life? Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:44: hello sorry for the long wait for an answer haha my chrome book broke my desk fell on it lmao but yeah about the question what we would be doing is my mum and dad would get a small apartment and id be living with my cousin adn i would probaly also get a job well down there to pay for some things like food and what not becasue id like for it to also be like an expirnece of having to pay for rent and food and bills if that makes sense Mentor 2023-01-14, 14:53: No worries, but darn hopefully your laptop is okay! Sounds like a pretty solid plan. But it's helpful having someone that you already know in town. They can help you with getting around and learning the new place. I think it's also great of you to want to work and pay your way. It will give you good practice of what it's like living on your own. Do you know what kind of job you'll want to have? Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:52: i am thinking for the type of job i would look for is something like a grocery store or a theater because i have back round knowledge from both plus i am still working at a grocery store, there easy to work at get 5 hours a day after school Mentor 2023-01-19, 09:44: That makes sense. I used to work at a grocery store too and I find it wasn't stressful and the hours a pretty flexibly which I'm guessing is necessary for hockey. Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:13: yeah grocery stores are nice to work in since also my employees in the grocery department are all my age so its fun to work with them. also about the hockey thing i found out my dad wants me to go and try and try out for the prince george cougars. because he thinks im good enough for it and plus i do have lots of family down there. Mentor 2023-01-25, 19:10: Yes, I remember it being fun working at a grocery store because exactly that you end up working with people your age and it's usually pretty chill! But that's really cool about trying out for PG Cougars! Best of luck with that! If you do end up in PG, personally I found the vibe to not be so different from small towns. Yes, it's definitely bigger and it's nice that it has more stores and things to do, but I didn't find it hard to adjust to living in PG after living in a small town for so long. And I find you can still go to places in like 10-15 mins so not so bad for travelling/traffic. It will also be helpful that there will be a lot of familiar faces if you have family here! Also this may be the last message you'll see from me with the program ending. If it is, just wanted to say that it was great chatting with you! Thank you for trusting me and sharing your future plans. I hope I was of help in any way! And good luck on your future endeavours! Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:52: yesh thanks alot for all the help Jihanne i wish you best of luck in school still i hope all well in your future it was great chatting with you for the duration of time we did. if i do make the prince george cougars i will be sure to contact you on mentor city if your still on it lol. roger 6 going dark sincerley donald","Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:22: Following the questions on Anchor text #1: 3 things I like about living in a rural area: I like how everything was close to each other, so it didn’t take long to get to school, to work, or anywhere really. I like how almost everybody was familiar, which made it kinda home-y if that make sense. I also like how peaceful it is for the most part. Sometimes urban centres can just be a bit chaotic, so it's nice than in small towns the pace is much calmer. 2 things I don’t like about living in a rural area: I didn’t enjoy that there was barely anything to do, so at times it can be a bit boring. Similar idea where certain things (stores, etc.) are not easily accessible and you have to drive to another town just to have more options for shopping etc. Please share 3 things you like and 2 things you don’t like about living in a rural area. And as the Anchor text said, please feel free to ask me any of the discussion questions.",,,,

1047583027,9/22/2022 10:53,1047584570,55600,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-23, 13:15: Hi Kendyl, I know it can be pretty overwhelming looking at all the options, it is completely understandable to have no idea in a career at this point. I browsed through some of the videos they provide (I remember these exact videos from when I was in highschool lol), I think a medical researcher would be most similar to Health policy researchers, consultants and program officers (NOC 4165). These jobs are very broad across all disciplines of science, you could be doing something with drug development, testing, new medical techniques or tools. Another way to get involved with medical research would be a University Professor or Lecturer. Lots of professors, also do research, some will do mostly classes and teaching, but some may only teach one or two courses and do mostly research. Sometimes the research done by professors and their labs create spin off companies from their work that would employ researchers similar to the first jobs I mentioned. Although this would probably have less oppurtunity for patient involvement if that is what you're interested in. There is also Medical laboratory technologists (NOC 3211) that could be an option if you like the hands on, being in the lab aspect of research. Mentee 2022-10-24, 18:00: Hi Elise, Thanks for the advice on career options. Also, let me know if I am answering the questions properly for the discussion questions. Dream career: In order to become a Health policy researcher you must acquire a bachelor's degree in health science, public administration, recreation administration or social science. Then receive a graduate degree in health, social science or an administrative discipline. They also say to have some years of experience in the health field, such as a health care professional or as a community or social service worker. Some of the programs that they mentioned are: Environmental/Occupational Health, Health Care Administration, Health/Medical - General, Human Kinetics/Kinesiology/Physical Education, and a few others. General career: To become a psychologist you must complete a doctoral degree in psychology and gain supervised practical experience. Then register with the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, by completing a 12-month internship and passing written and oral exams. Some benefits to attending post-secondary are that you gain knowledge on different career paths, you learn essential life skills, and it shows commitment and dedication to an interest. Some factors that might make attending post-secondary difficult are the costs of school and living, the length of schooling for more specialised careers, and the going to school far from home and family. I am feeling pretty good about taking a bachelor's degree because it is only 4 years but I am concerned about taking further courses due to the costs. I am looking forward to it because it will be a new and exciting experience. I will also be on my own so it will be very different and a great learning experience. I do believe that both the careers are achievable although I do believe that my dream career would require a lot of hard work and dedication. Question: Can you share your path to your current post-secondary program? Have you hanged programs, schools or careers along the way? Did you transfer from a college to a university? Was the length of schooling a deciding factor for your career in mind? Mentor 2022-10-24, 19:08: Hellooo, Your responses look good to me. About my path to post secondary, I was always interested in science and medicine so getting a bachelors degree and going to med school seemed like a good choice. I did end up in a undergrad program I didn't think I would and for that I would say always go for what looks interesting to you, don't worry about taking an unconventional path to your career. My career goal does take a long time, and because of that I am planning to take one gap year at least once I finish my Bachelor's degree, as a break and also to help with the finiancial aspect of doing graduate schooling. Mentee 2022-10-27, 17:58: Hi Elise, I think a bachelor of science degree would be the best fit for me and it is very diverse. Do you have any suggestions for schools or other programs that you think would be good? Mentor 2022-10-28, 13:02: Hii, From what I've heard from you, it sounds like you would suit a Bachelor's in Science pretty well. If you are into new medical technology development, you might like Biomedical Engineering, a program here at UBC Van. They'll focus on producing medical tech, so they incorporate electronics, manufacturing and coding with medical applications and research. I don't know very much about how science programs vary from school to school UBC/UBCO has good programs and research if you're interested in that. SFU science program is also ranked pretty well. Are you wanting to stay in BC or are you looking at other provinces too? Mentee 2022-10-31, 22:31: Message: Anchor text two Mentor 2022-11-01, 23:06: Hi Kendyl, Hope you enjoyed your Halloween! Unfortunately I can't access the file you sent me :( Is it possible if you could post it here on the message board? I think sharing emails goes against the privacy rules. If you've figured out a way to share pdf or word doc files on here, that would be great too. I'll reach out and ask about how to do that because I'm not to sure myself. Mentor 2022-11-06, 23:42: Hi Kendyl, I apologize for the late reply. Your document looks great to me. I'm glad to see that biomedical engineering was interesting to you. Your information looks good. You asked at the bottom about the extra year before starting biomedical engineering at UVIC. I believe that UBC is the same way. The first year is general for all of engineering. Then going into second year you apply for a specific faculty, which is when you would begin biomedical engineering. The third year of your degree you would specialize within biomedical engineering (you can see the four different streams here https://you.ubc.ca/ubc_programs/biomedical-engineering/). Another thing to consider about the engineering program is coop. This is typically 16 months of paid work experience, at usually 3 to 4 different jobs. At UVIC it is required, and at UBC I am pretty sure it is optional but highly recommended and the large majority of students do coop. So with coop both programs would become a 5 year degree. It helps with financing your degree but the extra year is something to consider. If you are looking for a program that is more biology based, I think just looking at the list of required courses would be most telling. I am curious to know where you stand with each program, on a scale how much are you leaning towards them. In the document it seemed like you were leaning towards UBC because of the program. How much do you consider the university and the city itself to be a factor. Look forward to hearing from you! Mentor 2022-11-09, 13:35: Hi Kendyl, Thats great you think you'll stick to science (I can't say I'm a little biased). If the hands on manufacturing and applications attracted you to biomedical engineering, just know that there are ways to explore this in a science degree as well. If you're considering coop, you can look for jobs like that, or join clubs. There is also a biotechnology degree available I forgot to mention that might interest you, it is a joint BCIT and UBC program. You certainly don't have to decide on a specialization anytime soon, just know that there are a lot of different directions you can take with a science degree. Doing your first year in Alberta could be a good option if you want to close to home, and might be an easier transition to university. Transitioning to university and living all on your own is a big deal, but is doable. Everyone handles it differently, and you probably know best what works best for you. You may have to put in a bit more effort looking into different oppurtunies (UBC coop, the programs here, clubs etc) here at UBC if you spend first year somewhere else. With that said, I spent my first year online from home and didn't get to explore my degree much. I am not very knowledgable on transfer credits, I would direct you to UBC science advising (https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising), they should be able to give you a better answer. If some credits don't transfer, I imagine you could come to UBC early and spend the summer taking any courses that didn't transfer. But I would definitely run that by science advising to check if I were you. 4 courses during the summer would be most you could take. Hope this helps a bit. Mentee 2022-11-13, 13:29: Hi Elise, Sorry about the late reply it has been a super busy week for me. You mentioned a few interesting things, can you explain a bit more about what the coop program is? I keep seeing it as an option, is it mandatory? Do you have to do coop every year if you chose to do it? If I did do my first year in Alberta I would make sure all my courses transfer, otherwise I don't feel like it would be worth it if I had to end up doing courses over the summer anyways. Also, would I be able to go right into my second year of some of the science programs at UBC? What programs would I be eligible for? Would I for sure need to take summer courses? Mentor 2022-11-14, 13:49: Hi Kendyl, Coop is a really great option, most professors you'll talk to highly recommend it. Although I was considering it, I personally chose against coop because I want to go to medical school, and coop is good for experience in lab/industry jobs mostly. I also had to think about giving myself time to write the MCAT. With that said, its a good chance to explore available jobs in the field before you graduate. It also is a great resume builder and a big help in getting jobs after graduation. Depending on the major you choose, coop will start the summer after 2nd year and the coop terms are more dispersed throughout the rest of your degree, or it starts the summer after 3rd year, and you complete all 16 months at once (summer term, both school terms, then summer again, then you come back to complete you're 4th year). Most people work with 2 to 3 companies throughout the 16 months. Its full time work, so you typically don't do courses at the same time (although you can get approved to do one course at a time if needed). There are a lot of coops here in Vancouver, but there is an opportunity to take jobs elsewhere in Canada or internationally. Here's the link to the science coop website: https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/ About the course transfer credits, I'm really not to knowledgeable. It was not something that I researched when I was entering university. You'll have to look at the second year requirements for your top choices of majors, and get a list of courses from there that you'll need to check if they can transfer. I think your best source of info would be advising, at either university. Sorry I can't be more helpful here :( I'm not 100% certain about anything and I don't want to give you inaccurate info. Mentor 2022-11-14, 13:55: Hi Kendyl, Sorry, I just send a reply but it got flagged by the system, and says it needs to get checked by the program administrator. I'll ask about it, but it may take another day or so to get a reply. Sorry for the techinical difficulty! Mentee 2022-11-15, 15:51: No worries! Mentor 2022-11-16, 12:45: Hi Kendyl, it should be below now. Also let me know if would like me to open up another module for you. We can continue this discussion here, while you can get some work done on that in the meantime, if you want to. What is your rough timeline for completing this course? Mentee 2022-11-18, 10:39: Yes, I would like to open up an other module, please chose what you think would be most beneficial for me at this point. I have been quite behind on completing everything and I would like to possibly complete the course before the Christmas holidays. Do you think that is reasonable? Should I complete it sooner? Mentor 2022-11-20, 16:48: Hi Kendyl, I've opened up Career Exploration for you, I think it would be a good continuation of the discussion we've been having. You can ask me questions whenever about programs and coop as I know you are in the process of applying now. I think Christmas is doable, but possibly a little ambitious. I'll try my best to reply quickly, but my responses may become a little slower during finals season (Dec 7 to 20 roughly). Mentee 2022-11-22, 16:14: Great, thank you! I wasn't sure what the appropriate time frame would be but no worries if you can't reply quickly, I know that time is busy for you and I am flexible. The coop program sounds really interesting and I think that would be a really good idea to do while studying abroad. I would love to do an exchange year in maybe my 2nd or 3rd year and I feel like it would be the perfect opportunity to do coop as well! I will get started on the Career Exploration!",,"Mentee 2022-11-28, 16:01: Hi Elise, Discussion Questions: Your Values Your Career Values - Some of my main values are being able to spend time with family and friends, staying healthy and active as well as practicing my passions. Community - I do enjoy volunteering in my community but something else I have started doing that has contributed to my community is coaching at my cheer gym. I became a fully certified coach over the summer and have started coaching my team and building our routine. Being able to work with youth has brought me lots of joy but also shifted my perspective on many things. I have also faced the struggle of being the younger and less experienced coach where my work and knowledge are often undermined. Careers - As I mentioned above I would love to stay involved with my family and friends while working full time and I would I like to consider a career working with children. I never thought I would consider working with kids but I have also found how important the voices of young kids are. Kids are in such vulnerable states where mental health can play a huge role in their lives that I would love to be that person that they can rely on. A possible career could be a doctor that works with kids (pediatrician). - I don't know many other jobs in the healthcare field that work with youth... Do you have any suggestions? Mentor 2022-11-29, 16:04: Hi Kendyl, These answers look great to me, nice job relating your interests to career choices (and congrats on being a coach :). I know when I was in highschool sometimes answering these questions felt a little silly, but its good practice to continually be asking yourself what you are or aren't enjoying (especially in university). As for careers in healthcare that work with children, I'm no expert but I know that you were asking about medical research. I imagine there are careers in research, maybe testing and implementing new technologies or treatments made for children, that would allow you to work closely with children. There are also many specializations of pediatrician too, so there would certainly be careers that you can work with children not in the typically hospital-check-up situation. Mentee 2022-12-04, 11:47: Hi Elise, I was having trouble sending my message again but hopefully you can see it now! Anchor text 2 Discussion Questions Physicians assistant: Strong personal interest? I have always been interested in health care and have considered becoming a physician or a specialized physician. Although, it does require a lot of schooling and money which is why I am researching the step-down, a physician's assistant. A physician assistant would be a step down from a physician but would still do many of the tasks that a physician would do. I am interested in this career because of my interest in healthy living and fitness. Work/life balance? I found this career interesting because many people said that a PA has high job satisfaction and life balance. This can be because they have slightly less responsibility than an MD. Financial security? A PA's starting salary is around $80,000 a year, this is a very reasonable salary and is manageable. Comparing this salary to one of an MD it is significantly less but a PA spends less money and time on schooling. Opportunity/job security? Comparing a PA to an MD, an MD would definitely have a wider variety of opportunities and options as well as more independence and autonomy. That does not mean that a PA does not have opportunities because it is a fairly new occupation and is still under development and I believe that there would be many opportunities available with this career. Location? Although PAs can not practice in BC I believe that they will in the near future given that it is a very in-demand job. PAs can practice in Alberta which is definitely an option for me given that I have family there and it is close to home. Have you ever considered becoming a PA? What made you choose your career path? Was anything holding you back from choosing your path, how did you overcome this? Mentor 2022-12-07, 10:53: Hi Kendyl, I have never considered becoming a PA only becuase I actually didn't hear about it until I read your message! It sounds like a great job oppurtunity, I enjoyed learning about it from your summary. I am surprised that they cannot practice in BC yet, especially with the shortage of doctors we are having. But I agree with you that they will probably be able to work here soon. I think I chose my career path mostly out of interest. I really enjoyed science and medicine but it was also important to me to feel fulfilled in my career, to be able to see the positive impact I was having. Although I know I want to be doctor, I don't know what kind, so it is important to me to have lots of oppurtunity to explore in the field. I would also love the oppurtunity to practice in some third world countries as well. Obstacles to becoming a doctor for me are mainly the length of the study, the financial cost, and the possible burnout that may come from such a long degree. So for me I chose to finish my undergrad in 4 years, and not to do coop, then I would be able to take a gap year before medical school. This should help with the financial cost as well. All your answer look great to me, good work on this one! Let me know what module you wanted to get started on next and I can open it up :) Mentor 2023-01-03, 09:45: Hi Kendyl, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I hope you had a fun and relaxing time over the holidays. I heard high schools were starting back up today so I hope your return to school is treating you well. I'll be checking my email regularly now so that you can get back to work on the course. It seems that when we left off, we were just finishing up the career exploration module. We can keep discussing that if you had any remaining questions, but if you like I can open up a new module for you. Cheers, Elise Mentor 2023-01-15, 10:32: Hi Kendyl, How are you? Just wanted to say hello and touch base with you. I realize that you're probably heading into exam season so I'm guessing you may be a little swamped right now. Let me know what your plan is for this course, if and when you would like to pick it back up. I'll be checking my emails regularly so reach out whenever. But feel free to take a break if you need and good luck with any finals you may have! Cheers, Elise",,,"Mentee 2022-10-18, 22:22: Hi there! I'm Kendyl. I looked over your profile and it looks like we have a few things in common. I am currently undecided on what program I want to take a university but I, as well have always been interested in medicine and health sciences. Last year I took physics 11 and it was hard but I did enjoy it and I am planning on taking physics 12 next semester. If you have any encouraging tips I am all ears because I heard that physics 12 is much harder and I am now starting to dread doing it. On the other hand, I am currently taking anatomy and physiology 12 and I am really liking it, I have always been interested in the human body and how it functions. Although, I'm not sure if biology is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Something I have been thinking about recently is doing medical research (if that's even a thing) on new techniques and technology. Maybe something to do with gene therapy, it sounded like you were interested in finding new techniques in the medical field so if you have any suggestions that would be great! Sorry, I am kinda all over the place, haha but I am excited to meet you and get started on this program! Mentor 2022-10-19, 14:12: Hello Kendyl! Its so nice to meet you! I took a look over your profile and I'm excited to get to know you (cheerleading sounds soo cool, I'd love to hear about it). It sounds we had the same favourite subjects in highscool. I wasn't too excited for physics 12 either before I took it. I would say it is harder than physics 11 but I personally found the content more interesting. There's also lots of great youtube videos on the topics and practice problems online that are helpful. If you're doing lots of practice problems you'll do great. Anatomy and physiology was one of my favourite courses in high school so I'm glad to hear you like it too. Medical research is very cool, and certainly a thing, a very big thing. Its a really broad field, and most life science subjects have at least some applications in medicine. Gene therapy is a really up and coming field that would be great to get involved in. There is a ubc prof, Pieter Cullis, who is known for developing the lipid nano particle, which is pretty much a very efficient delivery system for gene therapy (was used in the covid vaccine). Might be a fun google search for you. It sounds like you're interested in a lot of cool things. I like to ramble about science things so please ask away if you have any questions. Thanks for reaching out first, I apologize for the late response time on my part, I had a midterm this morning so I should be more available moving forward. On that note, let me know what times work best for you, if you want to set aside a block of time each week to work on the program, or if you want to do it in smaller bits throughout the week. I'm pretty flexible, I'll let you know when I have midterms coming up and may be quiet for a day or two. This is my first time mentoring so I'll be figuring this out with you. I think we can go ahead and get started on the program, what module would you like to start with? Mentee 2022-10-20, 23:53: Hi Elise! Thanks for the tips, I will definitely be looking into some things you mentioned! I am ready to get started on the program as well and I think splitting it up into smaller parts might be easier. I am available Mondays and Wednesdays after 4, I can also do Tuesdays and Thursdays but I have cheer practice at 7 so before then but after I get out of school (4 ish) is fine too. I am available on the weekends too so let me know what works best for you. Sorry about the late response, I had a few unit tests and assignments due this week so I was busier than usual. I think a good place to start would be Post-secondary and Career planning because I would like to start applying to universities soon and would love some advice! Mentor 2022-10-22, 13:07: Hi Kendyl, I am free Monday and Wednesday at 5:30 ish, so I'll try to be online during those evenings. I was wondering when you hoped to finish this course? A few weeks I'll check in with you about the pace, and we can either just do either Monday or Wednesday or add some time on the weekend. I should let you know that I have two midterms this week on wed and thurs so I may be a little distant this week but I will try to keep up. The post secondary conversation module is open now for you. To start off the discussion, once you finish with the module, I am curious to hear what you are looking forward to most about post secondary school. Looking forward to starting the program! Mentee 2022-10-22, 18:01: Hi Elise, I started on the first anchor text and am unsure what career I should choose because I honestly have no idea what I want to do. I know I mentioned to you that I thought some career in medical research would be cool, so do you have any suggestions on specific jobs? I have time to work more on this tomorrow and we can also work more on it Monday and Wednesday as you mentioned. Mentor 2022-11-01, 23:05: Hi Kendyl, Hope you enjoyed your Halloween!

Mentee 2022-11-08, 17:33: Hi Elise, I am definitely leaning more toward the UBC program just because I was more drawn to how they described the program and the courses involved (even though they are very similar). I am leaning more toward Vancouver because its a little bit closer to home and my sister is already at UBC. After doing a bit more research I am not sure that engineering is what I want to do. I am thinking that I just want to start off doing a bachelor of science degree so that I could get an idea of what I am interested in. Something else I a looking into is doing my first year of science at the Northwestern Polytechnique college in Grande Prairie, Alberta. I am considering this because it would be a lot closer to home, a lot cheaper and the living expenses would be cut down because I could stay with my grandparents. What is your opinion on this? Do you know if UBC takes transfer credits from Alberta? Mentor 2022-11-25, 17:19: No worries, Doing a coop abroad can be a good option. It allows you to spend a bit more time exploring whenever you are than a school term would (although if you do plan to go abroad for a school term, its good to plan ahead and give yourself a lighter term, but you don't have to worry about that for now). Mentor 2023-02-12, 19:12: Hi Kendyl, Hope your school year is going well. It's been a while since I've heard from you (sorry it's been a while since my last message as well). I've reached out to the Ementoring staff, if you would still like to complete the course just let me know. If not, or you've gotten too busy, thats is totally fine too.

Also to actually care about their feelings and thoughts, it would feel horrible to not have someone to talk to. The most difficult teaching would be honesty, cause we can be truthful but not honest. Honesty I think is where you tell the whole truth of a situation. Truth is where you only be truth about one specific thing. It's hard being honest but I think we need to be more honest, it'd make a big difference in society in my opinion. how can living by the seven teachings help you succeed during post secondary school and while adulting? which of the seven teachings have you struggled with, and what have you done to improve in that area?

I really love cats which is why I volunteered at that cat shelter but I sadly do not have any pets :( Hopefully, when I have my own place, I can get a few cats. Do you have any pictures of them? Of course! I'd be more than happy to provide feedback. I'm very open to your feedback as well, especially from a fellow poet. I've attached two of my poems. Mentor 2022-10-28, 01:27: The poems are saved to my portfolio so you should be able to see it on the top right of this page Mentor 2022-10-28, 01:31: how can living by the seven teachings help you succeed during post secondary school and while adulting? I think living by his seven teachings not only helps us succeed during post-secondary and adulting but also in life. The values he mentioned, in my opinion, reflect strength of character. making sure to love and respect others, working on being courageous and honest, making humility and truth as part of your lifestyle, and using wisdom to view life is not easy for a reason. As you mentioned, being honest would make a big impact in society. These values allow us to act with integrity and to view others with an open mind. I also believe these values help us gain happiness and reflect on what is happiness, leading to long-term stability. which of the seven teachings have you struggled with, and what have you done to improve in that area? As I’ve grown older, I think I struggled with being courageous as I transitioned from high school to university. There’s this phenomenon called the Big-fish–little-pond effect. Essentially, we judge ourselves with our immediate peers and our self concept is developed by the people around us. However, in high school, I don’t think we’re exposed to a lot of different situations or people. Once you leave that “little pond”, it can be overwhelming being thrown into a “big pond” where everything seems so different. I used to be super shy in high school but I wanted to be someone who wasn’t afraid to experience new things. It’s all part of growing up but really meeting new people and putting myself in unfamiliar ground really helped me build up my courage. Before we move on, there are some additional questions for the 6000 year old village video. Once we complete that, we can move on to well being and self care! Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:26: Heyyy I really loved your poems, Defenestrate really spoke to me, for me it has a deeper connection like the pain, and the decieving.

They are overall very good, it made my morning to be honest, I always love a good poem but TWO makes it better, thank you. I'll figure out how to attach a few of mine for you to read.

Someone who has lived on the land would think about the memories it has, not the more scientific ways of thinking of the land. The place I live at is pretty empty besides nature, it holds a lot of memories for my family, I've been told many stories about it. For example my grandma has grown up there and her mom had lived there for sometime, later on had a house built just for her amnd the rest of the family. So in my opinion most people would respect the land more if they know the stories and connections to the land they are on, but not so much if they didn't know much about the land or know if smeone has a connection to the land. how have the classes in your program used ""scientific"" versus ""traditional"" knowledge? how does this compare to high school classes? how about your connection to your land? How does it compare to mine? Mentor 2022-11-05, 20:21: how have the classes in your program used ""scientific"" versus ""traditional"" knowledge? how does this compare to high school classes? When you think University, most people would assume that scientific knowledge is highly valued over traditional knowledge. However, as someone who studied in the arts, my courses did well to stress the importance of “traditional” knowledge especially through culture and history. Of course, my experience would differ from the other students but I took a few history, anthropology, language, etc courses – all of which emphasized the importance of valuing different “ways of knowing”. In high school, I would say I experienced the same thing but to a lessor degree since there wasn’t much time to focus on other cultures. Nonetheless, I was lucky enough to have teachers that also valued traditional knowledge. how about your connection to your land? How does it compare to mine? I think it’s beautiful living on land that has gone through generations of your family. I’m sure your grandmother must have exciting stories to tell. I moved around a lot when I was younger (believe it or not – a total of 11 times!), so I never got the chance to make memories or form a connection to the land around me.

I'll go ahead and unlock the next conversation: Well-Being and Self-Care",,"Mentor 2022-11-05, 20:30: Hey Hey! Here's the next topic. Again, let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you had a good Halloween weekend! Sadly, I didn't get to do anything crazy with my friends but I did get to play with some sparklers for the first time ever. One thing I really miss from my youth (lol I sound like an old man) is dressing up and going trick-or-treating. Mentor 2022-11-26, 00:21: Hi Magdeline! Just wanted to check in since it's been a while since we last talked. Did you do anything exciting recently? I got a new PC and it's coming this weekend so I'm super excited : )",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-11, 12:36: Hi, Magdeline! Nice to finally meet you :) My name is Lisa and I'll be your mentor for the next few months. I recently graduated with a degree in English Literature and Language at UBC but I'm back for accounting. I see on your profile that you like creative writing as well! Do you write poems in your spare time? As for photography, I took a lot of photos when I was part of the yearbook club but I wouldn't say I'm an expert at it. If you have any tips for beautiful photos, I'd love to hear them. Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be more than happy to answer!! Some other things about meee - I eat a ton of Korean food. It has to be my favourite though I'm usually pretty open to trying new things. I tried beef tartar with my friends and, surprisingly, it was quite good. My friends aren't that open to ""interesting"" foods but how about you? Weirdest thing you've ever had or want to try? A quote that I really like is from J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be"". I think it's important to remember that our fate is within our hands. As we grow, it's up to us to make the decisions best for us. Culturally, I was born in a household where emotions were seen as a weakness and, looking at this quote, I know that I'm not bound by my birth. Or, at least, that's my take on it. What do you think? Mentee 2022-10-25, 11:09: Hi, my name is magdeline but um feel free to call me mag or mags which ever works,it's a bit of a late start for me doing this, my apologies. When I was viewing your profile I noticed that you used to write poetry, I find that really cool because I also really like poetry. I haven't met many poeple who also liked poetry or viewed poetry like I do. I also like reading, and it's great that you want to become a YA author, I hope it works out well. Also you worked in a cat shelter, I love cats, but I think I'm more of a dog person now. I don't really know what else to say but one thing about me is that I LOVE poetry, I mostly write it rather than read it. It's a pleasure to meet you! :) Mentor 2022-10-25, 20:44: Hi Mags! No worries : ) I'm happy to hear from you. I've also noticed that not many people are into poetry nowadays which makes it even more exciting to connect with you. If you're ok with sharing, I'd love to read some of your work. Do you have any pets? It looks like your teacher would like us to get through: Different Ways of Knowing Well-Being and Self-Care Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning And one conversation of your choice! Do any of them interest you? If not, no worries. You can also choose something later. Just let me know. I'll go ahead and unlock the first one and we can start that together :) Mentor 2022-11-02, 04:19: Thank you so much! I'm glad you enjoyed my poems : ) Honestly, I haven't written anything in sooo long but I might pick it up again. I'm very excited to see your cats and read your poems. It's like a double gift haha Mentee 2022-11-03, 11:27: Heyy heh no need to thank me! It's nice to have a break from stuff even if we do enjoy it and I hope you do start writing again. I'll share one of my poems now and the cats later",,,,,

It is my understanding that Thursday is the last day you are required to continue with this program, so I thought I would open the wrapping up module for us to work through! Part of this module is: 1. Me providing some post-secondary advice (I have included a list below the line!), and, 2. most importantly, feel free to ask any questions you have for me, even after Thurs. (there are seriously no stupid questions)!! 3. After the above are done, we can complete the wrapping up survey :D Janaki :) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My advice for post-secondary: When researching universities/colleges and what programs are offered, make an excel spreadsheet to keep all the info organized Look for scholarships/awards offered externally (aka outside your school) and also ask your school counsellors what financial resources are available to you Express your worries, questions and concerns to a trusted adult or a friend--it is SUPER important you don't feel alone in the process (feel free to reach out to me on MentorCity after Thurs if you need!) Try to have a mini to-do list for each day of the week so you can keep yourself on track (it's ok if you don't complete everything on the list!) Since you are interested in creating art, I'm sure you might know this already, but try to make a portfolio/collection of your work. So, if you ever decide to apply to an art school you can show your work!","Mentor 2022-10-17, 13:00: Hi Ariel, That's so cool that you have started to incorporate backgrounds into your drawings! And I'm glad to hear that your year is going well so far! I have opened up the Wellbeing and Self-Care module for us. I thought we could each share what we think are some important tips from the anchor text article and then do the discussion questions, if that is ok with you? I think it's super important that the article mentions building healthy habits and communicating about mental health. I'm sure you probably know that as a student (whether you are in high school or uni), life can get really overwhelming sometimes and it's always a good idea to reach out and get yourself the help you need to de-stress!! Like talking to a trusted person, or using the mental health services that are available to you. What were somethings that the article mentioned that stood out to you? (And if you have any questions, feel free to ask!) Janaki :D Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:40: Hii! Yea, thats okay and I think a few of the tips i thought were important is, focusing on positivity, maintaining connections and remembering the basics Because for me and a lot of people i know, these help the most! Ariel :&gt; Mentee 2022-10-25, 14:25: Thank you, i apreciate the info and yea thursday is! Mentor 2022-10-25, 14:32: Hi again! Great! Should we continue on and both of us complete the program wrapping up survey? Even though we didn't get the time to go through all the modules, it has been a wonderful experience to have you as a mentee...I hope you had a pleasant time too! Good luck with the rest of your school year, and let me know if you still want to continue on with the program after this Thursday (no worries if not!) :D Janaki Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:20: Thats okay, and thank you so much for all the help! I really apreciate it and ill keep it in mind, I hope you have a good day! :D",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:45: Hii! Could you unlock well being &amp; self care please? Also its nice to meet you! Mentor 2022-10-11, 14:07: Hi Ariel!! I am SO sorry I haven't been able to introduce myself yet! I was planning on doing it later today after my classes (I had class from morning until 1:30pm :)) ), but I am so glad you reached out. Again, so sorry for that, it will for sure not happen again! I think well-being and self care is a great module to start off with! Did you want to do a brief introduction before we start the module? (Totally cool if not). My name is Janaki, and I am a psychology and health sciences student. In my free time I really like to listen to music, draw and paint, and go hiking when the weather is nice! I would love to know if you have any favorite hobbies (I noticed in your bio that you like to draw, do you have a favorite thing/subject you like to draw?), and how the school year is going for you overall :D Lastly, I wanted to let you know that as the year progress, feel free to reach out to ask any/all questions you have regarding post-secondary, or if you want to chat in general, that's ok too! Janaki :) Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:27: It's okay!

I can't stay focused in class. My mind often drifts and I don't stay on task. List of activities I enjoy doing: I often enjoy sketching and when I do hang out with friends I end up having a lot of fun. I like to rest. I’ll also play video games. Mentee 2022-11-25, 14:30: A question about the assignment I wanted to ask was what activities do you do to make your self feel better. Mentor 2022-11-27, 16:36: Hi Logan, thank you for sharing that with me. I think it's really cool that sketching helps... I used to do that all the time in high school! My list of warning signs: disturbed sleep, withdrawing from my friends and family, lots of tiredness, being quick to upset or anger. I get a lack of focus too, like I can't sit still and focus on what I have to do. My list of actions or activities that make me feel better: watching funny videos on YouTube, journalling (which helps me figure out my emotions), talking to friends and family, reading a good book, or finding just the right music album. Taking a few days to properly rest also helps reset me, like catching up on my sleep. Mentor 2022-11-27, 16:45: I hope I answered your question! Is there another discussion question you want to ask? Mentee 2022-11-29, 11:27: I am fine when it comes to staying hydrated but when it comes to eating food or getting enough exercise and going to bed at a reasonable time I am terrible. Self care actions list: -Getting more sleep and ill do that by setting a schedule a bit earlier than I want to because then by the time i wanna fall asleep i will already be asleep. -Eating more food could be done by remembering to ring a lunch by setting a reminder in the morning. -I could get more exercise by just simply taking a 10 or 20 minute walk instead of going straight home after school. Finally a Question I have for you is how do you manage self care as an adult? Mentor 2022-11-30, 15:00: Nice work, Logan! Good luck with your self-care action list - I see that you've broken down how to achieve your goals in practical ways. I try to manage self-care as an adult by being purposeful about setting time aside for it, and using reminders to help me. I have an app on my phone called Streaks that lets me create a habit streak (so I can try to keep a streak going of reading, for example). It can be tough sometimes though, and other times I feel like self-care is the first thing that goes when I feel overwhelmed with other things in my life like school. I notice I always feel better about myself and whatever challenges I'm facing when I continue to care for myself through it all, though! I hope you do the same. Does your teacher want you to do the extension activity? If not, if you feel like you're ready to move on, what conversation would you like me to unlock next? Mentor 2022-12-01, 14:03: Okay! Sounds good. I'm ready to talk with you when you get your list done! Mentee 2022-12-08, 14:04: LIst of responsibilities that i will need to do when i'm an adult: -Get a job to afford food and rent. -Learn to pay taxes. -Learn to properly cook so I have a wider variety of foods. -Learn to clean a house -get a license and car to make travel more easy. Also what did you find challenging or surprising when you were transitioning into adulthood? List of skills im confident in: -I'm good at listening. -Good of drawing. -I'm good at manual dexterity -Good at cleaning dishes List of things to work on: -I often do not show up on time. I can work on this by Keeping my phone away from me when I go to bed so when the alarm goes off I have to get up to get it. -Need to focus more on my work. Can be fixed by listening to music helps with that. -Need to learn how to cook better. Whenever I go to my brother's house he teaches me how to cook so that'll help with this part. -Managing money. My mom works at a bank so i can always talk to her about it. Mentor 2022-12-10, 16:39: That's a great list, Logan! You're really good at figuring out ways you can build the skills you need to work on. I'm glad you have your brother and your mom to help you with things too, I've also learnt a lot from my mom :) I think what I found the most challenging/surprising when I was transitioning into adulthood was the sudden freedom in all the ways. In high school, you're kind of pushed forward by your teachers or by broad goals like ""get into university"", but once you're there, it can be scary suddenly having total control of your own life. No one's really looking out for you anymore. You make your own decisions and take everything that comes with them. You're fully responsible for your own goals and how you set out to achieve them. It's still something I struggle with... I'm still scared sometimes. But you're never alone if you have supportive family or close friends to lean on.",,,"Mentor 2022-12-15, 15:09: Alright, Logan, I've unlocked the conversation!

Thank you and i hope you feel better! Talk more another time! Bye!!! Mentor 2022-10-19, 15:06: Hello Trinity! It's good that you're able to idenity when you're in need of some destressing! I find for myself when I'm getting stressed I feel myself getting irritable and annoyed, especially by sounds. I find that listening to music with my headphones or watching some vidoes with headphones in helps me relax again. I also like to go on walks or hikes, espeically in nature, (away from the noise of cars and the city) help me destress. Something that really struck a chord with me about self care is that it's not about rewarding yourself when you get things done. Self care isn't a reward, it's a neceessity! I'm bad for working too hard on an assignment and pushing aside having something to eat until I'm finished. But that isn't right, eating lunch isn't a reward, it's a necessity! I'm trying really hard to be better at taking care of myself first. Making sure to eat enough, shower regularly, and spend time doing fun things. All are so important for your physical and metal well being. Another way I deal with stress is by talking to my partner, my mom, or my best friend. Sometimes just talking something out can help me calm down and see things clearer or one of them can give me advice on the situation that I couldn't think of myself! Are there any areas of self care that you think you could work on for yourself? Or are there some areas that you think you're great at? I'd love to hear more! I'll unlock it for you now :) And i am feeling MUCH better, thank you! Best, Dre",,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:22: Have you ever had any hared time with budgeting? If so how did you over come that? And do you have any tips or tricks for budgeting? Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:22:  Mentor 2022-10-25, 12:42: Hey Trinity! I've definitely had hard times with budgeting. Especially right now, with the cost of living so high and wages not high enough, I'm experiencing some difficulty with finances. Having student loans really does help - you can get some funding that's just a grant so you don't have to pay it back - and loans can also help because it can be hard to work a job and do university at the same time. I work part time right now, about 12 to 20 hours a week, and it helps to have some extra money in addition to loans, but for a lot of students it can be too hard to do both at the same time. I'm lucky that I have family I can ask for some help from, and my partner's parents have given us some food from their garden and canned goods that have helped with getting enough groceries! Some specific things you can do to help with budgeting though is to set aside money in a savings account so that you don't touch it and keep it for emergencies. I try to set aside about $100 with each paycheque but this might fluctuate. I also try to buy lots of canned goods (like beans, soups, lentils) and bags of staples like rice and pasta - you can usually get these pretty cheap and they last a long long time in your pantry! Something else that can help with budgeting is writing down everything you need to pay in a month - incluidng rent, phone bill, any subsciption services (like netflix), and approxiametly how much you need for groceries and then making sure you set aside that amount every month to get what you need. :) It gets a lot easier with time and with learning what you need. If you have any more questions or want me to go into more detail about anything, I'd be more than happy to! Best, Dre","Mentee 2022-10-05, 14:14: Hello! How are you? I hope to learn a lot from you.

The site takes a bit of getting used to haha And thank you! It's especially interesting learning about the Pacific Theatre since I took a 20th Century Chinese history course last semester. I love Radiohead! Do you have a favourite album? Mine's either In Rainbows or OK Computer. I checked out the other artists and EDEN is pretty cool. I listen to a lot of genres too. Lately I've been listening to a lot of hyperpop and classical music, which are quite... different lol Red Dead Redemption looks really fun but I've never played it. I'm assuming that you'd reccommend it? I actually don't really play video games that much, but my friends do so I end up hearing about them a lot. I usually prefer RPGs --I'm unfortunately terrible at FPS games. I've unlocked the ""Well-being &amp; Selfcare"" unit now! Let me know when you've finished reading through the article and video in ""Anchor Text 1"" and then we can work through the discussion questions :) Mentor 2022-10-19, 21:33: Again, no worries! I'm sorry for my slow reply this time, I've been a bit busy with assignments this week. That album is also awesome, I love ""you and whose army?"", it's so strong and emotional. I'll consider playing it during my winter break ! I love story-based games. Thanks for sending your answers, point form is completely fine. I also tend to procrastinate and dissociate a lot when I'm not doing too well. Honestly, video games are really useful in those times, they're fun and usually give you goals to aim for and whatnot. For me, I like reading, listening to music, dancing, watching anime &amp; other tv shows, and of course spending time with friends. I like shopping too, it's something to be careful about haha Usually, when I've lost motivation, I try to give myself incentives to do things, for example, if I go to school today, I get to talk with my friend, or if I finish this assignment, I can enjoy a new episode of a show without being stressed. Also, I find that listening to music can motivate me to get up and start doing the things I have to do. If you have access to a counsellor (like at school) I would firstly reccommend that, but there are some sites that might provide more resources, for example: https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/ or https://youthspace.ca/youthspace-resources/. If you'd like more I can try to find some more :) I think it's talked about, but I wasn't prepared for the amount of time management I'd actually have to do. You have to balance your responsibilities (some of which come with being more independent), school/work, and make time for yourself to relax too. Something that surprised me too is that I have to transit about 1hr to school, so I have to take that into account as well (2hrs for transiting in the day). My environment is fairly accepting, the amount of supportive people would basically overwhelm the individuals who aren't accepting. I'm also lucky to have a good number of lgbtq friends who make for a good support system. If you have any other questions related to those topics feel free to ask! Next, we should do the discussion questions for anchor text 2. Can you think of any changes you can make to better take care of yourself ? Also, apologies for a bit of a long response this time !!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-07, 13:58: Hi Marius, nice to meet you ! I’m Genevieve (or Gen), and I’ll be your mentor for this program. I looked at your profile and think it’s really cool that you’re interested in history. I study History so I'm actually taking a course on WWII right now. I also enjoy music a lot and play guitar! Do you have a favourite music artist right now ? I always like listening to new music. What game(s) are you playing lately? I’m looking forward to the next few weeks :)) Let me know if you have any questions and make sure to read the instructions and introductory files. Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:25: Hello Gen! sorry for such a late response, still trying to work this program. Aw that must be exciting! hope that course goes well for you. The artists I'm mainly listening to is Radiohead, EDEN, Glass Animals, and The Fray. Quite a mix of genres haha. As for videogames, I'm on my second playthrough of Red Dead Redemption. Trying to get back into Call Of Duty aswell. (cold war, mw19 mainly, if you were into that sorta stuff.) My class is working on the Personal Wellness thing, is it alright if you can unlock that? Cheers. :] Mentee 2022-10-17, 14:19: Hi there! my apologies again for such a late reply. there might be spelling mistakes because i am typing this quite fast. My favourite album is Amnesiac (Life in a Glasshouse, knives out, You and Whose army?). RDR2 is a great game, the story is amazing and has the same-ish format as GTA (third pers, map,-). I'm just gonna put these in point form. Warning signs: Constant dissociating (worse than my usual) Emotional Tired/Unmotivated Procrastinating Isolating from friends/family Activities: Videogames Drawing/Sketching Listening to music Watching documentries Guitar Hanging out with friends Shopping (bad habit of mine lol) Questions What gets you out of a motivation block? Where you lose motivation to even get up in the morning, what do you do/think of that gets you out of bed? Any resources for getting help that you reccomend? What are some problems you ran into after highschool that nobody told you about? If you are out, is the environment accepting of you?",,,,,

As you can already tell I have an unhealthy relation with procrasinating and little to no motivation to get things started. A few moments of highs and lows but I do have a few methods to really find stability to get myself balanced again (words of affirmation, breathing methods, walks, beadwork, music, etc). To go into a little detail, I have been asking my family and friends, I'm the youngest of the 6 siblings I have, so they're all experienced with adulthood but it is just not enough. So this whole Ementoring has given me a oppertunity to get another persons insight, tips, and opinions on entering a whole new world. One question I have is... What Mental Health challenges should I prepare myself for, and what should be expected when becoming an adult? And what are some healthy coping mechanisms that are different from mine, that can really benefit my process through this journey? Mentor 2022-10-17, 13:51: oh! I may have sent the previous messages to the In Activity Start Here! chat thread if you cannot find them. This is my first time using the Mentorcity platform so I'm still learning how it all works. Mentor 2022-10-25, 13:26: Good afternoon, We are supposed to be wrapping things up this week. I hope things are well. Would you like to go over the anchor text 2- self care action plan? Were you able to find the messages okay? Mentor 2022-10-26, 12:45: That sounds awesome :) and planning is definitely a great contribution for an action plan. There are a few different types of grounding exercises that still help me with my anxiety. Again, the tricky part is forming the habit of practicing them. You can look up a few different ones pretty easily online. I would also recommend doing a bit of research on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and practicing mindfulness. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-1Y6IbAxdM There are many great free videos on YouTube these days. It often surprised me. Lastly your action plan should include reaching out for help when you notice your warning signs or for example when you see on your calendar that an assignment is due, but are stuck. Taking action, asking for help tutoring can be difficult. Practicing makes it easier. Mentor 2022-10-26, 12:45: Was there any other discussion on the wheel that interest you? If we are fast and you have time, we could finish it this week. If not, that is okay too and we could move on to wrapping it up and there is always the option of keeping in touch on the mentoring site.",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:29: Hey, my names Reign. Can you unlock my well-being and selfcare. Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:29:  Mentor 2022-10-11, 12:56: Good afternoon Reign, My name is Jessica. I see we are going to be working through the wellbeing and self care conversation together and then one of your choice. I can unlock it so we can begin. I noticed you have some entrepreneurail ideas on your profile which is awesome. Please feel free to ask me any questions along the way. Mentor 2022-10-11, 14:30: My apoligies for not reaching out to you sooner! I would have but I thought it was part of your marks to send the first message. It's my mistake and I will get back to you as soon as I can everytime to make up for it :) Let me know what you think of the first disscussion in the well-being and self care section. There is an artical followed by a short video. Mentor 2022-10-17, 13:32: Good afternoon, You know procrastination is something that everyone can struggle with ;) I have a cluster of mental health issues myself that I manage. If you feel comfortable to share what mental health issues you're having it may give me a better insight into what would work for you. If not that's okay too. It sounds like you’re already tapping into healthy ways of dealing with things which is fantastic! :) I keep a white board/calendar, but you could use any calendar or day planner to write out your schedule. Since I am bipolar keeping a regular routine is very important for my mental health. Having the month planned out also reduces how many thoughts are ruminating in my mind... keeps me from stressing about everything I need to do at once. This also helps me tackle small goals that may add up to a larger goal like a degree. For now you’re schedule may mostly include school due dates or appointments but once you’re out on you’re own it will include things like the day the hydro bill is due. If you plan your life it will be more manageable it is really that simple. The hard part is modifying our behaviours! If you have a hard time making/keeping a schedule don’t give up on it. It takes time and effort for things to become routine. 6 siblings sounds like a lot! I never met my half-sister and was raised as an only child. To be honest I think you maybe lucky to have so many, but it must be hard to share a space/bathroom with so many people.... That experience may actually make it easier for you in roommate living situations when you’re on you’re own though :) Things I do for my mental well-being are exercise, sleep every night, play with my cats, gardening, writing, having a fancy bubble bath, treating myself when I've reached a goal and helping others (but with healthy boundaries). A big part of keeping ourselves healthy is being able to recognize the warning signs of our mental health issues. For myself not sleeping well, being less social and slacking on brushing my teeth before bed are the first signs that my mental health needs attention. Mentor 2022-10-17, 13:37: If you rent a place with utilities, you will want to make sure they are set up with something called an equal payment plan. This way you can plan for your monthly bill and not get a $600 heating bill in the colder months. Being unable to pay a bill like that can be very stressful and triggering for mental health issues… So as a young adult and even as you age… ask questions. All the time, never be afraid of communicating with your Telus rep, Dr or secretaries etc. The more you know the better. It is tedious being on the phone, on hold, being trasfered to another department but it is a portion of adulting. Sometimes I have to spend hours out of a day dealing with bills, returns etc on the phone or online. Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:25: Yes I would like to start the anchor text, and I finally figured out how to get to your texts. I read over them a couple times and they really helped my anxiety on entering adulthood. I will definitley try out a calender to sort everything out, or a month/year planner.",,,,,

It was nice knowing a small bit about you, and I hope that you won't hestitate to ask any questions! All the best in your school year, and enjoy the rest of High School!!","Mentor 2022-10-11, 17:40: Hi Matthew! I'm hoping very much that you see this message and that I did this right! I looked over the article and video, and I thought to share you some of my experiences before you go answer the discussion questions! When I started to take my mental health seriously after neglecting it for so long, I learned that depression can also be genetics! And I can confidently confirm that my whole one side of family does have depression. On the brightside, I am actually doing something to help me get through those funks in comparison to many of my family members, but I wouldn't have had my friends not been supportive for me. I had bad depression when I was young, and the thoughts I had were very scary. But eventually I got through them, although I wasn't healed completely inside. This past year, my stress triggered my depression, BUT I took action this time. I noticed that the university I go to (SFU), have doctors and counsellors, which I pay through tuition! I didn't know until I started to ask around! This helped me a lot, and while I did try throughout the years these same self-care tips provided by the video and article, I think going to see a counsellor was the final closure I needed. (My grey strands of hair from this stress I had are a reminder haha) I leaned that my main coping method is having a sarcastic humour and making jokes at my problems, because whats a better way to make people laugh than your issues? Jokes aside, especially going into uni and a new city, really make way for yourself. And although some of these tips both the article and video tell you are overrated at times, they really do help! My favourite is journaling, and walks outside when it's nice out (Vancouver has many nice neighbourhoods to walk around!). I realized I may have answered some of the discussion questions you might have for me ... like I said, I am also first time with this program! haha But, if there is anything i had mentioned, or didn't, and you would like to know, let me know! Mentor 2022-10-23, 13:18: Hi Matthew! I hope things are going ok and that you're doing well!! I noticed that you hadn't responded to the ""well-being and self-care"" activity yet, and I enjoyed reading your first response! If it helps to motivate you, I do recall this being a part of your class and even if this subject is not of interest, remember that the third conversation is one of your choices! Hopefully, I get to hear from you soon :) I wonder, how would you phrase ""well-being and self-care"" in Sm’algya?x? Perhaps approach this conversation topic in a way you found a method most helpful to you without you realizing it's considered ""well-being and self-care."" (Even if this method is not mentioned in the article or video, don't hesitate to write about it! There are no right or wrong answers!) Mentee 2022-10-25, 14:46: Hello Mattea! Sorry for the wait im still catching up on all the assigments and everything after my vancouver trip. I did listen to the Joshua Tree Album or at least most of it. I thought it was great! My favorite type of music right now would probably be rap but i do like all type of music. In fact the reason i went to Van was to attend the music festival Breakout 2022. In Van i wanted to use transit but becuase of a time issue i was unable to, ive never even been on a train so one in the sky sounds amazing, it will for sure be one of my main source of transportation there. I actually remeber reading that about our name, ""Gift of god"". I definetly believe we are more special then the average human being 100% Fun fact... i have more ""caveman"" DNA then 97% of the entire human population i found out recently through ansestory. Also thank you for sharing your mental health story. Honestly i think im going through the same thing right now, and i have not taken action once. It started when my cousin passed, then covid hit and all that but i hid it with ease, but recently its gotten harder to contain it all ever since after this summer i lost 3 more family members. Inside its sadness but ive never wanted to show that emotion so its come out as anger. I made sure to never take it out on anyone or anything which did lead to unhealthy coping mechanisims but i now know what to do i think. So basically im gonna try to act on it. I just dont know how to start. but thank you for the inspirtation, it has been a long couple years.. but i did promise myself i would never give up! Mainly since my family has already been though so much and i couldnt do that to them. Ill continue writing more and doing the questions class is just ending right now. Mentor 2022-10-26, 16:21: Hi Matthew! I'm happy to hear from you despite the delay! I know I made my little ""goodbye"" in the wrapping-up conversation, but I wanted to message you here again. Thank you for also sharing your struggle too. It's sometimes hard to admit we need help, but I genuinely believe things get better once we do. The process might vary from person to person, but I know one day you will look back at these times and think differently. I know how the breakout festival turned out, but I still hope you had fun haha Take it easy, and enjoy everything and everyone around you. Good luck with everything, and I hope you become the teacher everyone loves :)",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-05, 17:31: Hi Matthew! Its nice to meet you and I'm happy to be your mentor! Just like you, this is my first time in this program, so bear with me if I end up having technical issues. I noticed you mentioned you would like to be a Sm’algya?x teacher! I think that is very interesting!! I didn't know much about Sm’algya?x, so I went onto a website and I learned that Prince Rupert and its surrounding areas teach Sm’algya?x in school! Living here in Vancouver, I can't say I learned much about the different Indigneous groups in the region growing up. But now I take university courses to learn more, and now I'm learning more through you on here!! I also see you're half Irish!! Have you been to Ireland before? It's on my bucket list of places to visit someday ... perhaps when I win the lotto haha I noticed you also asked a question about what it's like living in a big city. Let me tell you this, 100% after a month you won't even feel like its a big city especially if you stay in the more suburb areas. Especially compared to other big cities, Vancouver is still small. I'd say because Metro Vancouver is very spread out, in that sense it looks massive. I guess I could ask you what its like living in a small city? Or would you consider Prince Rupert a town? I don't know how much of a reader you are, so I'll stop here. Let me know if you have any questions for me, or about anything that won't be covered about school in the conversations. Hope to hear from you soon! :) Mentee 2022-10-11, 14:34: Hello Mattea! I am happy to be your mentee. No i have never been to Ireland before but it is also on my bucketlist! What part do you think you would go to? Mine would probably be Galway or Sligo. Heres an idea for you, just go to vegas, win a bunch of money, and then irelend right after. What could possibly go wrong?? But yes i want to eventualy be a Smalgyax teacher, i am happy to hear you are learning more, here ill teach you my favorite word. eets 'm anaay. It means Fried Bread which is probably one of the greatest foods to ever be created so if you've never had it i highly reccomend it. Vancouver is actually the place i was wanting to move to! Prince Rupert is the only place ive lived, and the farthest place ive been to is Victoria so Van to me is absolutly gigantic.I've only been once recently but i still think i would fit in. It does make me feel better that after a month i should be used to it. I'd say Prince Rupert is more of a town. Basicaly everywhere is in walking distance which has always been normal to me but that time i went to van it was not an option, i had to uber everywhere which was weird. The only thing i read on my owntime are subtitles to TV shows but i dont mind reading at all. Thank you for choosing me. PS I think you have an awesome name, even if its kind of biast since its kind of a female version of mine. Mentor 2022-10-11, 17:05: Hi Matthew! Nice to see your response!! If I ever went to Ireland, I'm definitely going to visit Dublin (because U2 was formed there. I 100% reccomend you to listen to the Joshua Tree album if you haven't already), and I'll be basic and say Belfast as well. Though, visiting Galway would be cool just because of Ed Sheeran's song ""Galway Girl"" (I listened to this song quite a bit in High School when it came out). I don't know if going to Vegas would be a smart idea... but I do have it as one of my options for big money wins. :'D Fried Bread eh? Well, I love bread, and I don't mind fried food. And I have to admit, I have had it before!! haha Thank you for teaching me that word! Where my family is from, ""fried bread"", in Croatian (a slavic language) is ""pohani kruh"". I'm so happy you want to experience Vancouver more long term! I use transit all the time, but my transit is paid by my tuition, which is SUPER helpful. I can defintiely say Vancouver has a more secure transit safety than other places I've visited. So don't uber unless you have to!! But yeah, depending on the area, not much is walking distance. If you live in a more hub center of each district here in metro Vancouver, then its easier to get to places you need (e.g., grocery store) in walking distance. Best of luck when you come ! I can definitely relate to sub-titles! I watch a bunch of foreign shows and movies, and even when I'm watching something in English I leave it on! haha And yes, I did notice your name was a variation of mine!! But I thought I wrote too much so I didn't mention it, glad you did though! One time I read that our name means ""gift of God"". Does that make us more special than the average person? We shall see... I'll go ahead and attempt to open up the first conversation that your teacher requires ""well-being and self-care"". I'll write a message about it when I do! If I haven't ... then technology is not as nice as I hoped it would be. I mentioned this in my first message to you, and I'll say it again here; if you have any more questions about what's it like living in Vancouver, which colleges/uni's are closer to what, etc., let me know! Even tuition questions! Anything that might not be covered in the conversations, I'm here! :)",,,,,

Playing basketball at UBC has been a great experience so far! Hanging out and travelling with my teammates has been super fun and exciting. My position is shooting guard, which I love as it is the most comfortable for me. I'm glad to hear you have been practicing your skills as this will be super helpful and allow you to perform better when playing. Yes, neuroscience is about the nervous system, specifically the brain, but it is super interesting because it still affects the whole body. Sometimes our nervous system senses something and tells our brain, which then sends out hormones that affects other body systems like a domino effect. Super cool! I think we can go ahead and start on one of the conversations now as well. Your teacher has informed me that we need to complete the 'Well-Being and Self-Care' conversation and one other conversation of your choice. Let me know which one you would like to start with!

This is my fifth year involved in the e-mentoring program, I actually began in college as a mentee, like you! I was born in raised in a really small town in southeast interior of BC, in the Kootenay's! I lived there all my life, until I moved to Vancouver last year to begin medical school. I went to a small, three year rural pre-medicine program before medical school. I am 22 years old, and in my second year of the UBC Vancouver Fraser Medical program. Some of my favourite things include hiking, camping, cooking, hanging out with my friends, reading, and playing guitar! Since I've moved to Vancouver, the beach has been one of my new favourite hangout spots, since it's my very first time living by the ocean. This is really lead by you (and your teacher); they may or may not have set up some conversations for us to do; you basically let me know which ones, and we can get to them! This e-mentoring thing is kind of like having an online pen pal; it's an opportunity for you to ask any and all questions that you want, and I will do my best to answer! If you wouldn't mind letting me know what you'd like to talk about, and sending me a little intro about yourself, that would be great! Thanks! Look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks, Kira Mentor 2022-10-19, 10:36: Hey Lexi, Here are a few of my favourite time management tips. 1. Make time for self care. It can be tough to do, especially when you're quite stressed, however, it's so so important! You can't function at your best when you're not giving yourself a break, and you're more likely to be productive afterwards. Go for a walk, cook a good meal, hang out with a pet, whatever self care looks like for you! 2. Get a planner. I find the best way to get more time in your day is staying organized, and trying to prevent falling behind! 3. Write a list of everything you need to do, and rank it in importance (what is coming up first, what is most important to you). Try getting the more important/pressing stuff out of the way first if you can! Or, if something will be really quick and easy, doing that might help you feel a little bit more motivated to get going on that list. Hopefully that helps! Kira :) Mentor 2022-10-19, 11:06: Some tips for maintaining mental health... 1. Staying active! Getting some exercise can help SO MUCH when it comes to mental health. I personally love to go for a run when I'm feeling stressed. 2. Talking to someone when you feel down. It can be hard, but letting others know that your struggling, and getting help for it, is very beneficial for mental health. Whether it's talking to a counselor, or your parents, or a friend about something you're struggling with, talking to someone about your problems can help! 3. Keeping your body healthy in general. This includes eating a balanced diet (if you are able to), taking breaks when you need them, and if you're sick, don't push yourself to be too busy. 4. Journaling! It's not for everyone, but many people find it's helpful to jot their thoughts down, and another form of reflection. You won't know until you try it. 5. Remember that everyone has ups and downs, but if you're having more downs than ups, maybe consider talking to a doctor about your feelings. They can help you by either recommending some tactics that could help, or helping you come to an explanation. Kira Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:37: hi kiara can you open funding your future?",,,,,

I wish you all the best this school year and beyond! Like I said before, please feel free to ask me any last questions or any advice you'd like here in this conversation before we wrap up. Thanks once again, Gracie!","Mentor 2022-10-15, 23:59: Hi Gracie! I just wanted to check in with you and hopefully get started on the Well Being and Self Care Conversation. In response to the first couple of discussion questions, I thought I'd share some of the things I notice about myself when I might be in need of some self-care. Sometimes I notice that I get really tired and have a hard time focusing during the day or I take a long time to complete certain tasks, which means that I need to take a break and find a way to relax even for a just short amount of time. Here's a list of some of the activities that I enjoy and that help me feel better: I spend some time listening to music, taking a walk outdoors, reading a book for fun, doing some drawing, baking cookies, or relaxing by watching a movie. Of course, I also think that taking short naps helps me a lot when I'm feeling exhausted or overwhelmed. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, Gracie! Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:47: Hello! My signs are pretty similar to yours. When I'm in need of self-care, I notice that I get slightly irritated and the smallest things can make me more annoyed than usual. I feel disinterested in activities I usually enjoy aren't as enjoyable. How I deal with this is complicated. I either need to be alone for a little while, or spend time with people who I feel comfortable with. Listening to music, playing video games and watching Netflix can really help me too. Organizing my area can really help me too. Taking naps are really helpful too! I don't know if this question applies to selfcare, but do you have any tips on how to find the right people to make friends with in a new city? And Sorry for making you wait so long for my reply! Mentor 2022-10-18, 10:27: Hi Gracie! Thank you for your message! I think that the activities you listed are all really great options for self-care and I'm glad you know what works for you. I think that your question does apply to self-care because it can be tough sometimes when moving to a new place and not knowing anyone. A tip for making friends in a new city I'd suggest is to sign up for activities where you can interact with other people with similar interests, like volunteering, dance classes, cooking classes (anything you're interested in, these are just examples), or you can look up and attend events in your city. If you're moving to a new city for post-secondary, you might want to check out some of the clubs at your school. Making friends in your classes is also great - sometimes chatting with the people who sit around you and exchanging contact information might help you make friends or at least have someone to turn to if you need help. To tie this back to the discussion questions about self-care, one activity that I do when I find myself feeling low is writing about it in a journal. This might also help with feeling and staying grounded when moving to a new place because the process can be pretty overwhelming! I hope this helped - I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the video and your self-care action plan! Mentor 2022-10-22, 20:40: Hi Gracie, I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to check in with you again. It would be great if you could please let me know which second conversation you'd like me to open up once we finish Well Being and Self Care, since we're aiming to have two conversations completed by October 28. In the meantime, have a good rest of your weekend - I look forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:22: I'm so sorry, Alexandra! I've been so caught up with my school work and I rarely have the time to read my emails. I'll do what I can to finish up the first conversation! As for the second, I don't think I can really get to it. Again, I apologize for not replying as often as I should! Mentor 2022-10-26, 19:03: Hi Gracie! No worries about the late reply, I'm glad to hear from you though! I totally understand since it's a really busy time of the school year and I've been incredibly busy too. In the meantime, I've opened up the ""Wrapping Up"" section on the navigation wheel, so if you get the chance to take a look at that, it would be great! Also, feel free to ask me any other questions you might have. Thanks again, Gracie!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-05, 15:55: Hi Gracie! My name is Alexandra and I’m going to be your mentor for the next few weeks! Right now, I’m a student at UBC where I study English Literature and History but one day I’m hoping to become a high school teacher. I saw from your profile that you like drawing - art was also one of my favourite subjects in high school! I’ve always liked drawing with pencil crayons and I liked drawing landscapes and flowers the most. I’d love to hear more about the kinds of comic books or children’s books you’d like to create! We’ll be working on two conversations in the next few weeks. One of them is called Well-Being and Self-Care. You get to choose the other conversation topic you’d like to try out of the different conversations on the navigation wheel. Just let me know when you’re ready to start and whether you have a preference with which one we do first, and I’ll open up one of the conversations. Thanks, Gracie - I’m looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2022-10-07, 09:47: Hello! It's nice to hear from you Alexandria. You said you go to UBC? That's so cool! I planned on going to UBC as well, but I ended up changing my mind, especially since it's so far away from my home. Instead, I'm planning on going to Coast Mountain College for either a Social Service Worker diploma or First Nations arts. And yes! I do like art, it's one of my favourite classes. Right now, I'm working on a project for my CLC 12 class right now. I plan on putting my emotions onto three canvases with different art styles by the end of this month! It's probably one of my favourite assignments by far. Will it be fine if we start next week? I most likely won't be able to reply over the weekend. As for conversation, I think it'd be pretty cool to learn about Funding Your Future. I don't really have a preferance for which order we start in, so you can just start with whatever! Thank you for taking the time to read this! Mentor 2022-10-09, 07:52: Hi Gracie, thank you very much for your message! It's great to hear more about the artwork that you've been working on, and I'm glad you're enjoying your CLC 12 project! And yes, we can start the conversation next week. In the meantime, I'll open up the Well-Being and Self-Care conversation which we can start on first since this topic is required, but I will be sure to remember that you're interested in the Funding Your Future conversation next. If you change your mind about which second conversation you'd like to try out though, feel free to let me know before we get started on it! Once again, it's great to hear from you, Gracie! Enjoy the rest of your weekend! Mentee 2022-10-12, 09:36: Hello! I'm feeling a bit indecisive about the second conversation I chose. Can you explain the other topics to me please? I'm not too sure which one I should choose. I'm a little interested in Finding Inspiration but I want to know what the other topics are about before I make a decision. Thank you for helping me! Mentor 2022-10-12, 14:59: Hi Gracie! Thanks for your message. Unfortunately, I'm unable to know what's inside the conversations without opening them and I'm only supposed to open two in total, so I'm not sure which activities are inside - sorry! But in the meantime, I've opened up the required conversation (Well-Being and Self-Care, which you can find in the navigation wheel) and we can start there. No worries if you haven't decided which other conversation you'd like to try. We'll only open up a second conversation once we've finished Well-Being and Self-Care, so feel free to think about the different titles and decide later! I hope my explanation helped - please let me know if you have any further questions about getting started with our conversations. Looking forward to hearing from you, Gracie!",,,,,

And as always feel free to fire me any questions either you have or from the discussion questions. Linden Mentee 2023-01-19, 09:35: So did you always live on the coast or was it a new invirment? and are things diffrent there cuture wise? Mentor 2023-01-22, 22:33: Yeah, I've always lived on the coast. The culture is totally different between my hometown (Terrace) and Vancouver. It takes a lot of getting used to. Many new cultures, traditions, and people. It can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's great to experience. I know your class time for this is coming to an end, so I'm going to go ahead and unlock ""Funding your future"" for us to do next. Take a moment to finish up the videos and text on this one before heading over! Linden",,"Mentor 2022-11-25, 13:53: Hey Cole, Hope you got to this module ok. Just to get the ball rolling I am going to answer one of the discussion questions about what tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health. One massive thing for me that I've employed is exercising. You probably feel the same way being a hockey player, but if there are a few days when I am stuck studying or something and miss exercising, I feel so mentally and physically tired. Sometimes when you're busy its hard to find time to play hockey or hit the weights, but one tip I have is to always make time for exercising when you need it. You'll feel so much better and more productive after. Hit me up with any questions you may have about this or literally anything else man. Mentee 2022-11-28, 11:50: yes exersize is a very big thing, how do you keep a healthy balance? Mentor 2022-12-01, 19:05: Sorry! I put my message in the wrong place haha. I won't lie, it's not easy. It took me a while to find the best balance. One thing I do is make schedules, where I make sure I have time daily to exercise. Do you make schedules or anything? Mentee 2022-12-05, 11:44: yes i do make sceduales for my workout routine and for hockey and work, did you play any sport before colage, do you still play. Mentor 2022-12-07, 16:28: Good to hear, making and keeping up with schedules will get you so far in life man. Before college, I played both rec hockey and baseball. I played only about 2 years of baseball on our varsity team. I ended up quitting to focus on school. it is extremely hard to balance a social life, school, and sports (not impossible, but hard!). I still play both sports but on beer league teams haha. I was never good enough at hockey to play at the college level :P For this last part of this discussion, we need to talk about THREE changes you can make to your life right now that will allow you to take better care of yourself. After this, we can move on. I'll go first: 1) Sleep more. I only get around 6-7 hours of sleep lately. I should really try to go to bed earlier and make sure I am getting good amounts of sleep daily 2) Drink more water; I don't know about you but I forget about this all the time, get home and drink like 5 litres of water in one go. Must be better to do this throughout the day with a water bottle. 3) Scheduling more time with friends. I find being busy keeps me motivated. But it is also super important to still have a healthy social life if that's what makes you happy. Let me know your three things and Ill go and open a new conversation. Hope you're excited for Christmas break haha Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:44: Ahaha, yeah i definatly need to get better at schedualing on everything in my life. LIke hockey, work, school, socail life and working out. It definatly messes up my sleep sceduale and i see my self missing school alot more. 1) I need to get better at going to bed earilier because i need sleep. 2) eat more i tend hungryduring the day, i also need fuel my body because i do so much during the day. 3) i also need to have a more consitant water drinking level lol like its bad j forget all the time then wonder why im so tired I have hockey this weekend and its gonna be a big game, hopfully most of the town shows up. anyways text me back! Mentor 2022-12-10, 19:04: Hey buddy, let me know how your game goes, good luck! Those are some great points you make, I know the feeling when you get super busy and forget to eat. I think a big thing for you to consider is packing some more snacks throughout the day and getting a water bottle. I find that just always having a bottle in my backpack makes it so I have no excuse not to drink it haha. Anyway, great work on this module I am going to go an open up the ""Getting Hired"" module for us to start next.",,,"Mentor 2022-10-31, 23:04: Hey buddy hopefully you made it here alright. The way this works is to first give a read to the first anchor text, and then there are some associated questions you will answer and we can chat about. If you have any specific questions just fire em away at any time, even if you think they are dumb. When I was in your shoes I had 0 ideas about the types of degrees or even what I wanted to do. Always a good idea to pursue a career on the side while playing hockey. Do any of the types of degrees sound like something you would be interested in? Tell me about it. Mentee 2022-11-07, 11:46: Hello Linden, So what made you pick being a doctor. Did you like helping people, do you like the money, or just the work maybe you just like all of them. Also what made you pick your school, did you send aplications to more schools the just one? Mentor 2022-11-09, 13:17: Hey man, Hah, believe it or not, it's not all about the money (although for some maybe it is). I didn't want to be a doctor until my last year of university. I think you'll find throughout school and life you'll change your mind about a lot of things. I wish I put more thought into picking a school at your age, I think I just went with the first to accept me and did not really think too much about it. I would really recommend applying broadly and picking your favourite. A thing you may want to consider is how college teams value sports. I went to SFU in Vancouver, and they had a great hockey team which was fun to watch I had a few friends on the team that loved it. For types of degrees, I got a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology. But there are plenty of other types to consider, such as a Bachelor of Arts and other professional certifications (trades, etc.). A bachelor's degree typically takes about 4 years, so you will want to make sure you pick the one best for you. A good place to start is what subjects you like right now. Have you thought about picking a school or program? Is there a place or school you could see yourself going to? Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:37: i accidatly put my thing in ""in activty start here"" sorry Mentor 2022-11-20, 21:05: Hey Cole! Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I had a super busy week. There are tonnes of things to consider when considering schools. That's great you want to play college hockey, scholarships are very competitive but are definitely possible if you are really dedicated. Under the Achor Text 2 discussion, click the ""Discussion Questions"" box. It will take you to a resource that will be super useful for you. After you find that resource, it asks you to make a quick document (or on here is fine) regarding what factors are most important for you when choosing schools, and also what grades and courses you need to take for them. I look forward to hearing back from you about this, and as always if you have questions about it feel free to reach out! Linden Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:11: Are you happy with being a doctor, are you scared you made the wrong. What happens if you wanna switch the career you want would you get in trouble.",,,,"Mentor 2023-01-22, 22:35: Hey man, I hope you got here ok. I think this module will be super helpful for you. I wish I had advice on this stuff when I was in your shoes. Give the passage a read and sauce me any questions you may have. And try to use the discussion questions if you get stuck. Hope you had a good weekend man, Linden Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:09: Hey Lindon how are you? i have acouple questions Is it rough for getting money in collage, do you have time? should i save up now? Mentor 2023-01-30, 13:16: Hey Cole, No problem man it was great getting to know you over the semester. You're a great guy and I know you'll end up doing great things. If you ever have more questions, this platform should be open for a bit longer. So feel free to ask me anything. Cheers, Linden","Mentor 2022-10-11, 14:05: Hey Cole! How's it going? I checked out your profile and my favourite subjects through school were always science and gym. I also played tendy until high school, what's your position? I loved playing hockey growing up, and I am now a die-hard Canucks fan. The regular season is starting soon, so I am pretty excited to be disappointed again this year. Do you have a team? This mentoring platform takes a bit of getting used to, basically, I unlock conversations that your teacher has marked for me, and we will work through them together (each one has small assignments). Outside of that, if you have any questions (even dumb ones) just fire em at me at any time. It's super easy and hopefully will be helpful for you. Just hit me back when you can in the message box below with a bit about yourself and we can get started. Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:28: From Cole To Linden Hey Linden, I’ve been doing pretty good, how are you? I’ve played defense my whole life. I also like the Oilers. The Canucks have been pretty rough so far 1-7 aha. I've been doing well in school. I also like fishing, hunting and anything outdoors. I used to play video games but I've shied away from playing this year. Unfortunately I don't really have a plan for after high school I would really want to play hockey professionally somewhere like any kid. I have a couple questions for you. What do you do for a living? I’ve been working at our local gym for a while. Where are you from? How long have you played hockey for? Also how often do I write to you? Anyways im really excited to be talking to you! Mentor 2022-10-31, 22:57: Nice to hear back from you Cole! Canucks have had a ROUGH start, but 2 wins in a row so there is hope. The Oilers are a close second for me too. Personally, I really like Barrie and Kulak. To answer some of your questions: I am a student at UNBC in their medical program. I am originally from Terrace (you've probably played my old team at some point). I quit hockey after high school to focus on school so I haven't been on the ice for a few years, but I do really miss playing. I still get out for road hockey every now and again, although now I play net. You can write to me whenever you really get a chance, once a week is a good thing to aim for, more often if you can. I know you're probably super busy with school, social life, and hockey so no sweat if you miss a day or something. I'll go ahead and start one of our modules entitled ""post secondary and career planning"" it should light up for you at the top of the screen. Click it and it will bring us to our first module. Talk soon buddy Mentee 2022-11-02, 09:15: To Linden Oiler's got a big win yesterday of corse Mc jesus got 4 points and the Calagry Lames lost last night. I played my first league game this weekend and I got two goals. So how do I start the ""post secondary career planning"" stuff. Do I just ask questions or do you ask me questions. Any ways good catching up let me know what I need to do. Mentor 2022-11-06, 16:56: Congrats on the pair of goals, you must be an offensive defenseman haha. To get started, just scroll up to the top of the screen and you should see a pinwheel with ""post-secondary and career planning"" in blue writing. Give the text a click and it should take you to the module. Give the anchor text a read and comment with your thoughts. The first one on that page will get you to read up on the types of degrees and there are some questions you answer and we talk about the results. If you're still having a hard time accessing it, maybe check with a classmate who is good with navigating the site, it takes a bit to get used to Linden Mentee 2022-11-14, 09:21: Hey Linden It doesnt really to me as long as I can play collage hockey. It would be nice to go to a school somewhere in bc or alberta. A Lawyer would be pretty cool in my opinion, or even running heavy equiptment like my dad. I havent really settled with some thing yet. Some of my really old friends are going to the school in kamloops and victoria. As long as it has hockey im fine with it. What should I look for in schools? If i want to play sports there is it possible to get a socalship? Thanks for answering these Cole Mentor 2022-11-25, 13:47: Hey man, Great questions. Yeah, i'd say I'm pretty happy in medical school. I never really considered it until really late in my undergrad degree. You got Loaaadsss of time to figure out career stuff, so don't fret if you're not sure yet. My advice would be to keep an open mind about everything. If you ever make the ""wrong"" choice, you can always switch. I did 2 years of a psychology degree before switching. Sometimes you just need to experience a field for a bit before you know whether or not you like it. Do you have free electives upcoming for grade 12? I took a Law course in high school that made me sure I didn't want to be a lawyer haha. But if that's something that interests you, that's a great start. Great job on this module, and thanks for asking so many questions. I am going to unlock the ""Well-being and self-care"" module for us to do next. I'll see you there. Mentor 2022-12-01, 19:04: I won't lie, it's not easy. It took me a while to find the best balance. One thing I do is make schedules, where I make sure I have time daily to exercise. Do you make schedules or anything? Mentee 2023-01-11, 10:42: Hey Linden, Yeah I am, of corse it would be nice to play on a collage hockey team but I would love to be on the coast. I love the ocean and stuff but i would also go work in the oil field i guess. I dont really know what i want to do though some times its a little bit scary thinking of the furture. I just want to play hockey and the guitar lol. But yeah i do love the freedom of my town and how everyone knows everybody. but if i lived in the city their wuld deffinitly be more girls to choose from ;) - Cole Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:45: idk if i sent my last message but i feel like i havent really decided yet its kinda scary looking into the future. Hopfully i make money and enjoy what I do. Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:42: Linden, Unfortantly its the end of the sememster, speaking over the lat couple of months was a blast and i really appreated it. Anyways I wanted to thank you for helping me. Sincerly Cole.","Mentee 2023-01-09, 11:45: Aha yes the gold medal game was crazy, did you ever grow up in a small town? was it a big change? I also have a question on univerity, did you have to drop all the stuff you were into for uni? Mentor 2023-01-11, 09:46: Hey Cole, Yeah, I grew up in Terrace B.C, you've probably played our hockey team at least once in some tournaments. I won't lie it is a pretty significant change for me for a lot of reasons, friends, routines, family, etc... I did drop many of the things I previously did when I moved to Vancouver for school, but you don't have to. Trust me when I say, it's really important to keep doing the things you like when/if you decide to shift to an urban place like Vancouver, or Kelowna. You will find things you like and dislike about urban living, for example, when I was there I loved that there was so much to do and so many people around, but I didn't like transiting and how long It took to get around. I personally loved the freedom of having a car at home, which I didn't have in Vancouver. Are you leaning towards any school or place to live if you want to go to college? Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:47: Yeah I am, of corse it would be nice to play on a collage hockey team but I would love to be on the coast. I love the ocean and stuff but i would also go work in the oil field i guess. I dont really know what i want to do though some times its a little bit scary thinking of the furture. I just want to play hockey and the guitar lol. But yeah i do love the freedom of my town and how everyone knows everybody. but if i lived in the city their wuld deffinitly be more girls to choose from ;) - Cole Had to send aouple times. Mentor 2023-01-16, 13:44: You should check out the University of Victoria, they have a decent hockey team and would land you on the coast. Yeah man I’m not going to lie it can be pretty scary making the big move and being somewhere new. HAH sure meeting new friends (or girls) was definitely a major priority for me when I first went to school. Also, it's hard to know precisely what you want to do right out of high school, I indeed didn’t and did not figure it out until way later. The great thing about the transition is you can always go back, and you can always change your program (if you choose to go to college route). I know it’s a bit cheesy but it's also about figuring it all out. I'm going to go ahead and unlock the activity ""Different Ways of Knowing"" for us to do next. Linden",,"Mentor 2022-12-10, 19:06: Hey man, so this module is kind of fun, it asks a bunch of questions about jobs etc. Do you currently have a job? Do you work in the summer? If not, are you interested in applying? Do you have a resume? talk soon Mentee 2022-12-12, 12:32: i do have a job, all i do is clean stuff and manage membership. It doesnt pay good but its pretty fun. Have you ever gotten fired? and do you have any jobs you really want to do but dont have the acalades for it? Mentor 2022-12-16, 18:38: Hey buddy, sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I am currently travelling around New Zealand on vacation and it's hard for me to find internet reliably. That's great you are already working! I had a job through high school too and although it may suck a bit, it's definitely worth it in the long run. Hah no I've never been fired. I always worked hard and had a good work ethic, at least when my boss was around. I really wanted to do lifeguarding when I was around your age, I just was never a super strong swimmer so it was more difficult for me. But at least I got all my first-aid training courses and stuff out of the way. Since you already have done most of this module getting a job already, I think we can move on. Unless you have any questions for me? I still have one for you, how did your game go last week? Mentee 2023-01-03, 12:48: Happy New Years! My game went well i had a grossss drop pass to my buddy. how was new zeeland? have you been watching the world juniors? conner beadard is so good. Mentor 2023-01-06, 11:49: Happy New Year to you too man. New Zealand was awesome, was kind of weird not having snow at Christmas but I got to be in the sun and surf so I'm not complaining. Of course I was watching the world juniors, what a game for the gold medal. Guenther and Bedard are so fun to watch, I really think Bedard will be the next Mcdavid haha.

I am an indigenous person and I am very involved with my culture. I am from a nation that is very supportive of eachother and we have a great community to open up about culture. I have been to swetas, powwows, and have met medicine men. I've been told cultural stories about my ancenstors and what they have done in the past to make our culture that much stronger. To me my ancestors symbolize a great power in something I know that is true. What is something that you know is absolutely true? Mentor 2023-01-22, 13:44: Hi Paiton Thanks for sharing that with me! I myself am not an Indigenous person, and so I am very interested in learning more about Indigenous culture. If you wouldn't mind sharing, I'd love to learn more about your experience going to swetas, powwows, and meeting medicine men. One of the things I really enjoy about mentorship programs is that while I am a mentor and can help provide you with knowledge, I as a mentee can also learn a lot from you. Before this exercise I have never really considered what I believe to be absolutely true. I am not sure, truth be told, that I know something to be absolutely true but it is something I will continue to thinnk about and maybe I will discover an answer. I too am very involved in my culture, however in my culture we don't have quite the same appreciation for our ancestors. I think that it is great that you are involved in a nation that is very supportive. I have discovered that finding friends and a community at my university who share the same cultural values as me has been beneficial in creating a support system. If you decide to attend post-secondary school, or whatever you choose to do after high school, I think that maintaining an involvement in your culture and your community could be something that is beneficial to you as well. Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:45: Hello Chloe I went to a powwow last summer in Kamloops. It was one of the biggest powwwos I have ever been too and is known as Kamloopa. The only con thing that was so diturbing was the heat! It was so hot down there. I also hope that you find something that you know that is true. Having friends after high school would be very fun especially if we shared the same culture!! Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:49: Good Morning Chloe Today we were told that we were signing off of mentorcity. I just wanted to say thank you for all you have provided me and for the time you have put towards answering me. I have learned lots from you and your knowledge. I really appreciate the tips you have gave me through the past few months. Sincerely, Paiton (:",,"Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:26: Hello Chloe From the video I watched about mental health it is always good to have an action plan. Self care is also involved in mental health because it said that psychological and physical stress can refocus you on the things around you. I think that this video had many good things to say about the mental health and the well being of dealing with your mental health. What strategies would you recommend to use for after high school mental health? Mentor 2022-11-11, 13:18: Hi Paiton, While I am happy to share with you some of the strategies that I use to maintain good mental health after graduating high school, it is important to consider what was mentioned in the video with respect to finding what works best for you. Everyone finds that different methods of self-care work best for them, and so it will be important for you to experiment a bit to determine what you can do that will help with your mental health. For me personally, there are multiple things that I do to ensure my overall health and well-being. Firstly, I make sure that I am getting enough sleep each night. It can sometimes seem difficult to go to bed at a reasonable time given various school or work committments, however it is super important to make sure that you are still managing to sleep enough. Additionally, I have found that having a creative outlet that helps to relieve my stress ensures I am taking care of my mental health. For me, my creative outlet is dance and so while at university I have joined dance clubs so that I am able to partake in an activity that I enjoy as well as move my body for physical activity. Taking care of your physical health can also help with your mental health and so staying active, whether it be working out, going on walks, playing a sport, etc. can help with self-care. One other thing that has really helped with my mental health has been creating a support system with friends at my school. Since I moved away from home for school, I do not have the same support system of friends at family that I did while in high school. I have made friends at my school and so I have people I trust to confide in, people who offer to help me, as well as people who I just enjoy spending time with. Additionally, if you are planning on doing some schooling after high school, making friends in the same classes as you who can help with you work as well as understand the challenges you are facing can help relieve stress. Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:45: Morning Chloe The strageties you gave me are very helpful to stay steady after high school. I think that having friends after school and meeting new people is also a good idea to have around for support and to have around as a campanion. I have had problems sleeping latley and since I will be living alone after high school I really think that I will have to watch out for that. Taking care of my mental health is a very good way of dealing with stress and I thought this was an important comment, thanks for that tip! Taking part in an activity is also a good idea for reliveing stress because doing physical activity for me is one way of reliving some stress for me. Thank you for all the tips and ideas to stay stable after high school, I found that they were very helpful to me. Mentor 2022-12-10, 15:40: Hi Paiton, I'm glad I have been able to provide you with some helpful tips. When looking at the Anchor Text 2: Self-Care Action Plan discussion questions, it asks for you to describe three changes you can make to take better care of yourself. You have shared with me that creating a support system with friends in school, getting more sleep, and taking part in physcial activities are three helpful changes that you can make. Following the discussion questions, what are some concrete plans that you can implement in order to make those changes part of your daily schedule? For example, a concrete plan for improving your sleep would be to refrain from looking at any screens (computer, phone, etc.) 1 hour before bed. While thinking about changes to make in your life is an important first step in self-care, it is also necessary to think about how you can actually make those changes a part of your regular life. Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:38: Good agternoon Chloe, I have read the last message and thought that this activity was a very good idea! Three things I think I need to change is getting more sleep at night time, learn how to deal with stress, and time manage my daily life to involve everything I want to do in a day. Finding three ways to change in my daily life wasn´t very hard because I have been having trouble with these things for sometime now. One way I think I can do to help get my sleeping schedule is to not be on my phone while I am laying in bed right before I am sapose to fall asleep. I think that this will really help me focus on getting more rest at night time by the time I wake up. Learning how to deal with stress is usually a big one for me because I have really bad anxiety. One way I can do to help is try meditating or do something to keep my mind off of all the stress. I like to stay active so I think that if I get a gym memebership and I ever feel stresed then I can go and work out the stress and keep my mind off of it. Time managment is kind of hard for me but I deal with ... sort of. Ways I have done to help me is that I try and work around and sort out my times I play hockey at. My hocey time schedule is pretty good sometimes but if I ever want time to hangout with friends I always have to wait till after hockey and before hockey I do homework so my time managment skills are very limited through out hockey season. Do you have any time managment tips for me? If so I would love to hear them!! Thanks again Chloe for all these tips, I find them very helpful. (: Mentor 2023-01-05, 12:58: Hi Paiton, I am happy to help and I am glad that you are finding these tips useful. I understand that time management can be challenging with a sports schedule. I myself used to have a full schedule with dance and I also struggled to manage my time between getting my homework done and spending time with my friends. One of the things that worked well for me was to create a really good schedule where I write down all of my sports committments, my social activities with friends, and all of the school work that I have to do. I would schedule all of my school at the free time I had when I wasn't participating in a sport, and I would determine which assignments or subjects to focus on before or after school by putting my more challenging subjects during the time that I knew I would have better focus. Once I scheduled my school work around my sports I would then look to where I have free time to hang out with friends. I'm not sure if this will work well for you, as everyone is different in their time management, but I'm hoping that this might help. Mentor 2023-01-05, 13:01: Hi Paiton, After our most recent conversation I think that we finished this topic so I wanted to let you know that I provided access to the different ways of knowing activity so that we can get started on that. Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:51: Good morning Chloe The tips you have provided me seems like a great idea, I am hoping to try it out. While reading this you seem like a very active person too! I will aslo start working on the next activity. Thank you for this activity it seemed very helpful for me as this term I have some of the harder classes. Time managment I think will really help me with the tips you have given me.",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-11, 15:47: Hi Paiton! My name is Chloe and I'm excited to be your mentor! I'm looking forward to learning more about you and assisting you in any way that I can. I saw in your bio that you are interested in possibly being a veterinarian, paramedic, or assistant nurse. I am also interested in pursuing a career in healthcare. Also, I saw that you used to dance and I was wondering if you still dance and if you have a favourite style of dance. I love to dance as well. Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:20: Good afternoon mentor My name is Paiton. My goal after high school is to apply to go to a college/university and get into a veterinarian school to be a vet technician. Something I am looking forward to after high school is the experience of living by myself, and learning the different ways I can achieve my goal throughout high school and after. I am currently playing hockey and trying out new things like trying out goalie, and different hockey positions. I am very interesting in how the body runs. Something else I love to do is spend time with my pets. Last year my first dog I have ever owned throughout my lifetime had passed away and all I wanted to do is help her as she was getting sick but never knew how to without seeing the vet. This is how I got interested in being in the veterinarian side of the world. I am also unable to unlock the conversation topics. Mentor 2022-11-01, 10:31: Hi Paiton I also love dogs and this summer my family got a new puppy after my dog passed away this past year. I believe that only I can unlock the conversation topics. I chose one at random this time, however next time you can let me know which topic you would like to do and I will unlock that one.",,,,,

Also feel free to ask me any questions about this topic before we move on to the next thing! Which activty would you like me to unlock after this one?",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-08, 12:49: Hi Sukhdeep! I'm Shaun, your mentor for this term. I noticed you are really interested in becoming a machine learning engineer which I think is super cool! While my own degree was in Biology at UBC, I have been doing a bit of online research into which program might allow you to study that at UBC, depending if you want to go more engineering focused or more computer programming focused. We can always go more indepth with this later in the ""Post-secondary and Career Planning"" section. Anyways, I'm interested to learn more about you, so which grade are you in right now? If you've thought about university already, which ones would you like to go to? I also noticed you are really into music as well. Which songs do you like to listen to? Personally, I mostly listen to songs from the 80s lol. Are you part of the school band? If so, do you enjoy it or do you prefer to play by yourself? Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:15: Hey Shaun, it's great that you think that machine learning is cool! I really like machine learning and I am always looking to dive deeper. I really like UBC and I am actually considering to go there after graduation. I would really like to know more about the university from you. Talking about music, I really like pop music, I listen to different music at different times but some of the artists I like are Boywithuke, Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles and I also love playing 80s songs on guitar. Sweet chld o mine is my favourite to play. What's you favourite song? I am in the school band and the school jazz band which I really enjoy but I mostly prefer to play with just a friend or two. Mentor 2022-11-02, 19:58: Ooo very nice. Yea I'd be happy to answer any questions you have when we get to the University/Post-secondary section :) Tough to say which song I like the best, but generally anything from the 80s is pretty good like Journey, Queen, Cher, ABBA, etc. So let me know once you've read the different links under ""How the program works"". I believe your teacher has said yall will be doing the following conversations: Different Ways of Knowing From Rural to Urban Well-Being and Self-Care Getting Hired Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning Funding Your Future So let me know which one you want to start first and then I'll unlock it for us! Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:06: oh great I was thinking about starting with the ""Different ways of knowing"" chapter. Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:06:  Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:45: Hey Shaun, I'm sorry for responding so late. I've watched the video in 'different ways of knowing' Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:10: I think living on land will teach you a lot more stuff than studying land because when you're studying the land, you'll only knw the suff that is written in the book but if you live on the land, you'll be able to learn from the elders about cultures, natural medicines etc. Mentee 2022-12-12, 12:37: that's good to know. I have another question that how long did it take you to get familiar and be friends with the peolpe around you and what were some drastic changes that you faced in socialising and how did you get over them? Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:51: Hey Shaun, This will be my last message to you as my semester is ending and I won't be in this class anymore. I wanted to let you know thst I think you're an awesome mentor and I really enjoyed talking to you. I really appreciate you helping me. Mentor 2023-01-26, 17:34: It was good to speak with you Sukhdeep! I enjoyed answering your questions. Best of luck with your future plans. I hope everything goes well for you","Mentor 2022-12-02, 20:23: Alright cool, so I've unlocked the next thing for you which is ""From Rural To Urban"". Try doing the KWL activity, answer any of the discussion questions, and then feel free to ask me any questions you have on this topic! Mentee 2022-12-05, 11:50: So, my question is, how was your experiene in moving from a rural to an urban place and what challenges did you face? Mentor 2022-12-10, 20:40: Yea that's a good question. After moving from Chilliwack (which is where I grew up) to Vancouver to go to UBC, I found out how absolutely huge greater Vancouver is. One thing that was nice is have a ton more food options, whereas usually in Chilliwack, there would be only one restaurant for a certain type of cuisine. Being a coastal city, Vancouver is also super rainy, which is why a lot of people invest in waterproof shoes or just wear short boots all the time (I've opted for the latter). People also tend to use umbrellas a lot rather than rain jackets which I found really weird, coming from a small town. I still prefer to just use my rain jacket, because I really don't like carrying an umbrella around. Last year during the summer, things were INCREDIBLY hot. Usually in July and August it is quite hot, but last year was something else. For some people coming from a more rural background/smaller town I think it's also difficult to make new friends as there will be quite a few already established friend groups that come from the Vancouver and Richmond schools. I did a lot of networking and actively meeting new people in my first year so that I wouldn't get cut off. I would recommend treating every class like a new opportunity to meet someone different. It's really easy to just depend on a few people to get you through your classes, but it's really important that you find good friends who are going into your major because that's going to make the later years a lot easier. I would highly recommend spending some time in Vancouver/Kelowna over the summer to explore a bit and get some bearings on what the UBC campuses are like as well as the surrounding area. Also, try to familiarize yourself with the transit system and see if it fits your needs before buying a car or anything like that. Any other questions you want me to answer before we move to the next topic? :) Mentor 2022-12-14, 20:37: Well it only took me like 2-3 weeks to meet enough people to form what you would call a friend group. It was mostly difficult after those 2-3 weeks because a lot of people had become accustomed to who they interacted with in each class, so basically I just took advantage of those first few weeks to do as much socializing as possible. In terms of advice on how to actually do that socializing, I have actually thought about this quite a bit so I can tell you my full strategy. First of all, you need to make sure you sit next to someone in class. If you're not sitting next to someone then it will be 5x harder to get any interaction with someone. Talk about things that everyone talks about on the first day like: ""Which faculty are you in? What major are you thinking of going for?"" ""Which school are you from? Are you in residence? Do you commute?"" This is where you sort of gauge there ""vibe"". Usually someone with a good vibe will actively talk to you, seems to like you, and doesn't try to ignore you. You can also ask things like ""Do you know if there's a group chat for this course yet?"" If you feel like there's a good connection between you two, then you can say: ""What are you doing after this?"" ""You got any more classes today?"" And then the ultimate question: ""Say do you have facebook or instagram or something?"" Which allows you to contact them again, but also most of the time it means you plan to sit together again next class. The way I looked at it, if you are able to do this in every class, some of those attempts are going to be successful and lead to meeting someone you'll get along well with. I think a lot of people who don't meet new people in uni tend to either only stick to the people they know or don't sit near to other people. Also, if you are someone who arrives early to class, it'll be unlikely that someone will sit next to you unless there are no other seats or if they really want to talk to you. So arriving to class and sitting next to someone you want to talk to is a good strategy. You can say ""Is it alright if I sit here?"" To make sure they are not saving the seat for anyone else and is a good test to see if they are open to talking to you. Anyways, I hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have any other questions before we move on to the next section!",,,,

Like grit, agency requires action but considers one's ability to act and create change, without glossing over structural inequalities. Agency is not an individual trait. Schools, groups, and communities can organize to grow agency for collective interests. Mentor 2022-11-08, 14:36: I totally agree with your definition. I might add that grit is about being committed to your goals and creating a plan so you can envision yourself succeeding in those goals. We can move on to the next anchor text now. To start off with the next discussion question, I wanted to give an example of an ally that I have. My basketball coach in high school. They were always supportive of me (not only in basketball)...

You mentioned that you have considered becoming an engineer but are not sure - did you get anything out of the activity related to that? Anything you didn't know before? There can be many different type of engineers - were there any specific programs that you found interesting? I'd also be interested in knowing what you got out of the Career Exploration activity. As always, let me know if you have any questions! Eashan Mentee 2022-11-07, 12:07: Hi Eashan Sorry for taking so long to reply to you I was actually wondering if we could start with the career exploration conversation first. I think starting with that one would better tie into this conversation. Thanks, Kayden Mentor 2022-11-09, 16:53: Hey Kayden, No worries at all. Thanks for letting me know of that. I believe this conversation is under the list required by your class while the Career Exploration one is not - as this one is already unlocked, perhaps we can go through it first so that we don't miss completing the required ones? We can certainly come back to Career Exploration later if you wish. Let me know if that works for you! For this conversation, do let me know of your thoughts on the questions I sent over earlier. I think this is also a great place to explore different careers - I'd really like to hear your thoughts and experiences around what you find out! Best, Eashan Mentor 2022-11-20, 12:09: Hey Kayden, No worries at all. It's great that you were able to go through some careers that you found interesting. Your questions are very relevant to the second part of the anchor text so do go ahead and start on that if you haven't! I think selecting a school is really dependant upon a lot of different factors. An important one is whether the program you want is offered. Part of this is seeing if that specific program has the accreditation/curriculum to allow you to enter your target career. In engineering, for example, there may be specific work and curriculum requirements that the program would need to meet so good to double check that. The program's cost and whether you can afford living/studying at the institution is also important, whether it be through work, scholarships, or other sources of support. Another thing is whether/where you would need to move and how comfortable you are with living in a certain location, which ties into all the things I mentioned above. For schooling itself, I think it's really about having a feasible approach to your academic work, supporting yourself, and other things like cocirriculars and social aspects. It's something that you kind of settle into a natural rhythm of, is there anything specific you would like to know more about? Do let me know of any other questions! I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the second part of the exercises. Best, Eashan",,,,"Mentor 2022-12-12, 09:43: Hey Kayden, For sure, I have unlocked this conversation for you to go through. Do let me know when you have a chance to go through the first activity, I would like to know if you were able to find any scholarships that you could apply to for your career goals. Was there anythng that stood out or surprised you when you were looking through those websites? As always, if you have any questions, do let me know! Best, Eashan Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:22: Hi Eashan After reading the discussion questions I was quite curious about how you got any scholarships and where you found out about them. I was also wondering if you have a job while attending school and how you balance studying, doing classwork, and having personal time while still being able to work. Thank you for waiting so long for my response and I am so sorry for the delay Happy New year Kayden Mentor 2023-01-06, 15:04: Hey Kayden, No worries at all. That's a great question - the awards I received were tied to my research work and academic performance while undertaking my degree. I learned about these through newsletters and websites as well as through people who had gone through the process. This is something that you could potentially pursue once you start your studies at a school. Some awards, depending on the school, may automatically identify you and give the award/inform you of any futher processes, while others you can learn about through the communication channels I mentioned above. It's always good to keep looking for any opportunities that are available to you through the academic units in the school. The criteria for such awards often depends, but academic performance, research work, and extracurricular involvement like volunteering are often important points. There are also industry-supported programs for internships, awards, and co-ops - this also falls into emplyment and is quite relevant to engineering I believe. Entrance scholarships would also be very appliable to you potentially and may have more of an emphasis on your grades and extracurriculars. There are a lot of organizations out there, including non-profits, companies, and the schools themselves that can offer these so good to cast a wide net. In terms of your second question, most of my employment during my degree was around research. So I worked in different areas and groups and was supported by research funding and school studentships. This kind of work can really integrate into your school work and allow you to both cover costs and gain relevant experience. Another good way is to work part-time in businesses and food outlets in places that are accesible to you so that you can cover costs and gain general work experience while focusing on your school work. In terms of balancing my time, I had a good experience in that my work was in my field of interest and pretty flexible overall. The amount of personal time you get is really up to you in terms of the academic and career goals you have, the amount of time you put towards them, and how efficiently you work. I can go into more detail about some time management strategies if you want, do let me know. Also let me know if you have any other questions! Did you get a chance to look through the section on budgeting and costs? If not, please do so and we can discuss that. We can then move on to the next conversation. Best, Eashan Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:43: Hi Eashan We are actually working on a budgeting unit in school. One the things I have found quite challenging is whether I would need a car or not, or if some other kind of transportation would be better. Have a good day -Kayden Mentor 2023-01-16, 09:53: Hey Kayden, That's great that you're going over that now. A car can be quite useful to get around, however it comes with a significiant set of associated costs including insurance and fuel not to mention the initial purchase cost. So if you're living closer to your place of study/work or are able to commute routinely through transit, you may want to think about whether you could put that money to use somewhere else. If you're living further away/need personal transportation to get around effectively, a car can be necessary. It ultimately thus comes down to where you are studying, how developed the local transit network is, and how far away you are from the places you need to get to. Let me know if you have any other questions! If not, we can move on to the next conversation of your choice from: Different Ways of Knowing, From Rural to Urban, Well-Being and Self-Care, Getting Hired, or Confronting Discrimination. Best, Eashan","Mentor 2022-10-05, 10:44: Hey Kayden, Nice to meet you! I'm Eashan and I will be your mentor over the coming days for this program. I look forward to talking about some things that you will find useful! How's school? Could you tell me a little bit about yourself? I see you've indicated an interest in a range of structural/engineering professions in your profile. What you are looking to get out of this program - such as learning more about moving to and living in an urban city? I see you play in a band, I was in one too pretty early back in school but later joined theatre! I understand your teacher has asked you to complete a number of conversations.

Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:08: Good moring Emily What is your connection to the land you live on? Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:08:  Mentor 2022-11-10, 10:40: Hi Zoe, Good question - I've moved around every few years since I finished high school, so I've only been living on this land a short time compared to its long history. That being said, I really appreciate being able to live here and I'm often reminded how beautiful and special the land is. Water is especially important to me and I choose my career because I wanted to help protect and converse water. Sometimes living in the city does make you feel less connected to the land and it's indigeneous history and tradition, but even a walk in the park or along the river is a good reminder. Reading and learning about the history of the west coast makes me really respect and appreciate the land. What about you? What is your connection to the land you live on? Mentor 2022-11-22, 10:34: Hi Zoe, How did you find the move to / from Grand Prairie? I find moving bitter sweet, it's hard to leave friends and activities behind but it's fun to explore new places and meet new people. It sounds like you have a pretty strong connection to the land and do lots of outdoor activities! Do you think we've covered the first dicussion question? If so, do you want to share your thoughts on the TED talk video and pick another discussion question? Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:28: Good afternoon Emily, I found the move to Grand Prairie hard because I had to leave all my friends but once I started school it wasn't too bad because I made new friends and I was still able to talk to some of my old friends too. Yes I think we covered everything for this discussion topic. I think that moving on to the getting hired topic would be a good topic to move on to because I already have a job but I did not have to apply for it because my dad knew the people that own the company. Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:28:  Mentor 2022-11-22, 17:10: Hi Zoe, We have to do one of the discussion questions for anchor text 2. After that, we can definitely move on to the getting hired topic! How about we discuss this question: ""Which of the 7 teachings have you struggled with and what have you done to improve this area?"" I've probably struggled the most with courage. I'm kind of introverted and cautious. I like to take time to prepare and think things over. I find it hard to share my thoughts sometimes and I'm afraid of failure. I think I've improved in this area by doing activities and projects that are outside of my comfort zone and just experiencing various difficult situation through school, work, and life. I've learned that things are often not as scary or hard as they seem and even if they are you can get past it and they make you stronger. How about you? Which of the seven teachings resonate with you the most? Or which do you find the most difficult? Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:59: Good morning Emily I have also struggled with courage, i'm also kind of shy when it comes to certain things but I can also be kind of loud and obnoxious when i'm with my friends. I’ve improved on this by trying new things, like getting a job and learning to play hockey. When I first started hockey I couldn’t even skate. Now I play on the girls Hockey team with some of my friends, and now im one of the assistant captains on the team. Mentor 2022-12-12, 10:08: Hi Zoe, That's great, trying new things is a great way to learn! Congratulations on becoming assistant captain for your team as well, that's a big accomplishment. Now that we discussed anchor text 2, I'll open the ""getting hired"" topic.",,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-04, 13:45: Hi Zoe, Nice to meet you! Here is a quick back story for me: I grew up in Alberta and when I was young we lived on an acerage ~20 minutes from town. When I was about 10, my family moved to a town of approx. 10,000 people. After high school, I moved to Vancouver for university in 2012 and graduated from geological engineering in 2017. I got a job with a consulting company in Vancouver and for the last 5 years I've worked as a geologist/engineer on mining projects in the Northwest Territories, BC, and Ontario. This September, I started a Master's Degree at UBC in Vancouver. I see you're interested in a career in welding or heavy duty mechanics. That's great! I look forward to hearing more about it. I don't exactly have a welding / mechanical background, but I have spent some time working on various drilling and heavy construction projects. Also, my husband runs a business that does metal fabrication and stone manufacturing, so we've got a woodshop and metal shop at home. It's cool that you do hockey, archery, and baseball! Are any of those school teams or do you play in community leagues? I've tried out of different sports over the years including soccer, basketball, and softball. This fall I'm playing in a volleyball league and swimming. Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:56: Good Morning Emily My name is Zoe, I am in grade ten and I'm currently attending FNSS highschool. Some of my goals would be saving enough money for a truck before I graduate, starting my apprenticeship for welding and getting my redseal. I also really enjoy playing sports. During winter I love to play hockey and in summer I like to play baseball. Last year i played on two hockey teams, one of them was an all girls team and the other team was a mixed team but there was only one other girl on the team. Mentor 2022-10-31, 10:25: Great to hear you already have some financial and career goals! I look forward to hearing more about your plans. Hopefully I can help you work through the modules in this course. Did your teacher say if there is a particular conversation/topic we should start with? If not, is there a conversation you would like to start with? It must be hockey season now and I hope it's going well! Playing on two teams must keep you pretty busy :) Mentee 2022-10-31, 13:16: Good afternoon Emily How is your day going? I was wondering if you could open up some of the conversation topics so we can get started with the program. I think that it is really cool that you have moved around the country as a geologist/engineer. I was also considering a career in metal fabrication. Mentor 2022-10-31, 13:23: Good thanks, I can certaintly open a topic! Do you know if we're supposed to do the topics in a particular order? I think I'm supposed to open them one at a time, so for now I've opened ""Different Ways of Knowing"". Let me know if there is a different topic you would like to start with! Mentee 2022-11-21, 11:54: Good afternoon Emily I Have also moved around a little bit. When I was younger I moved to Grand Prairie, where I lived for 7 years before I moved back to where I am now. I do have some connections to the land but they are a little different than yours. I use the land around me for hunting. I also use it for things like line sledding in the winter and quading and dirt biking in the summer with my friends. Mentee 2022-12-14, 09:06: Good Morning Emily I already have a job working for a road maintenance company doing clean up and organization around the shop in the winter, in the summer I also work in the shop but I mostly do yard work and lawn maintenance, i also do a few other things like minor fixes on truck and equipment. I feel this job has helped me improve these skills by learning new communication skills, I have to be responsible and dependable to be on time for work, I have also learnt a lot of new skills by trying new things that I haven't had the opportunity to try before, have also learned how to work better with others though this job. Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:54: Good Afternoon Emily In our carreer life education class we have made resumes and cover letters. I don't have any questions about the resumes but if there is anything you think I should fix/improve I would love to hear about it.

I really appreciate you taking the time out your day to answer my questions and reply so quickly. I learned a lot having you as my mentor and I just wanted to say thank for helping me and working with me through out this program. Thank you, Zoe",,,"Mentor 2022-12-12, 10:14: Hi Zoe, I look forward to chatting about transferrable skills, resumes, and jobs you might want to apply for in the future. You've already got some work experience and your role as assistant captain for your hockey team is a good example that you have teamwork skills and can take on responsibility. Mentor 2022-12-14, 16:49: Hi Zoe, That's great, those are all excellent transferrable skills that will help you get new jobs in the future. I suspect you are also developing some skills in time management. It's important in any job to estimate how long a task will take, plan your time, and communicate your schedule to your supervisor and coworkers. I bet you are also learning how to be self-directed and take initiative to do clean up and organization without being asked. Have you had a chance to prepare a resume and do you have any questions about it? It would be great if you're able to send me a copy so I can provide some suggestions for you. Just remember to remove your personal information before sharing :) Mentor 2023-01-17, 09:03: Hi Zoe, You already have some great work experience and your extracurriculars and volunteer work are impressive too! One main suggestion: under the work experience section, you have listed tasks but you could consider adding some more details / description. These kind of details give you a chance to highlight your particular skills and strengths. For example, ""clean-up"" could be something like ""maintained a clean work space to improve safety and efficiency"". Under Extra-cirricular, there is a small typo: ""tack"" should be ""track"". That's cool that you volunteer at a dog racing kennel! My family had a dog sled kennel growing up and I did some dog sled racing when I was young. :) If you feel like we've covered the resume, please feel free to move on to Anchor Text 2 on job interviews. Mentee 2023-01-19, 09:54: Good monring Emily Thank for the suggestions on my resume, I correct my typos and add all your suggestions. I haven't really had a job interveiw before, we have done fake interveiws in class with our teachers. Mentor 2023-01-23, 11:49: Hi Zoe, how did you find the practice interviews that you did with your teachers? Did you find it easy to answer the questions or was it a bit uncomfortable? Interviews can be a bit intimidating, but practice makes them easier! I find interviews can be very different depending on the company and the person giving the interview. In some interviews they ask you detailed questions about the work try to gauge your technical knowledge and experience. Other interviews may ask more general questions about your strength, preferences, etc. to gauge your communication and soft skills. I think my general interview advice would be (1) Prepare ahead of time - make sure you know some details about the company and job your applying for and think about how your skills / experience relate to the job. It's common that the interviewer will ask why you want to work for their company, why you want a particular role, and how your skills / experience will translate to the job. (2) Be yourself - Of course you don't want to be too casual, but you also want to give them an honest sense of who you are, your skills, your experience, and your interests / motivation. Plus you will feel more comfortable when you're not trying to pretend or fit in a box (3) Try to answer all their questions even if you're not sure - If you're not sure how to answer, you can tell them that, but I suggest you still attempt to answer the question or even ask them a question to keep things moving along. Sometimes the interview can guide you through and they'll appreciate the effort. I believe your program will be wrapping up this week, but please let me know if you have any last questions for me. It was a pleasure to meet you and I wish you the very best! It seems like you've got a great start, getting some leadership experience through sports and good work experience too! I know you'll do well in the working world! :)",,
1047582923,9/21/2022 14:09,1047583935,55214,,,"Mentor 2023-01-09, 12:55: Hi Nisha, I opened up this convesation, so we can chat here now. I just watched the video, and read the article and will be ready to discuss my strategies once you have gone over the material. Did you get anything at the Harry Potter store? I'm also a huge fan and got this Harry Potter calendar for christamas. Each day has a different photo, quote or fun fact from the series! Sim Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:36: Hi Simarjot, So I went over the material and I am sure I understand most of it but after going through I do have a few questions. It´s weird but for my well-being I just like to have days with my friends after school and work, but I have noticed with college and a actually job I won´t have that much time, so I was wondered how do you get time to hangout with your friends or just get a break in general. Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:53: Hi Simarjot, Musical was good, the show is this weekend so I have practice all week. My Favourite HP movies are The Order of the Phoniex and Half Blood Prince. Yeah planning ahead is a good idea, honestly before this program I also thought I would never have time to anything fun I would only be studying and going to work, but you helped me figure out I can still do fun stuff along with studying and working. I have one more question relating to this subject how has the way you approach self-care changed now that you are an adult and how is it different than self-care while being a teenager. Nisha Mentor 2023-01-18, 21:27: Hi Nisha, Good luck on the show! My favourite ones are Goblet of Fire and Half-Blood Prince. A great way to plan ahead is using an agenda or calendar. I use a digital google calendar and I take time at the start of the term to put in all my assignments, labs and other outside school activities. Honestly, as a teenager I didn't even realize that I should be taking time out to do self-care. But some things that helped me feel better was reading books, playing sports and having days where I don't do any work. Now, I do make time by hanging out with friends, I started going to the gym a couple months ago and its been so great, journalling sometimes and taking days where all I do is watch movies/read books. I've realized now how important this is, because otherwise you can burn out (which has happened to me). I also now recognize the importance of physical self-care is very important, such as going on walks, playing on sports/dance teams or going to gym. What are some things you do for self-care?",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-10-04, 14:26: Hi Mentor 2022-10-06, 14:09: Hi Nisha! I hope you're doing well. I'm excited to start this program and support you through it and answer any questions. I read a bit of your profile and I can't wait to discuss Bollywood movies! What are your favourite movies? Mentee 2022-10-20, 19:41: Hi Simarjot I am doing very well, how about yourself. I am as excited as you to get this program started with you. I have a lot of favourite Bollywood movies like, Salaam Namaste, DDLJ, Hasee Toh Phasee, Brahmastra, and a lot more, I also love Vampire Diaries and the Twilight Series, what are your favourite movies/shows and a addictional question who are your favourite actors, I have a lot but the main ones are Shah Rukh Khan, Siddharth Nigam, Sidharth Malhotra, Ranbir Kapoor, Ian Somerhalder, Tiger Shroff, and Robert Pattinson. Love to hear back from you soon Nisha Mentee 2022-10-23, 13:59: Hi, Good to hear that you are doing good, Koi Mil gaya is a classic along with K3G, nice choices. Yeah I am a really big Vampire Diaries Fan, my favorite characters are Damon Salvatore, Stefan Salvatore and Elena Gilbert, the main 3. That's why the locations in Twilight seem so famillar, yeah I didn't know that most of it was filmed in BC, cool fact. What do we exactly discuss in the ""Rural to Urban"" section. Nisha Mentee 2022-10-25, 14:33: Oh theat seems interesting, I was born in a rural community and am still living there. I actually have never liked living here it is too small for my liking I have always wanted to move to a bigger city, the only motivation I hsve to stay here is my friends and the people I know. I am jst waiting to leave this place Mentee 2022-10-28, 17:51: Hi Simarjot, We skate at our local rink we have 3. I think I will really enjoy moving to a big city. Do you think Calgary and Vancouver would be similar in a way? Nisha Mentee 2022-11-14, 11:46: Hi Simarjot, That's good that you hvae been enjoying your time off. Umm I am not sure what video you are talking about Nisha Mentee 2022-12-05, 11:45: Hi Simrjot Sorry I haven´t answered your messages in a while I was in Calgary for a while and then we have had people coming over throughout the days. We can start the extension activity tomorrow I guess. Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:37: Hi Simarjot, It was fun I got to see the University of Calgary and look for house to buy. It is really cold here lately it´s been at -40 Degrees Celcius and along with that it´s been snowing everyday. I will look at the video when I get home then I will let you know. Mentee 2022-12-08, 11:20: Friendly reminder to be cautious of which Conversation thread you are sending messages in and to post only in the current thread you are working on so both parties can follow along :) Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:15: Hi Simarjot, Happy New Year. How was your Christmas, mine was great I was in New York. I will refresh on the video because it´s been a while, till then should we start a new topic. Nisha Mentor 2023-01-08, 13:30: Hi Nisha, Happy New Year! My break was great, I had 3 weeks off from school so I got to see all my friends and family. And wow! I've always wanted to go to New York. What was your favourite thing to do there? Which conversation would you like to start? Simarjot Mentee 2023-01-09, 12:11: Hi Simarjot, That´s good. I loved going to the Statue of Liberty and I went to the Harry Potter Store there it was fun. I guess we could start Well being and Self Care. Nisha Mentee 2023-01-10, 13:12: Hi Simarjot, I will go over the matrerial tonight I have muscial today so it willbe a later on.Yes I Got a t-shirt, pen, wand, and a mug.I wish I had gotten a calendar like that, I made my calendar with the pictures that I wanted to use. Who are your favourite characters from Harry Potter? Mine are Draco Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and then Ron Weasley. Nisha Mentor 2023-01-12, 23:35: Hi Nish, How was your muscial? I love all those characters but my favourites are Hermione, Cedric, Dumbledore and Snape! Which HP book/movie is your favourite? Personally, I also need to spend time with friends and family for my well-being and struggled with this a lot my first year at University. I would think I had to study 24/7, and would never make time. I realized over the years that its impossible to study that much and you don't do well in school either. My advice would be to plan ahead and stay on top of things. Now I plan hang outs with friends weeks in advance, away from exams. I plan to do certain assignments now if I want more free time later. I am also better at studying now, since I have learned what works for me, leaving me with more free time. It is a lot easier if you and your friends live near campus, so you can plan easy hang outs whenever. Simarjot Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:13: Hi Simarjot, The show was great, we just finished yesterday. I also write things onmy calendar in the being of the month. I have some days where I just isolate myslef in my room with a bunch of snacks and drinks, and chill like watching movies,reading, dancing, almost everything. I always do this once every week, I consider it my restart and recharge time. But besides that I go and get a facial and get my hair done every month. Mentee 2023-01-26, 09:42: Hi Simarjot, I would like to thank you for all the advice you have given me throught the 4-5 months we have interacted. I will still be using mentorcity and staying in touch with you, but my teacher said to send a Thank You message since this class is ending for me. Talk To You Soon, Nisha Mentor 2023-01-26, 20:56: Hi Nisha, I'm glad your show went well! It's also great you already have some self-care strategies which you can continue after graduation. I hope this you enjoyed this class! I had a lot of fun talking to you, so we can definetly continue this on Mentorcity. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me! Simarjot","Mentor 2022-10-21, 18:15: Hi, I'm doing great, thank you for asking. I love those movies! My favourites are Koi Mil Geya, Yeh Jewani Hai Dewani and K3G. There's no way someone could leave out SRK as their favourite actor, but other than him I also like Siddharth, Hritik and Taapsee Pannu. It's clear you're a big Vampire Diaries fan, who is your favourite character (mine is Klaus)? My other favourite shows in the past and now are Vampire Diaries, Originals, Criminal Minds, Arrow, Peaky Blinders, Gossip Girl and PLL. Did you know they filmed many scenes from Twilight in BC? I also wanted to let you know I opened up the conversation ""From Rural to Urban"". So we can get started on that now! Simarjot Mentor 2022-10-25, 11:21: Ni Nisha, Yeah I love the main 3, but my favourite characters were Bonnie and Caroline. And yes, the first movie was filmed at a high school 10 mins away from me! So during this discussion, you can read the achor text which is discussion #1. And ask me the discussion questions and then we'll go through each activitiy like that. This is so we can discuss how living in a rural community is different from a city, and how we can make the transition smoother. Simarjot Mentee 2022-10-25, 11:54: Hi Thats so cool I wish it was filmed near me. Ok thank you for explaining, what is like living in a big city during the first year of college, and how hard is it to find a job. Mentor 2022-10-25, 13:17: Although, I always lived in Vancouver going to UBC was still very different. It was very interesting to see how many different people when to this school and they were from so many different places across Canada and the world. Something that I found comforting is because there are so many clubs you can always find something to connect with for example there is the Bhangra Club, Indian Student Association and there is a bollywood dance club. I found it easy to find a part time job while studying at the nearest shopping centre. However, for a job related to my career, I currently studying nursing which is in high demand so I don't expect it to be difficult to find a position. What are some things you like about living in a rural community? Mentor 2022-10-26, 11:57: Hi Nisha, I'm sorry you haven't enjoyed living in a rural community, but it's nice to know you can get a chance to live in a urban community for post-secondary. Are there any activiites you enjoy there? Also, I think we can move onto discussion #2. I was also wondering if we could set aside a time where we both will be online so we can have a smoother conversation? This week im free Thursday 6pm-8pm and Friday 9am-2pm. How about you? Mentee 2022-10-26, 13:54: Hi, Yeah I love hanging out with my friends and going Figure skating and playing in the park with them. Sure I guess we can move on to Discussion #2 . Yea timings would be better I am also free most of the time, I am normally cheking my email so I answer when ever I get my email. Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:38: Hi Simarjot, I was wondering how do you make friends in a big city and how do you know you can trust them and are Indian fesitvals celebrated more in bigger cities. Mentor 2022-10-28, 12:02: Hi Nisha, I also love to skate! Do you skate at your local ice rink or at a frozen pond (when its cold enough)? Making friends can be difficult especailly in first year, I think it's helpful if you live on campus so you have roommates and people you see all the time. I would have to commute to and from campus everyday, which made it more difficult. But I would say joining clubs, and taking a chance on people you meet in class. I am part of the Giddha team at UBC and I met a lot of people though that. Same with just getting out of my comfort zone and talking to people in class. It helps when you have multiple classes with them, too! As someone that doesn't easily trust, I would say it takes time. Until I am sure this person is someone I can talk to about anything, and they would be telling others, I usually don't share a lot. However, I will say some friendhships work out and some don't, but you have to take the chance. Yes, Indian festivals are celebrated a lot more in urban cities! There are a lot more Indian people so that is why. Lots of fireworks and lights! I actually also went to an Diwali event at UBC too, where I painted a Diva and got my Mendhi done! Most big ciities have large Indian populations, so I expect this to be similar across the cities. Mentor 2022-10-31, 00:23: Hi Nisha, Yes, I do think the two cities will be similar. Although it is much colder in Calgary, you're probably used to that weather! Otherwise all urban cities are more multicutlural so you are likely to see many Diwali events and cutlural activites, especailly at post-secondary institutions. I am sure you will be able to find clubs where there are lots of people that love to discuss Bollywood movies as much as us! Also, has your teacher mentions we need to do the Extension Activity - Critical Film Response? Simarjot Mentee 2022-10-31, 12:46: Hi Simarjot, Yea I am usdeto the cold it gets to like -40 here sometimes. That's great if I can find people to discuss Bollywood movies because I can barely talk about them here because not many Indians live here. Yes I think my teacher is about to explain what the Extension Activity - Critical Film Response is. Mentor 2022-11-02, 23:53: Hi Nisha, I am very confident you will be able to find clubs at post-secondary in Calagary where you meet more Indian people. As well as a community outside of the school as well. I have many relatives that live there, so I know there are large Indian communities there. Okay, I think it is part of our activitiy, so we can do it tomorrow! Simarjot Mentee 2022-11-07, 11:51: Hi Simarjot, Sorry me and my family were gone out for the weekend so I couldn't check the messages. I guess we can start the extension question. Nisha Mentor 2022-11-10, 10:50: Hi Nisha, I hope you enjoyed your weekend. I actually have this week off school because of reading break, so I've also been enoying the time off. I've watched the video, and I wanted to ask: How did you feel while watching the video? Did you relate to any of the images presented in the film? What sorts of things did the filmmaker do to create those feelings in you? Simarjot Mentor 2022-11-18, 10:30: Hi Nisha, If you scroll up just under achor text #2 there is ""extension activity"". In that section you can click on the ""mobilize"" link that takes you to the video. But you can ask your teacher if this is something you have to do! Simarjot Mentor 2022-12-06, 21:05: Hi Nisha, No worries! How was your trip? How cold is it in your city? It's been snowing in Vancouver lately and I've been loving it. Okay you can go ahead and watch the video under ""extension activity"", specifically the ""mobilize"" link that takes you to the video. Simarjot Mentor 2022-12-10, 21:44: Hi Nisha, Wow, I don't know how I could stand the cold, so props to you! I watched the vdeo myself, I was wondering what you thought of it? Simarjot",,,,
1047582593,9/19/2022 9:59,1047583934,55212,"Mentor 2023-01-12, 17:47: Hi Harry, I've opened up this new module. Just have a look and let me know of any questions. Curious to know your personal opinion on the matter. You can be honest, no right or wrong or whatever. I know going into uni this would not be something I considered specifically, Mentee 2023-01-19, 09:53: My opinion on the matter is that I think scientific evidence is something both parties usually agree on. However, it is always good to think about matters like this culturally; An example, just cause you know something is good does not nearly mean the way you are doing it is. If you take land to expand a factory at the cost of land; although it is a net benefit people might not want it for many reasons. It is also good to consider how people will react to a project to see if it is truly wanted or if it might damage some people more than it helps. I have always been a person who does not care about most spiritual things, however, I do see why some people see it as important. It is important as it is something close to them so when someone or something like moving to an urban place, people might not like it. It is also good to intertwine both cultural and scientific evidence as it can make people more corporative to work in that field or add a new option or opinion on a problem. Like in environmental problems, it is always good to consider the environment and the people which some indigenous projects do. Like how the videos above show the benefits of intertwining cultural ways and research to create a better understanding of both sides. Mentor 2023-01-20, 21:34: Hi Harry, that is a great piece of analysis and thank you very much for sharing that. I think it is always a wonderful idea to approach issues from a place of mutual respect, and attempt to understand where people are coming from. I think if we were to look at why scientific evidence is such a prevalent way for parties to agree is because it is evidentiary, which makes it, if nothing else, consistent. And why it is good to reconciliate different systems of knowing. (of course, it is also reliable and other things). Also just wanted to note that how we perceive what is good vs. not is also shaped very much by cultural, social, and economical factors, which in turn are shaped by historical, geographical, and natural contexts. And I think it's great you mentioned being perceptive to other people's considerations. For example, when it comes to Indigenous stakeholders and environmental projects, Indigenous people have a completely different relationship and perspective with the land. And I think at the very very basic, notwithstanding all the other historical contexts highlighted by the media, it would be prudent to note that even by traditional colonial based legal standards, a lot of the land in BC (and elsewhere in Canada as well) is unceded. And also, if anything else, considering different ways of knowing can help you better understand where people are coming from, or can help you get to the root of people's needs or concerns, which is just useful no matter which career you choose Mentor 2023-01-20, 21:35: Please take alook at the second video and extentsion activity as well and let me know of any thoughts or questions on this entire module. Also, setting the modules aside, how is the beginning of the school year been so far?",,"Mentor 2022-11-25, 10:36: Hi Harry, I've gone ahead and opened the module on well-being and self-care. It was something I didn't think it was important until it did. What are your opinion on this issue? wondering if that video on self-investigation opened up any thoughts for ya. And feel free to just share honest opinions, these modules are all about helping you explore :) Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:33: sorry it took me a while to respond I have read and watched the video. I saw some of the tactics and will make sure to use some of them like proper hydration, diet and small breaks. Things like the paper with compliments, I will probably not. However, it is always good to have options just in case. I can try and implement some of the strategies I find convenient and effective for me. Also, I'll keep in mind the other options I have. I think it will be an excellent strategy to be aware of what can help but also who can help like parents or counsellors in case a bad mood Is severe. For my self-care action plan, I wanted: to stay more hydrated, be more active and fix my sleep schedule. for the first plan, I can try and have 5 cups of water a day and drink more if I am still thirsty. For my second plan, I can try and walk for 15 minutes a day and do 40 situps for a light workout. Finally, to sleep better, I should stay away from screens for one hour. Then go to bed at 11 or 10:30 and try to wake up at 6 or 7. Mentor 2022-12-06, 14:54: Sounds like a great plan! (And also apologies for the late response myself). Staying active and being mindful of your sleep is indeed very important. I am curious as to the warm up question (But please disregard if you don't want to share, totally okay). I know I am at my ""worst"" just right before an assignment due date or exam aha. It is something that can be mitigated with better time management and self-awareness. Are there any particular sports or activities you really like spending time with in your spare time? especially when you feel stressed or overwhelmed? Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:38: When I am stressed I mostly take a short breaks and play games. I also try to take my mind off of it and calm down. I mostly don't do any sports, so I just walk or watch videos and clean up. for the warm-up question, I am usually at my most physically healthy in the summer as that is when I can walk around town without freezing and I am at my worst in winter. mentally I am usually at my best but sometimes I can stress over something or I become hyper-fixated on a topic and I try to calm myself down. Mentor 2022-12-08, 13:04: Yep, I've turned to games some times as well. No issues there as long as it doesn't turn to too much of an escape. Mentally sometimes it is good to try practice a little of those mindfulness exercises once in a while when you find yourself super stress or fixated on a certain issue. Otherwise, diet and exercise really is key to make sure whatever challenges that comes your way won't become a spiral. It's a progress. I know for me it was, but eventually you will find something that works for you. I think the key takeaway here is just be mindful when these challenges comes up whether during university or in life. And there are always resources out there to help you discover ways to help your wellbeing. Mentor 2022-12-08, 13:06: Anyways, I think that about wraps up this module. Let me know of any questions or something you might be curious to know more about. Other than that I'll open up a new module in the coming days. As always, if any pref on which one, just let me know. Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:48: I am back from my winter break sorry for not responding it was because I did not know what to say after our conversation cause it left no room for a response and then I had my winter break. I think that we are done with this topic conversation and we explored it enough. Mentor 2023-01-12, 12:00: Great, I just wasn't sure when school started. I will go ahead and end the module and will get started with a new one. Looking forward!",,,"Mentor 2022-11-01, 11:03: I've also went ahead and opened the module for Post-secondary and Career Planning. Let me know if you'd wonna open a different topic instead. How's school going so far? Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:56: Dear Alex, Hey, I am so sorry for the lack of responses that I have made. The reason was due to many things. The first reason was that on the days that the class was supposed to do the programme I was at home as I was sick. So I went to school, waiting until we started without knowing we already did. Then, around October 22-3, I was gone in Vancouver and other parts of B.C. So I did not have any internet or my Chromebook to start it. Also, I could not log in as I did not have the password or the teacher for a few days to get it. So until now and before Oct 22, I could not talk to you. that is why I am sorry. I will make sure to respond in 3 days or less and also to start this programme. I saw that message about how school is going. I want to say that I am doing fine. I have 95%+ on all my classes and a part-time job at Boston Pizza working 20-22 hours weekly to start saving for the future. I also make sure not to overwork myself. I also manage my time and have started researching schools, jobs, costs, and places for university to see where I can go to save costs and see if I would be comfortable at those locations. Anyways I have gotten your messages, now I can start talking and writing to you. for this message I wanted to ask about university, it was about personal living costs as I've been looking it up, the prices seem to vary from 13000-21000 every year when living in a city. I wanted to check when I go to a university, are there ways to lower living costs and other personal expenses like food and transport? Mentor 2022-11-08, 15:30: Hi Harry, Wonderful to hear back from you and great to know of your excellent progress in school! Grades are an important aspect of your post-secondary application, especially given the fields of study you mentioned. And no worries about the extenuating circumstances and thanks for letting me know. Looking forward to completing this programme with ya. Always feel free to reach out regarding anything. Glad you asked about personal living costs. So, outside of tuition cost considerations, the city of the uni also affects your cost of living. From my past experiences, the majority of costs are normally rent+util, food, leisure and textbooks. Gonna break it down individually, hopefully that helps. For transport, some will finding having a car convenient. But for most universities, the bus pass is mandatory and included as part of your tuition. So if you want to really save on costs, you can explore ways to rely solely on public transport. And for the most part buses/skytrains are pretty well established. Getting grocery and to other places might be a bit more time consuming and troublesome, so you'd probably want to balance your interests accordingly. I've also seen people bike around and to school. Or if you have an ev, probably way more cheaper to maintain. And getting grocery is important. You work at BP so I'm sure you are aware of the cost of their menu. You can cook for a lot less, and it will be more healthy. But again, if you are not used to cooking, it can be very time consuming. And first year uni, you might find yourself with less time than you'd like. The other major cost category is rent. Some city have really expensive rent compare to others. Have you considered whether you will be applying for campus residence? There are definitely pros and cons, but I know the cheapest option is always finding roomates in off-campus. Let me know if you want me to elaborate on the pros and cons. Textbook is not part of your tuition. They are expensive. Some are mandatory, some are not; and some courses require recent editions while others dont; and some courses say you need it when you might not. I'm sure people will tell you more during your first-year orientation of what you should look out for, but be mindful that they can be a significant cost. The rest of living expenses are mostly withing your control (i.e. clothes, subscriptions etc.) or similar across different cities. Just know that there is student discounts for almost everything. Some are actual discounts, some are just marketing. Depending on your school, there's free software available. Most uni s have arrangements with Microsoft for free student 365. 13000-21000 sounds about right. So to stay on the lower end of the spectrum, you can find significant savings when you use public transport, cook instead of dining out/delivery (really adds up), rent with roomates, and min. personal expenses. Sometimes it might be helpful to create a budget just to get a sense of the total cost. Potential room listings are on sites like Kijiji for reference. Working part time will also help with costs. But again, like with any other ways to save money, it's a tradeoff for your time. And I know I had trouble managing my time in first year. Depending on your individual situation, government loans (and the associated grants) can help alleviate costs as well. And entrance scholarships. They are mostly based on grades. Tuitions themselves might vary alot between programs as well. Are there any particular programs that have caught your eye while researching so far? Mentee 2022-11-14, 11:55: Hey sorry for taking a while to respond. My Chromebook would not connect to the wifi at home and I accidentally forgot to do it before Thursday as this week was a 4-day week. The housing thing I was planning co-op living with someone as it is cost-efficient and saves money. I will most likely do this unless the benefits the university offers me are good enough. For programmes, I am thinking of doing a bachelor's degree in accounting. I have looked at places like UBC, Toronto, McGill and McMaster university. All of these have some benefits and good programmes. I think that UBC is a good choice as it has special offers for indigenous people and is not too far away, allowing transporting items I own to be cheaper or to be sent to me through the mail. after I get a bachelor's, I want to become a certified chartered accountant as it is great for the money and job security. I am looking for programmes currently and found CPA Canada and that's it. it seems to take 2-3 years. In total seven years for a bachelor and 2-3 for a CPA. Do you think the choices I found are beneficial or might not be suitable for me? Mentor 2022-11-15, 21:27: Hey no worries at all. Also feel free to look through some of the resources given by our module text, just as an aside to see if you happen across any other professions that are interesting. But it's great that you already have one in mind. As far as I know, the CPA designation is the one to aim if you want to go into financial accounting. I think some years back they merged a couple accounting designations (i.e. managerial accounting) under this one umbrella. (Aside from that, finance as a general sector can involve other programs too such as financial auditors or analysts). Anyways, CPA is a professional designation so they should have clear outlines of what is required for that designation. I'm not sure if you would be interested in co-op programs in accounting. But most of the accounting peers I knew was in co-op and I know that for them, getting internships, especially at the Big Four, was pretty important. Note that usually big firms is hard work, less pay, but great for resume later on. The schools you mentioned are all reputable. In terms of obtaining the CPA designation I would imagine there is very little difference in which school you pick. So it would boil down in looking at the specifics of their accounting programs and any specialized advantages they provide in helping your career path in accounting. One comment I will say is that Toronto (assuming it's the downtown campus) has always given me more of a finance centric vibe. But I might be biased since that's where the people I know went to look for jobs (uWaterloo has an AFM program). But again, UBC's cost benefits are very valid considerations and you might not find any difference if you plan to practice in the West Coast. One suggestion I have, is to consider looking through your dream accounting firm/company, find a student coop or new hire if possible, and just email them to see if they are willing to answer some questions. We do that a lot in my undergrad and law and you would be surprised in how friendly some people can be. And in the worst case, they'd just say no. No harm there. So to sum up, CPA afaik very relevant professional designation if you want to go into accounting; try exploring their website more; [also, I'm not sure if it's against regulations to suggest this, but try Reddit too, though only to help you to know where to start looking at more info, and you should treat everything there with a level of skeptism]. Consider where you plan to practice (i.e. home, or where most money); consider any schools that might offer experiential learning or if you want to fast-track your degree instead. And as a general piece of advice, always have a backup school as part of your application. Also, this is just for me to get a better understanding so I can give more relevant information, have you always sort of just known that accounting would be what you'd want to do, based on what you've seen or maybe people you know who are accountants, or other reasons? And if you've thought about other financial management releated fields, or other industries out of curiosity. Talk soon! Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:53: I have seen your advice. I will make sure to always have a secondary school option. Because just in case I don't get accepted by the first option. I will also look at other ways to get info on these places because that seems like a good way to get information on subjects. I will make sure to consider my options. The inspiration for becoming an accountant was not much. I have seen it as a field with a respectable income and job security. Math has always been something I am good at. However, no one I know is an accountant. However, I felt it was a suitable carrier for me and my skills. I have also looked at financing jobs or being an auditor as they have similar fields and a good income with the same schooling or degrees. I also looked at different areas like financing and management. But, most are related to math and other office jobs as they are safer and have a good income in most places as businesses require management for finances. One last reason I chose to become an accountant is that everywhere in the world needs accountants. So, with that demand comes better security and opportunity for me. Mentor 2022-11-19, 13:53: Sounds good. Math is pretty ubiquitously used in STEM. Outside of finance, there is also computer science, statistics (isn't confined to research. A lot of policy or analyst works require stat as well), software engineering etc. Generally all stable pay and decent market demand. Though the degree themselves are imo a bit more demanding as well. Just throwing them out there in case of any interest to look into it further. Back to CPA though, wondering if you've looked more in depth into it. Let me know if you found something new/interesting :) Other than that, just double check that you've looked through Activities checklist, and I think we can look at wrapping up this module and thinking about which one you'd wonna do next. (and just side note, even if we wrap, if you come across any post-secondary or career related questions, feel free to reach out) Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:20: I have looked at the job of being a CPA. I have found out a while ago about the busy seasons for accountants and the rules and things to be aware of so you don't get in trouble. I have also looked at secondary side businesses that are available. I have also looked at ways to ensure job security by working online if needed or to have a side business helping people with their financing. I noticed how the education takes ~7 years as the bachelor and the CPA training combined but luckily I can get paid during the CPA training. I can also offer help to people around me for their financing while training to get some extra cash while studying. I have looked at locations where accountants are paid the most and where I should go like new york but I also thought of the price of living to decide on some locations to work. I am hopeful some of this extra knowledge I know can help me stay stable and start to have side offers to make money to save properly. I have looked at the activity and I guess we already talked about schools and what career I want so I think we are done. Mentor 2022-11-25, 10:31: Sounds good, I'll go ahead and open up another module from the list your school sent. Stay tuned!",,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-04, 19:58: Hi Harry, Alex here. Looking forward to helping you make the most of your teacher has signed up for you here. Feel free to reach out at any time with just any questions or anything else in general. I will say though, that I've been surrounded by peole in accounting, finances, and tech during my undergrad so hopefully I'll be able to provide some useful info there.

If so, how? -Emma Mentor 2022-11-21, 13:23: Hi Emma, The length of schooling and experience needed were definitely factors in my career choices. I had to make sure I saved enough money and worked enough during the summer to pay my tuition fees. I also wanted to make sure I gained enough work experience during my university years for my career later on. Great questions! Mentee 2022-11-22, 13:19: Hey Alice! Thank you. Are you satisfied with your decision to pursue post-secondary school. -Emma Mentor 2022-11-22, 13:47: Hi Emma! I am satisfied with my decision to pursue post-secondary school. Aside from getting the work experience and knowledge I needed, it was also a great time to meet new friends. I met my best friends during university, and I also found new hobbies that I still enjoy today. Talk soon! Mentee 2022-11-23, 08:07: Hi Alice, Thank you, your response is very helpful. What challenges did you face while in post-secondary school? (financial, poor grades, moving away from home) -Emma Mentor 2022-11-23, 15:13: Hi Emma, glad to hear that my responses are helping :) I faced challenges with getting poor grades in my first year of university. I was used to the high school curriculum in which we had regular chapter exams. In university, I remember failing first-year physics because we only had one midterm and one final. Thankfully after that experience, I learned to preview and study daily while balancing my social life. Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:41: Hey Alice, Honestly, it is pretty relieving to hear that. Did you do any work during your time in University? If so, what job did you have? -Emma Mentor 2022-12-03, 16:08: Hey Emma, Yes, I did work during university. I worked as a tutor for high school students, a teaching assistant for biology classes, and an education assistant for a professor. I think working during university is a great time to learn more about what we like and work towards our goals. Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:35: Hi Alice, That's cool! Is there any specific jobs that you recommend to do during college? Mentor 2022-12-08, 15:35: Hi Emma, I recommend choosing jobs that align with your future career paths. You previously mentioned that you like working with small children at a preschool, being a pipefitter, construction worker, real estate agent, or accountant. Perhaps, you could work part-time as an accounting assistant or part-time at a daycare or preschool during college. These are great questions! Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:23: Hey Alice, Are you happy with all the decisions you've made in your post-secondary school time? -Emma Mentor 2023-01-04, 08:20: Hey Emma, I am happy with most of my decisions, but there are definitely decisions I regret making. I usually regret not taking an action rather than doing something though! However, mistakes shape our experiences too so it might not be a bad thing! Alice Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:39: Hey Alice, Did you take a gap year before you went to college, and would you reccomend doing so? Mentor 2023-01-12, 12:29: Hey Emma, No, I didn't take a gap year before college. I had a few friends that did though and spent it travelling or working. It depends on what you want to achieve during the gap year. I was able to save enough money to go to university and I also took loans from Student Aid BC. Alice Mentee 2023-01-19, 09:42: Hey Alice, Thanks for the response. I don't think I'll be taking a gap year. How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do you have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? Mentor 2023-01-20, 06:12: Hey Emma, I found that courses I struggled with in high school; I also had a bit of difficulty with them while in university (eg. physics). But, I studied hard for the courses I found difficult. I would preview the course notes before class. This means going through all materials that the professor will cover. After each class, I would review what the professor covered. If I did not understand, I would seek help within the next few days. My suggestion would be to ask for help early so that you can understand the material and have time to ask questions before the midterm comes up.

Thank you for the advice of asking people in the field! -Emma Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:19: Hey Alice, forgot one thing in my message. If there was something you wish you would've known about life after high school, what would it be? -Emma Mentor 2022-11-08, 15:08: Hey Emma, no need to apologize! Career exploration is something that everyone goes through and I'm glad to hear that you have a few career options in mind. For your top three career options, what are the demands for the job, the expected salary and the regions where the work is most needed? I think one thing I had wished I had known about life after high school would be all the adventures I would encounter and all the people I would meet. High school was quite peaceful for me. I would go to school, play at my friends' houses after school, finish my homework and play sports on the weekends. At university, there are much more people on campus. There are so many clubs that students can join and much more freedom. Of course, more freedom comes with more responsibility so it was definitely something I had to get used to. Great questions! Mentee 2022-11-09, 08:16: Hey Alice, my top 3 career choices are pipefitter, preschool teacher, or real estate agent. Where I live, real estate agents are in demand. Salary: 78,119. Pipefitters are kind of in demand but I'd say it's on the lower side. Salary: 88,983. Preschool teachers are in demand at the moment and should be for the next 3 years. Salary: $49,200 Thank you for telling me about your university experience! It gives me a better understanding of what to expect. If you could change anything about the choices you have made about your career, would you? -Emma Mentor 2022-11-09, 11:41: Hey Emma, I don't think I would change anything about my career. There are definitely times when I ask myself ""What did I just do??. But at the end of the day, those processes, and mistakes make me the person I am today. I would still find a mentor (kudos to you for doing that already!), go to networking events, meet new people and apply for more roles.","Mentor 2023-01-24, 13:57: Hi Emma, You asked questions about tips for studying so I opened the Strategic Studying topic up.

My brain gets overworked pretty easily and I've found I can only work for two hours at a time before needing to take a break. Another thing that's helpful is finding what drives me to want to do well in school - for me, I need to get good grades to get into teacher's college, so I really want to succeed in my classes and I'll take the extra steps in order for me to do so. That added factor of motivation can make a difference in how well you manage your time so that you don't leave things to the last minute! What are some things that you enjoy doing that you think you could incorporate in between studying/doing schoolwork so you don't end up procrastinating anything? I usually like to play piano, read, or watch TV. Mentor 2023-01-11, 18:54: That's great! It's really important to maintain a good balance between school, work, your social life, and just some time to yourself. School can and probably will get overwhelming at times, but just remember to take breaks and you'll be able to work through it!

Mentee 2022-12-05, 12:45: Can you share your path to post-secondary school Mentor 2022-12-07, 16:06: Sure! My path to post-secondary is a bit of a complicated one. In Grade 12, I had my entire life planned out, from each course I would take in every year in my undergrad to which medical schools I would apply to. I was 100% set on becoming a doctor, and my dream school was McMaster University in Ontario for their Health Sciences program. My plan was thrown off when I received a rejection letter from them, and so I accepted the school that I had listed as my second choice: the University of Waterloo, where I studied Honours Health Studies. I quickly found that medical school wasn’t the right path for me because I wasn’t passionate about any of my health-related classes, and so I started to think more about what I really cared about rather than what I thought I 'should' do. I’ve always had a strong love for animals, and so I decided to make the move across the country to study Applied Animal Biology at the University of British Columbia, which I am in the process of completing this year. I chose to study at UBC because it was one of the only schools in Canada that offered an animal biology program that aligned with my interests. Mentor 2022-12-10, 10:27: That's so great that you've already looked into everything and you seem sure that this is the path you want to go down! What made you choose this school specifically? Was it because of the location, the programs they offer, or something else? Mentor 2022-12-14, 18:16: It's good that you did your research and looked into a bunch of different schools before settling on this one! A lot of those factors were also why I chose my first university (mostly because my family was close by), but then I transferred out to a program that better suited my interests. You may or may not experience something similar, but the important thing to do is stay encouraged on whatever goal you're set on at the moment. I think we've done a good job of covering this Conversation, so if you're comfortable moving on, I can open the next one up. We have these ones left: Different Ways of Knowing Well-Being and Self-Care Getting Hired Confronting Discrimination If you don't feel ready to move on yet, that's perfectly okay! Just let me know what you'd like to talk about next.",,,,"Mentor 2022-11-19, 22:21: That was a great response, thank you! I agree that small towns often have a better community and you can make friends more easily. I prefer the more chill places compared to busy places too. I've opened up the Funding Your Future Conversation, so feel free to take a look through it! Mentor 2022-11-21, 15:24: I worked a lot over the school years and summers while I was in high school. It was mostly just minimum wage jobs but over time it added up. I've also been really lucky to have help from my family and grandparents for funding my university tuition. Right now I have a job at my school at the library, and I use that money to pay for all my groceries! Mentor 2022-11-29, 19:39: Are you planning on applying to university or college? Have you been able to find any scholarships that you might be eligible to apply for? I'm also just looking at the second set of discussion questions and it seems like you're supposed to fill out a worksheet and share it with me, but you could check in with your teacher to see if that's something you need to do. Mentor 2022-11-30, 12:46: If you can find time to look into some scholarships I highly recommend it. I applied to a lot in my Grade 12 year and I managed to win some of them, so it was definitely worth the time putting in the applications! Okay perfect, you seem to have a clear understanding of this Conversation so we can move on to another one.

I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is Meaghan and I'll be your mentor for this class. I read your bio and am so happy that we have a lot in common! I see that you're interested in marine biology, and I've actually taken a marine ecosystems class at university for my degree and can talk to you a bit about what that was like in the future, if you're interested. I also read a bit too - what's your favourite book? :) Mentor 2022-10-27, 17:26: Hi Isabell, I wanted to see if you would like to get started with our Conversations. Is there a topic that you'd like me to open first? Your teacher has let us know that the following Conversations have to be completed for your class: Different Ways of Knowing From Rural to Urban Well-Being and Self-Care Getting Hired Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning Funding Your Future Let me know which one you'd like to get started with! :) As always, I'm here to answer any questions you might have! Mentee 2022-10-31, 12:59: Hi Meaghan, Yes I have been interested in Marine Bilogy since I was 5. My favorite book is The Inheritance Games series what's yours? Sure we can start on a topic, I think I would like to learn about Rural to Urban. Thanks Isabell Mentor 2022-10-31, 18:12: I think I've heard of that book but I haven't read it before! I would say my favourite series is the Percy Jackson series and that my favourite book is either Song of Achilles or A Court of Mist and Fury. I've opened up the ""From Rural to Urban"" Conversation, so you should be able to access it by clicking it on the wheel. We can start by answering the Discussion questions that are listed under ""Anchor Text 1 - Taking Flight""! Mentee 2022-11-02, 09:08: what are some of your experiences when you started school in a new city. Mentor 2022-11-04, 12:51: I spent a lot of time exploring the city by myself since I knew nobody when I moved here. I lived with some other students in student residence, and I was lucky enough to become really good friends with them. We went out together and had a lot of fun experiencing a lot of different things such as going to new cafes and restaurants. I tried out a few school clubs like the Theatre club but didn't really find a club that I loved. Since I was living alone I had to learn how to do a lot of things for myself, such as cook. I still can't cook very well but it's been fun trying out new recipes! Those are a few of my experiences since starting school here. Mentee 2022-11-07, 11:58: Did it get easier with some new people by your side to help you have company and so you actually have someone to hang out with instead of yourself? Also what was the most difficult things with the change? Mentor 2022-11-08, 12:04: I'm the type of person who doesn't mind being alone that much, but it was definitely a lot easier having my friends by my side. Some of my best memories were made with my roommates who became my really close friends! The most difficult change was adjusting to living and taking care of myself. It was tough at first balancing my time with school, work, and personal activities. Also learning to navigate a big city by myself was pretty challenging and a little scary (learning the bus system, going grocery shopping by myself, etc.). Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:26: I forgot to ask in the beginning, what are you doing for schooling? Mentee 2022-11-15, 13:12: There's not really any other questions that I have to ask about moving from rural to urba. So if there's is anything thing that you would like to include on moving that I did not ask about, im happy to listen to what you have to say. Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:41: I really like living in a small town because there is less people and less stores. Everyone knows everyone and it's very easy to meet new people. I'm also a very quiet person so its nice when you can just go and chill somewhere around town and no one will care. I do plan on moving to a more urban place but living on the outside of it so theres not as many people. There's not any traditions or anything that I would take with me. Mentee 2022-11-17, 09:42: I think we should move onto Funding Your Future Mentee 2022-11-21, 11:55: How did you mange to keep money in you pocket from the cost of school and living somewhere new. (or old), necessities, and other things? Mentee 2022-11-28, 11:47: There's not really to much to ask about this and I think I understand the concept of everything in this catergory, so if you would like to move on... perfect. Mentee 2022-11-30, 08:09: I am planning on going to university, (UVIC). I haven't really had time to look into scholarships but I think my parents have been talking about a few that I can apply for. I asked her about the worksheet and she said ""I can do it but it's not mandatory to do, it's more for the people that don't know how to start conversations."" Mentee 2022-12-02, 08:14: Post-secondary and Career Planning sounds like a good one next Mentee 2022-12-08, 09:39: It's a wonderful journey you've had. I've always wanted to go into marine biology since I was 5 and i've had the plan sorted out for a while now. Looked really into the programs of the school I want to go to and the courses/classes that I will be taking for the career. Mentee 2022-12-12, 12:30: Well I've looked at multiple different schools before and I kinda wanted to stay in BC close to family, and I know the area. I also have family that lives where the university is located so that's another reason. With staying in the BC area that school had more options and special classes just for learning about marine animals/biology. And the programs they have, fit into that category too. Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:11: I think we can move onto the well - begin and self - care. Mentee 2023-01-06, 13:15: I just have one overall question which would be, how do you not get tired from all the constant school work and not procrastinating anything? Mentee 2023-01-09, 11:46: I like reading, piano, guitar in beteen study breaks Mentee 2023-01-12, 09:40: I would like to do getting hired Mentee 2023-01-16, 11:58: How did you get less nervous during the interview Mentee 2023-01-24, 13:14: Good to know.

Keep following your dreams! :) Meaghan","Mentor 2022-11-09, 10:26: Hi Isabell, I'm just going to move our conversation over to the From Rural to Urban activity to keep things organized! To answer your last question, I'm going to the University of British Columbia right now. I'm in their Applied Animal Biology program. I'm in my last year so I'll be graduating in the spring, which is both scary and exciting! Mentor 2022-11-16, 10:23: What are some things you like and dislike about living in a rural area, and do you plan on moving to a more urban place in the future or do you want to stay in a rural area? Are there any traditions that you want to bring with you when you move away from home (such as something you do with your family or a routine you follow every day)? After I hear back from you about those questions, I think we'll have covered everything in the Conversation and should be good to move on! Just let me know which topic you'd like me to open next - your options left are: Different Ways of Knowing Well-Being and Self-Care Getting Hired Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning Funding Your Future",,"Mentor 2023-01-12, 20:13: Okay - I've opened up the Conversation! Mentee 2023-01-13, 07:58: Can you tell me a story of a memorable job interview? Mentor 2023-01-15, 18:26: Sure! I'll tell you about the first job interview I ever had. It was super scary and nervewracking but I made sure to talk to my parents a lot about what to expect so I could prepare some answers for typical interview questions beforehand. I also googled a lot of mock interview questions and even watched some YouTube videos which I thought were helpful. It was for a cashier position at a local grocery store and I was 15. My resume was very simple because I didn't have any other work experience, I probably only had that I was a high school student, some of my volunteer experiences, any extracurriculars I was involved in at school, and perhaps an objective statement that indicated my dedication to the job if I was to be hired. I also went in person when I dropped off my resume so I met the boss - that's always a good thing to do and it might set you apart from other people applying to the job if you make a good first impression. I think the interview took around 20 minutes which is on the shorter side for an interview (but makes sense for the kind of job it was) and the questions were all very basic. I remember one of the questions being ""Who is your hero?"". Interviewers basically just want to get a feel for who you are as a person as well as the kind of employee you would be in the workplace to see if you would be a good fit. Mentor 2023-01-18, 19:41: What helps me get less nervous during interviews is the reminder that an interview is pretty much just a conversation. As much as the employer wants to get to know me, I want to get to know them better too! I keep the conversation light, ask them lots of questions, am very polite with them, and it usually ends up well. Of course I do still get very nervous beforehand but that's why I like to prepare a lot so I can walk in to the interview confident.",,

Great list, I share the same warning signs, especially procrastination, irritable moods when I feel stressed, or just an ineffective use of my time because I'm so tired that I can't get stuff done quickly. Maintaining good mental health is super important in uni. I learned that during my undergrad when I felt burnt out in school. You can get lost in how overwhelming everything is. I was always a procrastinator in high school and that worked for me back then, however, once I went to UBC, I learned how bad my work habits were. I suggest maintaining a schedule and keeping track of deadlines, as well as planning out your days/weeks for studying and homework. But I also highly recommend finding time in your week to have fun! If you dedicate all your time to studying, you can burn out quickly. And definitely get enough sleep! That was one mistake I made in uni that harmed my mental health cause I'm a night owl. Just like how you enjoy soccer, I also like sports too, but more from the comforts of my couch haha. One of my lifesavers for mental health was following sports. I got into watching hockey during my first year of uni and I didn't know a thing about hockey before that. It was during a bad time in my life and really saved me from giving up on school. To this day, I watch my favourite team, the Montreal Canadiens, and it makes my life so much more fun. Mentor 2022-10-05, 10:25: Why do you want to be physical therapist? It definitely is a wonderful and fulfilling job! Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:30: How good i am at self care. I would think that i take pretty good care of myself. i get enough sleep, i drink a pretty good amount fo water but i also drink alot of starbucks and drinks like that. i stay active and do fun activities also. 1. change- when stressed do somthing to clear my head . Action- before a test go for a walk to clear my head. 2. change- Stop drinking lots of sugary drinks. Action- try to only drink water, only have one sugary drink a day. 3. Change- Eating all 3 meals. Action- try to eat breakfast every morning, because i dont. Question for you- Can you share any time management tips? Mentor 2022-10-13, 13:40: Hi Monica, Starbucks is my guilty pleasure too. I love their london fog or chai lattes. I'm excited to learn that you're a hockey fan! The oilers are a fun team to watch. Do you have a favourite player? Mine is Carey Price. I was super stoked last night to watch the first game between the habs vs leafs and the habs won! Awesome to hear the reason behind physical therapy. Have you thought about your plans for post-secondary and have you looked into UBC's physical therapy program? Some time management tips I have are writing down deadlines for major assignments and exams. I use a calendar on my computer and in some years I like to write them down on a physical calendar/notebook. I also tried the pomodoro method. Have you heard of it? You can google it for the full details but its basically timing yourself for 25 minutes of productive studying/working, then give yourself a 5 minute break, and repeating this cycle. It helped me a lot because I get distracted otherwise with my phone haha.",,,"Mentor 2022-10-18, 12:06: Hi Monica, The conversation is unlocked now!

Three reasons why i would benifit form university 1. I heard university is the best years of your life but also could be the worse 2. I would become educated in what i want to study 3. I would persue a careers that i want to do, and that is what i will do for the rest of my life (hopfully) Three factors that may complicated for me in univserity - being home sick - Money and being broke - courses being difficult I am very excited for university but i am also very nervous. what i am most nervous about for university is the classes and tests, i dont want to fail. but there are also super exciting things about university.

The question i have for my mentor is What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them? Mentee 2022-10-25, 14:38:  Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:31: Discussion#2 The factors that are the most important to me when deciding on a university: - Location of the campus- closer to home - Exercise and recreation facilities - Hands on learning - Student support centre - Extra curroculars- sports and clubs - School spirit The school that i have researched is UNBC and is the school that i am intresting in going to. Questions for you: What factors did tyo consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there? Do you know anything about the schools, programs or locations you’re considering? i already did a research project in my careers class heres some infor i know because i want to go to UNBC some things i know about it is that its the closest university to where i live now. It has a great nursing program. .... to be conituned Mentee 2022-10-26, 13:36: Yes, i think i would be addmitted into the program of health science at unbc because i was already accepted. • Can you share advice on gaining admission into your desired program? What can you do to be a competitive applicant? Mentor 2022-10-26, 16:51: Hi Monica, Responding to discussion question part 1) ""What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them?"" Some of the challenges included commuting 1.5 hours to attend school during my first undergraduate degree. This year I moved super close to school, but I get homesick sometimes, even though I can come back home on the weekends. I'm still learning to get used to being away from my family, but I'm adjusting and facetime them all the time. The harder curriculum in university was also challenging. I barely passed my first midterm when I started uni. That was stressful! I learned to stop procrastinating throughout my education and developed a better sleep schedule (although this year I've been procrastinating again, not good with how hard pharmacy school has been so far). Time management is super important, but also something I improved on over my uni experience. Overall, university had its good and bad experiences, but when it's all done with and you're moving onto a full time career, I think the experiences will be treasured. Those experiences were exciting in making friends, going through life as a post-secondary student, and finding fun things to do. Although it can be stressful at times, staying motivated and positive helped me through the tougher moments. Discussion Question #2: Can you share advice on gaining admission into your desired program? What can you do to be a competitive applicant? Doing a lot of research and planning on your desired program. I can see that you've already done your own research. And congrats on getting accepted to UNBC!! Is your plan for school: Health Sciences -&gt; Nursing -&gt; Physiotherapy? To be a competitive applicant, it's important to show the school your applying to that you're a well-rounded applicant. Grades factor in but they like to look at your extracurriculars too. Writing a good application and getting feedback on it is very helpful.",,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-22, 21:14: Hi Monica!

Here are some questions to get you started if you're stuck on what to share: - what are your favourite past times? - how is school and outside-of-school life in general? - do you have any pets? - what do you want to gain from this mentorship program? - anything else that you'd like to share! Mentee 2022-09-26, 14:50: Hi Parsa. My favourite past time? I like to play video games, im usually just playing ganes if im not doing any work, school or doing my kickboxing. School is alright nothing bad or great to say about it but outside of it i stay home and usually stay home to help my parents watch foster kids we have here. We do have a pet at home hes not mine but hes a lizard not too sure what he is but his names george, he was a daycare pet that my mom used to work at. I hope to gain an understanding of what its like transitioning into the adult life after school even if its little bits of what its actually like. Just a little of whats going on, i wasnt in kickboxing for a while about half a year but i plan on joining back very soon for my capstone project which is basically a passion project that i have to track my progress of whatever the capstone project is about.I grew up on video games and i think i was introduced to it when i was about 2- 4 years old. Mentor 2022-09-26, 16:59: That sounds great, RJ! Sounds like you're staying very active both within and outside of school; having balance within your life is a very useful skill, especially when you transition into adult life! By the way, what video games are your favourite? Personally, when I'm not at school, I love to play Valorant, even though I am not too good at it, and some FIFA with my friends! Also, I'd like you to start thinking about which conversation you'd like me to open for you; these can be found at the top of this page I believe. Your teacher wants us to complete the 'Well-Being and Self Care conversation', but also another one of your choosing! Let me know which other one insterests you the most! Cheers! Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:57: Hi my favourite games right now are COD Cold War and Apex Legends i am getting a bit bored of games right now but the next COD comes out sometime this month which im pretty excited about. i do think i am above average in skill level but not super good like pro level and i am a console player too have been my whole time gaming, i'd really like to switch over to PC but i know nothing about computers and they can be pretty expensive. The conversation i'd like to open up is ""from rural to urban"" and my teacher would like us to start on the ""Well Being and Self Care"" conversation, thanks. Mentor 2022-10-03, 17:56: Hi RJ, That's pretty cool. I used to play COD too but I only had Ghosts which wasn't too bad. I recently just switched to PC and it was pretty hard coming from just playing on the console. Anways, I will open up the ""Well Being and Self Care Conversation"" first. We will begin working through it together and just let me know if you have any questions! Mentor 2022-10-26, 17:59: Hello RJ! I believe that your class is wrapping up the program today. Thank you for being a caring mentee and answering the prompts and questions I posed. I was wondering if you have any last minute questions or any advice that you want from me. Please let me know! For now, enjoy your high school experience and keep on doing the things that you love; especially kickboxing! All the best, Parsa.",,,,,

For example, I had a chaotic time when trying to adjust to the university lifestyle back in my first year, eventually, I learned the importance of self-care and slowly started to take care of myself, such as eating healthy meals, having a regular sleep schedule, and balancing work and rest time. You can look through the pages and try to answer some if not all of the questions listed, also if you have questions don't be shy to text me :D",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-21, 12:20: Hello Taylor!

My pronouns are she/her, and I will be your mentor for this program :) A little about myself, I am 22 years old, and currently in my fourth-year studying Biology at UBC, I enjoy painting, reading, watching movies or documentaries, and mobile gaming in my free time. Suripeungly, I also considered architecture as a possible path for myself when I was younger, since I enjoy architectural aesthetics and internal design, but I didn’t like the physic and mathematics aspects, so I ended up choosing another path for myself. It's great to know about your goals, and we can always discuss the expectation from post-secondary and transitioning into big cities like Vancouver during our conversations. I wish to get to know you better as well, if you don’t mind, could you tell me more about yourself? Like what class are you in? Are you starting to prepare for application to VCAD? Is there anything else you want me to know about you? Your teacher is requiring us to complete the following Conversations: Well-Being and Self-Care One Conversation of your choice And we have until October 28th to complete the program and these requirements, let me know which conversation you want to do first and we can start from there. If you have questions, just send them to me and I will try my best to answer them? Faith :) Mentor 2022-10-12, 16:25: Hello Taylor, just want to check in to see how's everything going for you?

Good to hear back from you :D Although I would love to help you navigate through the various conversations, I've been informed that your school is wrapping up this program today, tomorrow and Thursday (possibly on the 31st as well).

Mentor 2022-10-15, 02:04: Hi Taliyah! How's your week going? How's school going? Great list of recognizing when you need to shift your activities and focus on self care. I like the list of self care activities you have provided! I also enjoy spening time with my dog and taking him for walks/hikes. What type of dog do you have? How often during the week do you do self care activities? In terms of supporting self care during University, I think the most important thing for me was to maintain good time management practices so that I did have time to do those activities that support my mental wellbeing. I would always use an agenda and write out all of my assignment and test due dates as well as mark when I needed to start studying for exams and start completing assignments. This would help me better plan out my days so that I had the time to exericse, maintain a good sleep schedule, and still see friends and family regularly. Have you ever tried this approach with school? Do you have any other questions relating to self care in University? Have a great week! Katie Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:54: hey katie, my dog is a male cane corso. i try do most of the selfcare thing quiet often, but i do dance and go on drives on the daily. how often am i doing selfcare? i do the selfcare i like to often but the selfcare that everyone needs lilke sleeping and drinking water is something i stuggle with. three changes i can make in my life 1. drinking more water i can make this change by taking water bottle with me everywhere 2. sleeping more i can do this by going into my room earlier and turn my phone off 3. spending more time with my family start doing family game night do you have any time managment tips Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:55: can you unlock funding your future please Mentor 2022-10-20, 13:05: Hi Taliyah! How is the week going? Awesome self-care goals! You will have to let me know how those are coming along as you try to implement more sleep, water, and family time. Time management can be a tricky skill to learn - I am still learning it in my adult post-graduate life! Everyone is different and what works for them will be unique. For me, planning is key. I like to plan out my week and schedule in time for exercise, family, my dog, friends, etc. I used to do the same in school. I would plan out my weeks 1-2 in advance, and schedule in time in my agenda for studying, assignment preparation, sleep, exercise, social time, etc. It can be a tricky balance but when you find what works for you you will get into a rhythm. I can definitely unlock the next module! Have a great weekend! Katie",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-25, 17:31: Hi Taliyah! My name is Katie and I am a Registered Nurse working in emergency mental health in Kelowna! I am excited to be your mentor for this course. I see that you wanted to be matched to a mentor at UNBC, UBC Okanagan, or UVIC. I pursued all of my schooling through UBC Okanagan so I hope I can be of help and answer some of your questions about nursing! My educational journey to becoming a nurse was a bit tedious as I completed a BSc before doing my BSN. Now I work full-time as a RN and also teach nursing students. Aside from that, I also just completed my MSN at UBC Okanagan so I hope I can answer any of your questions about pursuing a career in nursing or nursing school in general! I see that you have to complete two mandatory conversations (Well-being and self-care and one other of your choice) as part of your course for school. Let me know which conversation you'd like to tackle first! I look forward to getting to know you and working with you through this program! Feel free to message me anytime with any questions you have. Cheers, Katie Mentee 2022-09-26, 14:48: Hi katie what made you want to go into nursing and what were your grades? Mentor 2022-09-27, 09:15: Hi Taliyah, Thanks for your reply! While I was finishing my science degree I was working in a lab, which I found to be quite isolating. It then occurred to me that I wanted to work in a more team-based environment and be able to serve others. This led me to nursing! For UBCO I believe grades need to be in the B+ to A range for acceptance into the program. Have you already applied to programs? What led you to want to become a nurse? Should we get started on one of the modules? I hope you have a great day! Katie Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:33: hi katie do you think you can unlock the well being and self care",,,,,

In university, feelings of lonelyness and homesickness are super common which can lead to mental health challenges. There are a variety of campus resources that you can use if you want support or need someone to talk to. Additionally, reminding yourself that other students are feeling the same way and finding friends you can talk to about these feelings is super helpful. On the positive side, being away from home helps you to explore yourself as an individual an gain confidence in your own thoughts, opinions, and experiences. This is really helpful for personal growth and maintianing mental health. I have used a variety of school resources and healthcare resources to maintain my mental health and develop healthy habbits as an adult. I have also discussed issues with my family doctor, she then gave me some helpful resources and options to consider. There are tons of resources out there, and if you are ever unsure of where to start, ask a trusted professor, friend, doctor, or really anyone you're comfortable with becuase starting that conversation and getting help with what to do next is the most important first step. Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:37: Sleep more Read before bed Put away electronics an hour before bed Eat more regularly and healthier Prepare breakfast and lunch meals the day before Organize meal plans Reduce McDonald’s runs Be more physically active Go on morning runs Stay 30 minutes extra at the pool after coaching Do you have any time management recomondations?",,,,,,"Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:24: Yes I frequently use the Dual Coding method, this proved useful for better understanding the topic. Spaced Practice seemed the most useful for memorizing the information. Concrete examples seem the most challenging because you must fully understanding the subject material. Flash cards are great method for retaining information. There is a 70% chance that I will utilize these methods. Procrastination is the factor that may delay my use of these methods. How do your study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to your study strategies from high school? What have you learned about studying since you were in high school? Mentor 2022-10-27, 14:31: When I was in high school, I didn't have very effective study strategies and was fairly inconsistent. When I went to university I had to learn how to study. Being consistent and studying in chunks is great, making sure to start early so you don't have to cram. One big thing I've learned is that its not realistic to get 100% in everything, you have to prioritize what you need to study more/less and make sure you study effectively to get the most out of your time.",,"Mentor 2022-09-22, 11:57: Hello Natalie! My name is Vanessa and I am looking forward to getting to know yout as your e-mentor. A little bit about me, I am currecntly a Masters of Science student at UBC and have completed an Undergraduate Bachelors of Science in Biology. I'm a big fan of dogs, the outdoors, and board games. What do you like to do for fun? Best, Vanessa Mentee 2022-09-26, 14:35: Hi Vanessa, I am excited to be your e-mentee. I too am a big fan of dogs. I love to paint, go on nature walks, and press leaves/flowers. How has life been at UBC? Is the workload insane? Regards, Natalie Mentor 2022-09-27, 12:25: Realistically, no matter where you go to school there will be a different vibe than highschool. You have to hold yourself accountable and do your work becuase instructors wont hold you accountable in the same way that they do in highchool. This will feel like a heavier workload, at least in the beginning until you get in the swing of things. I'm not going to lie, it definitely is a lot of work, but as you progress you learn how to better manage your time and how to prioritize/sacrifice appropriately to get what you need to done. I love school and learning (so much so, that I am now working on a second degree) and truly believe that you can study what you love and will find a way to balance things so that you can still maintain hapiness, health, and time for fun. I could honestly go on forever but I'll stop there (unless you want me to keep going?). If I'm not mistaken, the mandatory conversation your class needs to complete is Well-being and Self care. I'll unlock that now so you can start working through it, but I'm happy to circle back to talking about my time at UBC too. Best, Vanessa Mentee 2022-10-03, 13:03: 1.

How have you navigated managing your mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do you have any advice for finding mental health resources? Mentor 2022-10-13, 11:25: Time management is one of those things that takes time to find a method that works for you. I would recommend exploring different calendar options, ie if you like paper planners or electronic calendars, etc so that you can find one that work for you. Make sure to actually schedule personal time, rest time, health time, alongside classes and appointments so that you can hold yourself accountable and meet all of your needs. Set deadlines for yourself beyond those of instructors so that you can better organize and prioritize what needs to be done. Categorize your to do list into things like urgent, less urgent, non-urgent to help organize what order you accomplish your tasks and how much time to allot to each. This are all things that I try to implement to help myself complete all my tasks. Personally, I use the calendar app on my phone for all of my school and non-school deadlines, appointments, etc so I can access it no matter where I am.

Wellbeing and self-care is super important, and we often forget to take care of ourselves. I know for myself, I can get carried away with schoolwork and forget about other things. As you grow as a student and become more independent (say, if you were to move away for school), it's important that self care in your life is something that isn't pushed aside, so I am glad this is a topic here! I'll let you get started on Anchor Text 1: Self-Investigation. Read the article and watch the video, and then answer the questions from the discussion questions. We can discuss your answers, and we can exchange lists etc., and I can answer any questions you give to me. Have a good week! Ava Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:50: Create a list of your own ‘warning signs’ that you might be in need of some self care: Anger issues Irritable Often tired Mood swings Too Loud Create a list of actions or activities that you enjoy: Dancing Hanging with homies Spending time in nature Singing in shower Watching movies with family ASK your mentor at least one of the following questions, or ask them your own question(s) about this topic: -How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? Mentor 2022-10-05, 23:23: Hey! Thanks for sharing. It's good that you're aware of your warning signs for self care, and that you have actions and activities you enjoy for self-care. My warning signs: Irritable Tired Procrastination Needs to be alone No energy Actions and Activities I enjoy: Watching movies and TV with my roommates Blasting my favorite music in my car (dancing alone in my room is so great too) Spending time at the beach Reading Film photography To answer your question: How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? I was actually so horrible about my mental health in high school, and living alone and getting into adulthood made me realize I could not do that anymore. Full disclosure -- I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, so I have really awesome depressive episodes or manic episodes and on really great occasions when I freak myself out I will have panic attacks. That was sarcasm, if you couldn't tell. It sucks sooo bad. I realized I needed help -- campus has really good resources for mental health support, and I really had to learn to depend on family and friends (which I hated doing lol I am very independent). I have to accept now that it is okay to take a break, and it is okay to wave the flag and say that you need help, or an extension on an assignment, or just take a nap! I go to therapy on an online website called Inkblot Therapy, and it has really helped a lot -- it is super accessible and user-friendly, and it is probably my #1 mental health resource and I can tell you this -- I know everybody says ALLLL the time that it is okay to not to be okay and that it's okay to get help, and it is! The problem is admitting it, or at least that is what it was for me. That was a long spiel to say: As an adult, and when you enter post-secondary school, it is so important that you take care of yourself, because it is so easy to get carried away. You can't be your best self in any way if you don't prioritize yourself and your mental health. Let's move onto Anchor Text 2! Also -- do you have to do the extension activity? Hope you're prioritizing your self-care right now, Ava Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:29: How good I am at self care: To be honest I think I could definitley get more sleep at night, eat more and more helathy, I drink a fair bit of water but some more wouldnt hurt, and I dio more than enough excersise throughout the week. Changes: 1) Get more sleep! 2) Eat more! 3) Drink more water! Action: 1) Put my phone down 30 minutes before I go to bed and read instead to feel more sleepy. 2) Wake up earlier so I actually have time to eat breakfast instead of skipping it like usual. 3) Push myself more at dance so I feel a tiny bt more thirsty so drink more water. Question for you: Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) Mentor 2022-10-12, 23:07: Hey! Hope you're doing well! As to answer your question on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self care -- you picked a good question to ask! I will be honest, I can be queen of bad habits when school gets overwhelming. For your examples, it may take some time, but getting into the habit the night before or the morning of and making a lunch (I literally just throw a bunch of snacks like fruit, cheese, meats, and stuff together) seems like a lot of work and it can be, but it really is the best solution for that. Staying up too late? Welcome to the life of a student! I am so bad with my sleep schedule, and for your listed action, it actually works. (I know everybody says reading before bed works but who would've thought! Not me!) As for being a workaholic, it's so easy to feel overwhelmed and get caught up in your work. I am queen of studying or working all the time, and it's really hard to remember that you can take breaks. Take steps to help yourself decompress at the end of the day, or on the weekend. It can be beneficial to find a time to relax and let yourself do that. I recently started going back to chiro because I am so pent up with stress, and it has actually helped a lot. Also super important to remember that breaking bad habits is not linear. You're going to have those days when you're all over the place and you just want to lie on the couch and pig out on fast food and scroll on your phone. There's nothing wrong with that! Do what feels right for the moment. Just be aware of balance. We have finished self-care and well-being, so we can do the extension activity, or move onto the next topic, which I believe is of your choice? Just let me know which you would prefer.

Ava Mentee 2022-10-25, 14:43: Dicussion Questions #1: 1: My dream career is becoming an actor or performer on broadway. I actually have a friend who's going into the path of hopefully becoming a professional dancer so i do have a few ideas of how I'd get there. I could either join a dance institution which primarily focuses on getting into the acting, where you are assigned a agent and you bascially book auditions and make a life off of dancing in movies. Or I could go to a university like SFU and get a degree and dance to become a professional dancer or dance teacher. Orrrr I could take theatre in university and hopefully make it to broadway one day. Even though that would literally be a dream, I'm afraid being a starving artist just wouldn't pay enough, so my realistic career is to become a lawyer. To become a lawyer I basically can take anything I want for my undergraduate degree, I juts have to maintain a high GPA in whatever courses I choose. Then after I graduate my undergrad, I'll need to take the LSATS exam and score atleast over 150 in order to get into Law school. Then you gaduate Law school and hallejuah you can be a lawyer!!! 2: -Offers more career choices - Ability to make more money - Socializing and networking 3: - Stress/Anxiety - Being far away from home - Grades 4: Well if it was my dream job of course I'd look forward to it, everyday of eduaction would just be doing what I love. As for my realistic career I mean I think undergrad will be ok. Ill get to meet new people and learn abouit subjects I'm actually interested in. Lsats don't sound very fun tho and Law Scgool seems like it would be fun but also stressful at the same time. 5: I think with hard work and alot of dedication my career as a Lawyer is more tha possible, and well I'd like a career in dance to work I just don't see it happening. Im a shopaholic I need money HAHA. Question for you: Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university?

Mentor 2022-10-26, 14:22: Hi, To answer your questions: Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university? I did change programs in second year, just briefly. I was a double major with political science and sociology, but changed to a political science major with honours and a minor in global development studies. I went straight from high school to university, and I have been doing school every semester (including summers) since then, which is sort of insane. What factors did you consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there? • Do you know anything about the schools, program? .Any advice on how to standout when trying to beat out competition? When I chose a school, location was important to me. I have never lived near an ocean, and Victoria was far enough from home but not too far. I actually did not look much into the academics, but I knew Victoria had a good reputation for political science and their co-op program. Location ended up being really important, as the beach ends up being a great way to unwind, and being close but not too close to home makes it easy for me to go home for longer breaks. I was in love with the campus too -- not too big, but big enough, and it's a sort of comfy campus. As for standing out when beating competition, put your best foot forward. Some schools require entrance questions and essays, and I think being true to yourself and what you want to do and what you want out of the school is the most important thing. Put yourself and what you want to do first. I never really took that into account, and that's what I would say to myself back then. Have a good week! Ava",,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-22, 12:20: Hi Masoom! My name is Ava, and I'll be your mentor! I've read a bit of your profile, but I'd love to get an introduction and know more about you. I'll go first: I am a fourth year Honours in Political Science student, with a minor in Global Development Studies. I am also in co-op, which means I also do work terms and internships that count towards my credits. The Honours part of my degree means that I am conducting my own research and write a 50 page thesis at the end of this year (which is horrifying) but I am really interested in what I'm doing, so it's exciting! I am studying at the University of Victoria, which I see is a school that you're interested in! I'm glad to hear it, I love it here. I'm originally from Calgary, Alberta, and moved to BC for school 4 years ago (which is actually so weird I feel so old). I am looking into grad school for international relations, or law school for after my undergrad, which I see you also have an interest in. I think we actually have a lot in common -- if grades, money, and time wasn't a thing, I also wanted to go into the arts, with acting or directing. I also used to dance! and you're so real for mentioning hot girl walks. That's something about me -- I am a huge pop culture nerd. I am super into all kinds of music and I consume movies and TV like nobody's business. You mentioned that you have an older sibling, and I am the oldest sibling. I have had a lot of talks with my younger siblings about the move and what the move without my family is like. I hope I can be a big help to you! I can speak a lot for what you want to learn about -- the big differences in the transition, the hardships and challenges you may face, and the transition from teenage years to becoming an adult. We'll discuss these further, and make sure we get through well-being and self-care, and the conversation of your choice. After we introduce ourselves and get oriented, I'll open the well-being and self-care conversation. Look forward to hearing from you, Ava Mentee 2022-09-26, 17:28: Hi Ava! Its so great to finally hear from you and OMG we have so much is common! The fact that you too are interested to pursue Law and used to dance makes me even more excited about this experience. Here's a little bit about me:) I am in grade 12 this year and excited yet also nervous about my last year. I live in Prince Rupert, British Columbia and have lived here since I was one years old. I started dancing when I was four and have stuck with it since, making this year my final year to compete with my team (Think I may just cry.) My favourite styles are Hiphop, Modern and Musical Theatre, what were yours ? The University or Victoria is definitely in my top three for post secondary, me and my family toured the campus last summer and I fell in love with it! I also like the fact that its not too far from Rupert and that the campus isn't too intimidating. Law has always been my dream every since I was little so I love that you too are interested in that path too. However, if it goes south for whatever reason my back up plan was acting, so the fact that you even thought of going into the arts makes me feel even better about this match. I've never really had an older sister type figure so I'm truly grateful for any wisdom your willing to share with me. It's also comforting to know that you have all the answers to my questions and are more than willing to help me out. Can't wait to learn more about you and your experiences! Hope to hear from you soon, Masoom Mentor 2022-09-27, 23:48: Hey! Such a good match, they’re really good at what they do here :) As for what you’ve shared, I’ll respond in order: Congrats on your last year! I feel like we don’t celebrate that enough, it’s hard work. It’s totally normal to feel nervous, I think everybody is in the same boat as you. I was at least. I have never been to Prince Rupert, and full disclosure, haven’t been anywhere near northern BC, which is funny, because I live here now and spend more than half the year in BC. Dance!! Love that you’ve been on that journey. I was a big ballet, jazz, tap, and lyrical dancer. And competing! I’ve never actually competed — my studio was non-competitive and focused more on performance opportunities and ballet exams. Another disclosure — I love hip hop but I could never do it (and I so badly wish I could). I could try, but wow it would take work. Crying when you finish is 100% normal. Can confirm. Also -- if you don't want to say goodbye to dance completely, lots of universities (including UVic) offer classes or have dance teams. As for UVic — we have similar tastes. I chose Vic because it wasn’t too far from home but far enough, and yes, the campus is not as crazy as other places. If you ever consider it, I really have had a great experience here and enjoyed my time, and I can speak on that more if you ever want to know more about UVic. Literally ask me anything. As for law and the arts, I think us dancers have the same brain. The arts have always been something I have turned to and something I have drawn on throughout my education — people underestimate how tough it really is, mentally, emotionally, and physically, and it honestly served me very well. Lastly, as for the older sister role, that’s what I’m here for! Any questions you have at all, I’m your gal. I wouldn’t call myself wise, but I think my experiences can serve as help to you navigating your future. As for the next steps, we can chat a bit more here if you want, or we can get started on another conversation. I know you need to get wellbeing and self-care done, along with one of your choice. So, I’ll leave it up to you! We can get started on Wellbeing and Selfcare, or a conversation you want to do (lemme know which one you want to do, so I can take note of it as well), or we can continue chatting here if you have anything else you want to ask or get to know about me. Have a good week! Ava PS. I can be chatty on here — example: this message. If they are too lengthy for you, let me know, I know some people don't like to read a long message like this. I have a habit of running my mouth. Mentee 2022-09-29, 12:36: HI!!! As much as I would like to talk more my teacher wants us to have Self care and well being unlocked. Could you please do this for me? We are hoping to start this new section on Monday! Also you should just full send on hip hop, even though your more ballet driven trust me it's worth it! Thanks so much Masoom PS you don't talk too much I appreciate the length! Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:27: Hey Ava, I'm doing well, how are you? Thank you so much for all your feedback, I appreciate the detail you put into your answers and apologize for doing the bare minimum in the activities (It been a crazy week). I'm definitley going to use your advice for the future especially the lunch one haha! For next steps I think we should get right into the next discussion. Would you mind unlocking the post secondary and career planning discussion:) Thanks for everything, Masoom Mentor 2022-10-25, 12:10: Hi! I hope you're doing well! Heard that you guys are wrapping up the program, so I have clicked the wrapping up option. Please fill out the end of program survey if you get a chance! We can continue this conversation if you want, it's totally up to you! If not, I hope you the rest of your year goes great, and I wish you luck for the future! Thanks for chatting with me, and I hope I was of help to you! Cheers, Ava",,,,,
1047551564,11/20/2021 21:30,1047582876,54909,,"Mentor 2022-10-25, 12:28: Hi Kole! Since your class program is coming to a close soon I have gone ahead and opened up the end-of-program survey. If you could please fill it out that would be greatly appreciated! Your feedback is always super helpful! I will still be available to answer any questions you may have, so please don’t hesitate to reach out! If you are ready to move on then I just want to say that you have been a great mentee and I wish you all the best in your school and basketball journey! Have a great year!","Mentor 2022-09-29, 13:29: Hey there, Kole! The article above highlighted some key points I believe are vital, the first is that self-care does not need to be complicated to be effective. Personally, my self-care includes adequate sleep, sports, healthy food, boundaries between work and free time, and spending time in nature. My warning signs that I am in need of self-care are feeling sluggish, unmotivated, or overwhelmed. As an athlete, I'm certain that you have experienced how much better you feel physically and mentally after getting some exercise or playing sports with friends. The other point I really enjoyed in the article was the emphasis on creating a plan. Staying organized is such a large part of post-secondary, and having a schedule is a vital tool in reducing stress. Personally, I create plans in 4-month blocks and I find this allows me to manage my time efficiently. Having dedicated time for studying and free time allows me to focus because I know that I have a specific time to enjoy my other hobbies. How about you? What are your favorite forms of self-care? Do you change your strategies when you are in-season? How do you know when you are in need of self-care? As always, I look forward to your reply! Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:56: -Low energy -Often tired -lifting heavy objects -Sports What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? Mentor 2022-10-03, 17:23: Hey Kole! I’m glad to hear you are using sports as a form of self-care. What kind of lifting do you like to do? Do you do a lot of squats and cleans for basketball? Setting boundaries is the best tip I can provide for maintaining overall mental health. This can take the form of setting aside non-negotiable time each day for activities you enjoy, such as daily reading or lifting weights. Another example would be boundaries on where you will do work-related activities, and only working in that place. I have found that setting boundaries have helped me increase focus when I am working on a specific task, as well as reduced my stress levels since I am not worrying about unrelated tasks. Please let me know if you want any help setting up a system for setting boundaries, I am happy to help. Talk to you soon! Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:28: Self Care Action - Get more sleep, Take more breaks and Eat better How i will do this- Dont go to 10:15 mens leauge games, More rest days, Stop eating dons everyday Can you share any time management tips? Anyway, i dont hit legs when i lift becuase i play lots of sports and use my legs everyday and i can almost dunk at 5'11 so they are strong enough Mentor 2022-10-12, 11:38: Hi Kole! Your Self-Care action plan looks good! The importance of rest days is usually understated, I’m glad to see you understand their significance. If you don’t enjoy “normal” rest days, you could always try “active” rest days where you simply find a novel form of activity to allow your body to rest. The best time management time I can provide is to have a deliberate plan about when and what you are going to do. For example, I wake up at the same time every day and then go to the gym, followed by 2 “blocks” of studying. Within these “blocks” I have a list of work I need to get done, so when I sit at my desk I don't have to think about what to do, I just start going down the list. Let me know if you want more recommendations for implementing a workflow system! I look forward to hearing from you!",,,,,,"Mentor 2022-10-17, 13:53: Hey there, Kole! How did you like the video? I found the video to be very informative and easy to follow. I agree with all of the strategies outlined in the video. In particular, I am a huge fan of spaced repetition and active recall or practice testing. One of the best ways I have found to implement both of these strategies is to use flashcards, which allow you to periodically repeat older information, while also testing your ability to recall information. Another great strategy is to pretend you have to teach this topic to a friend or classmate, the act of teaching others is a great way to determine what you don't know as well as consolidate what you do know! What are your study strategies? Do you use any which were not outlined in the video? As always, feel free to ask me any questions you may have! Talk to you soon! Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:27: How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? Not likely, I am super lazy and never study. What kind of stuying strategies have you obtained since being in uni. How is this different from highschool? Mentor 2022-10-25, 12:34: Hey Kole! My strategies in university are very different from those I used in high school. In high school, I spent a lot of time re-reading notes and highlighting, which studies have shown are time-consuming and largely ineffective ways to take in information. In university, my studying has all been based on active recall and practice testing. If you want any recommendations on how to implement these systems in a simple way just let me know, I am happy to help! Talk to you soon!",,"Mentor 2022-09-21, 17:42: Hi Kole! My name is Alex, and I will be your mentor for the semester. I am 22 years old and studying biology at UBC. What about you? What classes are you in? I see that you like the gym, that’s great! I’ve been an athlete my whole life, so I’ve spent my fair share of time in the gym! I see you like basketball, that’s cool! Do you watch the NBA? I’m a Mavericks fan personally, what about you? If you have anything else (hobbies, passions, etc.) you would like to share with me, please feel free! Don’t hesitate to send me any questions you may have, I will do my best to answer them! I look forward to getting to know you! Mentee 2022-09-26, 14:44: I will bet you 20 bones that the mavs dont make it past the second round. Luka tough tho. He is one of my favourite players because hes crafty and plays at his own pace. Mentor 2022-09-27, 10:14: Hey Kole! Unfortunately, you are probably right about the early playoff exit. The Mavs really need to upgrade their supporting cast, Luka can only carry this team so far as-is. Right now, I think the only thing holding his game back is his lack of presence on defense, he tends to shrink a little when he has got to play both sides of the court like that. What position do you play? I used to play center back in my day, Shaq was my favorite player growing up! In terms of the program, did you have any questions about how things will work? Your teacher has asked that you complete “Well-Being and Self-Care” and another module of your choice. Let me know which you would like to start with! Always feel free to ask me any questions you may have! I look forward to hearing back from you! Mentee 2022-09-29, 12:38: My teacher wants us to ask to have self-care and well being unlocked. Can you please do this for me? We are hoping to start this new section on Monday. Thanks! Anyway, I play power forward but it is a guard roll so i play like the point guard just on the left side of the court. Do you think Shaq is a top three centre of all time? I think he is behind Kareem for the best centre of all time. Mentor 2022-09-29, 13:18: Hey Kole! I just opened up the “Well-Being and Self-Care” module, I look forward to completing this program with you! I think Shaq is the 2nd greatest center of all time, Kareem was far too dominant to ignore. I like Shaq so much because I got to watch him play while I was growing up, so I was more familiar with him. Talk to you soon! Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:29: Can you please open the strategic studying section.",,,,,
1047551371,11/16/2021 13:49,1047582875,54908,,,"Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:58: Some warning signs that I need some help with my mental health would be low-energy, high-energy, being desperate for attention, neglecting my personal life, grades dropping, being irritable, being constantly tired, and chewing on my hoodie strings (it's a bad habit). Some activities I enjoy that can sometimes help with my mood are watching movies, listening to music, reading comics, hanging out with my cat, and playing drums. I'd love to hear from you about self-care and such. Do you have any tips on snapping out of a funk? What's something you'll often do when you're not feeling like yourself? Mentor 2022-10-03, 14:21: lmao i hv those issues as well. I went through a really low time during this summer bc of some school and money-related stuff so I was having pretty much the same signals as you. It is quite hard for me to get over it bc they can't be resolved quickly. Usually when I am stressed and having bad mental health days, I would usually tackle what is the cause of my downward spiral and eliminate that stress, but then there are things that I cant resolve easily, so what I would do is that I would watch relaxing cooking videos and read a book as a remedy. the general rule for me is to just do what you like and talk to someone about it in order to help you sort things out. Of course these are just my methods, and everything relaxes and do things differently so, it is totally up to you to find sth you can do that can hep you relax like you mentions before. Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:33: As far as Anchor Text 2, three changes I could make to improve my self-care are to employ a strict sleep schedule to force myself to get better sleep (because sleep is a skill and I am awful at it), to set a regimen to exercise more consistently, and to make myself a schedule in an attempt to motivate me to do things I enjoy. One question I had for you was how do you prioritize self-care, and at what point do you say that self-care is more important than school or work (or vice versa)? Mentor 2022-10-12, 00:44: the sleep schedule is a good idea, cuz i also hv trouble going to sleep immediately when i need to. I, too, am like everyone else who scrolls on their phones for 3 hours when i say I'm gonna go to sleep soon lol. Exercising is a good idea as well (which reminds me i should prob do that haha) However, I think you're too focused on self-care being a part of your routine that i think it might end up being a chore rather than sth you can do to relax. It may be a part of the module to comment on what you would do to maintain a good lifestyle, but all in all, self-care is sth you should enjoy and not sth you should clock in to do. It is good to reserve some time for yourself to take care of yourself, but remember at the end of the day, self care should be sth you enjoy, not sth you should consider a chore. Anyways, personally, i think i prioritize self care too much haha. I'm not the most motivated person ever, so i do the same things you do except they are for finishing tasks, but in terms of prioritizing self-care, i think you really need to rmb that self care is how you recharge and not burn out from all the work you do. i think if you're someone who takes on work without a break, remember to take one day of the week to do absolutely nothing other than things you like to do. It could be exercising, reading, watching movies, and so on. Just rmb that you should feel recharged after a self-care session, not drained. Mentor 2022-10-23, 05:04: Hello is everything alright? You haven't replied to my message or started a new section? just checking up on you, no pressure!",,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-09-29, 12:34: Hi Renee, Nice to meet you! I'm excited to start talking.

So i received a message from my higher-ups that it's about time to wrap up this programme, I'm rly glad to have met you, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. There will be a lot of struggles to make it as an art person, I am too, but you will find success, and you will be able to persevere. Remember to do your end-of-programme survey and enjoy the rest of your time in school. Work hard but also play hard ;) really nice to have met you and talked to you! Mentee 2022-11-07, 21:30: Hi Renee, It was great having you as my mentor! Sorry I was absent for much of the program, I had to leave town for a couple weeks due to work.

Let me know when you've gone through the first text, including reading the article and watching the video (you can turn on closed captions if audio is an issue). I'd really like to know what your thoughts are on those. I'd also like to know what self-care means to you. For me, it's really a continous process of taking care of myself through the things we sometimes don't think about so much like eating healthy, drinking water, and taking time to relax and do something I enjoy. It's really helped me in my daily life to engage in this and think it's a crucial component of life that can't be taken for granted. Do let me know when you're ready to go to the first set of discussion questions! P.S. I usually play small forward, like to play more on the defense side. Cheers! Eashan Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:43: Small forward, nice! I'm a centre myself. A few warning signs for me that mean I'm in need of some self care, are when i become easily irritated, feel angry but dont know why, and tend to feel constantly tired. Personally i enjoy going to workout, play basketball, lift, anything that gets me outta the house and moving. I also enjoy hanging out with friends, going out, going on a hike ect. These things make me happy and often lead to me feeling very cotent after. I was wondering what you do when youre feeling off or exaughsted and what you do to get out of it? Mentor 2022-10-13, 11:13: Hey Joshua, Nice! Centre's a pretty important role. It's great that you've noted these signs in detail and have things in place to address them. In my case, I also really like to do something physical/productive when I'm feeling tired. This can be something like exercise, badminton, dance, or finishing a piece of work that's been on my mind for a while. To me, the best way of feeling energetic and motivated is to do something and push through the feeling of low energy - that pretty much always works for me. I also noticed in my own case that I tend to overlook drinking water while working so that's something that I have to consciously remind myself to do. Are there any things that you would want to add on to your routine? Like eating, drinking water, sleeping etc. As in my case with drinking water, can you think of a couple of things that you would want to change in how you take care of yourself? Let me know! Eashan Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:41: As far as taking care of myself physically i feel that i am quite sufficient. I feel i am keeping up with my supliments, nutrition ect. however there are perhaps a few things i could do to benifit myself both physically and mentally. A few actions i would like to take: Getting a bit more sleep, putting my phone away earlier and aiming for a more consistant time to be in bed. I should aslo stop going to the gym so late at night. I would aslo like to develp my social life a bit more. I'm gonna start spending more time with my friends even if it means putting other things aside temporarally. I guess i could also make some minor improvements to my diet. I plan on packing myself meals for times that i am in a pinch for time to eat, when i have morning practice i tend to ocassionally get mcdonalds for breakfast because i am short on time. Thank you for asking. I was also wondering if you could unlock dis- &amp; misinformation please.",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-26, 12:19: Hey Joshua, I'm Eashan and I will be your mentor over the coming days for this program. I am glad to virtually meet and look forward to us having some productive conversations! How is school going? Could you tell me a little bit about yourself and what you are hoping to get out of this program, such as learning how to save money at school as you mentioned on your profile? I see you like to play basketball, I do as well! I understand your teacher has asked you to complete the ""Well-Being and Self-Care"" conversation and any other one of your choice. Do let me know if that's correct. Please take a look through the links on this page - you can check off the boxes to keep track. Once you feel comfortable with navigating the program interface, do let me know which conversation you'd like to start with. Look forward to hearing back!

Can you please do this for me? we are hoping to start this new section on Monday. Thanks! Also just curious, what position do you play in basketball?",,"Mentor 2022-10-19, 11:22: Hey Joshua, It's great to hear that you're putting in the time and effort for that kind of self-reflection - having those plans in place can really go a long way towards preserving your health as you advance in your education and career. I also think it's good that you're focusing on smaller, doable changes to your lifestyle. Don't hesistate to let me know if you have any questions around this topic. I unlocked the second conversation for you on Monday, did you get a chance to look through the materials? I think the articles are really illustrative of the ways in which we can get the wrong information and hold it to be right. Have you had any experiences with the news that really stand out to you? I would be interested if there's been anything that evoked a strong emotional response from you? Maybe about an issue that you care about? As well, have you ever tried to point out misinformation to someone else? I personally think that misinformation is all around us, especially in this age of social media, and would really like to know your thoughts on this. Best, Eashan Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:37: Hey Eashan, I did look through the materials, they where quite interesting. I personally have had multiple instances of misinformation between both my friends and family. Given our current advances in technology most people i am around are constantly being fed different types of misinformation. they absorb this information through various social medias, tik tok, facebook, instagram, ect. I have also had experiences with people feeding me misinformation and me feeding people misinformation. An example of this was when me and my friends where watching a basketball game last night. We had a disagreememt about the current standings in the legue, one of us had seen something different on instagram then what we saw on the nba app. We got to the bottom of it and decided who was right. This instance of misinformation could have easily been avoided if it wasnt on social media. Where do you personally get your news and find reliable sources of information? Mentor 2022-10-26, 11:47: Hey Joshua, It's great that you're able to both identify misinformation as well as some common sources of it. The example you gave is a great case of misinformation that is the result of someone assuming something to be true without double-checking and it's great that you were able to reolve that. Personally, I tend to get my news from several sources that are known to be reliable in their reporting of the base facts of a news story and cross-check. Social media may not be the best place to get news from as facts can be filtered through the opinions and views of many people before they get to you. If you see something that is being claimed as true, you could use a search engine to look for more information on the story and the common facts that are being reported across different sources. I would also focus more on the facts of a story as opposed to the views and opinions of the people that are reporting it as they may not have any background in the field. I hope that is helpful! I believe we are to wrap up the program so I will go ahead and open up the Wrapping Up module so that you can take the survey when you are able to. However, I can still answer any questions you have or may have later around anything we've discussed so far or anything else you'd like to know even after that if you so wish. Do let me know what'd you'd like to know! Best, Eashan",,,

I hope the rest of your grade 12 year goes well!","Mentor 2022-09-30, 00:00: Hi Zoey! This is the well-being and self-care module! I personally find this one very important as a student. I have struggled with mental health in the past, especially when school went completely online because of COVID. During this time I would study on my laptop non-stop and leave my house only occasionally. This led to insomnia and other day-to-day problems like lack of motivation. Some of the ways I overcame this issue was by studying with a friend over facetime, working out in my garage, or going for a run outside. I also started to cook a lot more and create some of my own recipes! In this module, we'll have some discussions and you'll get the opportunity to complete some activities:) Mentee 2022-10-04, 13:47: Hi there! Just doing a quick test email... for some odd reason it isn't letting me send my answers to the first discussion post. I'll hopefully get this figure out with my teacher and send you my response shortly! Mentee 2022-10-04, 13:52: Okay here are the discussion questions hopefully they send: 1) Warning Signs - tired - procrastinating - irritable 2) Actions &amp; Activities that I enjoy - going to the gym - walks - reading Questions for you : Do you have any tips on getting out of a funk? Or when you're feeling low or not yourself. Also when covid started, were you in your first year of university? Mentor 2022-10-05, 21:19: Hi Zoey! Awesome responses:) I personally, also enjoy doing all of the activities that you have listed when I'm trying to get out of a funk! I love going to the gym, or a run outside. One other thing I try to do is reconnect with friends and family because I find that when I'm sad or feeling lazy, etc, it's usually when I'm alone and super busy because of school and work. So, I try to spend some time with my dog, friends, family, and boyfriend. Even a quick facetime call helps me when I don't have time to see them in person. And, yes, I was in my first year when COVID hit. It happened very suddenly! We all went to school normally, were studying hard for upcoming midterms, and then on our way home on the bus I received a notification saying that in-person classes would no longer be happening. During that time we thought it would just be a one-week break! But then 2 years went by! Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:33: I love doing those things as well when I'm in a funk! Usually I try to do a lot of cleaning to help me get out of my funk to motivate myself to do other productive things. My room usually gets really messy when I'm feeling down. And that must be so weird to experience your first couple years online! It's definitely a unique experience that doesn't happen often. Here are the next discussions btw :) Self Care Actions &amp; Making it apart of my life: Actually having breakfast every morning - Wake up earlier Get more sleep - Go to bed earlier/stop going on my ohone late at night Stay on top of my work - Do more homework and extra studying to stay ahead so I don't stress myself out Mentor 2022-10-13, 22:42: Hey, my room also gets so messy when I'm stressed out (aka rn ahhaha)! All your ideas are awesome! I think we can finish off this module now unless you have any other questions? Also, I believe you get to choose what module you want to work on next:)",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-23, 11:40: Hi Zoey! My name is Gurleen and I'm a 4th-year biology student at UBC! I will be your mentor for the next month and a bit. I will guide you through the eMentoring conversations! I would love to get to know a bit about you:) And ofc feel free to ask me any questions, about school, hobbies, extracurriculars, and anything else you may be curious about! Mentee 2022-09-28, 19:59: Hey Gurleen! Sorry I've been so busy with a bunch of homework. How did you decide what you wanted to be when you were in highschool? Mentor 2022-09-28, 22:47: No worries! I know how it is, I am also getting pretty busy with midterms and assignments! Tbh I did not know exactly what I wanted to be in high school. I knew that I enjoyed sciences, so I decided to pursue a science degree at university. I think what really helped me decide, was finding volunteer opportunities in areas that interested me. For example, I volunteered at a care home, physio clinic, and kids art camp, to gain experience in a health care and teaching role (2 of the areas I thought I would enjoy working in). However, again I still didn't know the exact career I wanted to do, just the general area. Even in my 4th year of undergrad, although my plan is to become a physiotherapist, I wouldn't be too surprised if I ended up with a different career. I think in high school, keep your options open and really try to determine what field of study you enjoy. After you're in that field of study, you can explore all of the careers associated with it! I hope this helps:) Mentee 2022-09-29, 12:40: Oh that's so cool! So far I'm taking physics, chemisrty and biology to keep all my options open in the science department. I'm hoping to study kinesiology or something like that because I'm super passionate about working out and health related things. I'm also thinking of becoming a physiotherapist but I'm not exactly sure yet. Also my teacher wants us to ask to have Self-care and well being unlocked. Can you please do this for me? :) We're hoping to start this section on Monday. Mentor 2022-09-29, 23:44: Kinesiology is a great program, especially if you enjoy studying human biology! I actually wanted to transfer to kinesiology (it's a separate faculty from science at UBC) after my 1st year, but then ended up just majoring in biology through the science faculty. And, yes! I will open up the self-care and well-being module! Mentee 2022-10-06, 11:03: I've applied to SFU and UVIC so far for the kinesiology program but I'm actually thinking of applying to UBC or UBCO as well. I'm hoping to keep my options open because I'm not exactly sure what I want to be anymore. However, I've been researching more careers in my class and I find occupational therapy very interesting. I'm just not sure if other options are still available if I'm going directly into a kinesiology program. Mentor 2022-10-07, 10:23: I think if you are not sure about which school you want to go to yet, applying to multiple is always a good option. The ones you've already applied to are all wonderful schools. If you are planning on applying to the UBC Kin program as well, I can tell you a few differences between it and the SFU one. From my understanding, Kinesiology is a major under sciences at SFU, so you would graduate with a BSc. in Kinesiology. However, at UBC the kinesiology faculty is separate from the Science faculty, so you would graduate with a bachelor of Kinesiology. In terms of school, this means that at SFU you will have to do first-year and a few second-year chem, physics, and math courses. However, at UBC, you don't have to do any of the science courses and will go straight into the kinesiology courses! Once you graduate with a kin degree you can work as a kinesiologist, apply for a masters program, such as physio or occupational therapy, or honestly anything else that you want to do as long as you do the prereqs for that program. You can also apply to grad schools, such as Med School. A Physiotherapist focuses on treating a patient's injury while an occupational therapist helps the injured patient live life with the injury. For example, the OT might help the patient make a return to work plan. A lot of the time OT's and PT's work together! I know a lot of this is probably really confusing rn, so lmk if you don't understand something :) Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:17: Nope I think I'm ready to start a different module! Could we start From Rural to Urban? Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:21: Also I had no idea about the programs at UBC, that definetly opens a lot more options and I think I'll apply there too. I'll have more questions for sure when I do Mentee 2022-10-25, 20:23: Also, sorry for a late message but I was wondering about your experience of applying to UBC. When you were filling out the questions for all applicants part, was there a certain format you had to follow or did you kind of write it on the spot with a rough draft beforehand? This parts seems pretty stressful... and I definitely should've gotten to this sooner. Mentor 2022-10-25, 23:56: For my UBC application, I definitely answered the questions in a separate document and then transferred my answers over to the application. As far as formatting goes, tbh I don't think there was a specific one I followed (just make sure you follow the word count). Also, one thing I found really helpful was getting others to edit my responses. I even asked my English teacher at the time to help me! I guess one other thing to keep in mind if you feeling stressed about the amount of time you have to complete the application is that there are two different application submission deadlines. The first round gives you eligibility for early acceptance and scholarships (deadline: DEC 1ST). And then there is another deadline if you do not necessarily care about early acceptance or scholarships which closes later (Deadline: JAN 15). So if you feel like you need more time to write your application you can always submit it in time for the second deadline. However, I feel if you start now you'll have plenty of time! Link to application deadline dates: https://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/dates-deadlines/ Mentor 2022-11-01, 07:55: Hi Zoey, sorry for the late reply! I'm so glad you found the info helpful! Feel free to ask me any other questions that you may have:) Thanks for being such a great mentee!","Mentor 2022-10-18, 11:27: Hey Zoey, I have opened up the rural-to-urban module. To start off you'll be answering a few discussion questions :) Mentor 2022-10-18, 11:28: Yeah, shoot me a message when you start applying! Mentee 2022-10-19, 13:29: Three Things I Like About Living in a Rural Area 1) I love being so close to nature/the ocean 2) It's easy to walk everywhere 3) Everyone knows eachother Two Things I Don't Like 1) There's not much to do here at all 2) Less opportunities to find a job here unless you want to work at the port and my question for you is what do you like and dislike about where you live? Mentor 2022-10-20, 23:03: I have lived most of my life in the same town and it's definitely not a rural town but it has that small-town feel to some degree. I feel most of the community is very connected which is one thing I really like about my hometown. For example, we are known to be a farmer's area and host a rodeo every year haha. I also like that I have easy access to a lot of things (grocery stores, the mall, the beach, etc). I guess it kind of provides the best of both words (a bit of rural and a bit of city). One thing I don't like about it is that it is pretty far (about 1.5 hours) from Vancouver where I go to school and where a lot of organized events take place. But other than that I tend to love living where I do, it can just be annoying during the school year when I have to wake up at 5 am to make it on time for an 8 am class lol. Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:26: That's what I love about small towns so much, Everything is easy access and everyone knows each other which 100% makes the community stronger. The population of my town is like 12,000 something which makes it really easy to find someone in town and have community events. Have you been able to live on your hometown while going to UBC for the past couple years? Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:34: And for the second discussion questions for keeping traditions when im away from home is that I want to continue going on walks on nice trails which I'm probably guessing you know there's a ton of nice ones in Van. There are so many in my town and I love being able to walk through a nice nature path. Mentee 2022-10-26, 12:22: Thank you so much! I really apperciate the help and information you've given me! I'll for sure ask my english teacher to help me on this and as soon as I have everything ready for it, I'll be ready to apply :)",,,,

I'm sorry if it is a little hasty for you, but I just want to make sure you can finish this program within the syllabus. Anyway, this is a chance for us to debrief what we gained from the program and impressions to each other. For me, I'm really nice to meet you. Through the program, we learned two sections: Finding Inspiration, Well Being and Self Care. You were smart and patient, always finished the tasks on time. I hope you can have an unforgettable and successful grade 12. Even you might always face challenges, I believe you can make it with your wisdoms. Now it's your turn. Please feel free to share anything about me or this program. One last thing, please finish Final Program Survey above for us to improve the program. Thanks for your participation! Yiming","Mentor 2022-09-29, 23:10: Hi Caivan, No worries! Thank you very much for your introduction, and it's so nice to learn a little more about you. It is such a good question of the life in uni. I would say uni life is quite different than high school, as you are asked to study more independently and manage time for yourself. Even the coursework can be intensive, there are still lots of chances for you to enjoy a club and meet like-minded people. It will be such a busy and colorful life. And no problem, we are moving to the module Well-Being and Self-Care! Please scroll up to the green circle at the top of the page, and click Well-Being and Self-Care to get to it. Here we have Anchor Text 1 and 2, following with 2 discussions (including Think, Share, and Ask). Let's working on 1 first. Please watch the video, click Discussion Questions 1 (Self-Investment), and finish Think and Share parts. I will also do it reciprocally, and we will be open for questions asking. Feel free to ask for any questions you have. Yiming Mentee 2022-10-03, 12:54: Warning signs of mine are commonly: procrastination, fatigue, no motivation, no work ethic, and overall lack of creativity Going to the gym, walks, gaming and movies, and often hanging out with friends My question for my mentor is…… • Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? Mentor 2022-10-04, 10:29: Hi Caivan, Thanks for your answers. Good job! 1. Warning signs for me: feel frustrated, low confidence, impatience, and losing interests of new things. 2. Actions I enjoy: hiking, jogging, chatting with friends, and listening to Jazz 3. That's a good question! Like I said in question 2, I would try to forget bad things for a moment, and do something I enjoy to lift my mood. When I come back to handle it, I can do it better with more rational mood. Does it work for you? Now I also have a question for you: could you please share your thoughts of why well-being and self-care are so important to a student? Feel free to ask me a question back if you wish. Also, we can move on to Anchor Text 2: Self-Care Action Plan. Please read it and make your sharings in terms of Share and Ask. Wish you a good week ahead. Yiming Mentor 2022-10-11, 10:35: Hi Caivan, How are you? I haven't heard from you around 1 week. I know you might be really busy with your school work. Just wanna check whether you are ok, and if so, we can continue our conversation. Yiming Mentee 2022-10-11, 23:30: HI!, sorry I've been kept up with school work and it slipped my mind now to answer your previous questions, I believe self-care is critical to students, we often live fast pace lives and taking care of ourselves keeps that energy there and so we don't sink so you don't slip into a negative mindset, further into a negative style of life. I am currently waiting for instruction from my teacher when I find ill be sure to update you. Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:40: Hi! just starting self-care and well being part 2, first off i genuinely need more sleep i go to sleep way to late, that would be the first thing i am going to change. To do this i will restrict or slowly lessen the amount of time i am doing stuff and leave a little bit of time to read and relax. Secondly i need to focus more on making money than spending money. I will have to take away the distractions like restaurants, movies, etc. Finally i wish to change the amount of time i spend with my family, to fix that i just need to stop procrastinating. Now i have a question for you, do you have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) i ask that you open finding inspiration for the next box, thank you i hope to hear from you soon!! Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:44:  Mentor 2022-10-26, 23:58: Hi Caivan, Thanks for your great answers. For you question that why I chose my career as environmental professional, I would say the decision was made by my interest in this field and the willingness to mitigate the climate change. We know that it is real and affecting everyone. I think in this section, there is still the Anchor Text 2 remained right? As I received your teacher's message of wrapping up, I would leave it as an optional task for you. Feel free to share something if you want. Now we are excited to enter the final stage of wrapping up. Please scroll up to the green circle and click ""Wrapping Up"" in the middle. See my next message for it, thank you. Yiming Mentor 2022-11-02, 21:03: Hi Caivan, I'm very glad to get your sharing in anchor text 2. They are awesome, thank you. The goal I had in my high school is that I wished I could review more the knowledge for exams so that might I can get better results of exams. I didn't make it due to my laziness and bad time management. If I can do it again I will better arrange my study schedule and give more time for reviewing. Now I think you've completed all the modules and you can respond to my message in Wrapping Up if you wish. Have a nice day. Yiming",,,,"Mentor 2022-10-20, 12:27: Hi Caivan, Nice to chat again. Well done of your answers. As for your question, it's really a good one! Personally, I have some ideas of breaking a habit for your reference. 1. Make tangible plans. Quantitatively make plans about how to change a habit (ex. I want to eat fast food only twice this week and choose healthier options for the rest of my week.) 2. Seek supports from people around you. Tell your family or friends you really want to change some bad habits and you might need their supports or reminds (Ex. let your parents remind you when you are too obsessed with those clips and forget to sleep.). 3. Award yourself for achievements (in a healthy way). Sometimes we need to encourage ourselves as well. Hope these are helpful. No problems, we are moving to the module Finding Inspiration! Please scroll up to the green circle at the top of the page and click Finding Inspiration to get to it. Let's working on Anchor Text 1. Please watch the video, click Discussion Questions 1 (What Do You Want?), and finish Think, Share and Ask parts. Please feel free to reach out for any problems you have. Thank you! Yiming Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:35: Howdy once again, im starting the finding inspiration anchor now. the first thing i want in life is to be able to freely work on cars and build some very cool cars, personally i find the way everything comes together perfectly appealing to my brain. secondly i wish to be able to backpack in foregin countries later on in life, ive done alot of traveling when i was younger but only scratched the surface so i wish to dive more indepth in the cultures. Next i want to be able to see my family i dont wanna be super far away from them, theres really need to explain why its pretty self-explanitory. I also want the ability to just relax sometimes where theres not that overwhelming feeling of worry, purely i want this to save my mental health. Finally i want a stable way to work on my mental health, its pretty self explanatory. what made you go down the path you did in life? ( career, school) Mentee 2022-10-25, 12:37:  Mentee 2022-10-31, 12:41: i hope this reaches you in time i just got your email and was unaware we were supposed to do both anchors so if theres still time i will do it. i often prepare early in the morning and plan for everything i may do in the day as soon as i can so i can be ready for anything that will come at me including my goal to be effecient and as effective worker at my job. for ever hour i do of class i do a half hour to an hour of homework each day so i can be able to keep up with everyone at school. finally i also plan ahead to spend one on one time with family so that i can build lasting bond those family members. now for my question, What goals did you have when you were in high school? Did you achieved them? If so, how? If not, what could you have done differently?",,,,"Mentor 2022-09-23, 12:15: Hi Caivan, how are you? Very excited to meet you! I am your mentor Yiming, recently graduating from UBC Master of Land and Water Systems. My dream career is environmental industry. My hobbies are hiking, ice skating and hanging out with friends.

I am a very extroverted person who has a knack for meeting new people. i've spent a good portion of my teens working and building a work ethic preparing for life other than that i love hiking and exploring with friends, i especially love traveling ive been too many countries around the world. im a huge nerd for action movies: fast and furious, john wick trilogy, etc. if you have anything you wanna know about me, if not id like to know more about how university is for you: managing life and school, keeping up with work loads anything you think i may find interesting.

On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? Mentor 2022-10-17, 01:41: I apologize for the delayed reply. Exam time is challenging! How is your week going? Are you also in the middle of the midterms? Do you currently have midterms going on? Also, I see you like watching movies, and I do too. Which genres do you prefer? Personally, I like romantic comedies, comedies, or gothic fiction. ""What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult?"" Since starting a new chapter of life involves a big shift from your familiar comfort zone, there are a few mental health issues that are certain to arise. It was my first time being away from my family, therefore I personally struggled with anxiety. Thinking about the future makes me feel more anxious because I can't anticipate what will happen, even though it would be amazing if I could (just think of all the tests I'd ace!) I have to accept that I can't. But since then, I've developed coping mechanisms, starting with identifying the cause of my anxiety—poor schedule planning and management—and now that I understand how to deal with it, things are getting easier. Even with everything I do, there are still times when my anxiety is simply unmanageable. To deal with this, I try to talk to others about how I am feeling, which often helps, but when it doesn't, I take some time for myself. I just enjoy a calm day by myself with some comfort food in my pajamas, putting everything on hold for a few hours to take a nap, go on a nature walk, take a nice warm shower, or just watch a movie to stop my brain from overthinking everything. And if that isn't enough and you need assistance, there are many services on campus and many fantastic ones offered by the government that are usually free and a great help. Regarding the advantages, I believe that having more control over my life and being able to take time for myself when necessary are the main ones. Additionally, there are others in post-secondary who are experiencing and dealing with the same pressures as you and having this community of people, which is helpful since they will understand, support, and decrease your sense of loneliness. Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:47: ""Are you also in the middle of the midterms?"" No i am not just a final in a couple weeks. ""Which genres do you prefer?"" i really injoy watching murder mystery,romantic comedies and horror. THINK about how good you are at self-care. Do you get enough sleep? Eat healthy? Drink enough water? Get enough exercise? Take breaks? Make time to do things you enjoy? myself-care is just taking the time to hangout with friends/family. I also try and go to the gym 5 times a week just to keep me some what fit and also gives me something to do with my time. eating healthy is a bit challenging because i have to make my own dinner and most of the time we don't have any vegetables i lke, i'm very picky so it's hard for me to try new thing and hard to find something i like. I go to sleep around 1 to 1:30 and its hard for me to get up in the morning so i would lile to fix this SHARE with your mentor THREE changes you can make to your life right now that will allow you to take better care of yourself. For each proposed change, describe a concrete plan to make that change part of your daily schedule. Hopefully these new actions will become habits. eating better i can improve this by planing my meals ahead of time. going to sleep earlier i can improve this by turning my phone off drink more water I can improve this my bring my water bottle with me Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) Mentor 2022-10-19, 02:39: A little bit of everything, the holy trinity of genres, I see. Those are some of my favorites as well! Have you seen The Only Murders in the Building? If not, watch it when you have some time on your hands. It's a creative murder mystery. In my experience, turning off your phone before bed is the greatest way to fall asleep. Because, no matter what the notification is if I am attempting to go sleep and one appears, I am immediately drawn back into it and then after that, there is a constant back and forth in my head, which makes me feel awful about myself. ""Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.)"" My worst habit is procrastination, especially when it comes to exams. I am utterly terrible at sticking to and carrying out a study schedule, which makes me really stressed out days before the tests and causes me to pull all-nighters and develop horrible eating habits. But I think I've figured it out; I've been using the 7,3,1 rule whenever I'm studying or doing anything else. I usually mark the exam date on my calendar, count backward seven days from that date to determine the day I will begin studying for the exam, forward four days to determine the second study day, and briefly review everything I covered on the first day before beginning new material, and then count two more days forward to determine the third study day, which will be the day before the exam. This way, I can pace myself so that I don't burn out while also avoiding feeling overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to learn. I can also learn the topic more thoroughly in advance so that I may perform at my best on the exam and succeed at it. I believe that concludes this conversation. Please let me know what you would like to explore next, and I will then open it up for you to start!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-29, 11:32: Hi Ivy, how are you?

Please complete the survey above :) Thank you for participating in this program, it was greating getting to know you (virtually) LOL! I enjoyed our ""Well Being and Self Care"" conversation. I will definitely try to ensure I work on my goals to achieve that. Also, I have the ""Getting Hired"" module open and I will be starting our conversation there if you would like to continue :). I wish you the best in life and I hope you enjoyed this program! Again, thank you so much!","Mentor 2022-10-14, 00:27: Starting our conversation on ""Well being &amp; Self Care"", as a third year university student I definitely relate to this. During my first semester at UBC, I was satisfied with taking on more challenges coming from high school. I decided to take five courses. I noticed that I had less time to do the things I like, the things that recharge my momentum and refresh me so that I am more productive in upcoming tasks. After that, I promised myself to take a lighter course load, which enabled me to join a soccer team (intramurals) (""A healthy mind is in need of a healthy body""). And now 2 years later, I am currently taking four courses. Even though I was struggling my first year, I tried to find the root of the problem and obtain a solution. Taking less courses rewarded me with higher marks and allowed me to focus my view on academics in a positive way (ensuring I take courses I like). I listened to advice from past students that all take fewer courses! Any stressful events you had to cope with recently? What means do you use for self-care? How do you know you are in need of a break? I hope to hear from you soon! Mentee 2022-10-17, 12:51: if you feel sad that one warning and if you feel tried or if you dont like stuff you use to thats a warning signs some thing that help you video games or friends or ask a some one for help . do you have any ideas that can help Mentor 2022-10-18, 23:06: Those are definitely some warning signs. The one I relate to the most is feeling tired. Even though one might be getting enough sleep, hydrating, and attending to all the physical needs, it is the mental needs that also play a role. That's why it is very important to take a break to do the things you enjoy. For me, I enjoy going on drives, hanging out with my friends, and playing soccer. This gives me time off the work I am doing so that I can come back refreshed. However, also taking care of the physical being is important. In the end, ""a healthy mind is in need of a healthy body"" :) A few changes I would make to improve my self-care and well-being: 1) Quality Time Off Work: My job at the moment involves working from home occasionally.

I find that I use my phone before I sleep often. I plan to stop using my phone 30 minutes before going to sleep by disabling the notifications at specific times. This will enable me to get my quality sleep. Are there any changes you would start to improve your well-being and self-care. If so, how do you plan on achieving those goals? Mentor 2022-10-30, 18:46: Those are really great goals to improve your well-being and self-care! One important thing to think about is: How will I achieve my goals? The way I like to ensure I will meet my goals is by having smaller goals (which I call objectives) that would help me slowly build myself and the necessary skills to achieve these goals. It would be really helpful if you can try to think of the objectives that would help you accomplish your goals to improve your well-being and self care! :)",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-25, 18:47: Hello Hello! ??My name is Alwalid (you can call me AJ, that's my nickname because no one can actually pronounce my name, but there is no issue around that here because there won't be any pronounciation LOL), and I am excited about being your mentor.

Starting our conversation on the topic of ""Getting Hired"", many of the skills gained in high school are transferrable. They can be used/improved when volunteering, working, or even doing things you enjoy. One skill acquired in high school is communication. Communication skill is acquired by doing and is something that will constantly improve with practice, so it doesn't have a limit. You may have acquired/used your communication skills in class presentation, team projects etc. For example, communicating your responsibilities to a group that you are working with to complete a project/presentation enables you to ensure the project will be completed smoothly. Another skill is mentioned in the example given; responsibility! It is important to take responsibilty and ensure you meet the goals you have mentioned to your team as that will impact your score and theirs. Understanding and predicting how much load you can take in a project is a great skill to be learnt. You definitely do not want to stress yourself by taking on many goals and responsibilites. What other skills do you think you have learned in highschool or any other experience? What can you do to improve these skills? How do you present your skills in your resume?",,

Take care, Tommy","Mentor 2022-10-07, 15:54: Interesting, I think reading and baking/cooking are great ways of relieving stress and taking your mind off things! I also tend to overthink things and experience feelings such as guilt when I am in need of a recharge. My warning signs are: low mood feeling irritable having anxious + negative thoughts not wanting to engage with others Activities I enjoy: going for a run spending time with family and friends watching sports (i.e. hockey and football) going for a drive somewhere new to me Let me know if you have any questions about anything! (: Mentee 2022-10-11, 12:37: I also like driving/exploring new places aswell, also how have you managed your mental health during high school? or as an adult, and if you have any resouces, could i please know how you found them? Mentor 2022-10-12, 20:39: Great questions, I would say there were a couple main things that I did to manage my mental health in high school. The first one was spending lots of time with my friends - this was an easy way to have fun outside of school and take my mind off of things. Secondly, I made sure to keep up with my hobbies; for me, this included playing hockey and watching sports with my Dad on the weekends. Remember, while it is very important to stay up to date on your school assignments and work hard, it is equally important to maintain a work-life balance and do things that make you happy outside of school. About resources, I suggest talking to a close friend or family member who you can trust with your feelings. I find that talking about things that are bothering me is very beneficial for my mental health and definitely takes some weight off of my shoulders. Otherwise, there are Ted Talk videos on youtube about how to manage your mental health - these will give you some good strategies for how to do so (just search ""Ted Talk mental health"" on youtube and there will be a bunch you can choose from). Also, talking to a counsellor can be helpful - counselling sessions are typically not free but there might be some free services within your community that you can access if you search online. Hope this helps!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-21, 14:01: Hi Claire! I will be your mentor for the next few months.

Nice to meet you :) My name is Hannah and I'm doing my masters in library studies at UBC right now, but I did my first degree in English literature. I am also obsessed with poetry and I was so excited to see on your profile that you're a writer and want to study poetry! I'd love to hear about some of your fav poems/poets and what you like to write about. (Maybe even share some of your work sometime if you're comfortable?) I think one of my favourites right now is this poem by Emily Berry, but I'm also a big fan of Richard Siken, Mary Oliver, and Louise Gluck. I think it's super cool that you like to look at songs like they're poems, too! That's honestly such a good way to find inspo and learn new ways to experiment with words and a lot of songwriters are also really talented poets! I have some friends who have studied creative writing in university and I took a few writing classes too, so I'd be super down to talk to you more about that if you have any questions! Also, please let me know which of the modules you want to start with and maybe think about which you want to do as your free choice :) I'm excited to chat with you more!

Hope that's alright, and if you'd like, you can choose the next one? Different ways of knowing and being: Fascinating! Seriously. This has been on my mind too lately: How are people different from me and in what ways? Life is incomprehensibly vast, maybe similar in scope to the universe(?). I want you to take a jab at the warm up question and share if you're comfortable. Then check out the anchor text and answer one of the discussion questions. Sounds good? And also, if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask. JY Mentee 2022-10-04, 09:09: • • • Since many post-secondary schools are places of research, have they seen any research projects similar to this story taking place at their school? Are there opportunities to get involved in this research? Mentor 2022-10-10, 18:55: Sorry for the late message Brody!! I've been doing some travelling in Toronto and lost track of somethings, but I'll make sure from now I give you speedy replies. Also, please ask me questions about Toronto and my travels!! Hmmmm. As for research, I'll do some research myself and give you a better answer, but that's a great question! I know that in the forestry department especially they tend to centre Indigenous knowledge as an important relationship with the land, which connects with their research projects. From my experience it's less common in Creative Writing and English, but connections with Indigenous ways of knowing are developing, just quietly. Just personally, I think this work is really interesting and valuable! Check out one of the discussion questions and give them a go. I recommend going after the question that interests you the most, or even bothers you. If you'd like, you can also ask me that question and I'll help you through it. Mentee 2022-10-11, 11:03: Since many post-secondary schools are places of research, have they seen any research projects similar to this story taking place at their school? Are there opportunities to get involved in this research Mentor 2022-10-11, 18:45: https://irsi.ubc.ca/ So the link above goes to the Indigenous Research Support Institute at UBC website. It has some interesting information around how research is becoming more Indigenized. https://indigenous.educ.ubc.ca/grants-and-bursaries/ This link shows the research projects of assistant professor Cash Ahenakew that prioritize Indigenous knowledge, one relevant to me is research on traditional and innovative ways of mentoring. One way to get involved in this research is to start your own projects doing an honours undergraduate program or masters program at UBC. Programs in multiple fields (forestry, education, sociology etc..) offer year long research projects and you can choose to prioritize Indigenous knowledge and/or talk to and receive mentorship from professors like Cash Ahenakew. Also, there are often opportunities for students to work for these research projects at multiple levels, they just might require some background experience and a job interview before hand. Hope some of this helps Brody! And remember, I'm not an emotionless robot, feel free to talk casually with me! Mentee 2022-10-13, 12:35: What do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the landWhat do you think the difference is between studying the land and living on the land? i think the diffrence of studying the land and living on the land is wehn you areauctullay lifing some where you get tosee the land in person you can study all you want but when you are acutally somwhere i think you learne a lot more about the land. its like see mexico in a picture it looks nice and you can learn the culture on line but once you acutally go there you can experaince the cluture Mentor 2022-10-16, 17:39: Great answer! It's totally true that if you're on the land, you get to actually see and experience the land for yourself. Can you think of something you'd like to experience in person somewhere? Maybe Mexico? Mentor 2022-10-20, 16:57: Hey Brody, I noticed you wrapped up the ""different ways of knowing"" conversation. We'll have to watch the second video and discuss it a bit before we fully finish. Also, plz let me know if there's anything I can do to help, or how you feel about the program. I know this program can be challenging, so if we talk about how you're doing with it I could also help you through that process. We can also talk about something else for awhile, like: what sort of biking are you into? Outdoors, Mountain, BMX, I got into BMX's for a bit in highschool! Mentee 2022-11-08, 12:25: Are there any Indigenous inventions or innovations that Jeff talked about that surprised you? What did you find surprising? If you can, describe other examples of Indigenous innovation. • Which of the Seven Teachings have they struggled with, and what have they done to improve in this area? Mentor 2022-11-17, 17:44: I'll write my answers below, but I also want your answers to the questions too! Just give it a try, no pressure! I was definitely surprised by the baby carrier because of how practical and useful it was! We associate practicality and use to modern day inventions and attitudes, but it's simply not true, people, especailly Indigenous peoples have been innovating and figuring out solutions to their problems for millenia. I definitely struggle with all seven from time to time, but one that comes up a lot is humility. It's really really really hard to see that we're not at the centre of the universe, to instead see the beauty that's just around us, in the people, the living creatures, the nature of reality. We can get so caught up in being judgemental, feeling like we know so much, when really, we all know very little! This is something I try to remind myself of often: The universe is a mystery, when you accept that you can find humility.

Jw Mentor 2023-01-19, 12:43: Hey Brody, I'm sorry i've been afk, things have been a bit difficult on my end. Mental health is something I've struggled with over my post-secondary years, currently, and I think I will continue to deal with it. I live with anxiety, depression, and OCD, and so there are a bunch of things I have to think of daily in order to keep myself healthy. It's gotten wayyy better over the years, but I still struggle with it at times. Overall, the most important things to me have been maintaining ""mindfulness"" over how I'm feeling and thinking throughout the day, so I know whether an emotion or thought is ""good or bad"" for me. I find this can be especially difficult if we are not in touch with our emotions, so its really important for me to reflect on them and understand what they mean. To feel better I often go for walks, journal, exercise, but I've realized that a lot of our problems run so deep they require greater knowledge and thinking about them in order to find a longer term solution, but also maybe there aren't, and that's okay too. For resources: colleges generally have their share of therapy, and drop-in counselling talks, student talks around mental health and wellbeing. I strongly recommend you take up these opportunities, you never know when they might come in handy, for yourself or maybe for your friends and family.

I am in my final year of the pharmacy program at UBC in Vancouver to become a pharmacist. I have wanted to be a pharmacist for a long time because I really like science, and I enjoy being part of the community. My favourite aspect of my schoolwork and future career is connecting with patients and discussing their goals of health, questions, and teaching ways to optimize their medications and health! I also really enjoy being able to inform people of ways to streamline their experience with healthcare, such as getting expensive medications covered, or stop taking medications that the do not need. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running or going for walks, spending time with friends and family, and curling in the winter. Of course, I also love to unwind with Netflix or reading. I'm excited to work with you this semester! The topics we will cover and discuss are important and interesting, and I hope to have engaging and thought-provoking discussions with you about them. When I was in high school, these things did not seem as important as I realise they are now, so I invite you to reflect on how aspects of what we talk about can help you as you finish high school and start thinking of what comes next after graduation. As I am sure your teacher explained, I will answer your messages within three days of you sending them. We are to finish the program by the 24th of January.

We are constantly finding artefacts from arrow and spearheads to old glass medicine bottles and tin cans so when we are digging we have to be careful we don’t cut ourselves Have you ever lived somewhere where you have had a deep connection to the land or known the history of the land? Have you ever had to or chosen to learn about the lane you learn or live on? Mentor 2022-12-07, 16:14: While I have not lived anywhere that I knew the history of the land in any real sense prir to my own family living there, I grew up on a farm where we buried our dogs when they got old and died. Having had many dogs growing up, my backyard had many buried there and it was a connection to the land that I no longer share having since moved away and, more recently, my parents sold the house and moved elsewhere too. Which of the Seven Teachings resonated most with you? Is this something you embrace in your daily life, how so? If not, how could you incorporate it in your daily life? Mentee 2022-12-15, 09:14: Where I live respect is everything, because I grew up in floods (the farming area of the town I live in) . I have built up a reputation of being hardworking. If any one has a job I'm one of the first people that they call. Floods is its own tight wound community, So over the five generations of my family that has lived and farmed here we have gained a lot of respect. So I would say that respect resonated with me the most and I embrace it every day. Mentor 2022-12-15, 12:36: Sounds like you have a really strong connection with the place you live. I've always felt a little disconnected from my town: it's always felt too big to connect like that in. I'm hoping to settle somewhere smaller after school. How do you think the Seven Teachings in the Ted Talk could help you through post secondary? Mentee 2022-12-16, 08:40: Using the Seven Teachings could keep me on course and remind me to reach out to someone if I need help. Mentor 2022-12-16, 10:47: Can you be a little more specific? Perhaps give me a hypothetical example of you applying the Seven Teachings to a problem you could encounter Mentee 2023-01-03, 13:50: I hope you had a good Christmas and new years. Sorry that I hadn't responded to your message. I was busy with family and work. I started my first 24 shift on my birthday so it's been a busy couple weeks. Hypothetically I have to go to court I would have to tell the truth Or when I was younger and I was at the dentist my mother would tell me that you are a bear you are full of courage. Mentor 2023-01-03, 16:02: I hope you too have had a great Christmas season and are enjoying the new year. I will likely be out of service for about a week as I am in mexico. Please poke through the rest of the conversation and questions and I will follow up more thoroughly when I return. Mentor 2023-01-11, 10:40: Thanks for your flexibility in scheduling. I am now back and ready to return to our program. What question(s) do you have for me about the seven teachings? Further, what final conversation do you want to do in our last two weeks together? Mentee 2023-01-12, 08:38: When have you used one or more of the seven teachings? And when have they helped you? I think that “from rural to urban” would most benefit me, as that is the next step in my schooling Mentor 2023-01-12, 17:20: Love, Humility, Respect, Courage, Truth, Wisdom, Honesty While I cannot think of any time that I have used any of the seven teachings as ""one of the seven teachings"" I try to live by many of the principles they stand for. I have recently been met with resistence in receiving financial aid through the student loan program for additional coursework I am doing and have been couragous in my persistence in getting the assistance I need. Further, as a law student, having respect for and humility before the institution of the court as well as being honest and truthful towards the court are important in ensuring an efficient and effective process for all involved. Finally, I have great love for those in my inner circle: my close friends, my girlfriend, and my family. Especially when they do things that make it hard to like them in the moment, I seek to find love for them inside myself. I have opened the conversation ""from rural to urban.""",,"Mentor 2022-11-25, 02:17: I just emailed my papers in to my professor now and saw that you had messaged back. Thanks for sharing those with me, I know it can be hard to be vulnerable and look inside yourself at times. I have certainly struggled with it in the past and even still do sometimes. I adore dogs! I miss my two maremmas back home terribly. I really enjoy partner dancing and have mostly been doing international ballroom (waltz, chahca, etc) and hustle (a street dance) while in Vancouver. I also enjoy board games and tabletop roleplaying games. I have plans to play through a dungeon this Christmas break actually. I also enjoy reading. I used to devour books as a kid but school sucked much of the joy out of reading for me. I have recently gotten back into it by taking turns with my girlfriend reading a story out loud. We have been reading ""a Practical Guide to Evil"" which is a swords and sorcery sort of fantasy book following an orphan girl in her attempt to gain power in the Dread Empire that conquored the kingdom she is born into a few years prior to her birth. it could use an editor for typos and clarity at times but its pretty good and its free online in blogpost format. Mentor 2022-11-25, 02:22: More on the discussion questions but also as general advice for adulthood, particularly at post-secondary which can sometimes feel like a dreary endless slog: it is really quite important to find a network you can rely on. it can be daunting and it is a little tough but you can do it. join some clubs that do activities you are interested in, talk to people in class, form study groups, and be proactive. I have found that having friends that will give you that push you need to get rolling when you are in a funk is tremendously valueable. I just finished writing a paper on a related topic so i thought I would volunteer some thoughts on the topic given the relevancy. For example, I had a buddy during my first degree who basically forced me to go to the gym with him for weeks and weeks until suddenly i wasnt being forced but was instead just going regularly myself. At the time I was only moderately interested because I wanted to get some vanity muscles but in hindsight i really needed the exercise. I lost about 40 pounds and got notably stronger. Having a friend who can recognize that you are having a problem and provide you with forceful, but kind, support through it is key to post-secondary Mentor 2022-11-25, 02:24: What three changes can you make to your life right now to take better care of yourself? Please also describe a concrete plan to make that change a part of your daily schedule. Mentor 2022-11-27, 15:08: I totally get where you are coming from with your grandmother. Both of my mum's parents have died in the past two years. It is a tremendous saddness when a loved family member dies. And for you to lose someone so central to your life is just an additional pile of emotional hardship. Sounds like a good start to your plans! What question or questions do yo have for me about well-being and selfcare? Mentee 2022-11-28, 13:45: What are some of the activities that help you get through a rough patch? What works best for you and what would you recommend? What have you found to help maintain your mental health at a good level? Mentor 2022-11-29, 09:51: Have you ever seen any youtube videos by CGP Grey? I find he has many interesting videos on random stuff. One in particular, that he put out near the start of lockdowns, was really relevant to this topic. I believe he called it ""spaceship you"". I would say that, much like he says in his video, my experience has been that a rough patch makes it really easy to fall off the wagon with healthy habits. I do, however, find that physical fixes are easier than mental. It is easier to go for a walk than it is to think my way into feeling better. When I am going through a rough patch I find that hard physical labor can be grounding. Without access to my parents' old farm, I get that at the gym now. Sometimes I struggle to get to the gym though and so my most base activity to get rolling again is actually a water fast. I find that it breeds feelings of control and makes me feel like I can add other healthy habits into my ay or week. I know its not for everyone so I would advise careful treading but I find success in it. I think of mental health kind of like a garden of plants and then physical health is the soil. Without healthy soil it is hard to have a healthy garden. I have let my physical health go over the past two years or so and I am currently in the process of tryng to improve my physical ability and lose weight. When I am in better shape I find that I hae more energy and can more easily frame things in a healthy way. Simply put, I would advise: 1. Healthy relationship with food: for me that is a scheduled regime of fasting and eating low carb when I am eating 2. Healthy relationship with sleep: for me that is getting more than 7 hours of sleep a night, preferably waking up before 7am 3. Healthy relationship with exercise: for me that is upwards of three days a week of resistance training and daily work with dance or sport for cardio 4. Healthy relationship with learning: school has not been particularly engaging for me for a long while so I engage my mind with things like science podcasts (The DarkHorse is really good but sometimes they get into the weeds past my understanding) and learning dance moves and techniques (I am a partnerdance guy: swing, ballroom, etc). 5. Healthy relationship with growth: understanding that growth comes from confrontation. Finding the discipline to not react defensively but rather constructively can be really tough but is better than the alternative. Do you have any other questions about well-being?",,,"Mentor 2022-09-19, 14:55: Sounds like you've got a great start to planning it out already! This first Conversation will be easy for you. Did you find that any of your plans have changed after doing the research required in the activity? Was there anything you found that was unexpected? Mentee 2022-09-21, 09:10: My plans stayed the same. The only thing I found was how expensive it is to live close to where I want to go to school so it might be better to take a year off to work and finish converting my bus before I go to college Mentor 2022-09-21, 09:23: You researched for both mechanics and diving? Can you tell me a little more about the programs for each? The trailer that TRU sends out would let you do your first year of the program in Hope? What benefits do you think you would get out of these programs? When you said that it was suprisingly expensive to live close to where you want to go to school, what did you mean by that? I mean to ask, is it expensive to live anywhere in kamloops or just to live near TRU? Further, I would advise you to look into whether or not there are options for taking a partial courseload while you are studying. I understand that certificate programs and bachelor programs are different but I have taken a partial courseload throughout most of my university so that I had extra time to work while studying. In my first year of university and then again during my first year of law school I did the ""regular"" full course load and did not work during the semesters but then for the remaining years I took 60-80% of the ""regular"" full courseload. Are you looking forward to post-secondary? Mentee 2022-09-22, 09:08: i will try and respond later to day since i have been busy lately Mentor 2022-09-23, 13:03: That makes sense. Are you able to switch into math 12 if you're not already signed up for it? Yeah that's fair, roommates and living further away from the university can help bring the cost of living down but it'll be a big shift from Hope. When you apply for the program(s) you have to be accepted before you get to attend. Do you think you have a good chance of getting in at either institution? What factors do you think largely impact your application? Moving away for school is a real tough change. Moving away from your support network and the town you're familiar with is hard. I'd really recommend participating in some kind of social activities outside of class; with your classmates or other people. I personally had good luck with the board games club and the ballroom dance club but there are all sorts of programs available at different places. It is really important to socialize so you're not as isolated and then to balance that with the focus on your studies. Mentor 2022-09-30, 21:15: The trek program sounds great! It's good that you have a second option too. What are the admission requirements for the two programs you're looking at beyond math 12?",,,,,"Mentee 2022-09-16, 10:53: So what is it like to be a law student? Mentor 2022-09-18, 11:57: Welcome to the eMentoring program MJ! Law school is honestly not my favorite experience. It is a great deal of very dry readings and in a very combative environment. I am, however, almost done and then I am looking forward to moving out of the city and finding work somewhere a little bit more small town than Vancouver. How are you finding your grade ten year? Back to school in a more normal fashion? I understand that we are to go through the following Conversations: Different Ways of Knowing Well-Being and Self-Care Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning One Conversation of your choice Do you have a preference with which one we start? Mentee 2022-09-19, 12:10: I am actually in my grade 12 year for the second time. When covid first hit, my school forgot to register me for careers 10 online. So I have to do this class and some filer classes. It is definitely nice to be back in school and not online as I don't learn well online. I think we should sti art with post-secondary and Career Planning. Is there anything that you think I should know about you? Or anything that you want to know about me? Mentor 2022-09-19, 13:02: Fair enough! I also did my version of Careers 10 in my grade 12 year. They called it Planning 10. I agree; online learning did not sit well with me. I started law school online and it led to some pretty poor school habits that I've been trying to unlearn since then. Sounds good, I'll open it up here momentarily. I think my summary on MentorCity is a good start anyways. I believe you have access to it. Do you have any questions about me? Tell me more about the welding you want to do. My father has worked as a heavy duty mechanic and machine operator for something like 30 years. I really admire people that do real work with their hands, it's so important and fulfilling. Its so satisfying to complete a project and have some physical and real afterwards. Do you have particular schools or programs you want to look at for either welding or diving? Mentee 2022-09-19, 14:00: I am hoping to get into the welding program at Thompson rivers university because they send a welding trailer to my school every two years (So it will be here next year). That way I can stay in my home town for a little longer. If not, then I'm going to apply to Sakatchewan Polytechnich, I will have to take a G12 math but don't think that will be to hard. I haven't fully looked into my diving yet but I'm hoping to take the course online then go in and do my test. Then after all that I'm going to be a wildfire firefighter/field mechanic and in the off season I will be a under water welder Mentee 2022-09-23, 10:28: I looked into welding and mechanics. I didn't look into diving because I don't see myself doing the diving for a couple years. The trailer that TRU sends would let me do my first year in hope then after a finsh the hours for the second year I would go to TRU for it. To get into the class I need a math 12, I am hoping to take this year sometime. Kamloops is expensive. Rent, taxs and the cost of living is high and still going up, it isn't as bad as out in van but still expensive. I'm still doing some research on sas poly tech but the class is cheaper and the cost of living is a lot lower then out here I have started looking into taking the pre class for sas poly tech and I can do it online then do the hands on work at sas poly tech Am I looking forward to post-secondary, yes and no on one hand i can't wait to explore what is out there but on the other hand i don't do well with change so it will be big change that I don't know that I'm ready for Mentee 2022-09-26, 13:46: So i had answers to all your questions but it got deleted so I'm just letting you know so you don't think I'm just not relpying to you I am working on trying to get it all back to what it was Mentee 2022-09-27, 12:50: I am not able to switch into a maths 12 this year but we have an alternative school called trek that I might be able to get into next semester that I'm looking into. I can do the class at my own pace so if I finish the assignment early then they will give me the next one instead of waiting. The other option is an online class that I could do but I think I would rather try and get into trek I think I will be able to get into TRU and SPT relatively easily. The only thing that I can think of that would hinder me is my grades before they got my IEP figured out because they were barely meeting expectations. Mentee 2022-10-04, 09:05: I found no information about Sas Poly Tech. Mentee 2022-10-04, 09:10: So the best I can do is send you a link to the website because I get this when i try and send all the info that I found Message should not contain personally identifying information https://www.tru.ca/trades/trades-programs/welder.html Mentor 2022-10-04, 10:39: Check out the admissions section on the site here. If you scroll down there is a brief section on it. https://saskpolytech.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/Welding.aspx Is there anything else you want to go over or any questions you have before we move on to the next Conversation? Mentee 2022-10-04, 10:43: No whitch one do you want to do next? Mentee 2022-11-03, 11:12: With regards to the last message you sent, can you please reword it if possible because I have been trying to respond for a while and I still can’t understand what you said fully. Along with the internet being very spotty I do apologise for the really late response Mentor 2022-11-03, 12:44: Yeah I can totally rephrase! First, I was asking you to respond to the discussion question about the Dr. Sharon video. Next, I was asking if you think there is a connection between believing ""I am going to be discriminated against"" and believing ""I have been discriminated against""? At risk of answering for you I will provide an example of what I mean: imagine two of my coworkers that come across me during the day. Both times I am deep in thought and have a bit of a resting scowl so I fail to respond to them when they greet me. One of these coworkers thinks ""wow what a jerk, he is only ignoring me because I am a _____"" while the other one thinks ""wow what a jerk"". Do you think that this is plausible? What possible causes could there be? Mentee 2022-11-14, 08:50: Thank you for rephrasing I could not find A video about Dr. Sharon Are you referring to the video about Dr. Nadine Caron? I believe that if you were brought up in an environment that you were discriminated against then moved to a place where people don’t discriminate. I think that you could interpret a sentence that was not meant to discriminate as one that was. Using your example ""wow what a jerk, he is only ignoring me because I am a _____"" while the other one thinks ""wow what a jerk"". If you are used to people ignoring you because of your colour or the way you look, just like learning a new skill your brain has been wired that way because of how many times it has happened. If I could remember the name of the article I read about this I would send it. Mentee 2022-11-17, 10:47: I think that her experiences could have made her more caring and more aware of her patients beliefs. It could have also made her work harder to achieve her goals. Mentee 2022-11-21, 12:40: Nope I'm ready to move on Mentee 2022-11-24, 08:58: My warning signs: Tired, hungry, lack of motivation, feeling down, feeling like no matter what I do it is never good enough, people talking makes me annoyed. Some of the things that I enjoy doing: Taking photos, playing with my dog, working on my mechanical projects, hanging out with my friend What are some things that you enjoy doing in your free time? Mentee 2022-11-25, 13:43: About a year ago my grandmother passed away and it messed my life up because I was over at her house every day after school so I was broken, so my uncle started picking me up from school and he added a much needed schedule in my life that helped me get over her passing. So I understand your gym story. Three things that I think I could change in my life is put aside more time to spend with the special someone in my life, because she always boosts my mood. I want to start going to the gym more often, as I only have time on the weekends and in the last couple weeks I haven't had the time to go on the weekends. Find some time to just have alone time to work on any of the projects I do for fun, like my model trains or many other hobbies. I can work in a hour at the gym after school most days, then I can arrange for my special someone to come over every other day and the days that she is not over I can take my alone time Mentee 2022-12-01, 12:41: I can't think of anything that I would want to ask","Mentor 2023-01-12, 17:21: Once you are done your KWL chart please share with me three things you like about living in a rural environment and two things you do not like and why. Mentee 2023-01-17, 10:47: Three things that i like about living in a rural area 1 it's quiet, there is no city noise. Very little vehicle noise, its peaceful 2 its a tight little community everyone knows and helps everyone 3 you have the freedom to explore and have fun Two things I don't like about living in a rural area 1 Parts are more expensive because you have to get them shipped in 2 I can't think of anything else What were your experiences when you started school in a new city? What do you like and dislike about living in a city If you could, where would be your dream location to live? Mentor 2023-01-17, 13:17: I do miss the lack of city noise. I live in a suburban area now and find it too loud. When I go downtown it is even worse. The city has tight groups and communities in it too, its a question of finding them because they are not as obvious as in a small town where it is essentially everyone. Exploration and fun looks different in a city. A buddy of mine is from a small town in the Okanagan and when he moved to Vancouver he explored the city including bribing his way into restricted sections of buildings to go on rooftops and the like. I would not recommend that, there are plenty of rooftops available without bribing the secuirty guards, but he found his own path to exploration and fun. Access to items is for sure easier in the city, acess to space becomes a larger issue. When I started school in a new city, I moved into a small apratment by myself which made home quite lonely. I worked for a couple months before school started so I made friends with some of my colleagues but the relationships were short lived as I ceased working once school started. Also, no longer having access to a car was a pain and the superior bussing system here does not really make up for it. I like the access to events and foodstuffs: I can get a broader range of goods for cooking south-asian and indian foods and there are many more dancing events here. However, it also is much more siloed here with people only doing the one or two things they like to do rather than doing a bunch of things. finding new people can be quite difficult and the lack of quiet natural spaces is hard. I do not know what town or city this would end up being but I would love to have about 3 acres of land where I could have a large garden, some fruit trees, some chickens, bees, and maybe a couple sheep. I would want somewhere with reasonably good access to social ammenities. I am considering Ontario right now and my girlfriend is pushing for Quebec but my french is very poor. Mentor 2023-01-17, 13:18: Once you have completed your chosen activity in the second section, share your findings. Mentee 2023-01-23, 08:48: At home] hope volunteer fire department Kamloops] kamloops fire department and they offer Paid On-Call or volunteer At home] hiking trail in my backyard Kamloops] Peterson Creek Park - about 3.5 km from TRU campus Are you familiar with the area around TRU, Do you have any recommendations for stuff to do in Kamloops This is my last day in school so I might not be able to respond. So thank you for the help with getting ready for the chapter in my life Mentor 2023-01-23, 14:11: Sounds like youve got a good handle on some great options for you to pursue in Kamloops! I am not particularly familiar with Kamloops, having only even passed through it enroute to other places. I hope that you have found the program and our conversations helpful in preparing for post-secondary. I think it will be an exciting journey for you. There will be bumps along the way but I think you will enjoy it! Best of luck!",,,,"Mentor 2022-10-04, 10:47: I have opened the Confronting Discrimination Conversation. I am just about to start class but will take a look at the materials shortly if you'd like to start reading through and taking a look at the discussion questions. Mentor 2022-10-13, 13:44: Just checking back in regarding your new Conversation. Having gone through the materials, can you share a little bit about what you read and learned? Can you explain to me what the various terms mean, in your own words, then ask me a question you have about the topic of confronting discrimination. Mentee 2022-10-18, 09:46: Sorry I have been really busy with work and school so I haven’t had a chance to go through all of the info but this is what I have. Implicit Bias Bias that is in the subconscious, most of the time the person is not aware of it Individual Racism For example Telling a racist joke, avoiding people of colour that you don’t know Institutional Racism When policies that make it harder for people of color to get loans, Jobs, houses or higher pay. The term can also be used when citys decide to put waste disposal and other environmental hazards around people of color Mentor 2022-10-19, 09:01: No worries MJ, you're free to get through it more or less at your own pace. Those sound pretty solid to me. I would say not to forget that discrimination and racism can be directed at any group. Men and women each face their own kind of discrimination, as do different ethnic groups, religious groups, and really any sort of discernable in-group/out-group. The kind of discrimination that is being outlined in this Converstion is a perversion of the kind of in-group/out-group tribalism that is seen in sports fans. Bonding over a shared sports team or showing distaste when someone is a fan of an opposing team is a fairly harmless version of the often very harmful discrimination talked about here. Once you have some more time to dive back into this, what question do you have for me about confronting discrimination? Mentee 2022-10-20, 14:17: Have you ever had to deal with discrimination or had the opprutunity to stop discrimination towards someone? And if so, how did you deal with it? I personally have had a couple run ins with some form of discrimination because of my learning disablity. What efforts have you seen at your school and job (if you are currently employed) to minimize discrimination? Micoaggression Everyday racsim. ex verbal insults, locking your doors when a person of color walks past you car. intentional or unintentionalintentional Privilege Social power that is given to you just because of the color of you skin or you gender. For exsample white privilege, male privilege, etc. Mentor 2022-10-24, 10:33: Apologies for the delay getting back to you MJ. I have dealt with some discrimination in my life, both directed towards myself and towards others. I used to run a organization alongside 5 other people. One of our volunteers had been behaving inappropriately and had been behaving in a sexist manner towards some of his female coworkers. As most of the other executives running the organization were women, they were worried that he would not take discipline from them well so I sat in on the disciplinary meeting essentially to ensure that he was respectful and to assist in enforcement. I have found largely that discriminatory behaviour can be really tough to stop as most people are, in my experience, aware of when theyre behaving in a discriminatory fashion. So simply educating them that their behaviour is discriminatory is not enough. My university engages in a great deal of performative anti-discrimination measures. They have everyone in my program go through cultural competence training and Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity training but both programs failed to provide useful tools for actually combatting discriminatory behaviour and were instead mostly just finger wagging and saying ""its bad to discriminatre."" I am sorry to hear that you have been the recipient of discriminatory behaviour. It is really a shame that people in our society cannot be more tolerant of irrelevant differences. Mentor 2022-10-24, 10:35: In addition to the questions in the discussion panel about the video for Dr. Sharon, I wonder what your thoughts on the relationship between expectations of discrimination and perceived discrimination are. Does the expectation of discrimination make someone more or less likely to feel discriminated against and does the expectation of discrimination make someone more or less likely to actually be discriminated against? Is there a real difference between being discriminated against and feeling discrimiated against? Mentor 2022-11-14, 12:24: Yes sorry Nadine Caron. I don't know how I mixed that up, my bad. No worries about the article, that totally makes sense. It's important to treat people with the respect and civility that they individually are due. Rather than making assumptions about people about how ""people like that"" have treated you or behaved in the past. It can be a tough habit to break as it's an evolved habit manifesting in an unhelpful and dangerous way. What thoughts do you have about Dr. Caron's video? Mentee 2022-11-15, 13:56: As someone with indigenous with heritage it is nice to see someone standing up for our beliefs and future generations. It is good to hear that she is able to help people that don’t trust the system because of past experiences. Mentor 2022-11-16, 08:57: Yeah. How do you think her experiences have shaped her as a doctor? Mentor 2022-11-17, 15:55: Fair assessment. Do you have anything else you want to cover before moving on to the next Conversation?

I will take some time to respond to your questions! How have the classes in your program used “scientific” versus “traditional” knowledge? How does this compare to high school classes? The classes in my program that are primarily arts focused such as psychology and sociology have used traditional knowledge: knowledge of people, why they behave the way they do, and why our society functions the way it is. This knowledge is presented primarily via books and text as well as orally from a professor in the field. In science classes, scientific knowledge is presented via lab reports and academic journals. This information is all derived using the scientific method. In highschool, I would say I'm more used to having traditional knowledge in science and less scientific research. As an adult and post-secondary student, what kind of Indigenous innovations or businesses have you encountered? I have encountered various Indigenous innovations on campus at UBC in the form of art and architecture!

To answer your question, I manage my stress in university life by making time for things I enjoy doing even when I have many other responsibilities.

I can answer some of your questions: 1. WHY IS HAVING POST SECONDARY EDUCATION WORTH FOR MONEY? A post-secondary education can be worth the money because it opens up opportunities for you to have more options and higher-paying positions when you enter the work force. In comparison, no post-secondary education would limit the number of jobs you are eligible for. Post-secondary education can allow you to have specific qualifications (like a doctorate, master's, or juris doctor) which allow you to have specific jobs like a physician, lawyer, professor...which may be higher paying than blue-collar and minimum wage jobs. 2. what was your most challenging part of budgeting issue? For me, it was challenging budgeting for essential things. Simple things like food, toilet paper, water, can all add up, but they are still important for your health and well-being. There are lots of resources to help students with budgeting such as co-op, work opportunities on campus, and scholarships and bursaries. It is really important to do your research and look into each of these as sources of revenue for your spending and expenses!","Mentee 2022-09-16, 15:27: Hey!!

I unfortunately don't know who Eric is :( It is sad but mentors don't actually get to see or know each other. Sorry for the late reply Eli, I was swamped with family related things and work. My experience in nursing school was memorable! I made some really good friends, some of whom I work with currently. Nursing school will challenge you to think more critically, but if you set deadlines and follow a study schedule, you should be okay (if I can do it, so can you). As far as the job is concerned, the nursing profession is very diverse and your job duties and roles will differ based on which unit or nursing specialty area you work in. For instance, I work in a medicine unit/ward, so our day-to-day duties consist of conducting patient assessments, administering IV medications, providing patient education, etc. Most nursing shifts are 12 hours (you get three breaks during each shift), but you can certainly find 8 to 10-hour shift nursing jobs if you are not a big fan of working long hours. The environment may seem stressful to some people, especially if they aren't used to visiting a healthcare environment or setting, but the anxiety and stress subside pretty quickly so it is not that bad and definitely doable (especially when you have supportive peers, which I was so grateful for). Mentee 2022-09-27, 09:56: Hello Syed, thanks for unlocking this module for me, I will get to work on it. Too bad you don't know Eric. Also I am totally fine with the later reply, I understand and don't mind if any of the replies are late. Thanks for sharing your experiences in the Nursing career and what the stress levels are like and your tips and tricks for doing well in school. From Eli =) Mentee 2022-09-27, 10:26: Hello Syed. This is for the disscussion questions in part one. 1. The connection to a rural environment differs from the connection of an urban environment because when you live in an urban environment then you have a more calm lifestyle and you can learn more about your land because you have less people to talk to and you have the older and wiser people who know a lot about the history of the land to talk to. 2. What is your connectin to the land that you live on. Mentor 2022-09-30, 03:02: Hi Eli, thank you for sharing that with me, and you're absolutely right about learning more about the history of your land from the older and wiser people in town. I also agree with the rural environment being calmer than an urban environment. Perhaps I would love to live there when I'm retired. To answer your question, I currently live in an urbanized city, and my connection with my land is very special. This is because I can access various amenities and community resources, such as swimming pools, basketball courts, parks, etc. I spent most of my childhood in a rural area of a developing country, where I did not have access to any of these things. Hence, I am super appreciative of all the resources around me and try to connect with my land by spending more time outdoors and exploring new places near me. Mentee 2022-10-04, 09:34: Hello Syed. sorry I am responding a little late. We didn't have the e-mentoring work day until today (Tuesday October 4th). I am going to answer the second part of the disscusion now. 1. I think Jeff is trying to bring awareness to fact that the things that we may have thought we invented were actually invented by Indigenous Peoples. He is trying to challenge the way we think and how we hear something and believe it right away without doing any research on it, He wants us to change this. Yes he is successful in this because he has made a very good piont and it has helped me to try this in my life now. I will research things before I fully believe them. I think I that humility could be one of the most hardest teaching to live by because humans love to talk about themselves and about how they did good but never how they messed up. I could be more humble in my life by being more humble and not one upping others achievements, I have been trying to do this for the past 4 years. I was suprised at how to medicines they made acually worked but after he explained that they share a main thing in them both the plant and asprin or pain relief I thoughy ""yeah it makes sense."" 2. Now I want to know which of the 7 teachings have you struggled with and how have you found ways to better yourself in that area. Mentor 2022-10-04, 14:47: Hi Eli, That's no problem; you can reply at your earliest convenience. I was fascinated by this TED Talk and by the fact that Indigenous people developed disposable diapers long before the western world (I never knew that! and they were so clever). Regarding your question, I would say courage is one of the seven teachings I have struggled with the most, especially in nursing school. I was an introvert in my first few college years and struggled to ask my instructor/teachers for assistance. I was afraid even to ask them questions in class because I thought I would look foolish (Very silly, I Know). To overcome this fear of being judged and be more courageous, I started talking to my peers, incorporated deep breathing exercises and watched many self-improvement videos on youtube to boost my confidence and speak up in class. Ultimately, I realized there is no point or merit in being worried about what others think, and I need to take actions that benefit and enhance my life regardless of what other people might think. Ever since this realization, I have become more courageous in talking to my nursing instructors/teachers and approaching them for help or clarification. This is what has helped me so far! I wanted to ask how you are doing and if you like the pace at which the program is running currently. Please Let me know if you would like to slow down or speed things up. Also, have you heard about this new game called ""overwatch 2""? All my friends are obsessed with it, and I am curious to know what the hype is all about since I haven't played it yet. Have you heard about it or played it ever? Mentee 2022-10-06, 14:07: Hello Syed. I am fine with the pace this is going at. You can unlock the next chapter of the program. I have heard of Overwatch 2 and know that it was released on October 4 Tuesday. I have never played the game or the first game but I know that it was a popular game. The games I play and hold knowledge in is Fortnite and Brawl Stars. I love to talk about video games, especially the two I mentioned above. Talk To you later. ps what games do you like to play.",,"Mentee 2022-10-13, 13:07: Hello Syed sorry for not responding, this is the first class we have had that is an e mentoring day because we have other work to do on other days. I did get your last message and thank goodness that Fortnite could refund the money. This next part is about the answers to the questions in the module. 1. My warning signs are I start to procastinate and I feel that I get low energy. 2. I like to spend time with friends, playing videogames, playing sports, spending time in nature and spending time with family and loved ones. 1. Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? I copied and pasted the questions because I would enjoy some answers to each to help prepare me and how to get out of the state of not being productive which could lead to stress and falling behind Mentee 2022-10-13, 13:24: Hello Syed, This is the second disscusion questions part. 1. I can limit my time that I relax after school to only an hour - I can set a timer so that I don't exceed the hour. I need more sleep - I can finish everything before my assigned bed time so I can get to bed earlier. I need more time for myself everyday where I get a break from screen and homework - I can set some time to go outside and kick a soccerball around or go for a walk. I don't have any more class time so I will send the rest of the answers later because I don't know how to save this draft. Mentor 2022-10-16, 23:59: Hi Eli, hope you are well and you asked some great questions. I will answer each one of them below and for your convenience I copied the questions as well. Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do they do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? To snap out of a funk, I personally speak with my mother or my younger brother because often times getting an outsider's prespective can give you a better viewpoint on how to work through a hard time and show yourself some self-compassion. Often times we’re harsh or inpatient with ourselves when we’re feeling sad or down, but if a friend or family member came to us going through something similar, we’d show them kindness and understanding. We’d assure our friend that everything is going to be OK and we’d remind them that they’re a good person and that this won’t last forever. Thus, I think speaking to someone helps majority of the time. Alternatively, a few other things that have helped me in the past during these times are praying (made me feel significantly better), deep breathing excercises, going out with my friends to eat, and taking a long nap. How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? Honestly speaking, the best advice that I can give you that will keep your mental health in check while in post-secondary would be to WORKOUT!! (Even if it's for 30 minutes/day) Yep, I know it may sound silly but I wish I had discovered this sooner or during my early years of post-secodary school. I started lifting weights again recently and I feel so much more energetic and cheerful now more than ever. it is the best stress reliever for me. Moreover, I have made some significant gains and my body looks and feels so much better. Additionally, I cannot stress this enough but try to get 8 hours of sleep every night, your body will thank you immensely. What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? As an adult you definitely more responsibilty and it is very easy to get distracted in your early college years due meeting new people, partying with friends, constantly studying or being anxious about an test/exam, etc. The key is to stay develop a routine of good habits and stay consitent and disciplined with that routine daily. For instance, drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, working out, praying/meditating, and taking time out for family/friends. The benefit of being a post-secondary student that you will eventually figure out how to handle things on your own and will feel good about being responsible and helping others. Talk to you soon, Take care! Mentor 2022-10-18, 05:44: Hi Eli, just read your comments on the second discussion questions part. You made some excellent points on sleeping earlier than your assigned bed time and taking out more time to play soccer. Also, take your time replying to those questions and send the rest of the answers whenever possible. Talk to you soon, take care! :) Mentee 2022-10-18, 08:57: Hello Syed, thanks for the flexibility. Here is the second part of that question module. How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have? Can they share any time management tips? How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult? What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and post- secondary student? Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) Sorry for making you answer so much but I would like to know what to expect and have some tips and tricks to help me get through them and what to prioritize in my school life Mentee 2022-10-18, 09:06: Sorry for the second message but I also find that praying helps me out and it helps calm me sometimes. You can also unlock the next section. Mentor 2022-10-24, 02:12: Hi Eli, sorry I haven't responded to your questions in a while. Just wanted to let you know that I have an urgent family issue that I'm dealing with currently. I will respond to those questions very soon and sorry for any delay that this may cause in your learning. I have also unlocked the next section for you.",,"Mentor 2022-11-30, 10:12: Hey Eli, let me know if you want me to unlock any other modules for you. I am saying this because the general discussion module that I unlocked for you does not have any activity and is basically there for us to have a conversation and for you to ask any questions you might have. I am fine with anything with working on any of them, and feel free to ask away whatever you like :) Mentee 2022-12-02, 12:43: Howdy Syed,(That is how Ryan Trahan greets people in his videos =-) I would like to do the dis/misinformation please. Do you watch ishowspeed and have you been watching the world cup lately. Auf Wiedersehen,(This means goodbye in German) Mentor 2022-12-03, 19:39: Howdy Eli, and there is not a day goes by where speed's videos don't make me laugh, he's absoultely hilarious. SEWWWWEEY!! I have overwatched so many of his videos, especially his recent World cup song. And yes, I have been keeping up with the world cup. Who do you think will win and who are you rooting for this world cup? Talk to you soon bruh. Khudahafiz (means goodbye in Farsi, which I speak at home :o) Mentee 2022-12-05, 09:04: ???? Syed,(this is hello in persian). I love the world cup song and video aswell SEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWEYY. Could you unlock the Dis/misinformation module please. The new fortnite season is out and it is fun to play. We should play it together if that is allowed, If not that is ok. I love IShowspeed and I am cheering for Brazil in the world cup. How difficult is nursing school in your oppinion and how long does it take from start to finish with the 4 years of school plus the undergraduate thing that you have to do before. What is the undergraduate thing anyway. Talk tp you later bruh.=0 ( sorry for sounding creepy earlier when I asked if you wanted to squad up in fortnie.=( Bye. Mentor 2022-12-08, 04:08: N?n h?o Eli (hello in chinese). Unfortunately, we are not allowed to share any personal information, including Playstation or any other gamer ID :( But that's okay we can still have fun through this program :) I have unlocked the Dis/misinformation module for you. I am rooting for Morocco and Portugal (crister ronaldo sewy) this world cup. A fun fact which you may or may not know, speed, Jake Paul, and Mr. Beast are all from Ohio lol (swag like Ohio playing in my head rn fr fr :o)! In regard to your question, nursing school isn't that difficult (7/10 difficulty scale), you just have to stay on top of everything from day 1 and impress your clinical instructors (if I can do it, so can you). However, since you are going to med school later down the line, try to get straight A's in your classes. It will make the med school admission process so much easier for you. Otherwise, If nursing is not really your main objective and you just want to go to med school, I would perhaps think about studying something easier and something that sparks your interest. For instance, language Arts, businnes, psychology, criminology, etc. These programs are easier to get good grades in compared to nursing, but then again nursing will provide you the most knowledge and prepare you well for med school. Talk to you soon :) SIUUUUUUUUUUU Mentee 2022-12-08, 14:32: G'day mate Syed,(A common way to say hello in Australia). thanks for unlocking the module. Fun Fact, I think I already shared this but I have the same birthday as Mr. Beast, Different year of course, It is May 7th. Thanks for answering my questions and I am going to do nursing school first and then medical school. On the ufv site it says to do nursing school you need to do an udergraduate course, do you know what that is?. I also noticed that you spelt cristo ronaldos name like IShowspeed SUUUUUUIIIIIIIIII. messi better though =) who do you like better Ronaldo or Messi, Or Neymar. I like the fact about OHIO and the song playing in your head. Talk to you later bro =o Suuuuuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii (said from the little face) Mentor 2022-12-10, 22:43: Annyeonghaseyo Eli (Hello in Korean), I'm happy you chose nursing first before medical school. And yes, I remember you sharing that Mr. Beast fact with me. Hopefully, you get a tesla from him on your birthday. I am a big Ronaldo fan, but I also like to watch Messi and Neymar play. Unfortunately, two of these three are out of the world cup, so only Messi has a chance to win. Regarding your question about UFV, an Undergraduate course means any course that leads to a Bachelor's degree; for instance, Nurs 101 is an undergraduate course that leads to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (an Undergraduate) degree. So when the UFV site says, ""to do nursing, you need to do an undergraduate course,"" It means you need to do or finish an undergraduate nursing course or courses in order to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree. I hope that makes more sense, If it did not then let me know so I can simplify it further for you. Trust me I had the same issue when I was your age, I didn't know what these terms meant. Hence, for your convenience, I simplified below what these terms mean. Undergraduate Degree = Bachelor's Degree (Typically 4 years in Uni or college). Undergraduate course = course that leads to a Bachelor's degree (like English 101, Biochemistry 101, Nursing 101, etc). Graduate = Master's Degree (Typically 2 years &amp; obtained after Bachelor's degree). Graduate course = course that leads to a Master's degree Talk to you soon :) Annyeong (bye in korean) Mentee 2022-12-16, 08:55: Frohe Weihnachten Syed, (Merry Christmas in German) How are you doing, What are you doing for the Holidays. My Great Aunt and Great Uncle have gifted my family and I with a trip to Hawaii. I am also going to watch the World Cup Final and Maybe the third place game. Hope you have a wonderful time this season remebering that Jesus was born. Wir sprechen später (talk to you later in German) Mentor 2022-12-17, 23:20: Hello Eli, and wow! Your uncle and aunt are adorable and lovely individuals for gifting your family a trip to Hawaii. I am extremely happy for you, and I hope you have an excellent and safe trip. I will try buying some snowboarding gear for myself these next few days so I can go snowboarding with my boys in January. Again, I wish you and your family a good time this holiday season. I hope you have a good and warm trip to Hawaii, and I'll talk to you soon. Take care! Mentee 2023-01-03, 14:07: ?????? Syed,(hello in Ukaranian) How have you been my brother.

I have had a pretty productive start to 2023 so far, and have a feeling that this will be a very good year for me. How has your 2023 been so far and are you trying anything different this year. Also, you can correct me if I'm wrong but I think we have met the required number of modules to be completed in the metorship program. One more thing, i think mentorcity is hosting ""meet your mentor live"" video call sessions I beilve on January 12 4-5 pm. Let me know If you are interested, we can register for this and discuss things and chat live for the first time. Talk to you soon. ???

How's life and how's your new semester going. And one really important point that I wanted to get your attention on and I think this point is very very crucial and will impact your life positively so I think it's important you know that Ronaldo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Messi. SIUUUUUUUU!!!!!","Mentee 2022-11-08, 13:25: Hello Syed, Just letting you know that we have a 4 day weekend only three days of schyool this week so Probalby won't respond for a few days. ttyl Mentor 2022-11-08, 20:04: No problem Eli, have a good long weekend :) Mentee 2022-11-15, 14:41: Hello Syed, here are my answers to the following questions 1. To become a Doctor need a doctor of medicine degree which is accquired by takeing a few courses like an undergraduate program and medical school plus working for two years. This is my dream job To become a Nurse you need a BSN or another degree but this is the most recognized and will give you higher succses in getting a job. This is my realistic job but I would like to go for Doctor after 2. Attending post secondary is beneficail because you can get a better paying job. You can become smarter in a certain area which interests you. This is all that I have and I WILL SEND MORE LATER BECAUSE THE BELL JUST RANG. Mentee 2022-11-16, 14:32: Hallo Syed. (That is German for Hello, I will say hello in a different language evrytime for fun0 =). Here is the next part of the questions 2. The last reason to attend post secondary school is because it helps you build new relationships thta can be very positive on your life and health. 3. The length of my schooling could be an obstacle. The cost could also be an obstacle. My desicion to take one year of bible in the quest program at CBC could be an obstacle. 4. I am looking forward to learning all the new stuff but I do want to get through it all because it is so long. 5. Yes, I do think that my job is achievable because I work hard and am somewhat smart in the health area. Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university? What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them? How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do they have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? Did length of schooling and experience needed factor in to their career decisions? If so, how? Are they happy with their decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not? Talk to you later. =)=0 Mentee 2022-11-17, 11:35: Bonjour Syed, I do like Marvel but I haven't seen the new black panther yet. I want to see it though. Remeber the floods last year. I am just remebering that today was a wednesday last year and I was stuck in Abbotsford because I was spending one night at my Brother's dorm at CBC because he did the quest program.I was then sent off tomy Oma's house because we didn't know when I could return home. I got there on Sunday and left on Friday And I did the school work that was assigned and I had a fun time spending time with family. Here are my answers to the second module Loction, distance to amenities, Gluten Free food options on campus and transportation are important to me when finding a campus to live on. Supports from staff and students and oppertunities to work are also important to me including hands on learning experiences. Places to study and extra curriculars are also desired to me when I pick a campus. Talk to you later bro. byeeeeeeeeeeeee. Mentor 2022-11-18, 15:14: Hola mi amigo Eli, I appreciate you sharing that with me, and glad to hear you were somewhere safe. I certainly member the floods from last year, but thankfully the I area I live in wasn't flooded as much as other regions of the lower mainland BC. I remember watching the news and seeing people stuck on the roofs/shelters of their homes in Chilliwack and Abbotsford for multiple days until they were rescued. On that note, I think the only natural disaster I have experienced was an Earthquake of 6.5 magnitudes in India when I was around ten. Thankfully, nobody was seriously injured, but it caused a lot of property damage where I lived. Back to the module: I reviewed the factors that you desired at your school campus. You made some excellent choices, which align well with what I looked for in a school campus. The only thing I would like to add to that list would be campus security or some sort of student safety engagement program to protect all students from violence, harassment, bullying, threats, and theft. Talk to you soon :) Mentee 2022-11-24, 09:33: Olá Syed, (this is hello in Portuguese). Thanks for waiting so patiently. This is a harder module to com-plete but here are my answers for the second question. UFV has Residency for studens which is what I want to do. It has an acedemic advising and sucsess center, safe student comunity, library, athletics and campus recreation, Dining services, health ad dental, shutle bus and parking, health ,welness and safety, printroom, TRU has acedemic supports, health and wellness supports, career and exponential learning. Their own experiences might tell a different story than what you can find online. Also consider asking (optional): What factors did they consider when choosing a school? How important did those factors end up being once they got there? Do they know anything about the schools, programs or locations you’re considering? 2. I need biology 12 or 11 at C+, Chemistry 11 at C+, Math 11 C+, English 12 C and 30 hours of voulunteer in a health care setting plus an undergraduate in biology. for UFV I need Minimum High School Grade 12 (or equivalent) or mature student status English Studies 12/English First Peoples 12 with a minimum 73% (or equivalent) Any Math 12 course with a minimum 73% (or equivalent) Anatomy &amp; Physiology 12 with a minimum 73% (or equivalent) Chemistry 11 with a minimum 73% (or equivalent) One other Grade 11 or 12 level Science with a minimum 73% (or equivalent) Minimum Post-secondary Grade 12 (or equivalent) Overall GPA of 3.0 or higher in the last 30 credits Completion of the following 12 credits: English 1000 level or higher with a C+ minimum Biology 1000 level or higher with a C+ minimum Social Science 1000 or higher with C+ minimum Math/Science 1000 or higher with a C+ minimum Additional Admission Requirements Situational Judgement Test (i.e., CASPer) Applicants will be required to complete an online situational judgement test, which assesses for non-cognitive skills and interpersonal characteristics that we believe are important for successful students and graduates of our program and will complement the other tools that we use for applicant screening (i.e., GPA). For TRU Do they have anything to add? Can they share advice on gaining admission into your desired program? What can you do to be a competitive applicant? I didn't create a document and I just wrote all the requirments above. Adeus (That is ggodbye in Portaguese) Mentor 2022-11-28, 00:32: Ciao Eli (hello in Italian) - I think you did a really extensive research on your program, so well done. The only advice that I would give to help you gain entry in to your desired program is to ensure you have driver's license as I believe UFV wants their students to be able to drive to nursing clinical placements and practice labs. Also, make sure you get certified in CPR amd Basic life resuscitation. Lastly, to help you stand out in the application pool ensure you more than 30 hours (the more the better) of volunteering as admission administrators love people that show ambition and dedication to their extracurricular activities. Also, we are almost done this mentorship program (exciting and ??) You have one more module left to do :) I will leave this upto you, what module would you like me to unlock next for you. Mentee 2022-11-29, 10:48: Kia ora Syed, (Hello in Kiwi, which is from New Zealand). I would like you to unlock General Discussion please or do you think that another one is more useful, if so please unlock that one. I am so sad that this almost over and I have enjoyed our chats together. Have a nice day. Adeus my friend (this is goodbye in Portuguese). Mentor 2022-11-30, 09:50: Kon'nichiwa Eli, (hello in Japanese). I have unlocked the general discussion phase for you. Enjoy the snow and take your time completing this one. Talk to you soon! :) Sayonara",,,"Mentee 2022-11-03, 11:07: Hi Eli, as per your teacher's request, Strategic Studying has been opened. Click on it on the navigation wheel to get to it :) Thanks, The eMentoring staff Mentee 2022-11-04, 11:12: Hello Syed, One of the ementoring staff unlocked the next module for me. here are my answers for the assignment. 1.The recall your information strategy was the most effective for me because I could get my parents to quiz me by asking me question based on the material I have been taught. This is best for me because I am an auditory learner and I remember best when I have to do this type of studying of calling out the informmatoin 2. What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? How do their study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to their study strategies from high school? What have they learned about studying since they were in high school? Mentee 2022-11-04, 11:16: Hello Syed, I got your message and ye my teacher emailed the staff to unlock the next section because I had nothing to do. Thanks for unlocking the next part for me as well. From Eli =0=) Mentor 2022-11-06, 22:38: ??????Hi Eli, I answered your questions below, hope you are well and weren't affected by the windstorms that occured a few days ago. We actually had a power outage in my area and did not have electricity for over 24 hours. I had to charge my phone and laptop at nearby library. This experience has made me so appreciative of electricity and many other things in life, sometimes we take such little things for granted so easily and don't even think through how lucky we are to be able to use so many resources and our electronical devices at home with ease. Have a great day and talk to you soon! :) :) What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? I would start studying as early as possible to prepare for exams and study with a classmate in a cafe or library. I could never learn at home, where I had many distractions. I also used something called a Pomodoro technique, where I would study without any distractions or talking to someone for at least 30 minutes and then take a 5-10 minute break. How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? University classes can be pretty different from high school. While it's commonly believed that university classes are slightly more challenging than high school (depending on what course you take), there are also great things about studying at a university. For example, you might have bigger assignments, but you also have much more academic freedom, where you can choose the majors and classes that interest you. The most surprising part of transitioning was making my schedule in post-secondary school and juggling schoolwork and assignments with work and my personal life. Freedom in post-secondary schools is Exhilarating but brings accountability; for example, you will probably find that many rules and borders have disappeared (You won't get detention for skipping class). How do their study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to their study strategies from high school? What have they learned about studying since they were in high school? There was a significant change in my study habits once I got into post-secondary school. I learned that I am a visual learner and learn best by watching video tutorials on topics I need to know. I have also learned that It is never a good idea to cram everything in one night and hope for the best; I used to do this a lot in high school (I also did this in college sometimes but wouldn't recommend it). Cramming everything last minute is the most insufficient and stressful way of studying. On the other hand, studying and learning content early will help you feel more prepared for the exam and reduce exam-day anxiety. How early, you may ask? That depends on how big the exam is but generally speaking, learning something 1-2 weeks before the test date will produce the best results.",,"Mentee 2022-09-16, 11:14: Hello Syed, I'm Eli. I forgot to mention that I like to go Skiing and Hunting with my family and friends. I also enjoy watching Star Wars and Youtube, My favourite creator right now is Ryan Trahan. Just wondering if you also enjoy any of the things I just listed. I am planning on going to UFV for my nursing course after I do the one Year program at CBC right after I graduate. I also have Celiac disease which means I am Gulten Free. From Ei =) Mentor 2022-09-16, 17:33: Hello Eli, Happy Friday! I am excited to be a part of this program and to meet you. Thank you for sharing those things with me. A bit about myself: I am currently a full-fledged Registered Nurse and Graduated this summer from Douglas college. Like yourself, I also enjoy watching Ryan Trahan's videos on Youtube. Another favorite YouTuber of mine is MrBeast; I find his videos admiringly entertaining. I also enjoy snowboarding with my friends during the wintertime. Unlike you, I have never actually tried hunting, but it seems like an exciting activity that I would like to try one day. I would love to learn more about it from you, and what and where do you guys hunt? Regarding your future goal, I think you have the right mindset and will be very successful. I am also happy to hear that you want to attend UFV for nursing in the future. It's a reputable university, and nursing is a gratifying profession. Just curious to know what got you into nursing and why you chose nursing as a career path. Also, I appreciate you sharing that you have celiac disease. I don't personally know anyone with this condition. What has your living experience been like living with this condition? Mentee 2022-09-18, 16:50: Hello Syed, Just wanted to answer your questions. I got the idea of becoming a nurse from my cousin. He did the same thing I hope to do. He was a nurse and is now in school to become a Doctor. I find medicine and science interesting and I enjoy helping people. Fun Fact: I have the same Birthday as Mr. Beast, May 7th.=). Talk with you soon. Bye. Mentor 2022-09-21, 03:44: Hi Eli, Thanks for sharing that with me. You have a bright future ahead of you, and I'm sure you will be a great nurse and an exceptional doctor one day. The path to achieving these academic goals might seem tough at times in future, but i'm confident that you will pull through and acomplish your goals with ease. You seem like a very motivated and driven individual. I wish I was as motivated as you when I was your age LOL! Do you have any other questions for me in mind regarding school, or anything in general? Feel free to ask away. Also, do you feel ready to work collaboratively on the first conversation, i'll unlock it once you feel ready. Take care! Mentee 2022-09-21, 09:04: Hello, Syed. I am ready for the first conversation. Also what was your expirience in nursing school and what is the nursing job like,( how long shifts are, how many days a week you work, what the environment is like e.g is it super stressful or is it not so bad. Also my friend wants to know if you know her mentor who is Eric, he is the one who like bagels. Talk to you soon.=) Mentor 2022-10-08, 01:48: Hi Eli, I have unlocked the next chapter of the program for you. Some of my recent favourtite games are FIFA, Call of duty Warzone, and Fall guys. I used to play a lot of fortnite when it first got launched, but I haven't had a chance to play it in a while. My younger brother plays fortnite daily though! Fun fact, my brother once accidently bought V-bucks over 100 dollars worth using my credit card :'( He thought he had only purchased 10 dollars worth lol. Thankfully, I was able to get that money refunded with a return request in Fortnite. Do you play/watch any sports? Take care for now and talk to you soon! Mentor 2022-10-12, 04:06: Hi Eli. I hope you enjoyed your long weekend and had a great time with family and friends. I was wondering if you recieved my last message by any chance. The only reason why I am asking is because I think I may have replied to the wrong chat box. I'm sorry for causing such confusion and let me know at your earliest convenience if you got notified of my last message. Take care for now! Mentor 2022-11-16, 17:34: Guten Tag Eli (also a german greeting that means ""Good Afternoon"" in English, though not necessarily used in the afternoon). I am curious to know if you are a marvel fan. I recently watched the new Black Panther Movie ""Wakanda Forever,"" which was enjoyable. Here are the answers to your questions: Ask them to share their path to their current post-secondary program. Have they changed programs, schools or even careers along the way? Did they work for a while, or take a gap year before going back to school? Did they transfer from a college to a university? I have changed my program several times in post-secondary school. For example, I initially thought of being a pharmacist in my early college years. However, this idea quickly changed after I found my passion in the nursing career and the variety of employment opportunities in nursing. I did not take a gap year but did take gaps in between semesters to make some money and figure out what I truly wanted to study. Lastly, I did not have to transfer to a university as my college already offered a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. However, if I could go back in time, I would choose a university over college for personal preference reasons and because I could meet more people, as university programs tend to have more students than college programs. I also want to say that if you plan to go to med school later down the line, I would advise you to complete an undergraduate degree at a University rather than a college. This is because, sadly, some Ontario Medical schools do not recognize undergraduate programs completed in a college for unknown reasons and only give preference to university students :( However, this is not the case in our beautiful province of British Columbia! :) What were some of the challenges that they had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education? For example: poor grades, financial difficulty, moving far away from home. Did they face any of the same challenges as you? If so, how did they overcome them? I had to overcome many challenges, the ultimate one of which was my laziness. I was a lazy student in my first few years of college and used to procrastinate on my assignments and school work. I did many things to overcome this issue. For example, I spoke to my seniors in my class, took a break from social media, started going to the library to focus on studying, and ultimately prayed to have more discipline in my life. How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do they have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? You don't necessarily have to be good at a subject that your career path requires. The best thing about medical schools in Canada is that you can be good at any subject of your interest; it doesn't require you to be good at biology or chemistry. I was awful at a few subjects too, but my college offered a free tutor service from Monday to Friday, which I occasionally took advantage of and benefited greatly. I would advise you to seek resources like these in your post-secondary school, and if you can't find them, simply youtube the content or subject you need to study. Youtube can sometimes provide better alternatives and ways of teaching content. Did length of schooling and experience needed factor in to their career decisions? If so, how? Yes, it certainly did. I chose nursing over medical school first because medical school takes approximately 6-7 years to complete (including the residency), and admission into the medical program was not guaranteed. Hence, considering my life goals and objectives, I decided to pursue nursing first and then medical school later down the line. Are they happy with their decision to pursue a post-secondary education? Why or why not Yes, undoubtedly happy. I wouldn't be where I am today without pursuing post-secondary education. While in post-secondary school, I made incredible memories and found good friends from whom I learned a lot about life. Mentee 2023-01-10, 12:27: Roooooaaaarrrr Syed,(That is hello in Dinosaur). I would like to do the video chat with you on Thursday after school. I will send a message if I suddenly cannot do the call but I think it can work. Send me the time to get on and I will be there.

It's been a while since we last spoke. I hope you are doing well and are working hard this semester. I just wanted to check in with you and see how you are doing. Sorry, If I haven't had time to message you lately. I recently lost a family friend and was occupied with other family related things. Hope all is well with you, and reply when you can my friend. Take care! Sincerely, your mentor Syed :)",,"Mentee 2022-12-13, 13:21: Shalom Syed, (Hello in Hebrew) I am a careful consumer when it comes to media content.I have steered well away from fake news and have realized when it is fake and when it is real. Some videos are pretty convincing on youtube and I kind of beleive them. These critical thinking skills are very important for students because they are young and vulnerable to the fake news and so skill to avoid it will help us in life on navigating fake and real news. Here are my questions for you. Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information? What are some habits they’ve built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation? Also Argentina jusy beat Croatia =). Go Messi and I also hope Morroco beats France. Mentor 2022-12-17, 23:08: Privet Eli, (Hello in Russian). Tomorrow is the Final, and although Morocco didn't qualify for the Worldcup, they played with their hearts out and made history. Regarding your questions: Where do they get their news and find reliable sources of information? As you mentioned, I also don't rely heavily on social media content when finding reliable sources of information. I have multiple streams of information sources that I trust and read when I have time. Such streams include news from various news channels, news blogs on the internet, and Reddit. What are some habits they've built that have helped them from getting drawn in by dis- or misinformation? Honestly, it is challenging to pinpoint what information is correct and wrong on the internet. Hence, one habit I use to verify whether the information I'm reading is accurate or fake is to discover who the original information poster is. If the original poster is anonymous (kinda sus) or unreliable, it raises questions and makes you want to criticize or dig deep into the information. Therefore, always go back to the origin of the source, and you will find out whether the information is correct or incorrect. Talk to you soon Eli, do svidaniya (Bye)",,,"Mentee 2022-10-25, 11:35: Hello Syed. That is fine, I hope everything works out for the best and you can repond at anytime. 1. Implicit Bias is when you hold negative associations of a certain group or people and you usually express them with out even knowing it. Individual Racism is the acts and beliefs that one holds. It also adds to the racism and you may not even know it Institutional Rasism is when policies are made to give white people tha advantage in situations. Microagressions are the comments and actions that are negative and derogatory towards another group. Privilege is the social power you gain based on your skin or race. They are advantages you get for being in a certain crowd or place. These are the definitions of the first module. Here is my question for you now. What are some good ways that they have found to overcome the biases and stereotypes they might hold? talk to you later Mentor 2022-10-26, 15:35: Hi Eli, I was going through some family issues that required my immediate attention, and I also got sick (not with covid), which prevented me from replying to you on time. Thankfully, my life is back on track, and here are the answers to your questions from the last conversation. Thanks for being patient. How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have? Self-care is vital for mental and physical well-being, and one must dedicate enough time to focus on things one likes. So my advice would be to prioritize the things you enjoy doing daily, even if you do them for a little bit, and surround yourself with people who uplift you or enjoy spending time with you. Also, aside from sleeping well and working out, deleting social media apps such as Snapchat and Instagram has dramatically benefited me in prioritizing stuff I enjoy doing. Can they share any time management tips? Here are a few things to manage your time better: Follow a routine, plan your day, or write what you need to do the night before to be more prepared for the next day. Make a to-do list on a piece of paper (I still do this) and write down everything you need to complete that week. I also found making a very detailed calendar, or even a physical planner, is super helpful in keeping me on track. I put everything from my classes, study time, gym sessions, and everything in between in my calendar. It helps me make my to-do lists for the day and keeps me on top of my assignments and courses (you can purchase a calender from the dollar store or Walmart). Do the most important task early in the morning after you have freshened up. Finally, the most essential time management tip is to stay consistent and block distractions. You must say ""no"" to anything that distracts you from your assigned task (such as friends or social media) until you complete your task. How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they're an adult? Personally, I would say it has gotten a lot more challenging to take time out or think about self-care as an adult. As an adult, you are occupied with several obligations, such as school-related assignments, family &amp; friends, work, etc. Hence having a routine or setting up time daily for self-care is vital. What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what's easier about self-care when you're an adult and post-secondary student? One of the first challenges you may face is missing home (that is, if you plan to move out); even though you're meeting lots of new people and trying new things, it's easy to miss your friends and family. Another common hurdle is learning to adapt to the differences between university and high school. For example, you may have difficult classes and more homework, and you're now responsible for managing your own time. I've found it helpful to make friends with people in the class, form study groups, and learn how to take effective notes. You can also easily fall into the routine of partying daily in Post-secondary school, so I would advise you to be careful, use your time productively, know your limit and party safely. As an adult, you get to meet new people who are also going through the same struggles as you. So you will always have someone to talk to and seek advice from, especially the senior students. Personally, I think this is one thing that I found easy about self-care as an adult. Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it's cheap and easy, staying up too late because you're watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) I would say surround yourself with people who live the way you want to, set reminders, and follow the routine you have made for yourself. If you slip up occasionally and fall victim to poor self-care, do not give up on yourself. Recognize what triggers your poor self-care habit, make small changes daily, and follow a consistent plan. Mentor 2022-10-26, 19:41: Hi Eli, hope you are doing well. Here is the answer to your most recent question. Talk to you soon :) What are some good ways that they have found to overcome the biases and stereotypes they might hold? I think the best way to overcome unconscious biases and stereotypes is to widen your social circle. What I mean by that is don't sit with the same colleagues every day, but move around and spend time with people from different cultural and academic backgrounds from you. You should also speak out if you notice bias; for example, if your male friend talks over a female friend and doesn't let her finish her point, you should respectfully point out that you wanted to hear what she had to say. Lastly, I think to a certain extent, we all hold some sort of stereotype about others, hence apologize if you make a mistake or have a stereotype about someone and work on rectifying this mistake. Remember that we can only deal with bias if we're honest and admit our mistakes. Mentee 2022-10-27, 13:17: Hello Syed. I am greatful that you are feeling better. Here are the questions for the second module. 1. I think it took the surgeon so long to apologize because we humans find it hard to admit ours mistakes, especially if it is a racist mistake. We have a hard time admitting mistakes because we don't like to be wrong. We like being successful and getting something wrong is the opposite. We find it hard to apologize when we hurt someone or are racist towards someonr because it can be awkward to open up and admit we are sorry. We don't like being to vulnrable to other's, especially if it is akward. Could you send me your response to the question. Here it is Why do you think it took the surgeon so long to apologize? What makes it difficult to admit our mistakes? Is it especially hard to admit when we do things that are hurtful and discriminatory? Mentor 2022-10-28, 02:14: Hi Eli, I 100% agree with your answer. Regarding your question, I think sometimes humans have a natural instinct to defend themselves against being wrong, making it challenging to admit our mistakes. In addition, admitting our mistakes might make our identity or self-image feel threatened, especially when it comes to recognizing a hurtful or discriminatory mistake. I believe the reason why the surgeon took a long time to admit his mistake was because he didn't know how to react in that situation as the environment became very awkward. The surgeon did not recognize that he had crossed the line or said something hurtful. Finally, after processing what had happened, realizing someone was emotionally hurt, and observing and spending time with many indigenous patients, the surgeon admitted his mistake and apologized. Mentee 2022-11-01, 13:51: Hello Syed, Just finished the section. I am ready for you to unlock the next part. Thanks =0=) Mentor 2022-11-03, 17:06: Hi Eli, I have unlocked the next conversation module for you. However, I see that Mentorcity managment staff has also unlocked a different Conversation module (strategic studying) for you as per your teacher's request. I was wondering if you happen to know if this was part of the curriculum as I wasn't aware about this, and according to the email I received the next conversation should be ""Post-secondary and Career Planning"". Replay at your earliest convenience and I hope you and your family members are doing well :) Talk to you soon!"
1047514517,10/16/2020 18:54,1047582369,54543,,,,,,"Mentor 2022-09-28, 21:23: Hi Mandy, I just opened up the Post-secondary and Careers discussion. Check out the first anchor text, and let me know what your a) dream job is and b) another option! Eric Mentee 2022-09-29, 12:59: What Education Do You Need? 1. Physicists: Master's or doctoral's degree in the right field. Animator: Diploma and two years of design training. 2. Attending post-secondary will benefit me by offering me more job oppurtunities, different skills, and learning new skills. 3. Physics: cost, time in school, grades. Animation: School far away, grades, skill/talent. 4. I am looking farward to future education, because thses subects interest me. I am a bit apprehensive about physics though, because it seems like a difficult course and needs a higher degree in post-secondary. 5. I think my careers are achievable, especially for art related courses. Physics will definetly be more difficult. What challenges did you have during post-secondary? Mentor 2022-10-02, 18:48: Hi Mandy, I had trouble making time for my hobbies in post-secondary because I was always stressed about my workload. I never felt I had enough time to do things on the weekend. Eventually, I realized that if I took time off on the weekends, I worked faster the rest of the time and made up for it. This took a bit of a leap of faith... The kind of education needed for a physicist: You don't necessarily need a masters or doctoral degree to become a physicist. The way I look at it, there are two ""pathways"" to becoming a physicist. Both involve going to university. 1) You take an undergraduate in either a) physics or b) engineering. During your undergrad, you do something called a ""Co-op"" program"", and gain a lot of work experience. After graduation, you can go straight into the workforce and slowly work your way up. If you did a BSC in physics, you would have to add some computer science to make yourself employable. 2) You do an undergrad BSC (Bachelor's of Science) in physics. Grad schools mostly look at your grades in the 2nd ( some), 3rd and 4th (lots) years. In the summers, you'll probably do some kind of research your interested with a professor, where you'll 1) gain experience and 2) get a reference for graduate school. After a few years ( 3 for masters, 4-7 for PhD, you'll be able to either enter the workforce in a more senior position, or begin the process of becoming a professor yourself. Graduate school has some classes, but is mostly research. Usually, you will have a stipend, which is like a small salary you can live off of, and counts as your pay while doing research. Eric- What's Co-op? Co-op is, in my opinion, the single most valuable part of an undergraduate university education and one of the best mechanisms for socioeconomic mobility that exists in Canada. If you plan to do university, make sure you check out universities with ""Co-op"" programs. These allow you to offset your school with multiple 4,8 and 12 month work terms in between. This allows you to 1) make money to pay tuition, 2) try out different jobs, 3) gain work experience and 4) makes it way easier to get a job after graduation. Often past employers will give you a permanent offer. A few questions for you: 1) Have you thought at all about engineering? It might be a good way to combine your passion for physics and design 2) What are your thoughts on math? Do you like it? Indifferent (me)? Dislike it? 3) Have you thought yet about where you would want to go to post-secondary? Mentee 2022-10-04, 08:57: 1) I just recently researched about engineering, and it does seem like something I would be interested in. The only problem is that there seems to be a very broad description of engineering and I'm not sure what I would specifically want to go into. 2) For me, math is alright. It's not particulary difficult for me but I wouldn't say I would want to study further into more advanced maths. So I guess I'm also indifferent on it. 3) I've not throughly thought about where to go post-secondary. I have gotten recommondations for some schools, but I'll probably aim for UBC, BCIT, or Emily Carr. Mentee 2022-10-11, 11:04: Following your last message, I’ve researched more about engineering and the requirements needed for some of them. Chemical, civil/ structural, and mechanical engineering all require passing highschool, and a grade average of above 70% in math 12, physics 12, and english 12. Chemistry is also recommended, especially for chemical engineering. Prior experience would also be helpful when getting into post-secondary engineering. Exercise and recreation facilities, location, work opportunities, extra-curriculars, and places to study are all factors that are important to me when deciding a school. I would probably be alright without a few of these, but having work opportunities is definitely important. I want to be able to make money while in post-secondary to be able to pay off student loans and just for buying stuff in general. Mentor 2022-10-11, 14:27: Hi Mandy, Just copy &amp; pasting my last message into this section for reference: Hi Mandy, Cool that you are interested in engineering! I can tell you a little bit more about it. I felt the same way about math as you do, but I knew I liked physics. To do engineering, you'll either have to like one of math or physics. If you hate both, you will likely not enjoy the program. Some engineering programs - like UBC - have a general first year. Everyone takes the same classes. Then, in the second year, you choose a specialization ( i.e mechanical, chemical). The specialization you choose doesn't define what career you might end up it. It might make it slightly easier to break into one specific sector, but choosing a specialzation isn't the be all end all. Your passions, projects, and the people you meet along the way will play a larger role in determining where you work. This goes for any type of university education &amp; specialization. Here are some examples of the different kinds of engineering, just to give you an idea. A good way to get a grasp of these things is to look up UBC + ___ Engineering Capstone Projects. Then, you can flick through a list of the projects and see if they inspire you. The ___ can be a type of engineering. A capstone project is something an engineer does in their final year of school, where they build something for a company. Pretty much every engineering school has a capstone program. Chemical Engineering: Helping manufacture drugs and antibodies in big bioreactors, building electric car batteries, or working in the oil &amp; gas industry building pipelines. Also things like genetically engineering bacteria to eat waste. Mechanical Engineering: Designing parts that move- think cars, planes, but also things like windmills. Electrical Engineering: Designing circuits, or control systems for parts made by mechanical engineering. Also designing things like biosensors. Civil Engineering: Buildings, bridges, urban design. Biomedical ( I do this): Designing medical devices, or working with medical data ( healthcare data, genomics data). Also working at a cellular or microparticle level to research and design new therapies ( vaccines, antibodies, lipid nanoparticles). Engineering Physics: A mixture of mechanical, electrical, computer, math and straight physics. This will let you do many kinds of engineering jobs, especially high-tech, cutting-edge ones. Computer Engineering: Building software for computers, either at the level of the user, or deeper down layers of software hidden in your computer. Materials Engineering: Helping companies select what material they should use, or designing new materials. For example, lululemon hires material engineering to work on their fabric. They could also design new materials for planes, or even tape to hold broken bones together. Mentor 2022-10-11, 15:26: Hi Mandy, Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving. I think I accidentally sent the same message 3 times ( about the different kinds of engineering)... Anyways: Nice work researching the requirements! Be careful though- meeting the requirements doesn't mean you'll get into the program. It just means someone will look at your file. Admission averages are tricky to find, but are way more useful if you can get a hand on them. For some schools, the low 90's is competitive, for others, mid 80's. Some schools say they look at all your courses. Others - like UVic - only look at the courses required for your degree ( English, Math, Physics and one other). By far the most important two are math and physics. The higher your admissions average, the less schools care about any extra-curriculars on your application. There are many ways to get into engineering if you are interested- you don't have to enter into engineering immediately. Some of the most hard-working, smart and driven students I've met start off doing a 1-2 year ""Engieering Transition Diploma"" ( check out Capilano University, BCIT). If you either a) didn't get into to a traditional engineering program (i.e UBC, SFU), or b) lack the prerequisites, you can do a transfer diploma, and then automatically gain entry into engineering later at a school like UBC. BCIT: An excellent school, great reputation around Vancouver. They do a nice job of setting you up with work experience. Their hands on, lab work is as good or better than most schools. You might get a little less of the theoretical side ( math &amp; physics) than a place like UBC. The tricky part about BCIT is I believe you need to know what kind of engineering you want when you apply ( I think they only have mechanical, electrical or civil)- hopefully, my last post helps with that! I totally agree with all your factors for deciding a school. Re work opportunities: 1) Do Co-op! Look for universities that have co-op programs. 2) Some post-secondary institutions have job boards just for students. For example, UBC has a work-learn program where you can work ~10 hours / week while studying. Do you have any more questions about post-secondary and career planning? Mentee 2022-10-14, 12:39: I don't really have any more questions about post-secondary and career planning. I'm glad I learned more about engineering during this though! It's definetly something I will consider in a future career now. Mentor 2022-10-18, 10:36: Hi Mandy, Which conversation did you want to open up next? Eric Mentee 2022-10-19, 14:09: I would like to open up agency in the world.","Mentor 2022-12-10, 20:15: Hi Mandy, I've opened up the Finding inspiration module- check out the first anchor text &amp; let me know what you think of the video. Any plans for the holidays? Eric Mentee 2022-12-16, 08:42: Hello Eric, I don’t really have any plans for the holidays, besides probably sleeping in or playing video games with my friends. What about you? I’m not sure what I really want in life right now, besides material things. So I guess five things I would want in life right now would be to pass all my classes with good grades, get more time to sleep, spend more time with friends and family, finish all my homework, and get a full collection of transformer comic books. I can’t think of anything else at the moment. Most of these I just want because I either don’t have enough money or time for them currently. How do you find inspiration for things you do? Mentor 2022-12-19, 21:03: Hi Mandy, I'll be playing in the snow &amp; visiting some family that's coming back. Sadly I only have two vacations days though.... I get a lot of my inspiration from my parents. My dad helps design roads, and my mom works in healthcare. They've inspired me to use my career to help serve the public. I try and choose jobs that ultimately, in some way, end up improving other people's quality of life. Knowing that my work will improve someone else's day is what keeps me going in my job. One of my biggest inspirations is the guy who invented insulin, a lifesaving drug for diabetics. He sold the patent for a dollar, because he knew how important it was for everyone to have access. Mentee 2023-01-04, 13:59: Hi Eric, How was your Christmas? I had a good winter break and got a lot of sleep in, and spent time with my family. Some of my goals are to improve my artistic skills and get enough sleep. Also, some habits I have are doodling in class and going to bed late. How do your goal and habits now compare to when you were in highschool? Mentor 2023-01-07, 19:24: Hi Mandy, Christmas was great! My girlfriend got me a massive bean bag which is quite comfy. I too am working on getting enough sleep- picking a consent time to go to bed helps. The best tip I got over the holidays was to make sure to get natural light in the morning ( 10-20 min depending on the weather. It helps set my ""body clock"", allowing me to fall asleep some 12-16 hours later. Exercise during the day also helps me have a good sleep. If I don't exercise I feel like a zombie all day and then have trouble falling asleep. Sleep is incredibly important to me. When I'm tired, I work slower, and then have to work later, which makes me more tired.... you get the point. One of my biggest tips for going off to post-secondary is to get enough sleep. It takes a bit of a leap of faith, but you have to trust you'll work faster when you're well-rested. My goals are pretty similar, but my habits are slowly changing as I adjust to working 9-5 full time. A big life change (going off to a new school, moving, starting a job) is typically the best time to try and set new habits. This is because many of the old triggers that make a habit hard to keep are now gone. I've made a habit of cooking with my partner every night when I get home- it's a good way to stay healthy &amp; catch up. Doodling is great! I believe it's actually been shown to help people focus in class. What are you trying to do to improve your sleep? Eric Mentee 2023-01-10, 13:25: Hi Eric, Currently I’m trying to improve my sleep by going to bed on time (which is somewhat working), and also taking naps in classes when I’m done with all my work. I’m also trying to not zone out as much in class because when I do that I tend to get tired. I would also like to get outside more, but there is currently still some snow around my area and it is very slippery and slushy. Is there still snow where you are now?",,"Mentee 2022-11-16, 14:32: I think the most challenging thing for me to do would be continuous studying instead of cramming. I get distracted or bored while studying and I also don’t usually retain information easily. What strategy do you use to study? Mentee 2022-11-16, 14:33: ","Mentor 2023-01-22, 21:33: Hi Mandy, I've opened up the Funding your future section. Check out the first anchor text on scholarships &amp; try the first discussion questions. A lot of scholarships go unfilled! Beyond this, in terms of funding your future, I think being in a school with a co-op program is really important. Also: this is probably our last week- so if you have any remaining questions, ask them soon!","Mentee 2022-09-16, 11:11: Hi Eric, I'm Mandy. I enjoy art, science, and Transformers.

I loved physics too in high school, and I can definitely help you on the transition to university. I don't do much quantum physics, but the TRUIMPH ( UBC's particle accelerator) is just down the road from me- I know a few people who work there, and I'm sure you could too one day! Is it still smoky there from the fire? And- imagining you could live anywhere- where would you want to be? Eric Mentee 2022-09-20, 13:22: It's still a little smokey from the fire, but the weather has definetly improved the past few days. And if I could live anywhere, I would live in a more rural and quiet area that isn't too far away from a city. I'm also curious on how the particle accelerator works, and what they do!

Engineering Physics: A mixture of mechanical, electrical, computer, math and straight physics. This will let you do many kinds of engineering jobs, especially high-tech, cutting-edge ones. Computer Engineering: Building software for computers, either at the level of the user, or deeper down layers of software hidden in your computer. Materials Engineering: Helping companies select what material they should use, or designing new materials. For example, lululemon hires material engineering to work on their fabric. They could also design new materials for planes, or even tape to hold broken bones together. Mentor 2022-11-12, 08:26: OK, opening it up! Mentor 2022-11-19, 15:27: Hi Mandy, It's okay to get distracted or bored while studying, that happens to us all... Most study strategies are awful &amp; pretty inefficient. I keep my studying pretty simple: If its a class that has practice problem (like math), I'll start by doing every practice questions, test or exam existence for the class. Most people are too afraid to do this- they feel like they need to review the content first. People are often afraid of feeling outmatched by practice problems. Be fearless! Practice, get your butt kicked, and then practice some more. As you practice, you'll 1) naturally fill in your content gaps, 2) increase speed and 3) probably end up practicing some of the same problems that are on your exam. At the end of this process, if you have done every possible practice problem, and still have time, then you can do some conceptual review. Now, how about for the classes that don't have lots of practice problems? Classes were you have to understand concepts &amp; memorize information? The strategy is to start broad, and then slowly compress everything you've learned and commit it to memory. 0: Step zero: Look at what's on the exam, and how many days you have left. Then, make a study schedule. For example, if there are 10 chapters, 2 practice exams and 6 days left, your schedule might look something like this: Day 1: First pass, chapters 1-3, 30 minutes each Day 2: First pass, chapters 4-6, 30 minutes each Day 3: First pass, chapters 6-10 30 min each Day 4: Second pass, memory work Day 5: Third pass, first practice exam Day 6: Second practice exam, memory work if needed ( try and recreate your their pass document, and re-read second pass notes, if there is anything you are sketchy on, practice memorizing it) 1. First pass: Go through all of the material class by class, supplementing by reading from the textbook if needed. Take notes. Make sure you understand everything. The notes you take should be for you only. Don't make them pretty. You might have short words, acronyms, or drawings that only you understand. That's okay! Try and write these by hand. It's important that you make these notes logically. When you are trying to commit lots of info to your brain, order matters. Try and have a logical flow to your notes. Numbering helps. Also, make sure you use a timer here. It's easy to get bored or carried away doing first pass notes. 2. Second pass: Compress these- try and make each chapter of notes a single page. Try and make this single page from memory. If you can't do it, look at your first pass, and then try again. Sometimes I'll cover my notes with a piece of paper, and try and orally explain each concept to myself. Then I'll uncover the notes and see if I was right. 3. Third pass:1-2 days before the exam, I'll try and compress all of my notes for the entire class down to a single page ( or maybe 2) in total. You might be writing single words or letters that remind you of entire concepts. 4. With any time left, do practice problems or test yourself by trying to recreate your third pass notes or troublesome sections on the second pass. Mentee 2022-11-22, 12:51: Hello Eric I will definetly try and use this technique to study in the future. I'll honestly probably get distracted while studying though. Are we opening another module? If so I would like to choose dis/mis-information. Mentor 2022-11-24, 20:30: Hi Mandy, I'll open up the next module! What sorts of stuff gets you distracted? For me it's either Instagram or the snow forecast.... Mentee 2022-11-29, 10:48: For me, I get distracted by my peers sometimes in class, or by my phone (youtube, etc). Also, the module isn't open yet; I can't click on it. Mentor 2022-12-02, 09:28: Opening it now! Sorry I've been ou with the flu this wek. Mentor 2022-12-06, 19:14: Hi Mandy, It start to get even more important to be able to pick out dis &amp; misinformation once you're no longer a minor. The first reasons obvious: you have a vote, and with that comes a responsibility to be informed. When you vote, ideally your not just thinking about how your vote will impact yourself, but how it will affect society as a whole. You'll need to be informed to answer these kinds of questions. Try and make an effort to tap into a news source that's not tied to social media, which filters out news you are a) not interested in or b) disagree with. Podcasts by major news sources ( New York Times, Globe and Mail) are great free alternatives. Subscribing is better, but costs money. National media outlets like CBC and BBC are held to a high journalistic standard while being free, because governments know strong, independent news sources are important for democracy to function. I would for sure recommend them! Mentee 2022-12-08, 11:31: Friendly reminder to be cautious of the Conversation thread you are sending your messages in and to only post messages in the current threat you are working on so both parties can follow alone :) Mentor 2023-01-13, 08:06: No more snow! We are all rained out here. Side note- the mentorship program is doing some video calls on Monday the 16th 8:30-9:30pm (Pacific time zone) on the gathertown platform. Would you like to join? I'll be there! Signup is here: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4kW9RC2fYbmCCG Eric Mentee 2023-01-13, 14:11: Hi Eric, It's nice that there’s no more snow where you live. It just started raining more here too. I don’t think I’ll be able to join the online platform on monday, as I’ll probably be doing something with my family at that time. Mentor 2023-01-17, 07:21: No worries- what discussion would you like to open next? Mentee 2023-01-19, 12:30: I think I want to open up 'Funding Your Future"".",,"Mentor 2022-12-02, 09:29: Module should be open. Mentee 2022-12-02, 12:50: Hi Eric I think thinking skills for social media are definetly important as a student, especially since the majority of students have/use social media. It's very useful to be able to identify what to believe on the internet, since people tend to just believe things at face value. How does the importance of being able to identify dis- and misinformation differ between being an adult/post- secondary student and being a minor? Mentee 2022-12-07, 14:02: Hi Eric I'll definetly try and look into more news sites into the future, considering that currently I get a lot of news related information from people I know. Regarding mis-information, we have actually learned a bit about it in the previous school year. It was very informative! During that unit we also looked at real or fake photos, which was fun. For the next discussion, I was hoping we could do Finding Inspiration.",,"Mentor 2022-10-20, 10:01: Hi Mandy, I opened up the agency in the world conversation. Check out the first video and let me know what you think. Mentee 2022-10-27, 12:47: Hello Eric, I watched the video, and I think the resources the students had were pretty influential in their lives. They had people that helped and motivated them to turn their lives around. I’m also confident that I have people like that in my life. Are people that help you present in post-secondary, and is it more difficult to ask for help As an adult or more difficult? Mentor 2022-10-28, 11:53: HI Mandy, Post-secondary is full of people who want to help you. If you're looking for something like a job, or a reference, start by building a connection. For example, start by just asking the person for advice, or about their own path. It's not necessarily ""harder"" to ask for advice as an adult. But what often happens is that people are ( or become) too proud to ask for help. Being too proud will get you nowhere! If you are genuinely confident about who you are, you should never be afraid to ask for help. Be efficient, don't be proud. Trying to make connections with friends, professors and possible mentors is always difficult. It took me a couple of months to find a good group of friends at uni. You have to be willing to reach out to people, recognizing your efforts might fail. What type of people in your life have helped you find agency? Mentee 2022-11-04, 10:52: Hi Eric. Sorry I haven't responded recently; I’ve been busy with other schoolwork since term is ending soon. People that come to mind who've helped me find agency are my friends, teachers, and coworkers. My friends have experience in other subjects and learning techniques that I can learn from; Teachers can help me find post-secondary options and suggest ways to improve my learning; Coworkers can help me gain more knowledge in workplace environments and help me in finding future jobs. How would you get someone to be your ally? How would you build trust with them? And do you have any tips for knowing if someone is trustworthy? Mentor 2022-11-07, 08:06: Hi Mandy, Most people want to see others succeed. Think of it this way: people want to be your ally by default. They're looking for any reasons not to be your ally. My best tips are to just be genuine, yourself, and to be respectful of other people. If you're working with someone who's a potential ally, be respectful of them, do quality work, and be timely. This will leave the door open for someone to be your ally. The next step is to be brave and ask for mentorship, help or advice! In person works best, it's harder for people to say no to your requests. Allies should never be jealous of your success, they should always be rooting for you. The same goes for friends. Ultimately, you'll never know for sure if a single source is trustworthy. Try and talk to multiple allies, and do you own research before making a decision. Sometimes you might take the wrong advice or make the wrong decision. These things happen, you're not perfect. The only thin you can doo is keep working hard &amp; try again! Any more questions on this? Or should I open up another conversation? Mentee 2022-11-08, 12:56: I don't have anymore questions on this disscussion, though the information about allies was nice to learn! For the next coversation to open up, I would like strategic studying.",

I hope you are doing well. I believe we only have until January 27th to finish! We can totally get this done, we will only have to complete the following modules: - Different Ways of Knowing - Well-Being and Self-Care - Confronting Discrimination - Post-secondary and Career Planning - One other conversation I know it might not seem like we have a lot of time, but I will be super available! I have had a lot of personal things come up, but do not worry! We can do this!! Let's start here and get the ball rolling :D Best, Saahil",,,,,,,,,,"Mentee 2022-09-16, 10:50: Hi saahil I'm kaiz I see that you had various interests in law ,I've had some in the past and wanted to ask some questions such as ,is the programs you worked on easier or more difficult and if you have had other interests in jobs. Mentor 2022-09-17, 15:28: Hello Kaiz! It's nice to connect with you! I saw on your profile that you are interested in becoming a heavy-duty mechanic, welder, or lawyer – that’s amazing! Your hobbies are super cool too; I have never been on a quad rider before but wow, that must be so fun! Right now, I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree and that takes four years of full-time studies. It can be easy to some people, but it depends on how much effort you put in your studies! Law schools usually require a bachelor’s degree, and it takes an additional three years of studying to earn your Juris Doctor (law degree), so it is a time investment. I have had interest in different jobs! Since I am majoring in political science, one route I was considering was to become a policy analyst after graduating or find a job in the government. My father also recommended I pursue a technical program, such as becoming a mechanic, so that was also a path I considered for some time. On a side note, I am working as a teaching assistant right now for my university! I hope you are having a fun weekend, Saahil Mentee 2022-09-21, 08:58: I read through the checklist and completed it and was wondering if you could open the first module Mentor 2022-09-21, 09:59: Hi Kaiz! Yes, I can definitely open up the first module! There is a bunch we can start with, but I will pick one at random and afterwards we can decide which ones to do next! We will start with ""Different Ways of Knowing"". We will eventually work through the following in the future: Well-Being and Self-Care Confronting Discrimination Post-secondary and Career Planning One Conversation of your choice! I just opened ""Different Ways of Knowing"". I will be working on it alongside with you whenever I am free to do so. I will try to respond as quick as I can and work through these modules so you can complete what your teacher is expecting of you in time :) Best, Saahil Mentor 2022-10-18, 08:10: Hey Kaiz! It's been a while but I hope you are doing okay. I would love to work with you when you have the time to do so! I want you to get a good grade for this part of your class and these modules seem pretty fun :) Reach out to me when you can! Mentor 2022-11-24, 22:34: Kaiz, I hope you are doing okay! Life has been quite busy for me too, but whenever you are ready, let's work on some of these modules! I want you to succeed in your class :) Saahil Mentee 2022-12-08, 13:52: Hey saahil sorry for the delayed response and work . I will start doing my work on here more often . I am also wondering how your doing as well as how school is going for you. I also seen that you are intrested in law . I also am interested in that field of work . Mentor 2022-12-10, 01:16: Hey Kaiz, No worries! I'm glad you got back to me when you could :) It's cool that you're interested in law too! I am doing great. Right now I have final exams and papers to write, but besides that, everything is great!! Feel free to start the ""Different Ways of Knowing"" module whenever you're ready with me!

Feel free to send over your answers to the discussion questions! Mentee 2022-12-08, 13:44: I think the difference between studying the land and living on it is two completely different things. I think this because sure you know the land but when you live on the land you know every little corner everything about it and just what the land is about. Mentor 2022-12-08, 14:05: Hi Colby! Thank you for your insightful response! Let me know which question you'd like me to answer out of the 3 discussion questions. Mentee 2022-12-13, 12:27: How have the classes in your program used “scientific” versus “traditional” knowledge? How does this compare to high school classes? Mentor 2022-12-14, 16:06: I think a lot of my university classes, especially because I am a physics major, have relied much more on ""scientific"" knowledge than ""traditional"" knowledge. There is a lot of emphasis on the scientific methods and being able to prove theoretical concepts with empirical evidence, as it is the most accepted way of learning about the world around us. To be honest, it didn't differ too much from high school, as I mostly learned through scientific knowledge. There are specific programs however, that you can join in university that focus more on traditional ways of knowing. Mentor 2023-01-10, 17:16: Hey Colby! Has school started yet for you? If so, you can get started on the next discussion activity! Mentee 2023-01-12, 08:58: The Indigenous invented Lacrose which I would have had no clue until this video that the Indigenous made a pretty good sport because we dont usually say the indigenous Canadians made Lacrose we just hear its a Canadian sport Mentor 2023-01-12, 21:18:  Mentor 2023-01-12, 21:19: Wow, that's pretty cool, I honestly didn't know that either! You can ask me one of the following questions regarding the video you just watched: As an adult and post-secondary student, what kind of Indigenous innovations or businesses have they encountered? How can living by the Seven Teachings help them succeed during post-secondary school and while “adulting”? Which of the Seven Teachings have they struggled with, and what have they done to improve in this area? Mentee 2023-01-17, 10:35: As an adult and post-secondary student, what kind of Indigenous innovations or businesses have you encountered? Mentor 2023-01-19, 01:04: Hi Colby! To answer your question, I think as a postsecondary student I have been exposed to a lot of Indigenous culture and business around the university, especially as British Columbia is much better at acknowledging Indigenous people than other provinces. Some examples include the MOA, a museum on UBC campus with a special emphasis on the First Nations peoples and other cultural communities of British Columbia. Additionally, I have also tried some Indigenous restaurants and coffee places across Vancouver, which really differ from the usual cuisine I am used to (still really tasty though haha)! That is the last activity for the module, so we can move on to a new one now! Is there any other Conversation or topic you wish to discuss?",,,,,"Mentor 2023-01-25, 20:07: Hi Colby!

Take a look at the first video and make sure to send me your answers to the discussion questions and follow the instructions given! Mentee 2022-12-01, 12:53: 1. I've tried multiple examples before. It helped me a bit not a whole lot. 2. The strategy that I think looks the most is Spaced Practice. It just seems like you can get a lot more because you aren't tired of studying the entire time 3. Not sure 4. I think its higly likely because I would like to get better grades and I feel like this strategies might help a lot in helping me. What strategies do you use to get ready for exams? Mentor 2022-12-01, 16:24: Honestly, I've tried many techniques to study for exams, and here are some of the ones that worked for me: Reviewing content before classes: this one is really helpful but can be super hard to keep up with as you're essentially doing double the amount of work necessary. This includes taking notes and reading the next lessons beforehand, in addition to doing the homework you already have assigned. It's really helpful because you come to class prepared and ready to ask insightful questions that aren't just basic knowledge, but once again, it is a lot of work and requires strict time management. I always try to do this at the beginning of the year but I find myself struggling to keep up after a while. Doing practice questions: I definitely agree with you that spaced practice is super helpful, espeically when you make sure to really identify what you don't understand and work it out with your teacher or a friend. Understanding the answer: this is kinda related to the point I made above, as sometimes you can get the right answer without truly understanding the reasoning behind it. In cases such as these, as soon as the question gets harder, it gets a lot more difficult to solve things. This is especially true for math and physics, where understanding every step to solving a simple problem is imperative to doing well on harder questions. Asking for help: I cannot stress this one enough. It is probably the most useful way to improve your skills, and learning it from someone who already has mastered the skill can improve your own understanding by leaps and bounds. I went from almost failing a math midterm to getting above 90% on the next one just by going to every office hour and really clearing things up with the teaching assistants!

I'll list some of the points below: Computer skills: if you know how to use Word, Powerpoint, Google docs, etc. these can added under computer skills! In addition, if you know any coding such as in Python that looks really good on a resume too! Languages: I like to add which languages I can fluently speak, read or write as well as ones that I might have a more basic understanding of. Awards: any accomplishments, scholarships, awards you can put on such as being on Honour Roll, etc. Characteristics: You can talk about your diligence, curiosity, responsibility, etc. Great job on your first draft though!

The easier it is to just sit and relax, the easier it is to connect to your surroundings, to have the peace of mind needed to properly connect with people as well I don’t know any stories about the land or territory where I live, unfortunately. I already treat the land with as much respect as I possibly can so not much would change for me, and if others learnt it might not have the effect expected, though many will likely do their best to change the way they treat the land Sometimes the two subjects can butheads, but they can also work together! It’s also a matter of respect as well. I have not heard of any other things related to traditional and scientific knowledge working together What’s your connection with the land you live on? Mentor 2022-11-20, 20:59: Very good point about the difference between urban and rural areas. When I was in high school and during my undergrad degree, I never heard about land acknowledgments. It was only at UBC medical school that I learned about this practice and learned the reasons behind it. I find UBC works hard to ensure students learn the importance of the land they live on and to acknowledge and respect it. I have been able to learn about the unceded territory that I lived on in Vancouver. However now that I have moved to the Okanagan, I must say I don't know much about the origins of this land. Like you though, I always try and treat the land with respect. We are very fortunate to live in this province. If there are no other questions about this topic, feel free to move onto anchor text #2. Talk soon! Micheline Mentee 2022-11-21, 12:44: The teaching hardest for me to follow is bravery, I'm a very anxious person and I'm easily scared. You could say going to school just about every weekday is brave, but it just feels like a chore i do out of obligation than something i'm being brave about if that makes any sense- Whats a teaching you've had trouble with? Mentor 2022-11-25, 06:43: Hey Toni, Thank you for sharing your thoughts. That does make sense. Though I would say going to school every weekday is definitely brave, if that is something that may present a challenge to you! What is a teaching that you value the most? For me, a teaching that I have struggled with is 'love'. I found that during my undergrad degree and now during medical school, many students are really competitive and work hard, but they also sometimes put themselves first and disregard their fellow classmates. I feel like sometimes in those settings, people forget to be kind to one another and sometimes only look out for themselves. Since realizing this, I have tried to take a ""person-first"" approach and be kind to everyone and act like a human before a competitive student. Some things are more important than school! Talk soon, Micheline Mentee 2022-11-25, 13:57: since im pretty sure that was the last discussion, could you open finding inspiration please? Mentor 2023-01-05, 20:03: That's great to hear. When it is time to apply, you will find it helpful that you have done a lot of research already. It can be a stressful process, so being prepared early only helps! This brings me to my tip about gaining admission. It is always a good idea that you read up on the prerequisites needed for the program you are interested in, just as you have. I often find it hard to navigate the university websites, so if you are unsure at all, reaching out to the university can be very helpful. Most schools have a great student affairs team that can answer questions. I believe Douglas College also has free information sessions. I have looked up the Douglas College sign language interpretation diploma requirements, assuming this is the program you are talking about (https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/dpsli). So my biggest tip is to become familiar with their prereqs early so there are no surprises when you would like to apply. And keep working hard! Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like any help with finding more information. Always happy to help :) Micheline","Mentor 2023-01-05, 20:07: Hey Toni, Looks like we have made it through all the required conversations, and then some! It has been great working with you. I think it's awesome that you have a clear idea of what you would like to do after high school, and you clearly have great insight into what factors help you succeed. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments or anything else you would like to talk about. Thank you! Micheline Mentee 2023-01-10, 12:35: It's been great to work with you too! I hope school goes well for you! -Toni","Mentor 2022-10-12, 09:20: Hey Toni! Now that we've finished the ""Confronting Discrimination"" conversation, I've opened up the next one. This one is also super important and is about self-care. Once you finish reading the ""Mind Power"" article and watch the youtube video, you can share your lists here and I will be working on mine as well. And you can ask one of the questions that are included in the Discussion Questions. Thanks and talk to you soon! Micheline Mentee 2022-10-12, 11:25: Unfortuneately Mind Power refused to load on the school computer, I will be sure to check i tout later though! Warning signs that i need self care= I dont want to draw/have no motivation to even pick upmy stylus, constant need to nap, going semi-verbal or non-verbal more often, i start avoiding things, can only barely stand reading for fun, certain songs don’t have that same *zing* to ‘em, not pacing Activities i enjoy= Drawing, animating, doin lil dances, pacing, reading, photography, meme compilation binges, being an over all silly goofy dude Warm fuzzy list= https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XyyAsxvOCiEGDcVjc2BfZyY8KhsUfDX ,https://youtu.be/6pVtcv08WX0 , https://youtu.be/jOvmKHtbaUA , that one time a random lady said that i have the eyes of an actress Do you have any tips for navigating mental health when you’re in post secondary? Mentor 2022-10-16, 13:08: Hey Toni, Thanks for sharing your lists. Being able to identify specific signs as you did shows your insight into your well-being. I can definitely relate to becoming quiet as a warning sign. Activities I enjoy are reading, playing hockey, and going biking with some friends. That always seems to be a good reset for me! Wow, the ""Best of Favorite Dance Moves"" youtube video is awesome! How can you not smile to that! Navigating mental health in post-secondary is a super important topic. It is easy to feel overwhelmed in post-secondary; you may be away from your home and your friends, and it can feel like there is nobody around who understands you. One good thing though, is that because those feelings are quite common, most post-secondary institutions have really great resources available to support students' mental health. These might include support groups, counsellors and school events where you can meet people and connect. There are also many different clubs that can align with your interests which are great ways to spend time with like-minded people. Institutions are often very understanding if you need some time to get back on your feet. In my school now, we have ""personal days"" where we can request a day off and not even need to say why. This has helped many students reset and stay on top of their mental health. Great question! Feel free to move onto Anchor Text #2 when you're ready. Talk soon :) Micheline Mentee 2022-10-17, 09:38: yooo that's sick! I hope when i go post-secondary we'll get something akin to the personal days your school has! thats such a wonderful thing and im happy that institutions are getting more in touch with the fact mental health, well, exists! How good am I at self care?- I need to eat better, be less stationary and scream into the void more often (its surprisingly very theraputic for me-) How can I do it better- Practice self discipline by saying no to sweets, I can go on walks more often by playing pokemon go, and i can find time to scream into the void more often Do you have any tips for time-management? And how has post-secondary and general adulthood challenged your approach to self-care? Mentor 2022-10-21, 07:18: Hey Toni, Totally agree! I've noticed many post-secondary institutions are incorporating things like personal days more often so I am sure you will have something similar, or something even greater than that! Great question about time management. Everyone will have different ways that work for them, but the main trick for me is to write lists. If I have many things going on, I will write a list of all the tasks I need to do: study chemistry, read this article, take notes on biology, go to the grocery store. I figure out which is the most crucial to do, and I rank them. I then set a goal, for example, today I will do 2 hours of chemistry studying and start reading the article. And all the while, I know I still have a couple more tasks pending but I can't do them all at once so they will just have to wait. But what I also find really helpful, is I set a time limit if I'm watching Netflix or procrastinating on the computer. When I'm watching a show, I will look at the clock and if it's say, 7:46pm, I tell myself ""Okay, I can watch until 8:00pm and then I start my studying"". That helps me stay self-disciplined. So to sum up, lists and mini-goals/time limits are my tips for time management! Post-secondary and growing up general has challenged my approach to self-care because I have found there to be less wiggle room when it comes to the deadlines that I have. In high school, if I was feeling a little bit burnt out, I knew I could take the weekend to reset and focus on things I like to do. But now, there are more tasks to do in less time, so I no longer feel like I could take a weekend off. I mean, I could of course, but I would get behind in school and that would just add stress! So when someone suggests I take a day off and do nothing and go watch a movie, I don't feel like that is the most responsible thing to do and it wouldn't help me in the long run. I find it's a tricky balance, but my solution has been: self-care in moderation! So I take a little time every day for self-care to avoid getting burnt out, then I don't have to take a whole weekend off and get behind in school. Staying on top of self-care has helped me avoid any major dips in how I'm feeling. Do you have any other thoughts or questions? Let me know whenever you are ready to move on to the next topic! Talk to you soon :) Micheline Mentee 2022-10-25, 10:46: Thank you for the tips, i appreciate it tons! I'll definetly be keeping them in mind! i'm ready to move on! could we do the conversation ""from rural to urban"" next please?",,,"Mentee 2022-12-13, 12:47: To be an ASL interpreter, I need 60 credits, a prerequisite in English 105 and I need to know ASL/take an ASL course and take a class in deaf studies. This will get me into the program and then that will get me the diploma I need to interpret. To be a funeral director, first it’s recommended I take biology and/or chemistry in secondary school, and if able, a business course Second, in post secondary I would need to take a pathology,anatomy and microbiology course. I’ll need to learn about dissection, embalming, safety procedures, preservation chemicals, lab work, ect ect I need to take an apprenticeship program which is a full time 2 year long program, and I’d need a foundation program, a 1 year long academic program. To obtain a License I would need to find employment before the second year of studying For this job, I need to have compassion, emotional stability, time management skills, know funeral regulations, cultural sensitivities, ect ect I would benefit from post-secondary due to having more opportunities, having more chance to pursue things I’m passionate about, and time management skill improvement Three things that might make my education goals difficult are my problems memorizing things, for the latter one of the closest institutions (that the school computer wont give me a “this is not a private connection, you can’t see this” message for clickingiam in PAIN ) is too far away (in Alberta), and the length of schooling is a bit daunting (because high school makes me wanna avoid schools in general, but also I love learning so-) I wanna get highschool over with because I want to do things I actually enjoy and learn things I want to know about. I understand why it is the way it is, but i also just generally like how this school runs oops The first is achievable, but for the second one I’d need tutoring in things like math because math and science are big things if you wanna learn to and embalm or cremate a body How important is it to be good at the school subjects that a particular career path requires? For example, if you struggle with Biology as a school subject does that mean medical school is not an option for you? Do they have any tips on how to handle difficult school subjects? Mentor 2022-12-15, 08:14: Hey Toni, Great answer! When did you first know you wanted to be a funeral director or mortician? Is your goal to be an ASL interpreter and funeral director? I think there are many more important aspects of a career path than being good at one of the prerequisite subjects. Interestingly enough, medical school in BC only requires you have an English course. That was my hardest subject ever! But I knew it was needed, so I worked hard to get a good grade. I can't say I loved that course, but I didn't have a choice in the matter. It does help when you enjoy the course you are taking, no matter if you are strong in it or need a bit more support with it. My number one tip on how to handle difficult school subjects is: time management. It does not help at all if you leave a hard subject to the very last minute! I find it helpful to start studying early, ask your teachers for help, and try and work a little bit on it every day or two so you can improve. Do you enjoy math and science? Or are those courses that just need to be done for your program? Micheline Mentee 2022-12-15, 09:12: For me, it started with ASL interpretation (found it through wanting to just in general learn ASL and loved the idea), and Motician came after (I went down a rabbit hole, learnt about the processes a bit, and learnt about the death positivity movement and it did nothing but intriuge me). English is a really hard subject so that's fair enough, and depending on who your teacher is, it can be really uninteresting/unengaging- And time managment is indeed a very good thing (that I need to improve on-) I am not fond of math, but I have to learn it anyways so oh well! An i thoroughly enjoy science! Especially Biology in general. And, of course, I do have an interest in mortuary sciences! When I was looking for schools that would get me a diploma for ASL Interpretation, the closest, and only one in the province, was in Vancouver (Douglas College). I am absolutely not willing to move farther than that, so it's my only option other than an online course. But with classes like these I'd prefer to do them in person, especially since there's practicums (3 1 month long ones during the course of the about 2 years I'd be in the courses if i remember correctly.) Do you know anyting about Douglas College? What criteria did you look for when looking for schools to apply to? Mentor 2022-12-19, 09:32: That's awesome! It sounds like you've done your research which is great. I have heard great things about Douglas College! I know there are many different campuses. Do you know which one you would attend? Do you know much about the college/location? I agree, in-person courses would likely be beneficial. For choosing a school, I put a lot of value into the city. I ended up choosing McGill because I loved Montreal and what the city had to offer. This is compared to Queens University in Ontario, where maybe it isn't so unique as Montreal! And arguably less to do! I also liked a smaller campus. You mentioned you wouldn't be willing to move farther than Vancouver. If I may ask, what don't you like about the idea of moving to another province? Micheline Mentor 2022-12-19, 09:33:  Mentee 2023-01-03, 14:29: Yeah, my family (mainly my dad) wants me to be prepared, which I'm thankful for! And thats good to hear: I was thinking of going to ther campus in new westminster if i remember correctly! That's a good thought process! Location can be very important when it comes to schooling! I don't want to leave the province sice i don't think i could handle being that far from my family, i want to be able to visit as often as feasible which woold be more spaced out visits if i left the province, i also just want to stay where i'm more famililar! I also just don't like cities much, especally ones as big as vancouver! (good segway to anchor 2 hahaaa) With what I have planned, i'm planing on finding a place in new westminster as close to the campus and at least a small grocery store and pharmacy! I'm also very willing to walk or take a bus, driving in the city doesn't seem like very pleasent, especilly when it comes to parking- (i could also earn how to ride a bike-) I don't have a huge priority for exersize or recreational things, mainly since i'd prefer to find a way to do it at home. For supports and opprotunities I'm really hoping to get a part time job as maybe a library page or at a bookstore in general, I could also make a couple bucks on the side through art comissions I would also probably try and find a group concerned with things like LGBTQ+ topics and how we can help queer people and all that good stuff! I could also invest in a line reader which would also be very helpful for me i'm not really sure what the campus culture is like, so all I know I can do is hope things'll go well and I'll be around at least some like-minded people, or maybe be randomly chosen to be a friend by an extrovert lol, and I don't mind a lot of students, as long as I can find my way around easily enough Factors that made me choose douglas is really just that it's in province and I know a couple people there already For pre requisets, I'll be tthe asl course I need in the summer, a course about deaf culture and related, english 105 if i remember corctly, and I will be meeting the general admission requirements Do you have any tips for gaining admssion? (Im also very tired as I write this so sorry if any of it seems confusing or jumbled at all) Mentor 2023-01-05, 20:03: That's great to hear. When it is time to apply, you will find it helpful that you have done a lot of research already. It can be a stressful process, so being prepared early only helps!

Micheline Mentee 2022-11-29, 10:48: Things that inspire me are music, helpng people, current fixations (video games, shows, history, ect. are some fixations ive had), literature, movies. science and spirituality I'm passionate about creating because it makes me happy, and i'm passionate about helping people because it makes me happy and creating things that could help people is what I want to do in life, even if it's not at the same time 5 things i want in life in no particular order - write at least one long story - make 1 full animation over 30 seconds long - learn to sew - make myself at least 1 outfit - learn how to park a car better What helps you stay motivated to pursue your passions? And what inspires you to pursue that passion? Mentor 2022-12-01, 15:40: Those are awesome! It sounds like you have a very creative side. My motivation and inspiration to pursue my passions come a lot from my long-term goal of becoming a doctor. When some days are really hard, I just think about my future in 10 years, and I think this is all part of the process to becoming a doctor and I need to keep working until I get there. Luckily, most of the time, I really like what I am doing so the motivation comes easy! I also find different parts of medicine to keep me inspired, like interesting diseases in kids. It is hard to stay motivated when I come across something that I am not interested in. For those, I sometimes think about the consequences and how I want to avoid failing or avoid being embarrassed. That makes me work hard too! Feel free to move on to the next anchor text when you are ready! Micheline Mentee 2022-12-02, 13:24: Creating is what i do best! Amd that ounds really cool!!! Med school is. not easy at all so props to you!!! By next month i want to be better at animating, i can do this by animating sometyhing small every day or every second day! WHat habits have helped you acheive goals? Mentor 2022-12-04, 21:05: Cool! What do you mean by animating? I'm trying to picture what that could look like! Mentee 2022-12-05, 09:01: I mainly focus on character animation! Recently I was thinking of animating to the song Best Friend by Toy-Box (semi-unrelated, the music video is absolutely wild I love it) !!! It wouldn't be super complicated or anything! My inspiration for it, besides the song itself, it an animation by Dystrack on youtube (best friend! (homestuck) is the video)! It's also a chance for me to branch out a bit since the style is only partially animated! I typically do frame by frame animation (because I like to make my life harder if I decide I want to properly colour and line the animation apparently) which is very time consuming, and making something partially animated is a lot faster! Though if I'm honest with myself I'll probably do mostly animated but just do jump cuts instead of fancy transition from scene to scene like I usually try to do! That should help give you a clear picture of current plans and what they look like somewhat! Mentee 2022-12-05, 09:34:  Mentor 2022-12-07, 21:28: Wow, that's awesome! Such a cool passion! Did you learn how to do that yourself? And to answer your question about what habits I have to achieve my goals, I would have to say organization and sleep are what make me stay focused! I try and always stay on top of deadlines and exams so I do a little work every day instead of a lot of work (and cram) at the end. This plus normal sleep habits have really helped me achieve my goals so far. What kind of habits do you have to help you achieve your goals, other than animating? Micheline Mentee 2022-12-08, 13:48: I had to memorize a few of the principals of animation like squash and stretch! And my dad got me something that supports animation! As for habits that help me acheive my goals, I write sometimes!!! Its good pracitce especially when I need to desrbe and anecdote hings!!! I give myself all the detail i need!

Nice to meet you, what is pickleball- Mentor 2022-09-17, 15:33: Hey Toni! Nice to meet you as well! Great question. Pickleball is a game that I would say is half tennis and half ping-pong. You play on a smaller tennis court, but your paddle is like a ping-pong paddle. It's super fun. What kind of things do you like to do in your free time? For me, I like to read, play sports and play the piano. I did my undergraduate degree in Montreal and am now in medical school in a smaller BC town.

Sometimes it just seems really hard to stay focused for more than 10 seconds. This usually happens if I am up late the night before or I'm not properly taking care of myself. It is super frustrating! But I have learned that these days happen, and you can't force trying to focus, so sometimes you just need to let a day like that happen and make it through the day. The next day is usually better!

Micheline","Mentor 2022-10-27, 13:34: Hey Toni! I've opened this Conversation now. Please take a look at the discussion questions when you have a moment. Thanks, Micheline Mentee 2022-10-28, 09:24: Thank you! Three things I like about living in a rural area and why: -Not as loud as the city; less distractions and chances of being overwhelmed by near constant noise when out and about -Being able to walk anywhere I need without much hassle: makes life a bit easier and the commutes around town are generally shorter -Not as many people (understatement-): People are scary and I dont trust any of them unless i either have to or i end up trusting them im great at wording my thoughts oh boy! Two things i don't like about living in a rural town and why: -There is far less to do: The most interesting thing about this own there is to do is visit like 9 different pizza places (we do not need this many) and comparing them -Expenses: gas and groceries are a bit more expensive, the reason why is more self explanitory As for my questions- What tips do you have for adjusting to the city? What do you like and dislike about living in the city? Do you have tips for general living in the city? What big changes not often talked about could one face from moving somewhere rural to somewhere urban? Mentor 2022-10-31, 20:24: Hey Toni, Thanks for sending your answers! Being able to walk to most places in your town must be so nice. My biggest tip for adjusting to a big city is to break the area up into pieces. It can feel super overwhelming with all the different ""cities within the city"" that you may not want to go out and explore or not know where to start. What worked for me is to start with one area and go explore, see what you like and dislike about it, and start to get comfortable in that area. Then maybe the following week, you can check another place out. Before you know it, you will be getting more familiar with the big city and it hopefully won't feel as overwhelming and busy as it once had. A big change that is not often talked about is a feeling of loneliness or anonymity. While some people may appreciate that aspect of it, it certainly is a big difference that comes with moving to a big city. In a smaller town, you can walk downtown and likely run into people you know. That can offer a sense of security. In a big city, however, it would be very unlikely to run into people you know. All of a sudden, you may feel lonely because you don't have your ""regular"" people around and it can feel like nobody knows you or notices you. This can be a hard adjustment, but it just means that you have to find a different way to maintain your social connections. And that is very doable! What I like about living in a big city is all the different food options (and really good food options). It would be very hard to try all the different pizza restaurants but I say it's worth a shot! Something I dislike however is the business and the traffic. Sometimes it can take me an hour to get home from school in my car. Feel free to move on to the next set of questions when you would like to! Micheline Mentee 2022-11-03, 10:59: Yeah, I really enjoy walking around town most of the time! It’s really nice here. Thank you for the tips and all!!! I’ll definitely be keeping these in mind! And traffic is never fun, truly someone in the city’s worst enemy When I eventually have to move out, I would love to be able to keep the tradition of making Empanadas for my dad’s birthday. Empanadas are the best and i love them, well worth the 2 day process of making them! Really all i’d have to do is plan things out, because the biggest thing is making the dough on the first day and leaving it to rest and then preparing what you need for the fillings the day after! How have you kept any traditions going after you moved away from home? How did you feel when you moved away and how did you deal with those emotions? How did you cultivate a sense of belonging in the city? Mentor 2022-11-07, 13:14: Hi Toni, That's an awesome tradition! And you are right, it would just be about planning things out for the empanadas! I can't say I have kept any traditions going since I moved away from home, nor did I have many traditions to begin with. I suppose the only thing is that my dad used to make this special kind of tea when one of us kids were sick. That is something I started to do as well, and it made me feel like I was back home. The main emotions right when I moved away from home were: excited and sad. I was super excited to go out on my own and explore a new city, but there was also a constant feeling of sadness because I knew I would miss my parents, siblings and friends. It was an odd combination of emotions. There were times I felt lonely too, especially being away from family, but you learn to adapt! You make new friends and you find your ""new normal"". Once you are in a good space and are happy with your new surroundings, there is no stopping you! My sense of belonging in a new city came from exploring the different neighborhoods and trying the local coffee shops. Made me feel like I lived there for real. Great questions! Anything else come to mind? Micheline Mentee 2022-11-08, 09:36: Thank you! I'll see if I can apply something similar to what you did as a starting point when the time comes! And you reminded me that I need to ask my grandma for this one tea recipe she has, she always makes it when we're feeling down! I don't have any more questions that I can think of!",,,,"Mentor 2022-09-21, 18:29: Hey Toni, I've opened up this Conversation. Please have a read through the text and the glossary.

Micheline Mentee 2022-09-22, 09:15: I have a quick question, so for whenever i read an anchor i send a message answering the questions? How should i format this? Mentor 2022-09-25, 07:46: Yes, exactly! Once you read the anchor text (in this case the first one is ""Racial Equity Tools Glossary""), you can answer the Dicussion Questions and include them here in this chat. Then we'll go from there. There's no specific format to answering the questions, so please do so however you like! Micheline Mentee 2022-09-26, 15:43: Alrighty, thank you Micheline! Anchor 1 Implicit Bias- The unconscious biases about things like age, race, gender, ect. that affect how we interact with others Individual Racism- Your own beliefs/assumptions that are racist Institutional Racism- Racism that is found in the foundations of things like law, the justice system, healthcare, ect. Microaggression- Subtle racism that can be either intentional or unintentional Privilege- When a group or individual is given an advantage due to factors such as skin colour, religion, economic status, ect. What are some ways you've seen discrimination? Mentor 2022-09-29, 19:20: Hi Toni, Thanks for completing the questions. Well said! I've unfortunately seen discrimination in both school and hobbies. For instance, sometimes when I am seeing a patient in the doctor's office, they are unwilling to speak with me about their medical condition because I am a female and they rather wait to speak with a male student or doctor. Feel free to move on to the second anchor text when you're ready. Talk to you soon! Micheline Mentee 2022-10-04, 08:54: Dr. Caron's story made me both happy and sad. Sad because it shows how prevalent discrimination still is in the medical field and how it still effects people. It also shows the effects that trauma and intergenerational trauma effectss Indigenous peoples to this day. But the story also makes me happy becase Dr. Caron has become somewhat of a shining light tha Indigenous people can be, in a western way, successful which fights against a lot of stereotypes that are very present still. I think Dr. Caron's expericnes with discrimination has shaped her as a doctor in how she approaches different people, many of her clientes are Indigenous people. With this she has also talked heavily about discrimination in the medical field at big events where doctors and surgeons and overall medical workers see and hear her voice and what she has to say. What was your response on how Dr. Caron's experience with discrimination has shaped her as a doctor? Mentor 2022-10-06, 19:37: So true! I felt happy and sad as well. I think the discrimination Dr. Caron has seen and been faced with must have made a huge impact in how she approaches situations. She knows what it feels like to be judged and for people to be prejudiced against her, so she has much more knowledge and an ability to welcome people of all backgrounds. She is truly quite impressive for the barriers she's broken and for her continued advocacy. I also really liked her response to the doctor who made an innapropriate comment. The 10 second rule and then her response I found was a good tactic. The next question for you is about how your and I's different life experiences may have influenced our answers. That's quite fitting because for me, I definitely had a doctor-patient lens when I watched that video. Because I'm in medicine, I related a lot of her story and comments to interactions at the hospital. Did you relate the video to anything in your life or did you apply it to a broad range of things? Micheline Mentee 2022-10-11, 11:12: I'm tired at the moment, but I understand most of what you're saying well!!! It would also help exlplain why I am not at the same level of word using as i typically am- I applied a broad range of things. I'm close to a few Indigenous people, and related to some, because, well, Native American. So i'm well aware of the discrimation Indigenous people face. I also know people in the medical field who have had to see discrimination in the work place, so I've applied both of those to my own understanding of the subject."

I am currently studying public health at university in Vancouver, and I grew up in Victoria. When I’m not working on school, I love hiking, playing board games with my friends, and playing violin. When you’re able to respond, let me know a bit about you. Let me know if you have any questions for me about the mentorship program or about other topics and I’ll try my best to answer them! Mentor 2022-10-08, 22:20: Hey Vic, just wondering if you got my message! Hope you have a good thanksgiving :) Mentee 2022-11-24, 08:57: Hii my name is Vic I am in grade eleven. I find it interesting you want to be a doctor how long have you wanted to be one?? Also a classical musician omg I really love music and want to be in a band or composer when I get out of highschool. If that fails I guess I can work retail in some gross walmart until im forty or something. Mentor 2022-11-26, 16:08: Hey Vic! Nice to hear from you! That's so cool you want to pursue music things when you're done high school! What instrument do you play? And do you already compose?? And always good to have a backup plan :) I have a lot of friends who work as professional musicians, and most of them also do some sort of other work on the side! I'd say I only started seriously thinking about wanting to be a doctor a few years ago. I think before then I was just kind of creeped out by the more gory aspects of medicine and intimidated about the job overall. But thinking more about it and working in a doctor's office for a while made me realize that while knowledge is obviously important when you're a doctor, what really makes an interaction positive/helpful etc. with a patient is how you are able to communicate. That realization helped me be able to think of medicine as less of a scary thing and more as a job that is just all about interacting with other people!",,,,,

I graduated a couple weeks ago and just sort of forgot about your message while I was distracted by work and other things. I'm glad that you liked my composition. I haven't actually seen Interstellar or heard the music from it, but I remember my classmates telling me that it reminded them of that, along with soundtracks to video games that I haven't played. My music was mostly inspired by the early expirementation of electronic music in the 1970's, and I imagine that if I had the right software, my piece would have sounded more like that. I figure I've probably just heard enough soundtracks of random games and movies overtime to subconsciously learn how they work enough to attempt to make something like that myself. The presentation itself also went well. I had it at the perfect length, had a decent slideshow and I looked nice as well. I got a little nervous, but overall I'd say I had one of the better presentations of my small class. People liked my composition, though I could tell people weren't as interested in my passion for music, since nobody asked me any questions after the presentaion or recognized any the bands I listed as influences. I'd like to recommend you an album while I'm on the topic of my influences. If you listen the album ""The Man-Machine"" by Kraftwerk you might see where I got the idea of making a sci-fi style composition. It's a really cool album, and from a historical perspective, one of the most influential electronic albums of all time. They're a band that I wish more people knew about. Since we're wrapping up, I'd like to once again thank you for your assistance with my last-ever semester of high school. I appreciate all your advice and assistance with me as my mentor, and I'll try to continue experimenting more with music as I wait for an idea of what to do with my future. I hope you have a good summer yourself! -Cohen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
