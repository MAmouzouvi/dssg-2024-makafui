I just wanted to say it was awesome getting to chat with you and share what i've learned about moving away from home/life at uni/studying etc. You're more than welcome to keep in contact with me through this program if you have any other questions or things that you're curious about but if not, good luck with the last little bit of highschool and whatever happens beyond!! You definetly have a good idea of what you're looking for and are very passionate so wherever you end up, I'm sure you'll kill it :) Best of luck and again it was lovely meeting you! Isabella","Mentor 2024-01-18, 22:09: Hello! No worries, i hope you had a very fun break and rest from school! Im glad that the acronyms helped you out, i find that approach super useful for science related things but no sweat about trying to do 2-hour study sessions, 20 minute shorter sessions are just as good as long as they work for you. Welcome to self-care and well-being :) In the first activity we'll go over how you know when you are in need of some good self-care and things that make you happy and help to reset your rythm!",,"Mentee 2023-11-01, 14:44: Worksheet: Adulting 101 Extension Activity – Well-being &amp; Self-Care Conversation Here are some skills and responsibilities you’ll need to take on when living independently as an adult. This list is just a starting point, feel free to add to it and ask your mentor what they would add. Identify the skills you feel confident about, and which you need to work on. For the skills you are not feeling optimistic about, think of concrete things you can do right now to start building those skills. Skill/Responsibility Confident? Concrete steps to gain experience and confidence Grocery Shopping Yes! Cooking Healthy Meals Yes! House Keeping/Cleaning So so I can do it. I’m just lazy Getting Around Town - Using Public Transit Yes! Finding a Doctor, Dentist, etc. and making appointments Yes! Paying Bills (on time!) Not Yet I’ve never paid any type of bill in my entire life… maybe just like a dinner bill. Maybe just learn more about what i’m doing Doing Household Repairs/Calling for Repair Services Yes! Banking - opening an account, making e-transfers, bank draft, writing a cheque. Yes! Finding somewhere to live. Not Yet Yes! Not Yet Yes! Not Yet Honestly, I think I’ll be fine living on my own. Growing up, my parents were always working mornings to night, so I always had to fend for myself growing up. Especially with my license now, I’ve grown to be extremely independent. Since I was 14, I started making my own doctor’s and dentist appointments and with a car, my parents also make me make my own appointments for oil changes, etc. Plus, when I’m in the city for school (wherever I go) I’m not worried about transportation. Our family has houses in Vancouver and majority of times I’ve had to flown up by myself for doctors appointments. I have family there that will usually pick me up at the airport then drop me off at our house, but that’s it. They’re already busy themselves so I don’t like to bother asking for rides, so I learnt how to bus and skytrain around Vancouver. It can be scary sometimes but also nice to be able to have that independence most kids my age don’t have. (or atleast just my friends lol) What did they find surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? Can they share advice about building the skills you are not yet confident in? Mentor 2023-11-05, 17:22: Hello! That's looking like a solid skills list to me! The only things I'd comment on would be housekeeping and paying bills. I am also lazy when it comes to housekeeping when I'm with my family but I found that when I moved in with roomates, I became way more accountable for at least common areas (my rooms a different beast) just because I wanted the house to be a nice space for everyone and its also helpful if you and your roomies come up with a little schedule or delegation of chores too. In terms of paying bills, that's just something that you'll get experiance with when you're no longer living with your parents. I had never payed a single housing or utilites bill until I moved to Victoria so that is totally normal and everyone else is also going to be in the same boat! Often a lot of your bills will be combined into one so you might only need to pay one bill a month that includes your rent and utilites but things like wifi might be seperate. I've found it helpful to set up automatic autodeposits to my landlords so that I never have to worry about remebering to pay rent (I'd often forget before that which isn't ideal lol). It's also great to hear that you're feeling confident in using public transit. I know that because a lot of same towns will only have like 1 or 2 bus lines, things like the metro or the skytrain can be really daunting you've obviously got experiance with that so that's great :) For your questions: 1) What did they find surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? Hmm I didn't find anything that was super super suriprising to me because similar to you, my parents were also quite busy working so I became independent pretty quickly but one thing that I did find a bit more difficult at the begining was how to grocery shop and meal prep for myself (like how much food I needed to buy, how to get the most out of my dishes etc.). But that skill just came with a lot of practice and also just building up a recipe reperitoire. 2) Can they share advice about building the skills you are not yet confident in? Practice! Put yourself in situations that you're not completely comfortable with because the only way to learn and get better at things is to actually do them: example: I am really bad and afraid of driving in the city because I've proabaly only done it five times in my life - if i actually drove more in the city then I would get way better at it and feel more confident (I also don't have a car which contributes to this problem) And also ask other people for help or advice if you're not sure about how to go about something alone. This is something that I found to be really when I was looking to learning about differetn savings account and how to invest my money. Let me know if you have any other questions and if not we can starting looking at the budgetting activity which I think is actually really useful and something that I still have to do currently because I'm not great with my money :( Mentee 2023-11-07, 22:07: Funding Your Future Conversation: Budgeting Worksheet, adapted from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada) Expenses (where you’re spending your money) Expense $ per month $ per year Rent/mortgage payments + insurance/residence fees UBC Housing: Winter Session Contract Date of Acceptance: $1,050.00 September Due: $3,542.55 January Due: $2,676.45 (My parents got this one) $7,269.00 Utilities (hydro, gas, electricity, internet, cable etc.) Comes with UBC housing N/A Cell phone $89 (according to my mom) - parents $1,068.00 Groceries Would I need groceries if I had a meal plan?

My guess is just the $4,200.00 from my part-time job that I hopefully acquire. Did you have a part-time job while in your first year of university? And were there any challenges for you with work and school if you did have one? If and when you did try to go out with your friends, did you find you did it often and spent a ton of money, or was it easy to stay in and not spend money? Mentor 2023-11-09, 21:14: Hello! Ok your budget worksheet looks great and pretty much covers everything! The only thing I can think of would be is tuition costs which is around 3000-4000$ a semester depending on the number of classes you take and what uni you're at. Tuition might also cover your student gym pass and bus-pass but i'd have to double check that. For food, when I lived in residence at UVic I never really needed to buy ""groceries"" but I'd often spend (probably too much money) on campus food that wasn't part of the meal plan - things like coffee, study snacks or on the weekend I'd maybe treat myself to food that wasn't from the cafeteria. For the section on debt repayments, you kinda got this right because it's hard to predict what that can look like. But usually this is money that people have borrow as a part of their students loans if they are a student and need help paying tuition/rent/food/textbooks. Since it looks like your parents are going to be covering the bigger expences (residence, meal plan) then you probably won't have debt right now! I have worked part-time during my 4th and 5th years of uni but not during my first. I kinda wanted to get settled in a new town and was afraid that I would get overwhelemed with schoolwork and a job but it's definetly do-able. I'd recommend seeing how school goes in the first semester and then if you're feeling like you want to take on more (or have an income:) then try and get one! Sometimes it can be a bit harder if you're in a science program because a lot of the classes come with additional labs but you just gotta see what works for you. So I am not great about spending money because I'm always trying to save more/spend less but then I get ropped into going out, or I see something that want to buy so I've found it really helpful to make my own budgetting sheets in excel to make sure that at least a part of any money that I make goes directly into savings so that I can't touch it. So I've gotten wayyy better at not spending a lot when I go out but especailly when I had just moved to victoria, I wanted to get to know the city, try different restaurants, activities etc. so I definitely did spend more than I am now. Also because I was coming from a small town to a larger city, I found that a lot of the events and shows were more pricey in general too. Luckily a lot of my friends are also pretty budget-concious so we kinda keep eachother on track when we go out as well. Actually one place where a lot of my money goes it buying coffees when I'm out or on campus because in my head I'm like ""oh its only $4"" but if you do that like 3 times a week then that's around 50$ a month so what I started doing is making sure that I was brining coffee or tea from home when I would go to campus to try and cut down on my spending. I hope that any of this has been helpful - do you find that you're pretty good with your money usually or something have trouble keeping track of it? Mentee 2023-11-13, 11:42: Thank you! I think I’m better now with my money than I was last year, especially since I have to basically live on my own next year. I’m not amazing with my money still but my spending habits that revolved around clothing are better now. Last year I was clothing-hungry. I’d spend the majority of my paycheck at Aritzia, lululemon, and every boutique ever. I would use my paychecks and my dad’s card, (sorry Dad). It was so bad that I was probably buying something every second day and getting packages in every week. Not even just shop for clothes, I would order out and get Starbucks all the time, smh. I was definitely terrible with my money and was not money-conscious. Now, I’ve reduced my online shopping to zero because I definitely do not need any more clothes, and my takeout has been reduced to a minimum, especially when I’m trying to eat healthier. It’s nice to eat homecooked meals and know what’s going in my food now, and it’s a lot cheaper too. Starbucks isn’t an issue now; I try to avoid caffeine because it doesn’t make me feel good. I also work at a coffee shop and get drinks for free, so don’t worry about paying $7. I hated budgeting in school. I try to avoid Excel at all costs. When saving my paycheck, I just put in ¾ of my pay in my savings, and the rest is free to use for whatever. My town is small and has little to do here, so my friend and I cruise around and watch movies very often. That ¼ of my pay will likely go to gas, movie tickets, and popcorn. (My friend and I do watch movies at home to save money, but once there’s a new horror movie out, we’ll def be at the theatres.) Questions! Are there kitchens at the university? Some do and some don’t I heard.. With the meal plan, what can you get with it? How many classes did you have to take, choosing biochemistry as a major? Did you think your first couple of years at university go by pretty fast? Mentor 2023-11-16, 09:07: Haha yeah lululemon and aritzia will definitely be the death of a paycheque :( Sounds like things money-wise are going better though and putting away 3/4 of your pay is a great strategy, I usually only put away 30-40% into savings so maybe I'll try and and bump that up a little bit! Answers to your questions! 1. There might be a kitchen depending on what kind of residence you stay in. In classic dorms it's usually just a room with a bed and a dresser and a desk - in the common areas there'll be a microwave and sink probably but less likely that there would be a stove. If you are in housing that's a bit more independent or live with 3+ people, then they would likely give you a kitchen. I had a few friends who lived in 4 person housing at UVic which was just four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a kitchen. I think it is nice if you have specific dietary restrictions because then you don't have to worry about the caf food but I was in a solo dorm and loved not having to cook my own meals or grocery shop :( 2. Usually the meal plan will cover three meals a day from the cafeteria from move-in day to the end of exams. For me, the money that I'd pay each semester for my meal plan would just go into a UVic account and then as I ""bought"" meals they would take money out of that account. I think some universities might be on an all you can eat meal plan (?) but I'm not 100% sure what UBC uses. At UVic, there is a main cafeteria building with different sections where you can different types of food (vegetarian, burgers, shawarma, pasta etc.) and you just walk around with your tray and order at whichever place you want. They also have tons of grab and go food and drinks as well which also comes out of your meal plan money. I love food and get very snacky, especially when studying so I would run out my meal plan and have to add around 50-100$ onto my account at the end of each semester. 3. For biochemistry, it was set up so that you would take 5 classes a semester in order to graduate in 4 years. That was pretty overwhelming for me so I opted to take 4 classes a semester which I liked better but a lot of my friends stuck with 5. Just depends on your stamina/ study-life balance preference! The great thing too is that you can drop classes after you have started so if you sign up for 5 in your first semester but then find that 5 might be too many, you can always drop one or two! Depending how early you drop in the semester, you can get 100% of your money back for that class too. I took 4 classes a semester until my fourth year when I started doing five (but I'd often take 2-3 classes in the summer too) Mentee 2023-11-16, 13:19: Did you enjoy living in your dorm by yourself? Or did you wish you had a roommate? That is actually crazy taking five classes a day. At my school right now, we’ve just implemented the semester system again since covid and it’s not even the normal type of semester system. We have three days of four classes and two days of only two classes. (My school system’s praying on my downfall) .. Do you having any tips for me to be able to create a good school-life balance? Its been two and a half months into the school year and I feel as if I still haven’t adjusted to the new system. In grade nine, I had the quad system with one class a day, then the quarter system in grade ten and eleven. Mentor 2023-11-16, 19:44: Sorry I just saw that missed your last question - YES 100% university flyyysss by! You get a long summer (end of April to September) which is so nice and your classes will be done around the beginning of December and then exams run until around the 20th of December BUT if you don't have any exams or maybe your teacher made them in November, then you get a month off for Christmas! So that layout along with the pace of courses makes everything go by super fast. i really liked living in a single room, I'm the kind of person who needs their own space to just be able to chill so that's what I préférer but if your super social and or want to save some money (double rooms are cheaper) then a roommate might be the way to go! It can always be a bit of a gamble in terms of who your roommate is but it's definitely an individual preference kind of thing. In my head I was like it's nice to have my own space that I can decorate how I want and relax in an if I want to hang with people then I can just go to their room to hang out! i should probably say thats it's not 5 classes a day hahha (that would actually kill me) but 5 classes a semester. So what that means is that you have 3hrs of each class a week. Usually you would either have a class twice a week for an hour and a half or three times a week for 50 minutes (sometimes classes would be once a week and three hours long). What that meant for me is that I would usually have one or two classes a day (plus labs) every week. That's rough that they keep switching up the class structure on you :( for me in high school it was usually the semester system so four classes a semester I think? Yeah work life balance is honestly so tough, I'm still try to work on that one. A good place to start is maybe having specific time of the day or days of the week where you don't allow yourself to do schoolwork: like take Sunday off or say that you can't study past 9pm. You might find it super easy or super difficult to maintain that balance depending on your workload. Sometimes when I took five classes a semester I would end up with more free time than taking four harder classes. I think you also have to try and keep things in perspective too. Often I'd get really stressed about trying to make all my assignments perfect or putting too much time into something that wasn't worth that much of my grade when in reality it might not be worth the stress or your energy. I'm not saying just don't do small assignment or try hard but sometimes it's ok to say I need a break right now and honestly this extra 5% of my grade might not be worth it. Top tip: plan fun things to do with yourself or your friends and stick too it! I have loved university but there definitely times where I wished that I was a bit more chill and just enjoyed being around amazing people and living in a cool new city on my own! Mentee 2023-11-16, 21:27: Good to know that it’s not five classes a day; I’d die. Do you get to pick what days your classes are? Or if they’re in the day or night? Thank you for all your tips; they’ll help next year when I am rotting in my dorm with seven thousand cups of ramen surrounding me. Is it okay if we move on to strategic studying? Mentor 2023-11-16, 22:12: Haha gotta love the ramen days - some classes have a few different slots that you can pick from or you might be able to choose if you class is Monday &amp; Thursday vs Tuesday/Wed/Friday; usually a lot of required first year classes have a few different times since there's so many people that take them which is nice because you can personalize your schedule! Yup I'll unlock strategic studying Here's a screenshot of what my schedule looked like for a semseter in second year for reference (4 classes) - looks like it won't let me paste and send a picture so i just threw it in canva: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0ZqLYTJg/u6Yzlxr8vwAX1hMdwCZZPQ/edit?utm_content=DAF0ZqLYTJg&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=sharebutton",,,,"Mentee 2023-11-17, 14:50: I don't know if you think your schedule's crazy, but looking at it, I'd die. Having back-to-back classes is so crazy, I think I'd go insane. In between your 10:30am to your afternoon, do you study and do more work? or do you give yourself a break? I’m going to be so for real; I suck at studying. I have a terrible habit of re-reading and re-writing old material. I’m also addicted to my phone, so I’ll go on my phone every two minutes and never get anything done. Since you’ve had to take multiple biology and many science classes, what helped you study, and what methods worked best? Mentor 2023-11-20, 09:02: Yeah the three long classes back to back wasn't ideal but I think that's the only time I've had it that way thank god. What was nice was that I got to get them all over at once and then have a (hopefully) chiller rest of the week. Usually i would just stay on campus until around 4-5 after my 10:30 am class and just hang out in the library until my lab or dinner time - I always know that when I go home I'll get nothing done so I try and bring lunch to campus so that I can stay later and get some studying done. A lot of my friends would go home in between classes but it was about a 20 minute bus ride for me each way so I'd try to stick it out on campus! That's ok that you don't really know how to study! I think that it's a very personal thing and takes a bit of playing around with to figure out what works for you - i don't think I figured it out until probably halfway through second year tbh. I will say that because I was in a lot of biology and chemistry classes, there was a lot of memorizing so I would make flashcards as my way of studying. The professors would post the pdf of what the class slides would be and then in class, I'd type my own notes on the pdf as the prof was lecturing. Later on, I'd then sit down with my classes notes and the slides and turn all of the important info into flashcards ideally a week before there was any exam. Then I'd go through all the cards about 3-4 times before feeling confident! This took me s bit to get the hang of but it definitely payed off in the end. A few of my other friends would make flashcards but the majority would just write notes and then either rewrite their notes and reread them a bunch or do ""cornel notes"" (if you're interested maybe look up some examples of this because they're pretty handy too!). in your first year just try out a few different things until you find what works for you! The phone thing is super tough because I'm the same way :/ what I did to get around this was using the app ""forest"" where you grow different plants by setting timers - if you leave the forest app while your time is still growing then you plants dies :(( this worked great for me and my friends also got it and we'd have competitions to see who could grow the most plants haha which helped. Mentee 2023-11-20, 14:48: Oooh, that sounds cool; I’ll definitely try that app out! Thank you. In uni, do you find that your final tests are very different than your notes? I feel like I wasted so much time studying the wrong things. My teacher likes to throw in random questions on things we haven’t even learned. I try the whole active recall method and it kind of helps, but I think my main issue is not knowing what to study. Oops I accidently sent this in the wrong subject.. Mentor 2023-11-20, 17:42: Of course, it's super cute! You can also look back over time to see all the plants that you've grown and it make a little forest :) I'll try and send some screenshots of mine ooo that's such a tough question, I'd say that the tests were a bit more repetitive in terms of what we learned in classes in first and second year (and what the profs said would be on the exam) and a lot more of the exams were multiple choice - in upper years things were a bit different, sometimes you'd have to design experiments based on other experiments that' you'd learned about in class, there were more long answer questions that would ask you to predict the outcomes of different scenarios and stuff like that. I think most profs will have a range of questions so some being just direct memorization of something from class combined with other harder questions that get you to use what you've learned in class to make predictions about similar concepts if that makes sence? A large part of it is also figuring it how different profs like to test because it's really different class to class. Going and looking up your proffs on ratemyprof.com cab be helpful because people will often talk about whether or not they think that tests/assignments were easy or not stuff like that! Other than that they'll sometimes give practice or example test questions to guide your studying too. yeah I've definitely had the same issue where I don't know what to study so I just end up studying everything and often that's not a great use of my time :( in first year biology I did find that most of the material that you learn about in lecture is fair game for the tests so sometime in the end you do have tostudy everything which can feel like a lot right off the bat but you're gonna by using and applying the same concepts throughout your entire degree so if you learn them early, it helps you out later! Sorry that was so long but here's a summary of what I think helps: 1. Try to write your notes in your own words and not just re-copy lecture slides (or just make them interesting through adding different colours or pictures) 2. Play around with different studying times eg. focused for 20min, 5min phone time, 20min focused and so forth 3. Go to office hours for your profs to ask questions or even just listen to what other people are asking 4. Figure out how to stay off your phone when studying (or else it's gonna take you 1000 times longer to get it done) whether that's locking it in a different room or using an app! Mentee 2023-11-23, 13:07: Sorry for the next bomb of questions, Do you find it better to study outside your dorm, or is it too distracting there? And if you did go out to the cafés or libraries, would you spend a lot of money on coffee and food? How often did you study and find time to do other things? I feel like time goes by really fast, and when I get home from school, it’s already dark out, and the next thing I know, it’s eight at night. Especially with so many classes, how did you stay organized and maintain a balanced schedule for other class assignments? Mentor 2023-11-26, 14:25: I actually found it easier to study outside my dorm - usually I'd go to the llibrary to do most of my work becuase they had a lot of little cublicles that were great for doing work in. They are have a no talking floor which a lot of my friends preferred to use because it was honestly dead silent (sometimes so quiet that I'd get self-concious about how loud i was breathing haha). When I would try and study in my dorm, I would usually just end up watching Netflix or eating a bunch of snacks so I never got much done there :( Even when I moved off campus after first year, I'd still often go to the univeristy library to study so that I wasn't distracted by stuff at home. I also found it nice to do the majority of studying on campus so when I'd come home, I'd just get to relax for the most part. I did try going to cafes as well which I did enjoy but I definitely would spend a tonnnnn of money on coffee and snacks when I was out - I did start trying to only buy drip coffee instead of espresso to save money since they're like half the price. When going to campus, I'd usually make myself a tea or coffee that I would bring with me and most locations would have a hot water machine so I'd bring extra tea bags to make tea throughout the day :) Compared to a lot of people I know, I probably studied a bit more - because I knew when I started univeristy that I wanted to go into medicine, I wanted to make sure that I had competitive grade so I went a little overkill. Usually I'd get to campus around 7:30-8 (I'd go to the gym before class) and I'd have class at either 8:30 or 9:30am and then my last class would end around 12:30 or 1. So in between classes i'd always just grad food and study until my next class but when things were busy in the semester, I'd try and stay on campus until5 or 6pm studying and then go home so that when I got home even if it was a bit later, I already had put in a few good hours of work. After dinner i'd usually study until about 9 or 10 and then go to bed! I think the best thing that you can do to make sure that you're studying efficently and productively is to stay on campus as long as you can even if you don't have many classes because at least for me, when I get home i loose all motivation to do work and I just want to watch tv or go to bed rip. In terms of stay ontop of everything, you gotta figure out what works for you but i really like puting everything into my apple calendar. At the begining of the semester, for each class your prof with give you a syllabus which will have the date of every test/assignment due date (except the final which gets decided later by the university) and so I would but every due date for the semester in my calander and then make it so that I would get a reminder 1 week before the due date and then 1 day before the due date. At the one week reminder, if it was test, I would start studying then so that it wouldn't be super rushed/stressful. I found that this worked great for me, and I never missed any due dates; some of my friends would use physical agendas or even get those big poster calendars that you can put on your wall and write out deadlines on those - all just depends on what works best for you! Mentee 2023-12-04, 14:06: Hi Isabella, sorry for the late response. (Ms. Ling is constantly giving us more work everyday). We’re definitely the same regarding productivity in and out of our rooms. I don’t know if it’s the same since you only have one space, but I also find it hard to do anything in my room. – With studying, how do you balance the amount of content and know how much to study in one sitting? In biology, my teacher just gave us a pile of new content that we need to memorize for next Friday, and I have no idea how to study and memorize it all in ten days. (We’re learning more in-depth about the digestive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems right now.) Do you have any tips for studying these body systems? Mentor 2023-12-07, 08:45:  Mentor 2023-12-07, 17:39: Whoops looks like mine was just blank here's what I meant to send: Oof I’m sorry to hear that, I’m guessing the teachers are trying to pack it in before the winter break :( Hmm good question, I guess I probably look over all the content that I know I need to cover and then divide it up over home many days I have until the test (making sure that I’ll have enough time to go over everything about three times - after trial and error this works best for my brain). You also have to figure out how long you can study for before your brain needs a break, for my I usually do 1-2 hours at a time but a lot of people do shorter chunks of time too. I think one of my favourite ways that helps me memorize information is the “Spaced Learning Method”. Basically one week before I have an exam I’ll start reading over all of my notes, I’ll often read them out loud. The next day I’ll go over the material again but instead of rereading, I’ll cover up parts of my notes and try and quiz myself. Then I’ll let one day go past before quizzing myself again, this way the information starts becoming a part of my long term memory instead of short term - here’s a link that’ll explain it better and there a bunch of videos that you can check out as well! https://www.oxfordlearning.com/what-is-spaced-practice/ Yeah great question! It’s so typical of biology to have to remember a ton of stuff :( I’d say first off make sure you give yourself a good amount of time to study. I’m not sure what information you guys have to learning - maybe things like all the digestive enzymes in the intestine? Either way when you have to remember things like a bunch of enzymes or a sequence of events, I find it really helpful to use meumonic devices - like taking the first letter from each word to make an acronym or phrase: Say you want to remember the order esophagus, cardiac sphincter, stomach, pyloric sphincter Using that method that would be: ECSP So you could either just remember ECSP or make a phrase like “Every Cat Scratches Posts” (just can up with that off the top of my head, plz no judgment haha). One of my teachers had a great way for remembering the order of the small intestine regions which are duodenum, jejunum, and ileum - “just remember, the DJ always gets the party started” So using tricks like that is really helpful and you can also easily look up helpful meumonic for whatever body system you’re trying to learn if you don’t want to come up with them yourself :) Mentee 2024-01-15, 14:58: Hi Isabella, I hope you had a great holiday this winter break. Sorry for the month late response but it’s definitely been a crazy last month and a half. I took your advice on trying to use acronyms to help study and I think It helped because my test mark was a lot better than I expected. It definitely helped when trying to remember organs in certain body systems! I also tried to bust down to 2-hour study sessions but.. Personally, i can only do 30 minutes before i get distracted. Thank you for all your tips, but i’m getting sick of talking about studying. Can we open up well-being and self-care?",,"Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:41: Hi Isabella, Here is my 3 photos about me. https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvHIECWf4/s_Rb8xfXgi9jubhxQ1VKWA/view?utm_content=DAFvHIECWf4&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink Mentor 2023-09-24, 18:11: Hey Anna! Thank you so much for the collage I absolutely love it - I'm also a big reader and love travelling as well so it is really cool to see that you like those as well. My parents work pretty much 24/7 so when I was stilling living with them it would be hard to have any family time so travelling was a great way to hang out as a family while also exploring the world. It also very cool that you've discovered a love of reading, I think its such a great and very underrated activity. Do have anything that you're reading right now that you've been liking? I really like fantasy books too and have recently been reading the Red Rising series which have been amazing!! Would highly recommend :) You inspired me to also make a collage (its not very aesthetiacally pleasing) but here's the link to mine: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvIpM68DQ/yNULgMmFnFaxMyFidnBB0A/edit?utm_content=DAFvIpM68DQ&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=sharebutton It looks like your teacher wants us to work through ""From rural to urban"", ""career exploration"", ""adulting"" and then two cataegories of your choice, let me konw you are especailly interested in any of those and we can start with it! Mentee 2023-10-20, 16:11: Hi Isabella! Sorry, I haven't gotten back in a while; things have been crazy with school. (It's funny I say that, but I'm sure university is much more stressful). I loved your college. That's awesome that you've traveled to Europe. Crossing my fingers, I can convince my family to go this summer. I have not read the Red Rising, but I will gladly add it to my tbr list! I haven't been able to read much with school, but my latest read was Still Beating by Jennifer Hartmann, and I loved it so much I couldn't stop crying for days. I just finished and sent the first part to rural to urban so maybe we'll just start there, but I don't think I get much choice in what order i want to go in. Mentee 2023-10-27, 16:17: That’s so cool, I’m sure you’ll get into their medical program. Have you ever been to the UBC campus? I’m sure schooling must be different at university in victoria than high school but did you ever find that you were at a disadvantage with your education coming from a smaller town? Or see it challenging to keep up with the school at university? Part 2: Growing up, my parents would take an annual trip to Vancouver to visit family and, I guess just to get away from the small town for a bit. When I was younger, I loved the big city. There was always something to do, somewhere new to eat, the Skytrain, and they’re always so many different and new faces. Now when I go, I just want to leave or just not be in the city for periods longer than 4 days. It might be because I've been so many times, but I honestly don’t like how crazy busy it is. I’m so used to being able to get from one destination to the other in less than 10 minutes that I hate the non-stop traffic there. I say this now, but my number one dream school is UBC. I hope since it’s kind of segregated in Vancouver that it might help me progressively move into the big city life. I mean, seventy-five thousand is a significant number to thirteen thousand but it's better than Vancouver's eight hundred thousand population. What are some advantages and challenges of city life? What are some things you can do to get acquainted with life in a new city? Mentee 2023-11-16, 13:20: Whoops I meant octa system in gr nine.. Mentee 2023-11-20, 14:47: Oooh, that sounds cool; I’ll definitely try that app out! Thank you. In uni, do you find that your final tests are very different than your notes? I feel like I wasted so much time studying the wrong things. My teacher likes to throw in random questions on things we haven’t even learned. I try the whole active recall method and it kind of helps, but I think my main issue is not knowing what to study.","Mentee 2023-10-20, 15:58: Rural to Urban My community has shaped me in differents ways from disfunctional to giving me a sense of belonging here. I can’t elaborate, you’re just going to have to trust me on that. Anyways there’s definitely some benefits to living in Prince Rupert but there are also some major disadvantages living here. Living in a smaller area allows to build long lasting friendships. Not saying you can’t in the city but it’s nice to have a friend from the times you are walking out of the womb together. Familiar faces are always nice too. Being able to go anywhere and everywhere and not feeling alone. Being in grade 12, I can confidently say I know majority or the students in the school. Everyones basically friends with everyone and it’s fun being friends with everyone in your grade, makes your last year more enjoyable. That’s like the only part I like about the small community. Now.. One major challenge my community faces is the education system. In a rural area, our education is slacking big time. With constant teacher shortages and lack of funding our school systems going down hill.. About Where I Live: It’s a small town with a population around twelve thousand people. There’s around 600 students in my school majority being grade nines I swear. (They’re literally taking up the hallways) There is absolutely nothing you can do here in Rupert. If you wanted to do something with your friends it would probably cruising around town or going for a walk. It’s sad :( My extracurriculars was dance but I quit because after a year of merged studios I didn’t enjoy it anymore. (Miss my studio) Now, i enjoy going to the gym after schools. There are some clubs but not many students join them… small town things i guess. Our towns special because of the hella loaded port! I’m just kidding.. Or am I? Finee I’m just playing. Our town’s special because of the beautiful ocean beside us. We have a cute town. Not like victoria cute but the naturey kind of cute. Nice trails to walk, the views, and the deep culture aspect. A strength i’ve learned was just to be reliable and punctual as a student and a worker. The effects of not showing on time or not at all, not only doesn’t affect me but can affect the community. Everyone plays a role to help keep the community running here so I guess that’s something i’ve learned about oliving in a small town. Will benefit me in a way to hopefully make it to my university classes on time ! Not only do we have a shortage of teachers, we also have a shortage of doctors and healthcare workers in general. My hope for my future is to become some sort of doctor and hope to come back to Prince Rupert and work here for a portion of my life. Not saying that’s going to make any major difference here but I’m hoping I can come back and make a bit of change. Mentor 2023-10-26, 21:20: Hey Anna! No worries about the late response, i 100% understand that life/school can get hectic and overwhelming. Thank you so much for sharing about Prince Rupert, your experiances there and what you've taken away from them. Although I haven't visited there before, the small town aspects of it definitly sound similar to my home town of Nelson which was around 10 000 people in population. So I lived in Nelson for 18 years before coming to Victoria to go to Uvic. I felt a lot of the same things that you talk about when I think about my time in Nelson. It was very special to be able to be part of such a tight-knit community and you really do build some beautiful friendships and connections with others. Its also a great place ot be if you love the outdoor ebcause we have incredible skiing, mountain biking, iking etc. Similar to prince rupert, we have a lot of issues: we lack doctors and our high school seems to also be going downhill becuase there aren't any teachers to teach there :( Because of the doctor shortage (and because medicine is so cool to me) I've applied to the UBC medical program and am just waiting to hear back from them about if i'll get interviewed for a position there! There also really isn't that much in terms of higher education in a small town which is hard because that means you have to leave to pursue more formal education which can be scary and sometimes loney especially going from a small community to something the size of Vancouver which is a crazy size change. While leaving my home was a massive shift, Victoria is a bit of a special place because even though it is much larger, it has a similar community structure to that of a small town so a lot of small town kids end up there because its still a large centre with more opportunities, more things to do but you still form a nice community there :) Is there anything in particular that you are interested in terms of city living, things that make you nervous or that you're excited for? Please feel free to ask me anything that you're wondering about! -Isabella Mentee 2023-10-27, 16:19: That’s so cool, i’m sure you’ll get into their medical program.

What are some things you can do to get acquainted to life in a new city? Mentor 2023-10-28, 10:49: Thank you! I'm super excited (but also terrified haha) to see how the med applications goes - I should know in December if they'll interview me so ill let you know what happens! I have been to the UBC campus once it's about 4-5 times the size of the UVic student body - it's definitely big and takes a while to walk across but from what I saw, there's a lot of cool things going on there and because it really is it's own little city, it might be a nice way to ease into city living. Yeah university in Victoria is definitely different then high school in Nelson! What I noticed most was just that you have some much more flexibility in your days in uni: you pick your course and often there's a few different options so you can choose what time of day you want to take them. Depending on your schedule youo might only be in lecture for 2-3 hours one day and then have the rest of the day off which is really nice because then you can leave campus, meet up with people or study (often me). And because the semesters are shorter (Sept.- first week of December) everything goes by really quickly because usually your classes are done the first week of Dec. and then it's just two weeks of final exams but if you don't have any exams or if they say are all done by the 15th, then you're done early! in terms of diasadvantages coming from a rural high school, I would say that one main one would probably be the fact that smaller high schools aren't able to provide the range of classes or higher level classes that you'd get at a big city high school so you might not have seen some of the material that other kids have when you're in first year uni. So they might be at a bit of an adavantage but honesty that usually goes away in second year. I was also super lucky to have been able to take some AP course at high school when I was there (sadly no longer offered :( but I know that's not the case for a lot of people coming from small towns. University is definitely a different style of learning and testing because you're completely responsible for how hard you study so there's a lot of self motivation involved if you want to get higher grades but it just takes a little bit of getting used to and then you're totally ok and suddenly you're almost done your degree! Other than that, I would say that maybe the act of having to move away from your family is also a bit of a disadvantage compared to city kids. You know they often can live at home (don't have to worry about rent, food) and are in a city that they already know with their family but that's sad,y not usually an option for rural kids. For me, i am so so happy that I moved to Victoria because there was a nothing for me in Nelson anymore when I gradded high school but I do still sometimes look at kids my age who never had to leave their town to go to uni and think how it must be nice to have your family right there, and not have to go through some of the stress that switches cities can cause. But at the end of the day no regrets and a lot of people I know who also came from rural towns feel the same way :) Sorry this is so long! I completely understand how you feel about Vancouver! It's a fun place to visit because it's new and big and exciting but it also gets very overwhelming too. I'm actually living in Vancouver right now doing an 8 month internship at a therapeutics biotech company in Vancouver and although the city has a lot of offer, I think it's definitely too big me for and I'm excited to go back to Victoria (also less rain haha). part 2: Advantages if city life! For sure the fact that there's more opportunities here, especially for things like jobs but also just in terms of stuff to do (shows, events, shopping, culture etc.) and people to meet. Bigger university's also usually way more programs and specialized programs if that's something that you're looking for (medicine, dentistry, criminology and stuff like that). Challenges: getting around because it's so much bigger it takes you longer to get places, rent is often more expensive (especially Vancouver) and it can be a lonely place. But some things that I've found that are helpful is trying to join groups or clubs so that I can meet people who know the city and can show me around, this is why it's nice to move to a city for university because you'll make friends at uni and as a group you can all go out and explore to get more familiar with the city. Other than that, I would just say take it one day at a time! Some days might be more overwhelming but as time goes on, you'll get more and more comfortable and before you know it, you'll be a big city kid! Let me know if you've got any other questions about rural to urban things and if not I can unlock the ""Adulting"" section and we can dive into that :) enjoy the weekend! Mentee 2023-10-30, 14:20: Do you find that even though you may only have a 2-3 hour lecture that you get lots of free time. Like with hours of studying do you find a bit of time to hangout with friends or go out? Also with such short semester, Did you find that there was a lot of professors cramming the stuff you had to learn. I’m just thinking back to my freshman year of highschool where we had one class a day for five weeks and our teachers had to cram every unit. We barely had time to digest what we were learning because we were always moving on. Definitely sucks in that area with education. My school offers a very limited range of classes and definitely not AP classes. (I wish) Even with the different ranges of knowledge at universities, are professors as understanding knowing that everyone came from different educational backgrounds? Thanks Isabella, I think that’s all i have for questions! Ready for the adulting unit. Mentor 2023-10-30, 21:53: It definetly depends, sometimes in the middle of the semester it can get pretty busy and I'll won't have a lot of time to hang out with people but that all sorta depends on how hard your classes are, how many you're taking etc. I'd say that sometimes you gotta buckle down for some of the busier weeks but overall there I've still been able to find time for myself/friends/going out - many of my friends also go to UVic with me so if we're not able to go out one weekend we'll often study together or something like that so that we get stuff done while seeing eachother too! Because the semester is short, things do move quicker for sure and thats something that you'll get used to - proffs also give you the syllabus at the begining of the semester which has the date of every assignment/test that will be happening so you know right off the bat how fast you'll need to work on class material. Uni courses are also built to be delivered at this pace so it should be managable compared to the highschool condensed situation. I will say that often universities will ofter condensed versions of classes in the summer, and for some of the more content heavy courses that can get overwhelming but normally courses aren't structured like that! Yeah, i'd say that proffesors are overall understanding that people come from different background as well as different times in their lives because some people are coming back to school after taking years off. Proffs do for the most-part treat you more independently which means that if you're struggling or finding the content harder to follow than you expected, its up to you to come to them for help. What a lot of teachers do is hold office hours where 1-2 times a week there's schdeduled times for students to drop by their office and ask questions/get help on specific topics which is really helpful and a great place to work with you proff if you are feeling like you're falling behind. There's definietely good proffs and bad proffs but espeically in first year, they know that you're going through a big transition and getting used to the way that univeristy runs and are often happy to try and help you out :) in third and fourth year classes they'd expect you to be at a similar level to other students in your year. Hope this helps and i'll unlock the adulting unit!",,,,

I am opening the ""Adulting"" module so you can begin to work on it. Let's start by identifying some skill you feel confident with and some you can improve on. Mentor 2023-11-22, 15:14: It's nice to hear from you again Austyn. I hope you are doing well. Thank you for reflecting on some of the things you can work on. Next for the adulting unit, attempt to tackle some of the 'discussion questions.' For example, how are you feeling about the responsibilities you will need to take on as an adult? Do you think you’re ready?",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-20, 18:36: Hi Austyn. My name is Brendan. It is nice to meet you. A bit about myself... I am a third-year university student at the University of British Columbia. I study biology and chemistry. On your profile, it says you are looking to do a trade maybe. Let me know if you have questions about the application processes for post-secondary, my experiences at post-secondary, the transition from rural to urban, etc. I am more than happy to help! I see that you're Indigenous, as well. I am also a member of an Indigenous community in BC. I also grew up in a rural community. I am more than happy to talk about this aspect of my life and how it influences me. I enjoy harvesting traditional foods and talking to my family members about my culture. Of course, connecting with my culture is difficult because I now live in a big city. However, finding spaces that have Indigenous people is significant for me. I also do not think you're being shallow by saying you're proud of being brown. You should be proud of your Indigenous identity. It will influence all aspects of your life. I also think you will be able to find a job that allows you to follow your passions. Aside from school, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, playing basketball, and enjoying the outdoors (hiking, biking, etc.). I see one of the things you're interested in is games. I used to play a lot of FIFA and NBA 2K when I was younger. If you'd like to tell me a bit more about yourself, please do. Whenever you have questions, please let me know. We can do any of the optional icebreaker activities if you'd like. Once you reply, we can open the 'From Rural to Urban' module, which Ms Ling said needs to be opened first. Mentee 2023-09-28, 13:19: hey how are ya brenden, i dont know what to message but it says i need to send you a message to unlock the units, i hope that i can learn something from this program that will help me out in finding a career, and that i will maybe learn some lessons or something that can help me be a better or more understanding person Mentor 2023-09-28, 14:20: Hi Austyn, I am unsure if you were able to see my introductory message. If you click ""In activity Start Here,"" you can scroll down to my first message. In the meantime, I will open the first unit ""From Rural to Urban."" Mentee 2023-11-20, 14:48: hello brendan, sorry for not messaging lately ive lowkey forgot about this mentorship thing, i would like to start the adulting module by saying that i dont really make good decisions i am very impulsive and i need to learn to make better decisions in the heat of the moment.","Mentor 2023-09-28, 14:30: Here is the first unit. The warm-up activity is optional, and I will still share my thoughts. I am fond of both rural and urban living, both have their advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of rural living for me is being close to nature and not having so many people around. For urban living, I like how there are many restaurant options, and Amazon deliveries are quick. We can start the first lesson once you have time to think about the warm-up activity. To get us started, about 20,000 people lived in my hometown growing up. High school students enjoyed playing sports and hanging out with friends. One thing that makes my hometown special is that being so close to water means that fishing is easy. Mentor 2023-10-11, 08:59: Hello Austyn. Are you able to see that I've opening the Rural to Urban module?",,,,

What are some things you enjoy from living in a more rural area? I would love to know! Hmmm I think for now, my guilty pleasure is the show Manifest on Netflix--it's so confusing and cheesy but I can't stop watching it lol and I love watching those rich house tours too!! They're so satisfying! I have received a notification from your teacher that we should be wrapping up this unit and moving on to the next by the end of this week.

I just wanted to open up the ""wrapping up"" activity to formally say thank you for being so engaged during the program and really making the most of each module. It was a pleasure being your mentor and I wish you the best in post-secondary. Please feel free to message me on the platform even after the program is done/during university if you have any questions. Thank you!!! :) Mentee 2024-01-19, 15:45: Hi Fermin! I want to formally thank you for everything you’ve done with this activity. You were always very engaging, and helpful with all the questions I had. You gave me insights to so many things relating to university that I probably wouldn’t had known until then if I had not “met” you. Speaking of meeting each other, I know that it was quite weird hearing this concept of ReMBC at the start where I get to talk to someone but don’t know who they actually are and plus we were told to figure out time management because of how busy university students are. Despite this, thank you so much for being my mentor and this is definitely an experience I won’t forget about. Good luck and I wish you the best on your future endeavours. Who knows, we might come across each other in the future :). But nonetheless, thank you!!!! for the shared experience in the last 2 and a half months. Until we meet again. Nicolo","Mentor 2023-11-20, 15:33: Welcome to the ""Well being and self care"" module! I'm aware you're more keen on discussing school/work-life balance in this module, so let's start with that! Otherwise, we can dive into the module activities if you've changed your mind. :) Mentee 2023-11-24, 16:10: Hi Fermin! I want to use this unit to talk about balancing the workload that come with university. If you could give me an insight on how you tackle your day such as attending classes, then doing schoolwork, and maybe if you have work that day. Perhaps, how do you manage your energy levels with such a busy schedule? I ask this question because as someone that works in the pharmacy after school in some days, I spend a lot of energy throughout but I tend to still have a bit to study or finish off schoolwork at the end of the day (without pulling all-nighters that often lol). I get to finish anything that needs to be done for school and go to sleep at my optimal time. Another reason is social life, as I do work a shift during weekend so I'm curious on how the workload affects your entire week as typically my weekend already gets illed studying for tests or hanging out with friends sometimes. Thus, it brings me back to my question of school/work/social-life balance in university. Like I mentioned if you could give me insights on controlling the workload throughout your years in university and I'm not specifically asking for your daily schedules or anything as such, but just managing your days/weeks in general to keep up with the responsibilities. Thanks! Mentee 2023-11-24, 16:14: Hello! Regarding the templates you we're planning to send me, it turns out that I can't send you my email on here as it contains my name and such. It wouldn't let me send the message. So I was hoping that you could just copy and paste the templates on here then I'll just do the same and save it in my files. If not, I can figure out another way just let me know. Thank you so much Mentor 2023-11-29, 15:38: Hi Nicolo, Ah yes, thanks for checking in with that! I've created the template but for some reason, my PDF or Word docs aren't attaching. I've contacted the mentoring platform to see if there's an easy way to send it to you. Otherwise, I worry if I send it as a huge chunk it will look very wordy and the format will be altered. Once they follow-up with a solution, I will send it to you! Mentor 2023-11-29, 15:58: As for your first message, time management was a big thing to tackle for me transitioning to university. I think one thing that made it extremely hard for me was the commuting time - it took 1.5 hours one way to get to my campus, so I would lose 3 hours/day just sitting on the bus. I'm not sure if you'll be near campus or farther away when you start deciding on post-secondary, so this is something to bear in mind! If you have the luxary and choice of being near your campus, it will be very helpful with the school-work-life balance throughout university. Scheduling tasks was probably one of my greatest saviours during university. It helped me stay really organized and plan my day accordingly. By having an idea of the workload i'd have per day, it was easier to plan additional activities throughout my day as well as prioritize tasks throughout the week. Try to start harder tasks earlier just so you're not stuck scrambling on them last minute. And please make time for friends/family/activities because university can feel overwhelming so times to de-stress are crucial. Overall, it's really dependent on prioritizing and starting difficult tasks earlier, and possibly scheduling your school and commitments so you're aware of the type of workload you'll have to prepare for. Have you tried scheduling things day-to-day (ex. when to study for a test, a dentist appointment, basketball practice, etc.)? Studying effectively is also very important for time management. When I first started uni, I had my phone around a lot during studying and I'd go on it here and there. I'd also study on my bed where I'd get tired and it would elongate my studying time because I wouldn't get anything done. Find an effective study plan! Keep your phone away and have a designated study spot - work for 30 minutes straight with no distractions and award yourself with a short break, and repeat. As I got used to the change in my study habits, I found this to be extremely effective as have others. I'm not sure how your study habits are (and I hope they're better than mine early on in university LOL), but effective study habits will save you a lot more time than you think! I've been quite fortunate with my jobs where on slow days, my boss was happy to let me study at the pharmacy I worked at. At the eye clinic, I did a lot of computer work so when I wasn't interacting with patients, I had time to work on assignments (on Google Docs) when I completed my other work tasks. I think this is something that helped me balance work and school, and I know this may not be the situation everyone falls under, I think this was one of the main reasons I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I could've felt. How many days a week do you plan on working in university, if any? I hope some of this helps! Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything. I will also follow-up with the template once I hear back from ReMBC. :) Mentor 2023-12-06, 15:25:  Mentor 2023-12-06, 15:26: Fianlly it sent!!! Find below 3 examples of reaching out to professors for research/volunteering opportunities. :) It didn't work for a couple of days oddly enough Mentee 2023-12-06, 20:35: Hi Fermin! Thanks for your response. I don't do sports in this time of the year as I only play soccer now and it occurs during the spring. My days are currently quite slow except for mandatory school events or work. So my days mostly consists of just doing schoolwork. However, at times where I do have a busy schedule, I tend to plan it out. Your point on commute time is definitely one of the factors I am considering when deciding for which university to go into. I am slowly coming into the time of admission acceptances (or declines lol) and I have already been accepted into one. I really consider about commute times because I feel that it doesn’t matter whether I’m taking transit or if I’m driving a car… it would still take me roughly the same amount of time to get from A-B. That’s why I’m strongly considering smaller cities in BC that still possess a resourceful place that can help me with my education without having to live in a big place like Vancouver. As per study habits, I was really curious about someone who is in university as I haven’t experienced the type of workload given during university. I do use some study habits but usually just tend to just do/study my lectures whenever I have time for. The one thing I fall into is procrastination. I believe I mentioned that to you at the start of this whole assignment, but there are just some days where I don’t feel like doing as much work. Did you ever had any experience of procrastination or feeling like just not doing anything for the day? I just want to know if such a thing can be achievable without falling behind that much with the workload for university. However, I do agree that effective study habits are much more beneficial than just cramming every single lecture into the brain so I tend to do work periods then take breaks. Lastly, I do not plan to work in my first 1-2 years of uni (as I just want to get the feel for the shift in environment). Except for experience opportunities but I don’t think those would occur as often as oppose to being employed in a job. I also just want to focus on school and maintain my high grades throughout (hopefully lol). Even right now, I am fortunate that my boss understands my viewpoint that I put school as a priority more than the job in the pharmacy. Thus, I don’t work that often through the week especially at a time where I constantly have schoolwork/ applications I need to do outside my timetable. I want to ask, now that you are in your final year(s) of your program, did the workload seem to ease a little where you have time to manage work experience along with schoolwork? Thanks! Mentee 2023-12-06, 20:39: Thank you so much for the templates!! I had to wait over the weekend and a day before sending my response to ask my teacher what to do about the situation and I wanted to see if ReMBC was going to get back at you quickly enough before trying another method lol. I'll have a read at them and make it an inspiration when I will do mine in the future :) Anyways, thank you so much once again! Mentor 2023-12-08, 13:32: Hi Nicolo! Congratulations on your acceptance!! May I ask where if you're comfortable sharing? :) I agree the smaller cities outside of Vancouver will have all the resources you will need and tend to be slightly cheaper to live in than Vancouver itself! If you're near transit (if you're not driving), commuting will be much easier. I'm not sure if you currently have a preference on which school you are hoping to attend, but I suggest (if you have the option), to be near a skytrain station when looking for a place to live if you hope to attend UBC or SFU - it will significantly reduce your commute time not only to university, but also places like the grocery store, mall, etc. I was a MAJOR procrastinator in my first (and partly second) year of university omg. And as you mentioned, yes there were many days where I just wanted to lay down and relax!! I do think it's achievable to give yourself rest days and stay on track! It took a bit of self-guidance and learning to be able to achieve a good balance, but I do think it's possible. One thing that may help to ease you into the transition could be to take a smaller course load while figuring out the pros and cons of your current study habits and how they influence your grades/studying, and modifying your behaviours to fit the new workload. As much as the course content is a learning curve itself, the amount of work you will need to complete may feel overwhelming in the beginning, so having to adjust to both can feel really stressful and make you feel like you don't have time to yourself. It may not be an option for you depending on how long you'd like to take to complete your undergraduate program, but my neighbour recently started university and was telling me she really wished she reduced her course load in her first semester to adjust to university workload and alter her study habits while also feeling like she had time for herself (she took 4 courses, or 12 credits, and wished she took three). Even in my experience, I wish I took 1 class less in my first semester of university to ease me into my transition and figure out how to better adjust my study habits while also giving me time to relax. In the beginning of university, I recall always thinking ""I have this, this, and this to still finish!!"" and feeling overwhelmed even on days where I wanted to relax and rest. It's better to start with a little less (if you feel that's what you need) to tend to yourself. Just a side note - in highschool if you are used to getting high grades from memorization, this may be the hardest battle to overcome because university will force you to apply the topics you learn into different scenarios rather than purely recalling information. In highschool, my study habits were pure memorization and I achieved good marks, so learning to take what I learned and applying it in university was the most difficult study habit to teach myself. I'm not sure if it's the same for you, but if you're not solely memorizing information for exams, the university learning curve may be easier for you than it was for me. :) I'm glad you won't have to work for the first 2 years!! I was lucky that I didn't have to as well and trust me, it makes it a lot easier to not have an additional stressor especially when you start post-secondary. I started working 1x/week at the end of my third year/4th year. You can also use your free time to volunteer/do activities you enjoy (or be lazy :P)! I do feel that as the years went on (both in my undergrad and my masters), the workload did become a lot more managable, and most of my friends felt the same way. :) It really is the start of post-secondary where you need to learn your ""new normal"" that is difficult to overcome. Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to address! :) Mentor 2023-12-08, 13:33: You're very welcome for the templates! It was weird - it wasn't originally attaching and I was also starting to wonder how I'd get it sent over to you but I'm glad it all worked out! :) I hope you find them useful! Mentee 2023-12-18, 15:40: Hi Fermin! I'm really sorry for the late reply. But I did receive a VERY EARLY acceptance with UNBC. Their campus is in Prince George so I'm not sure if you're too familiar with them. It is one of the universities I'm strongly considering to go into as Prince George is still considered a city while not being as big as Vancouver. I got the acceptance letter the first week of December which was a shock honestly. Last week I just had a talk with my principal and they told me I am in consideration for their full 4 year scholarship. So another shock lol. I guess for my last ""question"", I was really intrigued on what you said about adjusting to different methods of applying knowledge other than memorization. What other methods of applying knowledge did you go through? I just spent the last 2 weeks memorizing for my Bio test which I agree with you that it's sort of the only method of applying knowledge in high school. (maybe other than doing labs but I follow instructions during.) In a way I'm kind of relieved to hear it's more than just memorization as one of the things I wonder about university is how much stuff you need to memorize to apply knowledge. I'm not saying I'm bad at it, it's more of just ""there's already quite a bit of memorization in high school, how much more is there when it comes to university"" type question. Mentor 2023-12-20, 09:11: Congratulations! That is such wonderful news and an even bigger congratulations for being considered for a 4-year scholarship!!! That is definitely something to be extremely proud of! And I agree that is a very early acceptance - you must've wowed them! I found that you really had to understand course concepts at a conceptual level. For example, if you were learning about mitosis or meiosis, you'd get a question that might ask ""what would happen if you didn't have separation of the chromosomes at metaphase? What would your final cells look like?"" or ""This person was doing an experiment and noticed that her animal cells have chromosomes XXY. Describe one way, step by step, this may have resulted."" Things like that where you essentially take the basics of the concepts (the steps of mitosis/meiosis) and you apply some scenario that might alter it, and describing what could be the outcome of it. This was an overly simplistic example, but that's essentially the idea rather than ""What happens during metaphase of mitosis?"" Other questions include describing data from a graph, which you can't technically memorize, so understanding how to read data may be a common type of question you encounter in science courses. Overall, you may notice a lot of ""application"" questions, where you apply your knowledge of a basic concept into different scenarios. Memorization actually worked well for me in some courses - for example, with psychology courses and memorizing vocabulary, the concepts weren't overly complex where it would require mental manipulation (so they wouldn't really ask ""if this one step were not to happen, what would be the outcome?"" type of questions)! However, there were some psychology courses that were a bit more challenging (ex. a took a brain dysfunction and recovery psychology course and that required both memorization but also the ability to manipulate the content). For other courses, like biology and biochemistry, I studied by ""teaching"" others the lecture content or just saying it out loud as if I'm speaking to a class. Oddly enough, it helps you identify where you may have learning gaps and gives you the ability to reflect on what you may not know. I know a few other friends who learn the same way, so it may work for you too. Other courses, like organic chemistry, just required A LOT of practice for me. I wasn't really good at mentally imagining compounds in my head so it just took a ton of doing practice questions and trying to find patterns. Overall, a singular study method will likely not be sufficient for all classes, so try everything and see what helps you with learning the most! I hope this was insightful and painted a clearer picture of what type of questions you may encounter in university! And if you have any other questions, please let me know! Otherwise, if you'd like to move onto another module, we can also do that! Mentee 2024-01-03, 15:23: Hi Fermin! That's no problem, but I will get back to school on Jan. 8 so I will respond to you ASAP after I ask my teacher. Otherwise, if it's alright I'm okay about doing the module anyway. Sorry I just wasn't aware the we didn't formally do 5 yet. If it's okay with you that we open the 5th and final module and we can talk about it since our modules lasted about a week (without me delaying it lol). Thank You! Mentor 2024-01-04, 11:50: Perfect! Sounds good to me. We can also just do one activity if you find it's sufficient for you. I will open up Career Exploration now. :)",,"Mentor 2023-10-18, 11:53: Welcome to the Adulting module! Here we will discuss the skills you currently have and what skills you may need to practice in order to live independently. In this module, we will also explore finances and saving/budgeting when living alone/away from your family or support system. Look over the warm-up activity to get you thinking about adulting and what it may look like for you, and feel free to share your thoughts! It is up to you to decide which lesson(s) to complete in this module after giving the warm-up activity a try, so feel free to pick whichever intersts you, or both! Mentee 2023-10-23, 18:17: Hello! Hope you’re having a good day! When I think about being an adult I mostly think about taking care of the financial aspects that comes with adulthood. These are things like doing taxes, budgeting, and tracking my expenses/spending. For the most part, I think this is what I’m going to be doing in the near future. I would say I’m already independent in terms of planning my meals, doing my clothes, and budgeting my money. The biggest adjustment would definitely be keeping track of my expenses such as transportation, housing, and miscellaneous expenses as these are things that I don’t control in my life just yet. I think learning the city of wherever I move to, is something that would benefit me into this transition. Researching and gathering information about the city can help me paint a better picture of how to spend my money. I know that sounds weird but it’s basically just adapting and socializing with people to learn the ins and outs of the new place. Attached is the evaluation table for the necessary (skills?) for transitioning into adulthood. My biggest “weakness” in terms of adulthood skills are definitely paying bills, taxes, or any other general financial duties outside of budgeting. I would also include doing the necessary paperworks for buying/renting a house, a car, or any other assets. That’s probably a little too far into the future but still lol. I simply don’t have the experience or ever came across a situation where I had to do said tasks. But time will definitely come where I will get the chance to do them/ be forced to do them lol. Side note: Sorry this one took a little while than expected. I know I had been quiet the last days and I know you’re very busy compared to me even if I say I’m busy. But thank you for still constantly messaging me. I would love to work on “Post-Secondary &amp; Career Planning” for our unit next. It’s something that I’m looking forward to talking about and I hope we get to spend quite a bit of time on that. If I’m required to spend more time on this unit after this, then I have no problem with that. Mentor 2023-10-25, 13:49: Hi Nicolo! Nice explanation on what you consider to be ""adulting."" Everything you listed is very relevant to being an adult, and especially if you're moving away from home, will be relevant to you! For me, finances were definitely my weakness as well and I think this is the general concensus for those transitioning out of highschool and living independently, so don't worry! Tracking your expenses is definitely an important skill to keep tabs on, especially when you first move away and it isn't clear how much you'll be spending on what. Generally, since you have strong budgeting skills, I don't think tracking your expenses will be as difficult as it may seem since you already have the skills to manage your budget, so it'll come naturally when other expenses come into play. This may take some trial and error when you first move away and are unsure of how other expenses may play a part in your monthly/weekly budget, but with some adjustments will be feasible I am sure. :) Learning about the layout of the city is a great way to familiarize yourself with what's around you, especially if you've never been there before. I had a previous mentee who moved to Calgary for university, and I suggested using the ""Transit"" app if you have an iPhone (I believe it's also available on Android) or Google Maps. I personally like the transit app because the layout is nicer and it tells you the times your bus/train will be arriving, and it's easy to input where you'd like to go, and it will give you what busses/trains/other modes of transit to take to get there and even the walking path if your destination is farther from the transit stop. If you're planning to use transit, this will be very helpful to get you from place to place and it works throughout Canada/US! And you're totally right about learning of a new place by adapting and socializing - locals and those who have lived there longer will be familiar with how the city runs and give you tricks to get places quicker or other general knowledge about your surroundings. School/jobs are great places to meet these individuals and I'm sure it'll be easy for you to learn your way around a new town by asking around :P If you plan on moving to Vancouver specifically, I can try to give you some tips as well. :) Thank you for uploading your document! Finances are definitely a tough thing to tackle. I noticed that your family/other individuals you know are a resource you can use when the time will come to doing your finances. It's wonderful that you have a support system that will provide you with the help you need. I know for taxes, there's certain websites like TurboTax that make it a lot more simple in a step-by-step manner to do your taxes alone (and it's free!), and that may be something you use in the future when you do your taxes. Making big purchases (car, house, etc.) is also a big deal and can be quite confusing/daunting. Alongside family members/people you know, YouTube, Google, and surprisingly, even TikTok and other social media platforms have great channels to get you learning the basics prior to making these big purchases. As you become more familiar with what is required to make these big purchases, asking those more skilled in the field (ex. a realtor, a car salesman) general questions can also be helpful! And like you said, with a lot of the skills you listed, practice and experience is what makes the difference, and unfortunately sometimes, we need to be put in the position to make these big life changes in order to understand the experience more clearly.? No need to apologize for taking some time to respond! I know Grade 12 is extremely busy especially when you have all your graduation requirements, assignments, and other duties so I understand it can get overwhelming at times! I try to respond 1-2x a week as well and will continue updating you if I receive anything from your teacher, but respond whenever you have some free time - no rush :). Otherwise yes, let's open up ""Post Secondary and Career Planning"" for our next module! Feel free to continue the conversation here alongside the new unit if you have any questions/input. Otherwise, we will go through the new module on its own. :)","Mentor 2023-10-25, 13:52: Welcome to the Post-Secondary and Career Planning module! Like you, I'm excited about this module as well because it gets you to explore the types of post-secondary education you can receive, and how to plan your career accordingly if you have specific career goals! Give the ""Warm Up: Prediction"" activity a try and feel free to share your thoughts. Otherwise, we can move onto your choice(s) of: Lesson 1: Pathways to your degree Lesson 2: Planning your journey Mentee 2023-11-02, 13:25: Hi! I hope you’re having a good day. I wanted to use this time to talk about different careers as I realize that Neuroscience isn’t just a one job goal type of degree. I got to talk to many different people who obtained a BSc in Neuroscience and talked about their different careers. While those are helpful inputs, I wanted to ask if you could share yours as someone that is still in school and isn’t in the full-time workforce. I know this gets very personal but if you could share the types of jobs you’re hoping/qualified to go into with your degree. As you could probably remember students don’t declare their major until their second or third year. So all my applications to universities are all just BSc. I am thinking of applying for Psychology for the universities that doesn’t have a Neuroscience option. I do want to go into medical school and obtain an MD but I’m more concerned about the scenario if I don’t get in. I really just want to prepare for a fall-back if the MD route doesn’t work and Psychology seems to be really interesting to me. I wanted to use this unit to start a conversation about the different careers. Thanks :) Mentor 2023-11-07, 13:00: Hi Nicolo! Great question and I want to express how great it is that you're exploring various avenues for your future in both medicine and neuroscience. So my friends have gotten into many different sectors being graduates in neuroscience, myself included. I actually completed my neuroscience degree recently! As I previously mentioned, I'm working at BC Cancer right now as a research coordinator and am involved in brain cancer studies (and other body systems), and additional opportunities include working as a project manager in cancer research after a few years of experience. The nice thing about this role that you can obtain casual/part-time/and full-time positions (based on what's being offered) so it worked while I was in school, and I was offered a full-time opportunity after my studies were completed. I find that a neuroscience degree in the healthcare system is quite versatile, and you can typically land research-related jobs in other bodily systems (ex. lung, cardiovascular system, etc.) even if your specialty is in neuroscience - it's nice that you are not confined only to neuroscience with your degree (although I do think this also depends on additional factors like your experience, which I'll talk more about below). Additional opportunities include going into research directly (running experiments, testing samples, meeting with patients to do research activities, etc.). If you have experience doing data analysis during your undergrad in neuroscience/psychology, this can also set you up to be a strong applicant for data analyst jobs as well, and it isn't confined only to healthcare. :) Others have gotten into the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which often pays better than public health sectors and provides more opportunity for corporate growth and moving your way up through a company. This tends to fall more under the business side of healthcare. You did mention that you were interested in business and healthcare, so this might be an interesting combination for you! Jobs here includes pharmaceutical/biotech company representatives/managers/directors, statistical programmers (this essentially goes more into the tech side of science/health), clinical trial associates/managers/directors, and sales specialists for pharmaceutical/biotech companies. The jobs I listed above are also applicable in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. A bachelors degree and research experience will of course be beneficial for medical school applications, but will also be helpful if you decide to pursue a masters or PhD as well! Psychology is a great major and is a very intersting topic. If I were to do a bachelors degree again, I would also choose psychology because I found it very intersting. One nice thing about psychology as well is that if you decide to pursue a graduate degree in Psychology (masters or PhD) and research isn't the path you are wanting to take, you can also study to become a psychologist or clinical counsellor and work directly in healthcare. Although a BSc (in whatever major you choose) will be awarded at the end of your studies, getting a job offer also highly depends on your work experience. It's very important (not just for medical school, but any career path you hope to pursue) and experience is an incredible asset that will make your application stronger. If research is your thing or you're willing to explore it, I would suggest once you're doing some more-specific courses (ex. maybe you have a brain dysfunction class or a mental health class that you have interst in), reach out to your professors and ask whether they, or other colleagues they know, have research opportunities that you can be involved in, and make sure you express why you are interested in the topic. Not only will this provide you with job experience, it will also help you discover your likes/dislikes and pave a clearer path for careers you'd prefer to pursue in the future. I found that I started building my experience in research quite late (in my 4th year), so I like to tell students to get their foot through the door earlier just to open them up to more opportunities in the future. Also, being involved earlier may also provide you with some strong references for future jobs/schooling. If you would like a template of the type of email I sent when looking for research opportunities/finding a supervisor for my Masters degree, I can share that with you to hold onto for future reference. :) If I haven't touched base on a specific career or topic you'd like to discuss, please let me know and I can dive a little deeper. :) Mentee 2023-11-15, 20:49: Hi Fermin! I would like to take you up on your offer on the email template you sent for research opportunities/finding a supervisor. (If it still stands :)). If you want my email to send a document of the template please let me know I would be more than happy to share it with you. Thank you so much for giving me in-depth insights on you and your friends' experiences in the field. I am grateful you shared me the stuff you guys had learned and the last few days gave me a lot more information than just researching about experiences online. I am quite limited to the amount of people I can talk to who have a background in Neuroscience (or just science in general) as sometimes careers is a very sensitive topic to adults, and being in a small town further limits my options. Thus, I was looking forward to your response as I can gain an insight on what I should expect in the upcoming years coming from someone who is currently studying in that field. It's so much more (believing I guess) where it's not coming from online where websites don't go into details about real-life experiences. Of course, I haven't stepped a foot in a university as a student, but I will build my own experiences once the time comes. Thank you for sharing your own learning such as building experience and I will definitely keep that in mind :). I believe that the next one will be our last unit together, and for that I hope you can open ""Well-being and self care"" where I hope we can spend our last time talking about managing the work load and duties in university as it is something I am also curious about. I understand that there are activities specifically recommended in each units. However, given that my teacher told me to choose 2 topics I would like to share with you, I spoke to my teacher and it seems acceptable to deviate from the activities as she told us to respond and learn about the things I want to learn about in the 2 units. So I hope it is okay with you if I am not strictly following the activities but I am talking to you about content related to the unit. Thank you so much for all of your help and guidance throughout this course. Mentor 2023-11-20, 14:53: Hi Nicolo! Yes of course the offer still stands! Please let me know your email and I will forward you an example or two. :) No problem! Even being from a bigger city, it was still very confusing for me as well on what careers were available in science, biology, and neuroscience and many of them I wasn't aware of until halfway into my bachelors. I wish I had someone in my life with experience that was able to offer me with insights on career paths, so I'm glad I can extend my current knowledge to someone else. Yes - let's open Wellbeing and self care. We can absolutely talk about managing workloads while in university in that module! As long as your teacher is okay with it, I'd rather we discuss topics that are of interest and beneficial to you anyways. :) You're very welcome!",,"Mentor 2024-01-04, 11:55: Welcome to the career exploration module! Since completion of both activities in this module are not required by your teacher, we can decide to do one activity if you wish. Or if you'd like to go outside of the module's activities, we can explore careers in a different way that will be helpful to you! Let me know what you prefer, or if you have specific questions for this module, ask away! :) Also I hope you are enjoying your break before school starts up again! Mentee 2024-01-09, 09:56: Hello! Hope you are doing well. I took a look at the activities attached to this module, however I do have questions pertaining to this module that goes outside of the spectrum of questions in the activities if that's alright. Since we already sort of covered the several pathways of careers one can go into if they pursue a degree in Neuroscience. I wanted to talk about transition, degrees like psychology is quite similar and overlaps to neuroscience (especially the behavioral/cognitive part) as UBC requires students in BSc of Behavioral/Cognitive Neuroscience to partake in Pyschology courses in the upper years. However, Psychology does have its own degree and is considered by a social science. Did you ever think about going into Psychology instead of Neuroscience? I ask this because some smaller schools do not actually offer Neuroscience as it seems a little more niche than Psychology (where small schools offer a degree in Psychology). I understand that Neuroscience dives into diverse topics and explores the function of the nervous system, where Psychology diverts with specializing in studying behaviour and response from stimulus and socializing with people instead of working in the lab all the time. Did you ever come across/collaborated with people that are in Psychology and yet they are able to work with the same topics as you do? It's a bit of a ""curiosity"" question as I just want to know how (strict?) is transtitioning from Psychology to Neuroscience-related careers. For example, Neurology also examines the brain (albeit differently,) but there's a barrier where you are required to go to med school and pursue a MD. Hope you also enjoyed your holiday break, I'm finishing up my first semester so every teacher is just throwing in test dates left and right lol. Mentor 2024-01-10, 12:48: Hi Nicolo, This is an excellent question - I did think about Psychology as an option as well but unfortunately for my undergrad, psychology was an arts major and I was enrolled in science, so the switch would require me to take additional required courses (at least that's how it was for UBC), so I didn't want to commit the extra time to completing additional requirements since I didn't complete the psychology requirements as elective courses while in science (more on this later...). For my masters program, I heavily considered psychology, however I ended up going with neuroscience based on my specific research interests - I really wanted to manipulate parts of my experiment and assess protein levels in the brain, which really only is feasible in animals. Additionally, the human ethics process in research is very lengthy and things like blood collection from humans for a study could take months, or even up to a year to approve if it's not originally on your supervisor's study protocol. I tried to weigh out my options based on time - what program would get me significant research experience without the additional regulatory work? (Eg. more classes, more certifications to complete, more time to wait prior to starting experiments and data analysis). In the end, it truly is based on your interests and the nice thing with employment is if you have a range of experience (for ex. you do a psychology degree but you also volunteered in a neuroscience lab), you will build skills to pursue both fields. In the end, I suggest going with the topic that intersts you more because this will make school a lot more enjoyable and learning will feel exciting rather than a chore. I had significant interest in psychology even prior to doing a science undergrad degree and I wish I started off with psychology (an interest I knew I had) because I feel that I'd really be tackling my interests by pursuing a psychology degree. Oh well :P In terms of transferring betweem programs, it's a bit difficult to say because transferring to a different program within your own school or at a different school will have different requirements. If you are thinking of possibly transferring programs in the future, it would be helpful to look into the programs you are interested in and what course requirements they have - sometimes they will overlap with your program's course requirements, and sometimes you can take the additional required courses as elective courses so you don't spend extra time completing program requirements after transferring to your new program. However, this is only what I'd recommend if you have a specific timeline you'd like to finish your undergrad in - if you're open to taking a semester longer then you can always hold off on completing certain courses. Again, it depends on the program's requirements (so do they need specific courses to be completed before you transfer? Before your second year of university? It really varies by program and by school). A little different to what you asked, but I knew one PhD student who was in Zoology (animal studies) but her supervisor was a Psychology professor. For her PhD, she focused a lot on behaviour in animals in response to steroids and she looked into blood and brain tissue. I can't recall the undergraduate degree she did, but although she was in Zoology, her work really combined neuroscience, biology, and psychology all together. So yes! My friend who is doing his PhD falls in a similar boat but he is in neuroscience, and he is looking into brain activity in response to music in regular people and people with apathy (a lack of enthusiasm or concern). I would assume even if someone was in psychology, their work could absolutely overlap with neuroscience, as neuroscience overlaps with psychology a lot! I hope this was helpful and please feel free to ask more questions or ask me to build on anything I said it it was not clear or you'd like more information. :)",,,"Mentor 2023-09-22, 11:35: Hi Nicolo! It's so great to finally ""meet"" you. I read over your profile and noticed that we both share common interests in neurology and medicine, which is great! I'm a masters student (just finishing up) in the neuroscience program at the University of British Columbia and also hoping to go into medicine. I currently work at the BC Cancer Agency in clinical research and it seems like our interests are similar, so I'm glad we've been matched together! I also noticed you have an interest in finance. Are you leaning more to a specific program (pre-med vs. finance) or are you hoping to find a program that combines both study areas? Very neat topics of interest! The mentoring platform can be challenging to learn, so I suggest reading over the ""Lesson 1: Program Tutorial"" section and completing the quiz to get yourself oriented. Once you're done, let me know and we can transition into ""Lesson 2: Meet your mentor."" If you fall stuck on any of the sections or have any questions, let me know and we can try and work through it together. :) I look forward to speaking with you more over the next few months. There are specific topics we are required to cover based on your school's cirriculum, but we will plan that out once we complete this section. I'm excited to learn more about you! Mentee 2023-09-22, 15:54: Hello Fermin! It is very nice to meet you too (virtually)! I had a very pleasant time reading through your background and experiences in regards to my interests in medicine. I do agree that we both share very similar interests. It is very nice to hear that you currently work in BC Cancer Agency. In fact, I am currently working as a Pharmacy Technician and I do the same tasks as the ones you mentioned when you worked as one. When I read that you worked as a Pharmacy Technician, I was actually so glad that I matched with someone like you because there is atleast some type of relatable connection there. I say that because I am interested in studying neuroscience, and of course, such topic does not really get covered in a high-school setting due to its complexity and the vast amount of concepts yet to be (discovered?) by the top researchers/scientists of the field. Thus, I was quite anxious to see who I match up with to talk about this, because I have very limited knowledge when it comes to the topic. Which is why I had always entertained going into neuro specifically because of how much research yet to be done. To answer your question, I am leaning more into Neuroscience than Finance. I happen to just put the two careers I am most interested in. I really look forward to working with you in the next few months! Regarding the mentoring platform, I had chosen to do the Photo Activity and I will be sending you photos and the assignment through this format later on the day.If there is another format that is more efficient and you wished for me to you use, please feel free to mention it. I hope the long message didn't bother you too much. ( I get very detail-oriented.) :) Mentee 2023-09-22, 18:49: Picture #1 - I took this picture at a beach in the Philippines. This photo is very meaningful to me because it is the place where I come from. I wasn't born in Canada and had moved here during my early childhood. I live in Canada now, but the values of life that the Philippines had taught me due to the drastic difference in lifestyle compared to Canada always resdies with me. It is the reason I maintain a humble attitude in life, and always grateful for any accomplishments I achieve. Mentee 2023-09-22, 19:09: Picture #2 - It is the brain :). I wanted to share this because I'm always so entertained about any topic/conversation regarding the brain. Its complexity and the fact that the public do not know much about it, just compliments my ""always wanting to learn new things"" mindset. That ""mindset"" of mine is really what got me interested in neuro instead of other departments in the medical field. Another factor in my interest is my care for people. I've always liked helping people, from school or community volunteering. In neuro, the ""widely-known"" disorders associated with neurocognitive functions are progressive. It sparks my brain into wanting to help either further the development of research, or help people who may be in need. Mentee 2023-09-22, 19:25: Picture #3 - I wanted to share this because it closely relates to what you study. This picture is basically just sleep! It is the method that I use and personally rely on in times of stress. The reason I choose this method over other clinaclly-proven methods such as meditation, is because I always overthink. Most of the time I benefit from it due to me overpreparing for stuff so I do not end up in a situation where I will regret because I didn't think through enough. However, overthinking can be very bad when I am stressed, which is why meditation does not end up working well for me because I am still fully conscious and thinking. With sleep, I can let time pass without having to think, and end up waking relaxed. Mentor 2023-09-25, 15:59: Hi Nicolo! Nice to hear that you're already leaning towards a specific topic, but also keeping your options open with finance! No need to apologize for your detail-oriented messages :) I love that you are engaged and sharing your experiences with me, and I really enjoy learning more about you from your thoughtful responses! Thank you for being so involved in the program and showing your interest in participating/learning, especially so early on! It's very neat to hear about your job! It's great to hear that even our jobs have some connection to one another! How do you like being a pharmacy technician? It's a great job to open up opportunities to other fields of healthcare, and I'm really glad I had the experience myself, and hopefully you do too. Picture #1: What a beautiful and scenic photo of the beach in the Phillipines. It's very nice to hear how humble you are given that you moved to Canada when you were much younger. Although I was born in Canada, my parents are from Bangladesh and first-generation immigrants in Canada, so I admire your humbleness and gratefulness for your experiences both here and back home. I'd like to think my family passed on the same traits to me as well, and if you hope to be a doctor in the future, these are very important qualities to hold onto as you go through school to maintain strong connections with patients! :) I'm curious, when was the last time you visited the Phillipines and for how long? Picture #2: I love the picture of the brain and I agree that your mindset definitely shapes you into having the qualities to learn about neurology/neuroscience! The brain is a complex topic, but extremely interesting given how much there is to learn and like you said, how much is still not known, and there are so many ways to be involved directly in patient-care and in research like you mentioned. I'd like to think even your role as a pharmacy technician plays a critical part in helping others. Without you, many people may not have their medications on time, so you play a very important role in the healthcare system just as much as others do. :) You mentioned some volunteering you do when describing this picture as well - Are you comfortable sharing your volunteer activities? I'd love to hear more about it! Picture #3: Oh man you remind me so much of myself LOL. I too am a major overthinker and things like meditation also don't help me (but I'm very glad it provides relief to other people who can make use of it). Like you, being conscious in times of stress cause me to overthink and/or over-prepare, so oftentimes to escape the commotion in my head, I take a nap or a full-blown 10 hour deep sleep to stop overthinking. It seems like you have a pretty good solution to tackling stress. Are you able to tell when your limit is (for ex. if you're overstudying or overworking yourself), or do you tend to realize when you're already over the edge and begin realizing you are pushing your limits? Unfortunately for me, I tend to notice a bit too deep into my own stress, so I am working on it myself. :P Beautiful/excellent photos and thank you for such thoughtful and detailed responses alongside them! Mentor 2023-09-26, 13:34: Also I will send my pictures to you in the next day or so! I'm gonna have a quick write up for them ready for you. :) Mentor 2023-09-28, 10:47:  Mentor 2023-09-28, 10:47: Picture #1: The hippocampus of a mouse. This structure is involved in learning and memory and is the main brain structure I studied during my neuroscience degree. I love this picture not only because it represents the work I've done throughout my graduate studies, but it also holds a deeper meaning to me in that I am always learning and craving knowledge, and I'm lucky my mind gives me the drive and capacity to keep seeking out new opportunities to learn. I think this is a symbolic picture that also motivates me to pursue medicine after my masters degree is complete, and my hippocampus will allow me to continue learning and retaining new knowledge. :) Just to orient you to the picture if you're interested, I took this picture myself using a microscope in the hippocampus of an 8-day old mouse. The blue specs represent neurons or ""brain cells,"" while the green are called microglia, the immune cells of the brain. The really thick line of neurons in the centre is the outer boundary of the hippocampus. :) Mentor 2023-09-28, 10:48: Picture #1: The hippocampus of a mouse.

Picture #2 - The biggest known black hole compared to Earth. This one is a bit spooky, but it actually brings me a slight level of peace. This is TON-618, the biggest *known* black hole in the universe and can fit 1.3 million Earths inside of it. This black hole is millions of light years away from us, so thankfully not a threat to our existence hahaha. Oftentimes I get overwhelmed about my future, my goals and aspirations, and whether I will be able to meet my own goals and make myself and my family proud. This level of thinking actually gets me pretty anxious because it brings about scenarios in my head of if I don't make it, whether not becoming the person I strive to be will leave me feeling empty, and some general thoughts that give me anxiety and stress me out. Pictures of space like this remind me of how small we actually are as humans, how things that may not align with what we originally planned out in our heads are okay, and we are floating through a rock in the middle of a never-ending universe, and having one thing that may not happen the way you planned out will not ruin our lives or make us less wonderful than we already are. This picture in an odd sense helps me feel grounded and brings me back to a calm sense of reality. Mentee 2023-10-02, 16:54: Hello! I REALLY enjoyed reading your feedback in my pictures, as well as the explanations of the pictures you sent. To answer some of your questions: I visited the Philippines 8 months ago, and my family typically stays there for a month. I haven't gotten to see the Philippines for 5 years because of covid and it stopped us from visiting for a long time. I like working in the pharmacy a lot and I've gained many eye-opening realizations or lessons by just working in it. As for my volunteering activities, working in the pharmacy actually started off as a volunteering experience before I got the job. It takes up the bulk of my (volunteering time?) where it might had become a job now, I still treat it as an opportunity to learn new things nonetheless. Aside from that, I do some community work like door-knocking in part of a Food Bank or arranging school events (when those types of opportunities come up). I do not always get to do them as I am from a really small town so those only may be a seasonal event. I definitely think I will get to dive in this with you a bit more in one of the units we have to cover :). Lastly, I don't necessarily realize that I am pushing my limits until I am stressed, and often times I do things where I over-study but I don't realize it because I overthink of scenarios where it could go wrong. I don't necessarily feel stressed about studying, it's more about the outcome as I do not want to fail a project/test. The only time I realize I over-studied is when the test is only a fraction of what I studied (lol). Anyways, to your pictures. Picture #1 - Thanks for orienting me on the picture, and that is really cool! It's acutally fascinating how such a structure plays a major role in our abilities to remember things. I actually relate to you where I also crave learning! I like that you talked about a brain structure that functions in retaining knowledge because when I first worked in the pharmacy, as someone who has no background in medicine yet, I found myself fascinated that I learned so much stuff and I'm able to remember it. I'm talking as simple as what a certain medication does, but still amazing to me. I really like that you have a motivator in the form of a picture, because in reality, I do too. Parkinson's disease is mine, and the reason why I want to go dive in to neuroscience (or maybe becoming a doctor in neuro as well). I am not saying I want to be this guy who wants to conquer and develop a miracle cure for it, I just want an opportunity to research and learn about not only Parkinson's but other neurological diseases as well. Picture #2 - I really like the connection you made to the black hole where you feel anxious if you don't make it or strive to be the person you want to be. This actually relates to me so much because my overthinking comes with doubts in myself like the ones you mentioned which is why I try so hard and give it my all to achieve whatever it is I am trying to achieve. Your comment actually hits me very deep (in a good way lol) where at a time like this, I am only a few weeks out until universities open their admissions window. It is something that lingers in the back of my head because I always get anxious of what is gonna happen as I hope to get accepted into a university. Unfortunately, I don't have anythingl like you do with the picture to keep me grounded and at peace. Even if my friends always say ""you're one of the smartest in the school, universities will accept you"" or comments that are similar, it doesn't keep me at peace. How did you come about into finding a picture that keeps you at peace? Thank you so much for sharing those pictures to me and I hope you don't mind the deep connections I made to them :p Mentee 2023-10-02, 17:00: Hi Fermin, Sorry I only just realize that I did not send the previous message until now :/. Except for that, I wanted to ask you about the next units. You and my teacher both mentioned we need to cover a set of units so I just do not know if I should be asking my teacher so I tell you which units to open, or do you already know which units to open for me? I know we're finishing up on this unit so I just wanted to make sure for our next steps. Thank You! Have a nice day :) Mentor 2023-10-03, 09:57: Hi Nicolo! It's so nice to hear that you were able to travel back to your hometown after such a long time away due to Covid. It must've been very fulfilling seeing your extended family and friends after so many years apart! I love hearing how involved you are with your extracurricular activities. It's funny that you mentioned your pharmacy job started through volunteering initially, as that's exactly how my job at the pharmacy started too! I agree that the job provides extensive learning opportunities, especially because there's so many drugs and medications that you get to learn the uses of. Door-knocking for the Food Bank must feel so rewarding as well, and although you mention it's not often, it must be fun to incorporate your ideas for school events and execute a vision you may have for other students to enjoy. I'm relieved to hear that your study habits don't bring about an unecessary amount of stress. I can agree that after overstudying, I too often don't realize I overworked myself until I do an exam that covers very basic concepts and I learned way more than I needed to haha. Thanks for your great comments on my pictures. :) Parkinson's is a debilitating disease and fortunately I haven't had anyone in my close family be affected with the disease, but diseases such as Parkinson's really does show us how much more there is to learn about the brain and the body. Sometimes I get in my head and think we know almost everything, but diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimers remind me that although there have been so many advancements in modern medicine, there's still so much more to be discovered, and we may be the generation that will see that! And yes, I think a big misconception of research is that it's all to find the ""end-all-be-all"" method for curing diseases, but even outside of developing new types of medication, there's so many other avenues of research in health that still provide valuable information on diseases that bring us one step closer to discovering cures/treatments. I completely understand how you feel with university admissions. It's a very stressful and daunting time for many high school students and I felt the same level of anxiety as I'm sure many other students felt too, especially something that feels so out of our control! I received similar ""you're smart, you'll be fine"" comments as well, and I think this will still apply for when I apply to medical schools next year, but I still get in my head. Even with positive affirmation from my loved ones, I too get stuck in thoughts of not being good enough, so I understand exactly how you feel! Since ""career exploration"" is one of our requred topics, I'll dive into university admissions in there with you (or one of your 2 mdodules of choice). I found Picture #2 when I was growing my interest in astronomy (more of a side hobby for me - nothing too crazy or drastic) but I came across the picture and it put into perspective how small we really are in comparison to other things outside of the world. Our hopes and dreams are really confined into this small planet in a universe full of several of them, many significantly larget than us, so I think it's moreso the idea that we are so small and ""insignificant"" (not in a way where we don't matter, rather just how much more there is outside of Earth) that keeps me grounded and also allows me to dissassociate myself from thoughts of being a failure (and you and I are both smart and hardworking people, so I don't think ""failure"" will necessarily apply in an extremely negative context to our future :P) Thank you for your engaging and fantastic comments! I really enjoyed working on the introduction module with you! Mentor 2023-10-03, 10:17: Great question about the modules! So your teacher wants us to complete the modules in this specific order: 1) From rural to urban 2) Career exploration 3) Adulting 4) and 5) Two of your choice Since we've wrapped up this module, I will open the ""from Rural to Urban"" module next. You are not required to do every activity in the module, so you can pick and choose which activities you'd like to do. It's unclear whether there's a deadline for when to complete each module, so I think our aim will be to do 1 module/month (except for one month where we will have to do 2 modules to complete them all on time). For the two modules of your choice, you can let me know which ones you're interested in now or you can decide after we complete the other 3 required modules first. Up to you! I'll open ""from Rural to Urban"" now and we can begin that module. If you ever have any questions unrelated to the module, feel free to ask them directly in the module we are working on or you can come back to this ""Start here"" section if you want all your general questions grouped somewhere specific! Let me know if you have any questions. :) Mentor 2023-10-17, 10:45: Just following up on my previous message - ""Adulting"" would be the next module according to your teacher, not the ""career exploration"" module. :) Mentee 2023-10-17, 15:01: Hi sorry for the late message. I would like for us to move on and work on the ""Adulting"" unit for the next few days. Thanks :) Mentor 2023-12-06, 09:37:  Mentee 2023-12-28, 23:19: Thanks for the insights! Never did I expect to be accepted this early lol. I enjoyed reading your examples on different methods of applying knowledge. It definitely piqued my interest because it is something to look forward to/prepare for in university. I'm sort of glad that such a concept exist because in a way it is a breath of fresh air from just solely memorizing in high school. ( I'm not saying it'll be easy LOL) However, I did also get quite a bit comments about dealing with the content in organic chemistry. I did get the chance to take it last year and will take it this year too but we'll see what happens in university. (I'll probably be crying) I didn't want to message leading up to Christmas and so I planned to reply today and to touch base with you. I'm currently on my winter break but I've had fun doing this. After the break I only have 2-3ish weeks until this general course ends for me. Before the break, I asked my teacher about how this activity ends and they mentioned that the mentor themselves will be the ones ending the activity once appropriate to do so, not the teacher/a deadline. Since the resources you had provided me such as the templates have been WAY MORE than sufficient and I am more than satisfied I got to do this with you, and I never got a rubric but was only told to do 5 modules, I wanted to ask you. If we had exceeded the goal of this activity (pls let me know if we actually did 5 modules because it seems like we did from my side), would you be okay if this becomes our final module? I ask you because this course will be ending for me soon and so we will have to eventually say goodbye and I know this takes up your time and I presume you have a lot already. There is no time span required and I talked to my teacher and it just seems like it is to do 5 modules and talk about topics as the mentee. This assignment never got in the way or felt like I just want to get it over with. I've had the pleasure of discussing various topics with you but at this point, I had gained an abundant of knowledge to which I am okay if this ends here. Plus we will have to say goodbye either way once my course ends. If it does, I will be sending my final farewell message to you :) This will not be my final message. New Years is coming up so Happy New Year! Mentor 2023-12-30, 15:07: Hi Nicolo! Happy holidays and happy New Year! I hope you're having some nice time off. :) I have no doubts you will adjust well to the different learning styles in post-secondary. It seems you prefer it more than pure memorization :P I think it will be a fun change :) I believe there is one required module left (career exploration) then you complete your teacher's requirements! However, I do recall we discussed several careers with your interests in neuoscience/psycology and business, so doing that section again may be redundant. If you're able to, may you clarify with your teacher whether it is okay that we do not complete career exploration since we essentually covered it in another module together? If your teacher is alright with the last module not being formally completed, I'm happy to conclude the activities! Thank you again for being so involved and enthusiastic while going through the modules together! You have a bright future ahead of you :) Mentee 2024-01-15, 17:29: Hi Fermin, It's actually nice to hear about the argument of Psychology being an Arts major as when I was applying I did come across this obstacle. Most of the universities does list Pyschology being achievable through a Science or Arts degree (atleast from the website). Nonetheless, I wasn't asked to declare majors yet since I'm going into first year but that's why I asked about it. Thanks for the response! Please let me know if we've missed any requirements as I believe ReMBC/ my teacher are closing the communications in less than two weeks as that is when my course ends. Otherwise, I will be sending you a farewell message so this won't be my last :) Mentor 2024-01-16, 11:27: Yes! At UBC when I was in my undergrad, Psychology was only provided as an Arts major and it would have complicated the courses I needed to take to transfer, so I unfortunately passed on it (and I wanted to complete a BSc rather than a BA). UBC opened a newer major called Behavioural Neuroscience recently which falls under the Science program but encompasses several neuroscience-focused psychology courses. It falls along my interests A LOT more and if I had this option when I was picking my major, I think I'd do this major instead of biology. I really hope the activities were useful for you! I truly appreciate how engaged you were in each of the activities and you really used to activities to explore several aspects of post-secondary life. I believe you have completed all your requirements and are officially done the ReMBC program! Please feel free to message on the platform with any questions even after completion of the program. I will be happy to continue helping wherever I can. :) Best of luck in your future endeavors and once again, congratulations for your post-secondary acceptance(s) and nearing the end of high school!","Mentor 2023-10-03, 10:41: Welcome to the ""From Rural to Urban"" module! This unit will give you a chance to reflect on what you’ve gained from your rural community and to talk through some of the ideas and feelings you may be having about moving to a city (if that is what you are planning to do). Since you can choose how many and which modules you'd like to complete, let me know which activity you'd like to start with and we will work through it together. :) Mentee 2023-10-09, 18:15: Hi Fermin, I’ll start off this module with Lesson 1 and sharing my experience of living in a rural place. From where I live, it is quite a small town with only about 12 000 people, and only one high school. There is about 100+ of us graduating from the school, and most of the people I’ve known ever since we were grade 5 (my first school year in Canada). Living in a remote community has definitely shaped me as a person. In the past, I actually didn’t really see the good in living in a rural place as I was focused into wanting the city life. I still want to experience the city life, but as I grew more mature and got involved with the community around me, it made me realize the values I can garner from a very small community. Such values I had realized and shaped me are learning the importance of collaboration, building strong relationships, and proactively trying to contribute to the community. From where I live, it intensifies the word “community” and the action of “doing your part as a community member” because the next town is 2 hours away by drive from where we are. I brought the scenario to attention because as I grew older, I realized that we are so remote, that the same people I see in my school during the day, are also the same people I will see working after school, serving the community. Another situation that made me realize the values of being a community member is during some holidays, the pharmacy that I work in will be the only one open for the day. It was an eye-opening experience to think that in a way, I am subconsciously contributing to the community. Additionally, the extracurriculars that I can do are revolved around the community. Even if it’s a school club, we always are encouraged to plan something that allows us to help the community. The values I gathered from living in a rural place can help me with my education or career by building and maintaining strong relationships around me, collaborating on tackling challenges, and oftentimes, just doing acts of kindness. I believe that the list I just mentioned are very important concepts that can have positive impacts in our life. I think that the values taught me to grow as a a leader; and I say that it’s not something I expected considering I was always a shy kid. But I’m very happy that this is the outcome and I can use the skills and knowledge to take on new challenges in my education or my career. Mentor 2023-10-11, 15:55: Hi Nicolo! That was very well written and I appreciate your reflection on living in a remote community. Although I cannot relate to living in a rural community, I can understand the feeling of community when you refer to being from a small town and familiarizing yourself to everyone around you. I really liked how you mentioned that living in your town intensifies the word “community” and the action of “doing your part as a community member.” This was really beautifully written because it showcases how intertwined you and your community members are with one another and that everyone depends on each other in some shape or form. Another part I really enjoyed reading was your reflection on your role in the pharmacy and how you are directly contributing to your community - and I can agree that you play a big role in it, especially being the only pharmacy open on holidays when people may desperately need their medications. You are playing a critical role in these people's health and that's a big impact to have. Same with your extracurriculars and their involvement in your town. I agree that your actions truly embody the meaning of community. It's wonderful to hear how your experiences contributed to your growth as a leader and fostered the growth and maintenance of strong relationships. Although I cannot relate directly to your situation, the Bengali community in Vancouver is relatively small compared to other cultural communities here, and I also feel that being part of such a community also allowed me to maintain strong relationships with friends and family, and it is a humbling experience being surrounded by those who've watched you grow into the person you are today. Overall, it's really nice to hear about your experience living in a rural community and how it shaped your growth over the years living there, and I agree that the skills you've acquired will serve you well when you are in the city! My experience living in the city I would say is similar, but I don't think I've felt that I've strongly impacted my community as much as you, mostly because the lower mainland is quite large and my actions seem very small in the grand scheme of things. Not to say I don't believe my actions had positive impacts in others' lives (ex. volunteering with Kids Help Phone, working at a pharmacy and eye clinic and helping with patient care, etc), but maybe because I saw/spoke to so many people and the lack of follow-up I'd recall having with several people, it would feel slightly less impactful to me. However, I think this is my own poor thinking and objectively, I know I am creating a positive impact to those in my city no matter the magnitude. It's interesting that in your reflection you mentioned that those you go to school with are sometimes the same individuals you see working after school. With me, this was not as common of an experience, and often seeing others from school at their workplace wasn't as frequent as it may have been for you. I really appreciate all you've shared and it really put into perspective what living in your town is like, so thank you! Because it is up to you which activities we complete for each module, would you like to continue in this module or move forward to the ""career exploration"" module?",,,,

Since we haven't finished the last module, we can work on them at the same time. To get started on the ""Adulting"" module you can work through the warm up section and then you can think about and send your response to the dicussion questions: ""How are you feeling about the responsibilities you will need to take on as an adult? Do you think you’re ready? It’s alright if you are not – you still have time to learn and you have your mentor to help!"" Please let me know if you have any questions :). Mentee 2023-11-01, 11:53: I don't think I have any questions at the moment about the idea yet but if I do I will definitely let you know :) Mentor 2023-11-01, 21:30: Of course! Have you had a chance to think about the discussion questions in this module? Mentee 2023-11-06, 17:15: What did you find surprising/challenging about transitioning into adulthood What did you find the most challenging about budgeting Mentee 2023-11-15, 14:32: i will defently try those for sure i did have a couple other questions like What do you recommend for trying to balance a part time job with school work? how do keep track of all the money and payment dates. Mentor 2023-11-15, 22:41: Hi Makenzie! I definitely think it can be difficult to manage a part time job along with school work but it can work well if you stay organized. If you know when you are working ahead of time, I would suggest writing that down in your agenda along with the assignments/work you need to get done for the week. Once you have this all written out, you can allocate time to study for each subject! Also make sure to always take care of yourself in the process :), you don't want to get burnt out! Having a budget is a great way of keeping track of your money and making payments! You can either do this on the computer or in a notebook, wichever why works best for you! Personally I write it all down in my phone so I always have easy access to it! Do you have any experience using an agenda and/or a budget? Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:04: I do have a bit experince with agendas have not used one in a couple years though. I dont have experience with butget at all. Defently plan on using an agenda and any other things to help stay organized. Mentor 2023-11-21, 19:16: Hi Makenzie! That is great! Those are great resources. If you feel as though we have addressed all of your questions for the ""Adulting"" unit, would you like to move on to another unit? Has your class started working on the unit ""Career Exploration"" yet? If not, we can finish working on the unit ""From Rural to Urban"" that we started in the first few weeks. Mentee 2024-01-08, 14:52: i think i am ready to start the career exploration i believe i am finished adulting and from rural to urban",,,"Mentor 2024-01-14, 13:51: Hi Makenzie! How are you doing with your progress on this unit? Have you had a chance to do the warm up activity and write down some of your goals/aspirations? I hope school is going well! Mentee 2024-01-14, 16:02: How do you want to contribute to your community and the world?• Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers ? Mentor 2024-01-16, 09:37: Hi Makenzie, would you feel comfortable sharing your responses to those discussion questions? Do you have any ideas for careers you think you might want to pursue? Mentee 2024-01-19, 14:17: Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? my dream careers is photography, hairstylest, or a house designer. How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? i want to contribute to particapating in fundraisers or charity events. What do you value in life? patience. kindness. Mentee 2024-01-24, 13:55: How did you choose your career? • Were you ever considering a different career? Why did you change their mind?• What are some things that you wish you would have known about career choices while you were still in high school? Mentor 2024-01-24, 15:50: Hi Makenzie! Unfortunately I can't fully answer your questions as I am still in university, but I will try my best! At the moment I am studying Biology at UBC and am aiming to be a veterinarian. I chose to try and be a veterinarian as I have always loved animals and knew I wanted to work in animal care in some capacity. I have briefly considered other careers, but knew I wanted to work in the animal health field. I think it's important to recognize that there are so many options when it comes to careers and many will be unknown to you until you encounter them. Please let me know if you have any other questions! :) Mentee 2024-01-24, 18:03: Will photography allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? Will this career offer me financial security?",,,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 10:22: Hi Makenzie! How are you? My name is Rhianna and I am a 5th year student at UBC studying Biology. Once I graduate I want to apply to veterinarian school. In my free time I like to hangout with friends, go to the beach and read. What do you like to do for fun? I look forward to getting to knowing you :)! Rhianna Mentor 2023-09-25, 13:56: Hi Makenzie!

If you've finished going through the ""Start Here"" module, just let me know and we can get started on ""From Rural to Urban."" Have a great weekend! Mentor 2023-10-12, 12:08: Hi Makenzie, just checking in to see if you've had time to work on the ""From Rural to Urban"" module and if you have any questions. Hope you had a great long weekend :). Rhianna Mentor 2023-10-24, 15:53: Hi Makenzie, I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing and if you have had the chance to make any progress on the module? Hope you're having a great start to your week! Mentee 2023-10-26, 14:13: the responsibilities for becoming an adult is a bit nervous but i think ill do fine i think im ready but at the same time im not. have mixed feelings about it Mentor 2023-10-26, 21:33: Hi Makenzie! I definitely understand that feeling! I felt the same way in high school, there are a lot of unknowns that come with growing up. Are there any specific adult responsibilties that make you feel nervous? Do you have any questions about any of the responsibilities? Mentor 2023-11-06, 17:01: Hi Makenzie! I hope you had a great weekend! Have you had a chance to work on the discussion questions? :) Mentee 2023-11-06, 17:08: My weekend was boring haven't had time to discuss the questions I will go through them tonight, hope you had a good weekend Mentor 2023-11-14, 11:04: Hi Makenzie! I hope you had a good weekend! Those are great questions. I found time management to be the hardest part of adulthood for me. When living at home I didn't realize how much time it takes to get groceries, cook and clean. I found that creating a time budget was really helpful. So I would allocate a certain amount of time for each activity/ chore I needed to get done every week. To answer your second question, I found budgeting a little difficult at the beginning because I hadn't done it before but I would recommend looking at prices of things like groceries and rent to give yourself an idea of how much you want to set aside for each thing! Please let me know if you have any more questions! Mentor 2023-12-04, 10:50: Hi Makenzie! I just wanted to check in to see how you are doing? And if you've had a chance to work on any of the units? Mentee 2023-12-18, 14:51: living in the city can be very stressful especially if people have a rough time sleeping or just even focusing on things and can get very distracted. why tdid you want to be a mentor on this program? would you be able to explain something in your poem/photos or their profile that im not familiar with? choose one thing that stood out in their poem/photos, and why its significance or why you chose to share it. Mentor 2023-12-19, 19:10: Hi Makenzie! I agree, there can be a lot of difficulties moving to a big city. I find that a lot of things solve themselves over time as you get used to it. I'm not sure what part of my profile you are refering to, but for your other question, I decided to be a mentor for this program because I felt that I could help other students who are in a similar position as I was. Immediately after graduating high school, I moved to a big city and started at a very big university. It was a transition that took a lot of work and time and I felt that it would have been easier if I had a mentor at the time. I hope I can help you feel more comfortable about moving and transitioning to adulthood! Mentor 2023-12-19, 19:13: Do you feel ready if we were to move onto the other required unit, ""Career Exploration""? If you've had a chance to complete ""Adulting"" and ""From Rural to Urban"", I can open the next topic and we can start working on it! Just let me know :). Mentor 2024-01-21, 00:05: Hi Makenzie! Those are super cool careers! What is it about them that you find appealing? Have you had a chance to do any of those activities before? Mentor 2024-01-22, 15:55: Hi Makenzie! Unfortunately, this is the last week that you will be working on this program for your class. However, I wanted to let you know that I would love to continue working on this program even after you finish it in your class. Of course that is only if you would like to continue working on the program! I will open up the ""Wrapping up"" module for us to work on! Have a great day! :)","Mentor 2023-10-03, 14:25: Hi Makenzie!

Thank you for sharing that information! To get you thinking a llittle bit further, we can also work on the discussion questions: What are some strengths that you have gained as a result of living in a rural community? How will these strengths give you a leg up in your education or career? How might you use your future education or career to help address some of the challenges your community faces? Please let me know if you have any questions! Mentee 2023-12-07, 14:47: I dont think i finished any other units but defentily should finish Rural to urban. If i had any feelings about the city life i defentily think its to busy i personally find it nicer outside of town/ city. i find that some challenges are trafic especially at night but some advantages are that you are close to everything instead of a couple hours to get to everything. Mentor 2023-12-07, 15:05: Hi Makenzie! I agree! The traffic and amount of people can get overwhelming sometimes. Personally I found it a nice transition to go from living in Kelowna to going to UBC. That's because UBC feels like a small town of its own, so I was able to stay there most of my first year while I was adjusting to living away from home. I limited the amount of times I went into downtown Vancouver in my first year as I felt it could get overwhelming but now I love the city! Maybe something similar will happen for you! Just looking at the discussion questions for the first lesson: Rural Living, have you had a chance to think about those? I think they would be great to work on! Mentor 2024-01-08, 17:47: Hi Makenzie!

I truly enjoyed working with you and talking to you despite the limited time you had. There has been so much to learn for me from meeting you. I had no idea the world of cheerleading was so competitive--and how you and your team managed to secure a bid. Thank you again for your time with this program and for talking to me!

It's been some time since we last connected, I am wondering how you are doing and whether you need any help with some of the activities. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-20, 18:45: Hey Mya-lena! I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about who I am and what I'm passionate about. My name is Edmond, (Edmond or Ed is fine :)) and I'm currently a student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), pursuing a degree in the Faculty of Arts. One of the driving forces behind my academic journey is my career goal of eventually pursuing criminal law. I find the intersection of psychology and the legal system to be absolutely fascinating, which is why I've chosen to focus on these areas during my time at UBC. I believe that understanding human behaviour and the intricacies of the law will be invaluable in a law career. I've heard you're also keen on criminal law, which is awesome! I'm eager to share insights and experiences related to these fields, and I believe we can learn a lot from each other throughout our mentorship. Outside of academics, I'm a bit of a sports enthusiast. You'll often find me snowboarding, golfing, and getting into various sports. It's a great way to unwind. Plus, English is another area I'm also very passionate about, especially since my days with AP English Literature and Language. I'm always here if you need advice or just someone to chat with. I'm really looking forward to getting to know you better. Our shared interests in sports and English and my background in the Faculty of Arts, combined with our mutual love for criminal law, should make for some interesting and productive conversations. Feel free to reach out whenever you want to chat or have questions about anything. I look forward to connecting and supporting you in your academic and personal pursuits! Regards, Edmond PS Let me know if there's any other name you prefer to go by!

It is so great to finally connect with you. Thank you for sharing the photos; they look great! I am more of a dog person, but both of your pets sound awesome. What are their names?

The drink really grew on me, so its either water or diet Coke whenever I go out for food. Your cheering record is really impressive. From my knowledge, Worlds cheer championships are held in the U.S. annually, right? Where in the U.S. have you been to before? Have you been to Vancouver? Anyways, no worries about being late, I'm happy to be able to connect. Let me know if you have any questions about school planning, work-life balance, time management, or even any questions about me - I'm happy to answer. Mentee 2023-10-12, 20:21: Hi, your dog is so cute!! my cat is a white maine coon and his name is Massimo, my dog is a black an grey havaneese and his name is Diesel. I used a picture of a dog and a cat for my collage that I found online because I did not know how to attach my own photos on canva haha That is so funny that we both love Diet Coke!! It's been my go to drink since I was little and my mom and I both drink it. For cheer, I went to Las Vegas last year for a competition and we placed second. I lived in a small town in alberta up until this year so most of my competitions were within the province. Championships and Worlds are the ones in the U.S. so my team went to Vegas for a Championship. We were supposed to go to Orlando for The Cheerleading Worlds May 2024 because we got a bid from the judges at a competition (there are 2-5 bids that they give out to certain teams at certain cheer competitions and normally there are hundreds of teams and we got a bid), however since I moved I will not be attending:( It's okay though! I will cheer on my team from BC haha Mentee 2023-12-08, 14:12: Hi Edmond! I am truly sorry for not responding for so long. I have been so busy with school and applying to universities and cheerleading. I've been doing well just super stressed out, How have you been doing? Regarding the Adulting unit, I am still not too sure how this works or what I am supposed to say. if I could get some guidance on that it would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to your response! Mentor 2023-12-08, 14:45: I'm glad to hear from you, and I completely understand how busy life can get, especially with school, university applications, and cheerleading. It's impressive how you're managing all these responsibilities. It's okay to feel stressed, but make sure you take some time for yourself from all the hustle. I've been doing well, thanks for asking. Life is always just a bit chaotic. I've got a couple of final exams in a week, looking forward to that. For the Adulting unit, let's break it down. This unit is all about preparing you for independent living, covering essential skills and financial management. For now, let's focus on Lesson 1. I recommend starting with the warm-up unit just to get in the zone of thinking about some of the issues covered in this unit. After that, you can move on to the worksheet in lesson one. Looking forward to your message. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help with anything.

Regards, Edmond Mentor 2023-10-13, 14:12: I'd love to see Massimo and Diesel if you're able to upload their pictures, but if not, that's totally fine no pressure haha Your cheerleading record is really impressive! It'll be a valuable asset for your portfolio for all sorts of applications in the future. I'm sad to hear you won't be able to compete with your team for next year's competition. Is cheering something you are considering continuing in the future? Just as an example, UBC has an excellent cheerleading team. If cheering is something you'd be interested in continuing, there are some great opportunities at the university capacity. It's really cool that you've been to Las Vegas. I was lucky enough to visit a few years back. Besides being really hot, I really enjoyed the city, how did you find the city?",,,,

I'm thrilled to have you as my first mentee this term and I'm really looking forward to working with you for the upcoming semester! Let me introduce myself a little bit. My name is Rosie and I studied music performance and music education in university. Music has always been a big part of my life and I enjoy playing, listening to, making, and exploring different types of music. I started playing the piano when I was in elementary school and a few years ago, I picked up the ukulele just for fun. More recently, I learned a little bit of flute - I can play Happy Birthday and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, but that's pretty much it for now. I'm eager to get to know you better, so could you please tell me a bit about yourself? It would be great to plan our activities based on your interests, passions, and the purpose of your participation in this program. If you're not sure where to start, perhaps you could answer some of the questions below: - How's school going for you? - What do you enjoy the most about school? And is there anything you dislike the most about it? - What would you like to get out of the E-mentoring program? - Who are the musicians that have inspired you both musically and in life? - Why would you like to pick fashion and modelling as your career in the future? - Additionally, do you have a favourite song? I'd love to know what kind of music you would recommend to your friends, or even to me! Remember, you can always reach out to me whenever you have a question or a topic you'd like to talk about. I'm here for you! Looking forward to our future conversations! Best wishes, Rosie Mentee 2023-10-04, 10:00: Hi Rosie i dont know where to really start! I am enjoying school, although im drained all of the time from dancing for 4+ hours everyday after school. I really like britney spears and marilyn monroe. Not just because i enjoy Brits music or they both have blonde hair like me but because they both have a story and theyre really strong women. Id like to learn more about myself during this program. Id like to be a model beause everyone tells me i should be one and I have all the atribuits to be a model. I dont really have one favorite song that is something id have to think about for a really long time. Thanks Rosie!!!!",,,,,"Mentor 2023-10-06, 17:08: Hello Amy, I hope this message finds you well. It's wonderful to hear from you and to see your enthusiasm in our communication. Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions; it truly helps me get to know you better. Wow I didn’t know you were a dancer! What kind of dance do you do? Are you with a dance club or a school program? I'm part of a dance club at my school, where we focus primarily on contemporary dance. It's a great outlet for my creativity and a fantastic way to stay active. Similarly, I understand how dance classes, can leave you feeling both tired and fulfilled. Even though I don’t do 4 hours of training like you do, I leave feeling tired and fulfilled after the class. Regarding Britney Spears, I'm thrilled to find another fan! Her music has a unique way of resonating with people, and her confidence and power are truly inspiring. I appreciate your kind words about finding empowerment within myself. It's something I've been working on, just like my dance moves! It’s so awesome to hear that you want to learn more about yourself! I'm excited to embark on this journey of self-exploration together. I really hope I can provide the kind of help you need for your self-exploration journey. According to the school's guidelines, we should start with the new unit, ""From Rural to Urban."" Please log into Mentor City, click on the unit in the Navigation Wheel, and explore the Warm-up section. I'd like to invite you to reflect on these questions: How do you feel about living in the city versus living where you are now? Would you rather live in the city or live in a rural area? What are the differences between living in the city and living in a rural area? You don’t have to share this with me if you don’t feel comfortable, but it would be a good idea to think about this before we get into the discussion. Once you've had a chance to think about the warm-up questions, please click on the Lesson 1 Discussion Questions. When you're ready, send me a message with your answers to the discussion questions regarding your current living situation. If you have any questions about what to do or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to our next conversation! All the best, Rosie",,,,

Something that I found surprising was the amount of independence you have as an adult. I always thought going to post-secondary there would be a strict schedule. However, in post-secondary, you have independence in creating your own schedule. Also, you are free to join clubs or activities. Also, as an adult there is more responsibility on you to figure out what to eat. This means you need to plan ahead of time what you need to go buy from the grocery store. Overall, the amount of independence and the freedom you have was surprising to me. I also found to be successful as an adult, time management skills are essential. 3.Some advice I would have is to join clubs where you can enhance your skills. For example, if you struggle with public speaking, you could join a drama club or a speech club. The best advice I have is ask your peers what they are doing. You can learn a lot of things from other people. Many of your peers will be going through the same stage of life as you and by talking with them you can bounce ideas and learn what works and what does not and adapt that to your life. Sincerely, Amrit Mentor 2023-11-02, 14:08: Hi Zachary, You seem to have a great start with the budgeting. With the job that you have it seems like you will be able save a decent chunk of money. Just a couple things: for your car, you have to take into gas if you do not have an electric car. One place where I believe that you could save money is using public transit instead of having a car if this is possible. Having a car can come with lots of extra expenses which can add up over time especially when you are just beginning your life as an adult. Overall, you have done a good job with this exercise. Is there anything else you want to ask me about budgeting or saving money? Sincerely, Amrit",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-18, 22:33: Hi Zachary, This is Amrit and I will be your mentor through this program.

Then complete the Lesson one background info and discussion questions. Feel free to send me questions as well. Once you have finished lesson 1, here is a question to get you started: how are you feeling about the responsibilities you will need to take on as an adult? Do you think you’re ready? It’s alright if you are not – you still have time to learn and I am here to help! Mentee 2023-10-17, 09:20: Skill/Responsibility Confident? Concrete steps to gain experience and confidence Grocery Shopping Yes! Not Yet Go geocery shopping by myself more without my parents Cooking Healthy Meals Yes! Not Yet Look online for meal prep ideas, think about what to eat before House Keeping/Cleaning Yes! Not Yet Continue to clean as a go, dedicate a day off to clean Getting Around Town - Using Public Transit Yes! Not Yet Research quickest and most efficient routes on maps before hand Finding a Doctor, Dentist, etc. and making appointments Yes! Not Yet Go to appointments on my own, call my doctors on my own Paying Bills (on time!) Yes! Not Yet Put down what date on my calender that my spotify bill is due Doing Household Repairs/Calling for Repair Services Yes! Not Yet Search up how to repair broken things online Banking - opening an account, making e-transfers, bank draft, writing a cheque. Yes! Not Yet Continue to make e-transfers by myself Finding somewhere to live. Yes! Not Yet Look up places to live near my university or just live on dorms im excited to be responsible about my independence but im also a little bit scared since its just me at the end of the day and my decisions will lead to everything. what did you find challenging while transitioning to adulthood? Mentor 2023-10-17, 18:55: Awesome! I really like some of your concrete steps to gain experience and confidence with the skill and responsibilties that you completed. Having independence is a huge responsibility, but if you are surrounded by the right people and are in the right places you should not have a problem. It won't just be you at the end of the day, just remember that you truly are not alone since you have family and friends to connect with whenever you want to hear a familiar voice (whether it is over the phone, through facetime or perhaps a visit over the weekend). I would say there were a few things I found challenging when transitioning to adulthood and I still struggle with them, which honestly is okay! One thing would have been being more independent, in the real world and when it comes to academics. I had to start learning how to drive which was stressful, but I still managed. Studying without the hand holding teachers do in highschool was new for me as well, professors are still there to help in university but a lot of the material is self study when it comes down to studying for tests in my field. I would also agree and have to say attended some medical appointments alone can cause me to be a bundle of nerves, but with time I have gotten use to making my appointments and attending them alone. Finances are also something that I am starting to learn by myself, but I always ask for help when needed either from my family or people who work there. Mentor 2023-10-17, 18:58: Would you say you are ready to transition to adulthood? Mentor 2023-10-17, 19:04: Once you have answered my question, please feel free to ask me any burning questions about adulthood that you may still have. If not, please move onto lesson 2 which is about budgeting and managing money. You can begin with the background info link and send me your questions as you complete it. Then we will move onto the discussion questions. A question to get you started with this lesson: do you feel confident with budgeting your finances? If not, list one way you can improve this. If you do feel confident and only if you want to share, list one way that you budget your finances. Mentee 2023-10-23, 09:12: I think i'd have to adapt a lot and it would be challenging if i was thrown straight into adult hood right now but once i get to univerisity i'd definately transition better since ill have people around me who are going through the same things. I feel confident since i dont have a lot of money hahaha but once i do get money for univerisity i would probably have to put what i want to save in a locked account so i dont go crazy on it in one night haha. i can also buy a meal plan and occasionally go out of campus to buy other foods. I can also go through what i need with myself and save for what i want later. Mentor 2023-10-23, 13:08: That is understandble, you are only in highschool right now and have awhile to learn and transition into adulthood, haha. Also, you mentioned a good point, being around people your age who are doing the same things as you is a great way to help with transitioning into adulthood, especially if you share the same interests and more things such as classes and possibly career path and/or goals. I'm guessing since you have answered my questions about budgeting (the second lesson) you have had a chance to complete the lesson (background info)? Please let me know. In response to your answers, having separate accounts would be the best idea. I would also suggest that you can speak with a financial advisor as I found them to be helpful. I'm not sure if all of them do this, but they can help with creating a basic budget plan for yourself and of course you can then add to it as you go along. I like how you are starting to think of ways to save/ budget your finances either by starting now or once you get into university. To continue with the second lesson, please take the time to complete the background info materials and content. This is a great exercise for yourself. Once you have finished the worksheet, please save it to your portfolio. This way I can review it and give you some tips on where you can earn or save money. Also, if you come up with any budgeting/financal questions of your own while completing the activity, ask away!

and what was the most challening budgetting issue for you? Mentor 2023-10-24, 14:33: Good job with completing the activity/worksheet and I hope you were able to learn something from filling it out! One thing that I wanted to mention after looking at your budget plan is that in addition to working which might not be so easy while in school, you can also apply for scholarships and student loans as they are always useful. To answer your questions: Some recommendations I have would be during school, if you can, try to get a job on campus whether it be tutoring or working in a cafe or one of the many restaurants on campus. I know working while being in school can be a struggle for some people, so working after hours or during your breaks (i.e., winter and summer holidays) is always the next best thing. Many students also apply to clothing stores near campus or where they live as well to make some extra money on the weekends or their days off. It varies for each person, right now I am working two days a week (on the days I don't have class) and then I sometimes cover a shift if it works with my schedule. The most challenging budgeting issue for me would probably have to be related to my shopping and focusing on when i should really be spending my money (buying things) and differentiating between the needs and the wants. Do you currently work right now? If so, how do you keep track of all your money and all your payment dates? Please ask me anymore questions that you may have! Mentee 2023-10-27, 09:20: I cover shifts at a local tutoring business right now. The only payments i need to make monthly are my spotify payments, which get automatically renewed. Also same, I also have a hard time differentiating on my needs and wants as i sometimes get carried away with shopping online hahaha. where do you work the two days a week? Mentor 2023-10-29, 15:05: That's interesting! What subjects do you help tutor? It is nice to know I am not the only one with this dilemma haha, although I feel like it might be very common among others. The two days a week that I am doing during the school year are at an eye clinic, I am an optometric assitant. Other times when not working or studying I also volunteer at a hospital near UBC. When I am not in school, I try to pick up as many shifts as possible. Mentor 2023-10-29, 15:16: I really appreciate your questions and effort with engaging with myself and the units! If you do not have anymore questions related to Adulting and Budgeting, please fill out the survey above (below the ""Next Steps"" heading) as we have now completed this unit. Once you have completed the survey, we will move onto the third unit you are required to complete which is Career Exploration. Then after this unit you will get to choose two or more units of your choice (this is dependent on how much time we have) so please keep this in mind and perhaps think of which other units you would like to explore. For now, please click on the ""Career Exploration"" title in the wheel at the very top as this will be our next unit and has now been unlocked. We can continue our conversation under the Career Exploration section. Talk to you soon!","Mentor 2023-11-22, 12:40: The unit: ""Post-Secondary and Career Planning"" is now open. Please read through the unit description and learning goals. Once you have finished that, you may move onto the warm up activity (this can be found above the first lesson). Then you may move onto completing the background information activity. Please let me know if you have any questions along the way. To start thinking about the material, please consider what this question means to you: What does it even mean to “get a degree”? (Suggestion: it might be best to send me your response to this question first before starting the background info activity). Mentee 2023-11-28, 11:11: What does it even mean to “get a degree”? I think it means to be more educated in a specific specialty. I think to go into the workforce right away they dont really care of degrees. They care more about experience so i think a degree is mostly something physical to be proud of that youve accomplished and that youve seeked higher education in whatever field after highschool. warmup Predict what you will do after high school, both immediately and longer-term. Why do you believe that this will happen? After highschool I'm going to university to get my bachelors and then ill get my medical degree and in the long term i predict that i will open up my own independent practice in vancouver or toronto. I believe that this will happen because I will never give up on making my dreams come true since i still havent given up on anything. I always find a way to do whatever i dream up. Mentor 2023-11-28, 16:48: Thank you for sharing your response to the warm-up activity/question. I really like how determined you are towards achieving your goal and how you already have a plan set in place. Perseverance is key and you clearly have it! The other warm-up questions are for yourself, so as long as you have completed them we can continue with the background info activity. Good job with answering the question of what it means to ""get a degree"" to you. In the background info activity you will be looking at what education you need in order to achieve your career goals. Please follow the instructions as listed once you click the link and please send me any questions you may have along the way when completing the activity. Please remember to focus on Lesson 1 just for now, so that we can move onto the discussion questions after. When you have finished the background activity, please think and answer these questions: How do you feel about the education required for your chosen careers? How easy or hard is it to gain the education you need for your dream career versus your more realistic choice? Is it different than you imagined? Mentee 2023-11-30, 11:18: How do you feel about the education required for your chosen careers? How easy or hard is it to gain the education you need for your dream career versus your more realistic choice? Is it different than you imagined? My realist career choice is to become a specialized surgeon and my dream career choice would to be a CEO To be a surgeon it takes around 12-14 years after highschool. You have to get a bachelors degree, go to medical school, residency and an optional fellowship. I think the education required makes sense but the lenght of the education is super long. I also think that it costs way to much to put yourself in medical school and then after you have to do residency with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt when you barely get paid what you deserve. For my dream career choice as a CEO you usually need a degree in business/engineering related things or anything. It doesnt take much but it does take a lot to run a succesful business since usually not a lot of businesses are really successful. I think its easier to gain education to be a CEO than to be a surgeon because you dont even need a degree to run a successful buisness and usually people start from nothing. Its kind of a gamble but its a hard one. With being a surgeon medical school is hard to get into especially in canada but after you're in, you'd be guarenteed a job after graduation since theres a nation wide shortage and that there will always be a need for doctors. Its a safe option to be a doctor but you could also experience burnout. At first I thought you needed more education to become a CEO but then most CEOs have just a bachelors degree or even nothing. I do think its crazy that even after medical school when you get to residency you get paid minimumly when youve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get yourself through school to just be paid minimumly after all the education and money you spent. Mentor 2023-12-01, 12:57: Thank you for answering the questions. You have made some good points related to each of the professions/careers you have chosen. With all this in mind and your work on the background info activity, would you say that you are leaning more towards your dream career as a possible realisitc career? For both careers, there are advantages and disadvantages and it is good that you are assessing both. To be a CEO, I think it varies for individuals based on how much expertise they have in given/said field. Nowadays, I feel like with either becoming a CEO or surgeon or any other career for that matter, higher education/ getting a degree is what is needed for most high paying jobs and even then people have to pursue more education after getting a bachelors degree to even survive and live, given inflation. It also depends on where you plan on studying and potentially living because it might not necessarily always be BC. Further, you mentioned the idea of burnout, which I liked because it shows that you are considering your health (mentally, emotionally and phyiscally) when it comes to choosing a career. Burnout is something we will touch on in another unit, but it is nice to see that you are incorporating this idea into this unit. Now we will continue to work on the Lesson 1 Discussion Questions, focusing on the questions under the ""Share"" heading. Please share your responses to BOTH of the prompts: Three or more reasons you would benefit from attending college or university. Three or more factors that you think might make it challenging for you to obtain the education and experience you’d need for BOTH careers you explored. AND please go ahead and ask me any of the questions listed under the ""Ask"" heading! You can start off by asking one at a time or all of them, you can choose. Mentor 2023-12-19, 15:26: Hi Witayanee, I hope you are doing well! I understand that the holidays are upon us and you will be on winter break, but I wanted to check in with you to see how you have been and whether you have worked on the questions I last sent you regarding this unit. I hope to hear from you soon! Mentor 2024-01-10, 17:10: Hi Witayanee, Happy New Year and thank you for your message! I am sorry for the late response, with the holidays and then recovering from being sick it has taken me awhile to reply. I hope you enjoyed your holidays! With regards to your response, job security and guarantee are two very important factors. Great job with answering the questions as well. Nowadays to get a job or step ahead in the career paths a degree is usually needed and sometimes even a second degree. Money is always an issue as well that everyone struggles with, including myself. Most students who obtain a higher education end up having debt to pay off which can be tough, but there are always resources you can access for help. Please go ahead and ask me a few of the questions under the ""Ask"" heading of the discussion questions. If you have no more questions regarding Lesson 1 or the discussion questions, then we can move onto Lesson 2. Please begin by familiarizing yourself with the learning goals and then move onto the background info activity. As always, have fun with it and if you have questions along the way I am happy to answer them. Have fun planning your journey! Mentor 2024-01-15, 14:29: Hello! Just checking in to see how you have been and whether you have started Lesson 2 yet? I hope to hear from you soon! Mentor 2024-01-17, 14:44: Hi! As we are approaching the end of the program, I would like to ask whether you would like to stay in contact and continue to work through the remaining units. It is completely optional. However, if you would like to end the program, which is fine as well, please click on ""Wrapping Up"" on the navigation wheel. Please let me know! Thank you!",,"Mentor 2023-10-29, 18:22: The Career Exploration unit is now opened. Please read through the unit description, learning goals and the warm up just before Lesson 1. Then complete the Lesson 1 background info and feel free to send me questions as you start to think about the material and work through the unit. For the background info exercise, you can watch all of the videos if you have time, but choose at least one video to watch. While watching the video, consider the following: before jumping into career exploration, it can be helpful to evaluate what you value in life. What kind of mark do you want to leave on your community and on the wider world? What do you value in life? Also, think about how your values can inform your career choice. You can use the following questions about the videos you just watched to organize your thoughts: What are some of the values expressed by the speakers in the two videos and how did those values shape their career choices? How do these values align with your own? In watching these two videos, did you realize something new about what might shape your own career choices? How might these realizations change your career goals? I look forward to reading your responses! Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:26: I help tutor english and math to middle schoolers and under Mentor 2023-10-30, 11:13: Hi Witayanee, You completed the wrong survey, please complete the survey for the Adulting unit so that it can be marked as completed. You filled in the survey for this new unit, Career Exploration. Once done, please follow my instructions that I posted in this unit yesterday (message from Oct 29th). Thank you! Mentee 2023-10-31, 10:33: I value myself most importantly, money and my family and friends. I want to contribute with the world by being a doctor and opening my own practice. My dream careers are being a CEO but I can try to obtain that when im a doctor and then opening more practices around the world. How did your values inform your career choice? Mentor 2023-10-31, 14:39: This is a good start, but perhaps you can start to think about more deeper values for example: unity, integrity, happiness, and responsibilty. Do you have any core values that you live by/follow and plan on using when you get into your desired career? By being a doctor and opening your own practice, this is good but also what type of mark will this leave on your community and/or the wider world? Through my life experiences, I have learned and instilled many values in my life. Some values such as being compassionate and respectful are helpful when working in healthcare and are well observed in the professions. Working as a team has always been one core value that I abide by and it allows for a great working envionment. Also, integrity is another value displayed by healthcare professionals, through their commitment to integrity and ethical practices. Overall, I find that there are many values that healthcare professionals display and one day I hope to share similar and new values with others. Mentor 2023-10-31, 14:42: Please remember to complete the background info exercise. While watching the video, consider the following: before jumping into career exploration, it can be helpful to evaluate what you value in life. What kind of mark do you want to leave on your community and on the wider world? What do you value in life? Please let me know which video you have watched as well, for my reference. Also, think about how your values can inform your career choice.

I am just following up on the questions and our conversation from last week. I was wondering if you had the time to work on them, if not, that is fine as you can work through the questions this week. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentee 2023-11-08, 09:03: Hi zarrah sorry for the long wait i got carried away! I watched the UNBC strenghtening communitites video about the rural nurse. I want to leave a mark that will help people in the wider world. Most importantly, I value myself. I also value my family and friends, along with money. In the video she always wanted to come back to her home town, fort saint john, because she values her community. Although I dont want to return to my community, I'd let to return to help my parents as i value them. When watching the video i thought about if i want to come back to my small town after school. This realization could lead me to coming back since theres a physician shortage here. Mentor 2023-11-08, 12:29: No worries, it is nice to hear back from you! What type of mark do you want to leave that will help people in the larger aspect of the world? Your responses are very surface level which is a good start, but I encourage you to dig a little deeper if you can. Those are some important values which I can relate to as I also value my loved ones. Well done with making a connection with the video content and your personal values as well as to the idea that there is a physician shortage, thus more physicians will be in demand. After answering my question above, if you do not have anymore questions about Lesson 1 we can move onto Lesson 2. Mentor 2023-11-08, 12:29: No worries, it is nice to hear back from you!

Please go ahead and review the learning goals and begin the background information activity. This will need to be done first before we move onto the discussion questions. Once you have finished the background info activity, please let me know. Also, take a shot at this thought activity after completing the background info exercise: Select THREE career options from your Career Discovery Quiz results. For each option note the demand for the job, the expected salary, and the regions where the work is most needed. As always, please share your work if you would like and feel free to ask me any questions related to this topic/unit. Have fun with the quizzes and exploring potential career paths! Mentee 2023-11-14, 09:21: What type of mark do you want to leave that will help people in the larger aspect of the world? The type of mark I want to leave people is I want them to be understood without judgment. Mentee 2023-11-14, 09:39: I did the abilities quiz and i got an 88% verbal ability, 85% general learning ability and 69% manual dexterity. 1. Registered nurse high demand, expected salary is $87,595 and around vancouver/ vancouver island is where nurses are in the most demand. 2.Civil engineering 1,200 job openings in bc, expected salary $77,167 and theyre most in demand also in the vancouver area 3. physiotherapist\ 1,920 job openings in bc, expected salary $89,681 and in kewlowna theyre most in demand Mentor 2023-11-15, 14:14: Thank you for asking this question: What type of mark do you want to leave that will help people in the larger aspect of the world? I really like your answer. A free space without judgement is always appreciated. The type of mark I would want to leave on the world (this is something that I tend to do anyways), but any small act of kindness whether it is helping someone who is less fortunate, volunteering at the soup kitchen, simply saying thank you to the bus driver or saying good morning to those that I pass by. I feel like any small act of kindness can resonate through our world. Also, I like to share any advice based on my own experiences with others as well. Mentor 2023-11-15, 14:26: Great work on the abilities quiz, were you expecting those professions and results? Those are all very good careers as well and ones that are in high demand. Would you consider pursuing any of the three careers you got as either a back-up plan or instead of your original career choice? Please click on the Discussion Questions under Lesson 2: Career Discovery and complete the ""Share"" section. Please be sure to read the instructions and answer each of the questions. I look forward to reading your responses! Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:50: I agree with your small acts of kindness! I always try to help people who are less fortunate by donating. I was expecting some health care stuff but I didnt think I would get engineering. Before i was thinking of pursuing engineering but then i changed my mind into medicine. Its to good to know that i have the ability to become an engineer if i find that i dont actually enjoy medicine when i go out in the field. I don't want to consider any of these careers backup plans if medicine doesnt work out for me because medicine is all I see myself doing hahaha. Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:57: for lesson 2 i choose the career specialized surgeon Q1: I have a really strong interest in this type of work since being young and i havent changed my mind since. Im passionate about helping people when theyre at their weakest. Q2: This career will allow me to acheieve the worklife balance i want because i want to be a lasik eye surgeon or some surgeon where i can open my own practice. I can take my own holidays and be my own boss. Q3: Yes it will offer me financial security, especially if i open my own practice with lots of customers. Q4: Lots of opportunities, Canada and BC are in a very high physician shortage and everywhere needs doctors and surgeons so ill always have securities and opportunities everywhere. Q5: I can live anywhere but maybe if i decide to open up my new practice id like to live in a big city like toronto or vancouver where i can promote my buisness a lot and have a wide range of patients Mentor 2023-11-20, 12:41: I like that you were able to make a connection with the idea of small acts of kindess. Donations are always the best, especially during the holidays. Sometimes a career choice may suprise you. It is completely fine to be content with what you feel is right though, even after taking the quiz. I like how you already know that you want to do medicine, but always bear in mind that having a back-up is a good idea. Mentor 2023-11-20, 12:53: Interesting career choice. While reading your response, I also learned a few things along the way about the career I never knew before. I have some questions in response to your answers below, they are as follows: Q1: from your responses throughout this module, I understand that you have a strong interest in medicine. The question however is asking if you have a strong personal interest in being a surgeon though. Are you interested at all in being a surgeon one day? Q4: I guess it would depend on the type of surgeon you would want to be. Yes, there is a high physician shortage sucg as GP's/family doctors but is there a shortage in surgeons? Particularly the one you are interested in? It is good that you are thinking of these questions at a base level, but I would suggest diving deeper into the questions to get the most out of the information and conversation. Other than this, good work! Great work overall! If you do not have any questions for me, please let me know if you would like to complete the extension activity. Otherwise, please fill in the survey at the end of this unit. Mentor 2023-11-20, 12:55: Once you have finished the survey, please look through the list of the units and their descriptions and let me know which one you would like to do next so I can open it. We have finished all the required ones for your class, so that is great. The remaining units/conversations will be optional. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:08: Q1: I do have a strong interest in being a surgeon. Ive always had a strong interest in working with my hands and using precise tools since im good at doing the both. I'm very interested in being a surgeon one day Ive always dreamed of being one. Q4: I searched it up and In canada it says that between 2022-2031 theyll be a nation wide shortage of sugeons which is good because ill graduate univrsity in 2029 and then ill go onto medical school from then. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:14: we ca do post-secondary and career planning! Mentor 2023-11-22, 12:33: Thank you for answering my questions, its showing me that you are engaging with the material. I will open up the next conversation/unit. We can start with ""Post-Secondary"". We can continue our conversation there once it is opened.",,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 09:48: I am from a lamp From sheseido face wash and sheseido eyelash curler I am eating hotpot From having fun I am from the rundown From cedr trees I am from fireworks i am from frid bread from the school ghost ben The prince rupert the docks waves swaying my feet while i hear laughter Mentor 2023-09-19, 18:35: Hi Witayanee, It is nice to meet you! Great I am from... poem by the way, it was very intriguing to read. I wanted to quickly introduce myself before we get started on this program. I am a recent gradaute from UBC and I am planning on pursuing a career in healthcare. I am taking the time to explore different options, starting with medicine and optometry. I gradauted from UBC with a sciences degree. I enjoy swimming, hiking and going for walks. I also enjoy baking and watching movies. What are some of your interests/ favourite hobbies? Please go ahead and ask me anything you would like. Hopefully you get the most out of this program and I look forward to mentoring you and getting to know you a bit better! I was also wondering if you would be able to explain what ""school ghost ben"" is from your poem. I was having a hard time interpreting that line. Mentor 2023-09-19, 18:41: Here is my attempt at the I am from...poem: I am from a bustling city From wearing cozy PJs and a warm blanket while watching movies I am eating spicy butter chicken From having fun I am from the sun From gardening I am from the nightlife and music I am from reading from the Thunderbird The Vancouver the ocean and the forests wind blowing in my face while I'm surrounded by loved ones Mentee 2023-09-26, 11:26: Hi Zaraah its nice to meet you too. School ghost ben is kind of a legend that was made in elementary school, when the smartboard would randomly shut down all of the kids would blame it on school ghost ben. My hoobies are also going on walks, baking and reading i mostly read psychological thrillers since its my favourite genre. I'm interested into going into medical school after i finish university (but im still in highschool) and also interested in going into optamology or possibly dermatology. Are you a POC( person of colour)? Mentor 2023-09-27, 14:19: Thanks for explaining the background story behind school ghost ben, my highschool also had its own ghost haha. It's nice to know that we share similar hobbies and genres of books. I enjoy psychological thrillers and mystery novels as well. It is great to hear about your future interests and yes, I am a person of color. Moving forward so we don't fall behind, since we have finished this Start Here unit and its activitiees, please let me know which unit you would like to do next so that I can provide access to the unit. Details on how to access your chosen unit and the list of the units and their descriptions are above. Hope to hear from you soon! Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:02: i would like to do career exploration thanks Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:06: wait nevermind we're supposed to do rural to urban sorry for the mistake Mentor 2023-09-29, 17:18: That is okay. I have opened the rural to urban conversation, please go ahead and access it. We will continue our conversation there. Mentor 2023-10-04, 12:42: That is a great connection between your future career/education and your community. Sounds like a great and effective plan! Would you say you are looking forward to moving to the city in the future or would you prefer to stay in your rural town when you have finished your education? That is a good strength to gain, connections with community members and people in general are very useful when it comes to school, your career and just day-to-day tasks. Thanks for the question! I actually have never lived in a rural town before, so I am use to the city life so some strengths I have gained from living in a city would be that I have gained more independence. Being able to hang with my friends and family and build connections with my collegues is important too. Connections and independence have allowed for more experiences as well when it comes to my education and social life as well. I like how we have been able to find similiarites in our lives, great work! Mentee 2023-12-20, 11:24: Hi Zaraah I hope everythings going well! Im leaning towards my realistic career choice because of the job security and guarentee. I would benefit from attending univerisity by getting higher education in getting my bachelors in science degree so that it can take me to medical schoo, I would be the first person in my family to go to univerisity and theres more career oppotunities for me when im done. The reasons it might be hard for me to obtain the education i need for my careers is only money. I would be worrying about paying for school and being in a lot of debt so it wouldbe hard for me to focus. I hope you have a good holiday Zaraah Thank you!","Mentor 2023-09-29, 17:24: This conversation is open. Please read through the unit description and learning goals as well as the first lesson and its activities. As mentioned in the activities, please feel free to ask me any questions in the discussion questions document as well as any of your own questions if you have any. Also take the time to complete the reflection/thought exercises, with this in mind, I'd like to ask you a question relating to Lesson 1: How might you use your future education or career to help address some of the challenges your community faces? Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:47: I think about 12 thousand people live in my town and about 600 people go to my highschool. Students at my school like to hangout with eachother and go out to eat at local restaurants since there's not much to do. I like hanging out with my friends at the docks. Most of the students at my school do sports as an extra curricular but theres also student council and other little clubs around. I just do student council. The way i find my town special is the docks and the water view, there's nothing else thats special about here. From the community being small and going to school with the same people my whole life i've gained life long friends. If i end up going to the same university with some of my friends, i always have someone there for me since some people ive been in the exact same class with for 10 plus years. I can use my future education to leave this town for good. Mentor 2023-10-03, 13:30: Nicely done, thank you for sharing! Although the number of people in our town and schools is different, there are many similiarites that can be seen between your rural town and the city. Students here in the city also like to mingle with one another and go out to eat at restaurants as well as take part in fun activities. Sports are a big craze here as well as the club life. Many students are also engaged in extracurricular activities and sports here, we have student councils at the different schools too! There are also other extracurriculars and clubs such as leadership, band, physical education, and choir to name a few. I would have to agree with you and say that what makes my city special would also be the environment/landscape, the ocean views are breathtaking along with the forest views that can be seen on hikes or even city/park trails. Take a shot at answering some of these questions now: What are some ways that you can serve your community in the future? Are there any challenges that your community faces that you could help with in the future with your future career/education? Also, what are some strengths that you have gained as a result of living in a rural community? How will these strengths give you a leg up in your education or career? Feel free to ask me any questions you may have as well, I'm happy to share my thoughts! Mentor 2023-10-03, 13:32: Sorry forgot to include this before sending the last message: please feel free to ask me questions pertaining to Lesson 1 about rural living and the discussion questions associated with that lesson. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentee 2023-10-04, 09:34: I can help serve my community when im older by opening a modern optamology lasik eye surgery clinic. The hospital in my community is very run down and theres not enough nice workers or workers. If you have a servere medical emergency then you have to go on a medi copter to vancouver which is a hassle. I can help by encouraging my fellow med students to move to my town after theyr graduate. The strenghts i've gained are a stronger sense to connect with my community members. This strenght can help me connect with my peers in university and my professors if i ever need help in any of my courses. What are some of your strenghts you've gained from living in a rural town and then going to a city? Mentor 2023-10-04, 12:45: I posted this in the wrong conversation, my apologies. I have sent it again to the correct conversation now. That is a great connection between your future career/education and your community. Sounds like a great and effective plan! Would you say you are looking forward to moving to the city in the future or would you prefer to stay in your rural town when you have finished your education?

Mentor 2023-10-08, 17:41: Thank you for sharing your reason for whether you would return to your town or not after completing your studies. I am glad to hear you are excited to experience the city life soon. Absolutely! For Lesson 2, you'll watch the video Mobilize, then click on the Discussion Questions under Lesson 2. This part is about what city life is like. From the discussion questions and after working through any reflection questions, pick on prompt to answer and share it with me. I'm looking forward to answering your questions about what it is like to live in the city! Mentee 2023-10-12, 17:56: I know that living in a big city has a lot of opportunities for anyone, along with the city having almost everything for everyone and it being super energetic. I also really like the skyline views. I really like the city life and the hustle the city brings. My town is super depressing and theres no life to it. I also like how there are soo many opportunities in the city and so many things to do like food and entertainment. As the only things to really do here are exploring abandoned buildings and going to the mall that has like 6 stores in it. I also like how when you have to get to one place in the city it takes you on a journey. Some advantages i think of city life are that you never get bored and the endless opportunities. Some disadvantages are the costs of living in the city and the fact that theres so much people in it that there's really no chance to form a tight community like the ones in small towns. What are some challenges and advantages in city life for you and how did you feel when you moved to a big city from a small town? do you recommend using public transportation or bringing your own car. Also how hard is it to get into UBC? Mentor 2023-10-15, 21:47: Great work! So what would you say is one takeaway that you found important from the Mobilize video? I like how you were able to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of living in the city, it is always a good idea to view everything from both sides. I completely agree with you about the journey point, you actually will experience many different journeys. Cost of living is definitely a huge problem but finding some friends/family to live with always helps. Also, tight communities can still be formed surprisingly! Not so tight like the ones im sure you have/ are experiencing but you form them through your daily life tasks, for example when attending classes, or meeting new friends. I have actually never lived in a small town before, so the city life is pretty much what I am use to. I guess one challenge I can think of is when I had to start commuting to school, it was different compared to driving. I was no longer by myself or with my family but this time when commuting on the skytrain or many buses you encounter lots of people from different backgrounds and different areas of the city. So becoming familiar with transit took some time. This leads me to your next question, there are some pros and cons to both. If you live on campus, I would suggest public transit as it is more efficient. If you live off campus, to get to campus public transit can be useful because you save money and time (if there isn't a lot of traffic, which can sometimes be the case especially in the winter), driving would then be a good option at this point but if you do bring your own car to get to campus at least you do have to pay for a pretty pricey annual parking pass so I would personally avoid this. You would of course have to make the decision and assess yourself based on your daily activities, etc. To answer your UBC question, it doesn't really relate to this topic, but I will answer it anyways haha. It really depends on multiple factors, ultimately the decision is yours at the end of the day. It depends on the faculty you choose to apply to, overall you are competing with many students to get in but if you try really hard and work hard in all your classes and are achieving good marks you should not have a problem with making it in. I would also suggest joing extracurriculars which I believe you said you are part of, because grades are not the only component that make a person, everything is looked at. So I have a few questions for you now: are you nervous at all to move to the city one day? If so, how would you cope with this? Also what do you think will be the biggest challenge and opportunity for yourself when you do move to the city? Mentor 2023-10-15, 21:51: Once you have finished answering my questions, please feel free to ask me anymore questions, but also try both or at least one of the extenstion activites if you would like. Then when you have finished with the extenstion activities let me know. Remember you don't need to do both, you can choose one. Mentee 2023-10-16, 09:19: one takeaway i found important in the mobilize video was how the video quickly transitioned into modern city life and how the music got faster to match the pace of the city. Also what do you think will be the biggest challenge and opportunity for yourself when you do move to the city? I mean i'm a little bit nervous since its away from home and i've never lived in a big city before, only visited for a couple days haha. but im also excited to be independent in a big city and be surrounded by new opportunities. I can cope with it by if i'm feeling sad or anxious sometimes i can call my family and friends so that I can hear a familiar voice, I can also go for a walk or just put my headphones in and say to myself that i've already made it this far theres no point in turning back. I think the biggest challenge for me would be how to navigate the city and how to make new friends since i dont think so much of my friends want to go to UBC. An opportunity for me is internships the city offers to university students along with the city having just about everything. Mentee 2023-10-16, 09:26: extention activity easing transitions: at home i have the docks that i like to go to and at UBC i can go to the beach thats there. i also like to hike at a trail near the ocean and UBC also has a hiking trail near the its beach. Is the library nice at UBC? Mentor 2023-10-16, 13:06: Thank you for answering my questions! Its normal to be nervous especially if it is a new place you have not been to before, but it will take some time to get use to and I am sure you will fit in just well. Family and friends are always a good way to cope with anything, so I like how you were able to choose them as your first form of coping. Going for walks is a great option as well especially if you decide to live on campus as there are many scenic sights and trails to be explored. UBC has diverse clubs which you can join, this is a great way to build connections (i.e., make friends). In response to your extension activity, UBC has a couple of beaches that might be of interest to you. Just a heads up though there is one beach that you may want to avoid, its called Wreck Beach, although the views are nice sometimes people walk around in the nude there haha. You are correct, UBC does have many hiking trails around campus and off campus, so I am sure that is one thing you are looking forward to experiencing. There are many libraries at UBC, but yes overall they are all very nice and huge. Lots of spaces to study as well, whether you want a quiet study space (in a room or cubicles) or more of a collaborated study space (places where you can sit and study with others). There is also this place called the Ridington Room in IKB one of our main libraries that is called the harry potter room because of the way it is set up with the portraits of past and present presidents, definitely something to check out when you get the chance. Mentor 2023-10-16, 13:14: It seems like you have really learned a lot from this conversation and it is great to see that you are engaging with the material, especially with the extension activity and I hope it has been helpful to you.

Mentee 2023-11-21, 11:15: Hello, I hope all is well with you. I was not aware we also had to fill out this table, so I apologize for that. The website is a little unorganized for me. What was the most challenging budgeting issue for you? What do they recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? What was the most surprising thing they learned about themselves and money management in their first year of post-secondary education? How do they keep track of all their money and all their payment dates? I did not fill out my income because I do not feel comfortable sharing that information. Thank you. Mentor 2023-11-27, 22:15: Hi Sienna, Thanks for completing the table! The most challenging budgeting issue for me was food. In first year, most univiersties require you to have a meal plan (if you are in student residences), so you will be most likely eating at the campus dining halls if you are living on campus. When I moved out, I did not live on campus, so I had to buy my own groceries. This was challenging as when I lived at home, most of the groceries were purchased in bulk and the food was cooked for more people. As a result, it took me a few months of trial and error to figure out what my monthly budget for food needs to be. I worked part-time in first year! I would definately try to find a job that has more ""shift-work"" so there is more flexibilty around schedules. For instance, I worked in retail, so I was able to work out an arrangement with my manager where I was only scheduled on Fridays, Saturday, and Sundays as that was what worked best for my schedule. If you are working first year, I would try to aim for a slightly reduced work load in first term, so that you have more time to adjust to university instead of being stressed out about balancing everything. For instance, consider taking 3 or 4 courses instead of five. In terms of keeping track of everthing, I put everything on my credit card! That way at the end of the month, when I received my bill, I had a history of everything I spent money on. I would also recommend tracking your expenses using Excel budgeting sheets as havign a history of your purchases can help you determine what you need to allocate more or less of your budget to! Let me know if you have any other questions! I have opened the career exploration module. Please let me know what other modules you would be insterested on working on! Best, Jasleen",,,"Mentee 2023-11-29, 09:51: Hi Jasleen, How are you doing today? Thank you for responding in such depth. You gave lots of useful advice that I will be sure to keep in the back of my mind when I start University. A module I would like to do next is the “strategic studying.” Best Regards, Sienna Mentor 2023-11-30, 22:20: Hi Sienna, I am doing well! Thanks for asking :) Thanks for sharing your reflection on career explorations! I think your point on treating the symptoms rather than the root causes of illness in western medicine is really insightful! It is so cool that you want your career to focus on helping people by taking a more holistic approach to health and wellness! I think you definately have a passion for health and you will do great in any career you choose. It is clear that you have given this some thought already, which is great! To answer some of your questions: My career choice has definately been influenced by my values. While I have had many interests over the years and do feel I could do well in another career path, medicine particularly intrigued me because it is a career where I get to dedicate my life helping other people. And that was something that was really important to me as I couldn't imagine dedicating my life to a job where I didn't get a sense of fulfillment from the career. Your values are so, so important! Your values are fundamentally what shapes you. I think it is realistic to possess the values you have. I have never had to ""give up some of my values"" for a job. But rather, I have had some jobs that didn't bring me a sense of fulfillment. However, I would also not put pressure on yourself if some of the jobs you work throughout your life or the career path you end up choosing does not fully fit with your values. What I've learned over time is that adulting is tough. There are bills to pay. You have responsiblities and sometimes when times are tough, you have to make things work. It is okay if your career is not the one you imagined! And it is okay if you pivot your career path throughout your life! Let me know if you have any other questions! I've opened the ""strategic studying"" module :) Jasleen","Mentee 2023-12-12, 10:48: Hi Jasleen! Thank you for your thoughtful response on the Career Exploration module. The study strategies that seem the most useful to me would be using pictures and words. This is because I can relate words to a specific image that I can visualize. The strategy that seems the most challenging for me is the spaced repetition. This is because I would rather know one subject really well before moving onto the next. If I studied a little bit from each subject, I would feel overwhelmed, unorganized, and like I haven’t made progress. A strategy that I would add to this list would be the pomodoro technique. This is when you study for about half an hour, take a five-minute break, and repeat. I also enjoy the Feynman technique for subjects like biology, which is mostly memorization. With this, you say or write down what you know as if you are teaching it to someone else. I find that I truly am able to recognize my strong and weak points with this. For subjects like math, doing practice questions seems to help me gain a better understanding. What strategies do you use to study and prepare for exams? How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how did that change how you learn/study? What have you learned about studying since being in high school? What tips do you have for retaining lots of information in all your classes? How much and what kind of studying do you do on a daily basis? I understand that this is a busy time of year with finals and the holidays. Please take your time and don’t feel any pressure to answer right away. Thank you, Sienna Mentor 2023-12-18, 21:36: Hi Sienna, Thank you for sharing! My favourite study technique ironically is spaced repetition, but in a modified way. I like to focus on one subject at a time and I will go thorugh all the flashcards for the course at once. Then I come back to them in certain intervals. There is a great free app for this called Anki that I like to use. Of course this doesn't work for every class and tends to be a study technique more geared towards memorization based courses. For other courses, I like to try to get as many practice problems as possible in. This strategy works best for me for more application based courses, like math and chemistry. Post-secondary courses are very much more self-directed learning. To do well, it is expected you will do pre-readings and come ready to class having learned some of the material before hand. Lectures focus on the important details, and in order for you to effectively engage and interact with the proffessor it is important to stay caught up. Keeping up with assignments, deadlines, and studying is a student's decision. No one really follows up with you and your success is dependent on yourself and your own habits. There are resources you can try to for help if you are struggling. For instance, office hours are times where you can get one on one help from your instructor. However, to benefit from these resources, you have to recognize you need more help and seek that help out. This differs from high school where teachers send lost of reminders and follow up with you themselves when you are falling behind. My studying in high school was not very effective. I have learned that the way I need to study for each course differs. Usually I let myself use the first midterm as an assessment to determine if my study techniques are working and don't let a mark (if it is bad) get me down. If I do well, I know what I am doing is leading me to success. If I don't do well, I go back to the drawing board and assess how I can re-structure my study habits or use new techniques to perform better. Oftentimes I will dicuss this with the instructor as they have often been teaching the same course for years and are familiar with the habits/techqniques of successful students. The best way to retain information is to keep up with the course. Oftentimes courses build upon themselves. So if you go home and rreview information on a regular basis, it will help with retention. See the ""forgetting curve"" below. I actually learned about this in my neuroscience course. By re-reviewing the same information without leaving too much of a gap between intiial review sessions, you help strengthen the neural pathways that are established when you first learn something. If you strengthen these pathways through revision early on, you will be more likely to remember stuff. But if you leave too much of a gap, it will be as if you have to learn the same information for the first time. In first-year my profs gave the estimate that you should expect to study 3 hours for every 1 hour you are in class. So if you have 3 hours of lecture for one course, expect to study at least 9 hours. Of course this differs from course to course and in my experience is largely more dependent on your academic goals (i.e. the grades you are striving for). I hope that answers all of your questions! Let me know if you have any more questions and I am happy to elaborate more. Happy Holidays! Let me know which module you would like to work on next! Jasleen Mentor 2024-01-10, 09:35: Hi Sienna! No worries. I can still see your response! It's great to hear from you! Happy new year! I am currently preparing for some med school interviews. Thanks you completing the module! My tips for time management include (1) prioritization, (2) starting early, (3) and splitting a task into smaller task items. I always prioritize by what is most important. If I have a big test in a few days and a bunch of assignments due in a few weeks, I try to focus on the most challenging task at hand first and then prioritize in accordance to how much time I have, how difficult something is (and therefore the more time I will need to dedicate to it) and how important it is (i.e. it's worth a lot vs. very little of my final grade). I also like to start early. I sometimes struggle with procastintion, but I find that if I just start an assignment and spend a little bit of time working on it, it helps get me going. Lastly, I like to split big assignments into smaller items. For instance, if I have a big cumulative exam coming up worth a lot of my grade, I start early and kind of create ""mini"" tasks for myself. I for instance may aim to get 1-2 chapters done every 2 days so that I stay on track but the amount of studying I have to do does not seem so bad when I focus on getting the smaller task items everyday. As an adult I have found self-care to be very important. University can be stressful at times and it is really easy to fall into habits that do not benefit one's emotional, mental, or physical well-being. I always like to prioritize exercise, especially in team settings. I participated in a lot of intramurals, which had a social aspect as well. Exercise also results in the release of endorphins. So participating in team sports helped my mental, emotional, and physical well-being when I had a lot on my plate. I've been in ""funks"" before where I really did not balance all aspects of my life well and heavily focussed on academics. I find that when I am falling into these habits, I try to set one hour aside for myself a day. I know in the grand scheme of things that one hour doesn't change much in my daily routine. I take that one hour to do whatever I want. Whether that is getting some fresh air outside, going for a run, watching some TV, or just relaxing. It is always important to give yoruself time and space to rejuvenate. In terms of university and medical school, both can be challenging and it is important to develop some good stress management strategies that really work for you. I think it is best to try to form some good habits early and that will benefit you in the long run. To manage my stress during university, I participated in sports but also did yoga and breathing practices. I also found journalling really helped me as it helped me kind of ""get everything out of my system"" in terms of negative emotions and really reflect on the actions I could take to overcome challenges I was experiencing. Let me know if you have any other questions! And let me know what the last module you would like to work on is! Best, Jasleen",,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 10:53: Hi! This is My meaningful image swap. I am looking forward to getting to know more about you and myself. Thank you for taking the time to message me. Mentor 2023-09-20, 19:08: Hi Sienna, It's so exciting to e-meet you! My name is Jasleen and I'll be your mentor for this semester. I just graduated from UBC with a BSc in Biology. Thank you for completing the meaningful image swap! I see that you are interested in a career in dermatology, which is awesome! While I am not currently in medical school, I am in the process of applying to medical schools across Canada. So, I am familiar with the application process, as well as the challenges and considerations associated with pursuing medicine. Feel free to ask any questions that you may have about that! You can message here with any questions you have about the application process and any concerns you may have :) We also have so many hobbies in common! I really enjoy running and fitness related activities. One of my favourite things to do in my free time is to play sports. During my time at UBC, I played on multiple intramural teams in basketball, ultimate, and softball! I've opend the first module your teacher would like you to work on which is, "" From Rural to Urban"" Jasleen Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:41:  Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:48: Hi, I hope all is well with you. I have tried sending in my table a couple times to you but I dont think it has been working. I apologize if you have not heard from me for a little while... there has been some technical difficulties. I tried doing something new so hopefully you receive this one. I am very curious about your journey with school. Did you always know that you wanted to attend medical school? If so, what made you think that you could do it? It is a very hard 4 years to get into and through and that is something I am worried about. I am nervous that I am not capable enough for medical school because of all the things people in my town have been telling me. I know of a few people in my town who have gotten into medical school and that is what's giving me hope. Do you have any advice for this? Thank you for your patience Mentee 2023-11-03, 21:22: Hi, I'm so sorry for the confusion. I have been trying to upload my adulting assignment for a couple of weeks but none of them have gone through until a couple of days ago. For some reason it uploaded in the ""Start Here Activity"" space. You will see it was uploaded on October 30, at about 9:45am. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences. Thank you Mentor 2023-11-03, 22:43: Hi Sienna, Thanks for reaching out! No worries at all. I can see your response from Oct 30th. I'll take a look at your assignment and respond to that tomorrow! I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to look at it earlier this week. In your progress report I'll make a note that you tried to upload the assignment earlier so you don't lose any marks if your teacher is marking these! I hope that alleviates any anxieties or concerns. If you have any other concerns or technical challenges let me know. Have a great weekend! :) Jasleen Mentor 2023-11-06, 20:15: Hi Sienna! Thanks for completing the activity! To answer some of your questions in the message below: Did you always know that you wanted to attend medical school? If so, what made you think that you could do it? I did know it was a path I was leaning toward by the end of high school. I was inspired to go to medical school after my grandfather got diagnosed with ALS. Moreover, I have always been fascinated by the human body (biology was my favourite subject) and so the path seemed like a right fit for me. It is a very hard 4 years to get into and through and that is something I am worried about. I am nervous that I am not capable enough for medical school because of all the things people in my town have been telling me. I know of a few people in my town who have gotten into medical school and that is what's giving me hope. Do you have any advice for this? I am still in the process of trying to get in. I was rejected last year (which was the first year I applied), and that was very difficult to hear at first. I was really dissapointed, but it helped that I had other things going for me. One thing I've learned is to not put ""all of my eggs in one basket"". And by that I mean that while going into medicine is a really important goal to me, I am continuing to work on my career outside of medicine and my hobbies, skills and interests, so that I find satisfaction and fulfillment outside of medicine You are absolutely capable of medicine! I won't lie and say it is not competitive. It very much is. But that does not mean you are not capable of getting in . As I said earlier, I was rejected last year, but I haven't let that get me down and have re-applied this year. I went back to the drawing board and analyzed weaknesses in my application and am hoping for better results this year. Things don't always work out immediately. In fact, the average UBC med student gets in after three tries. Don't let the fear of failure hold you back from your goals! In the words of Wayne Gretzky, ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"" To answer some of the questions in the ""adulting"" activity you sent below: .Can you share any advice about building the skills that I am not confident in yet? Similar to you, I wasn't very confident in commuting. I grew up in a very car-centric city and didn't use public transit much growing up. Learning how to use public transit was a bit of a transition, but it is easy to get a hang of once you start using it regularly. I started by making sure I planned all of my bus routes and times ahead of my departure. Then as I got used to the system, many of the bus routes and schedules became familiar to me. There is an app called ""Transit"" you can use to help you figure out the bus routes. Google Maps also has a similar feature! I also struggled with finance. My dad actually helped teach me a lot about banking and budgeting during my transition to university. I found it really helpful to have discussions about financial planning and having him initially help me with my banking. You can also talk to an advisor at your bank and they can help you get comfortable with your banking when you first open an account. What was the most surprisingly easy thing about adulting? I think managing household tasks was the easiest part of moving away from home. Growing up I was really involved in household chores and my mom instilled a lot of good habits in us in maintaining habits that help ensure that we maintain clean and organized spaces. Therefore, I didn't find it difficult to manage my own living space after I moved out. Is balancing adult responsibilities with student responsibilities a difficult thing to do? It can be difficult at times. I think I especially struggled with this during midterm and finals season, when a lot of school work piled up and it felt difficult to get routine chores done. I found that sticking to a schedule was most helpful with this. For instance, I would get all my cleaning done on Friday mornings, so that I could use the weekend to study and also use evenings to get some social time in as a break. Let me know if you have any other questions! Jasleen Mentee 2023-12-26, 11:48: Hi Jasleen! I hope you're having a wonderful holiday break. The next module I would like to work on is the Well Being &amp; Self Care. Thank you very much for the advice on study habits in University. I will definitely take those into consideration.

Mentor 2023-10-11, 22:35: Hi Sienna, Thank you for sharing about your community in Prince Rupert! I am from a city! I was born and raised in Surrey, which is about an hour drive from Vancouver, but falls in the Greater Vancouver Area. It is much larger than Prince Rupert in size, with a population of about 550,000. Most of my close extended family actually lived in about a 3 block radius from me growing up, so the city never felt as big as it actually is. Growing up in a city, there is always something to do and always something going on. So if my friends and I ever got bored, all we had to do was hop on the SkyTrain to downtown in Vancouver. It's great to hear about the community of support that you have in Prince Rupert! Growing up around familiar faces and with a strong community has so much value. That's something I truly missed when I moved away for school (and I wasn't moving very far). It's so cool that you hope to work as a doctor in a rural area! Rural areas definately face greater challenges and disparities when it comes to accessing healthcare services. UBC Med actually has special pathways for students from rural areas in their admissions procedures. A set number of seats in each year's incoming med class are reserved for the rural pathway, and the aim of this program is to help increase the number of physicians that choose to practice in a rural community. Many med schools in Canada have similar programs, so that is something you can look into when you are planning to apply to med school. I can provide links if you are interested! If you have any specific questions about transitioning from a rural town to a city, let me know! I am happy to ask some of my friends at UBC who grew up in rural towns what their experiences were like. It was great to hear from you. I have opened the ""career exploration"" module for you to work on next if you feel ready to move on to that one, but if you have any further questions about this module or any follow-up questions, feel free to message at any time! Best, Jasleen",,,,

My take is that living on the land will help you learn much more about it than any book you could read. Learning about the land should include going out into the world and experiencing it. So although there is a difference between learning about the land and living on it they both go hand in hand. Mentor 2023-11-09, 20:48: Sarah, I 100% agree on your take about the difference between learning and living on the land. Do you have any personal examples of the differences? Personal bias and social media can alter the way we perceive our world. When we actually have lived experiences of the land (whether it be our home or some place we are travelling) we grow to be much more accepting and welcoming of different people. This is why I encourage you to go travelling to as many different places as possible. Mentee 2023-11-14, 10:22: Well, right now, I'm in B.C First Peoples, and we have been looking at learning about the land vs learning in the land a lot. Learning about the land while being actively in it and doing something with/in the environment with Elders and First Nations People has been the way we understand the most. In your area, are there many Indigenous businesses that you have encountered? How prominent are Indigenous people in your community? Mentor 2023-11-20, 02:04: Hi Sarah, UBC does it a great job acknowledging the improtance of unceded territory in which our campuses resides on. There is also a number of different resources and musesums dedicated to First Nation art work and celebrating the suceeses of Vancouver's first people. I don't believe I have interacted with indigenous businesses before, but your point stands and I will defintely make a point of checking some out later. Again, indigenous people are integral part of our education and our society at large. It's important to recognize these changes and celebrate their sucesses. As a rule, I try to stay local and support small businesses as much as I can despite the added expense. What about yourself? Do you interact with indigenous businesses or people on an everyday basis? Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:00: I do Interact with Indigenous people almost every day. My best friend is an indigenous person. He often invites me to do activities with his family. In Prince Rupert, we are a very indigenous prominent city. There are lots of places that are indigenous-owned and run. Because of this, every time I go out, I end up supporting Indigenous. businesses! Mentor 2023-11-23, 23:19: Thats great to hear Sarah! What are some indigenous activties that you have participated in? I am facinated to hear your experiences about them. Mentee 2023-11-28, 08:59: I wouldn't say all of our activities are Indigenous, but he did a small smudging ceremony with me. We made a fire and burned sweetgrass. We wafted the smoke over us to remove bad spirits and promote emotional healing! For me, it was super cool and nice to see my friend doing a practice from his culture! Mentor 2023-12-01, 16:23: That's really cool to hear about all these activities. I think we have come a long way in terms of integrating indigenous knowledge into our education system. There was not a lot of emphasis at least when I was in high school regarding the contributions made by indigenous people. Would you say they are doing a better job now at your school? Mentee 2023-12-01, 22:20: I would say throughout the years of my schooling, we always learned about the mistreatment of Indigenous peoples. I still feel pretty guilty for feeling jealous when I was younger that my Indigenous friends got to know so much about their culture In school. As an African-American/Canadian student who didn't get to learn about any of my culture in school ever, it hurt. Now that I am older and understand more about what happened, I think everything the school district is doing to incorporate Indigenous learning is fantastic, and we have come a very long way. However, I am still fighting to have other cultures represented. Mentor 2023-12-02, 13:37: How do you think can we do better to talk about the African-Canadian experience in Canada? Are there certain things you would like to see be done in order to improve your experience as a person of color? Mentee 2023-12-12, 19:23: Personally, due to my adoption, I feel very disconnected from my culture. Even the basic history of how African Canadians came to be would be interesting for me. I read a book about some of the first Black people coming to Victoria and starting the first police force there. I asked my teacher if you could review it in class, and she suggested I do a presentation on it instead. This bothered me cause I would have to do all the work. It didn't feel like learning more like research. In English this year, we are reading The Hate You Give. I love this book and have read it many times, but whenever my classmates have questions about terms used in the book, the teacher directs them to me (The only black kid in the class). This happens a lot. To improve my experience and the experience of kids who go to school after me, more has to be done to erase systemic racism in schools. Most teachers don't even realize they are doing it, but it's all the students can see. (Sorry for such a late response, I was in Las Vegas competing in The No-Gi World Championships, and I came third!) Mentor 2023-12-15, 04:35: That's quite alright Sarah! Coming in third in a sporting event is huge and you must be proud. I think the minority experience is one that I can relate to tremendously. However, something I find particularly helpful is being able to connect to different individuals within your minority. This way you can share experiences as well as connect potentially over cultural commonalities. Do you have friends that are African Canadian that you have met online or even though your travels as an athlete? Mentor 2023-12-18, 11:15: That's really cool that you can share those experiences with her. Does she attend the same school as you? Also as a result of traveling, two different tournaments has your perspective change of the world around you? Mentee 2023-12-19, 09:13: We used to attend the same school before I moved away. I can share those experiances with her! When we attended the same school we often experiammced the same thing from the same teachers. Now that we go to different schools Its kinda funny how we are still experiancing the same things with different teachers across the province. I think Travelling to tournaments has had an effect on how I see the world by showing me there is more then just where I am now. A lot of people in my town have never left and can be a little closed minded. Sorry for putting it in the wrong section at first! Mentor 2023-12-22, 12:13: No worries Sarah. It's good to see you still connect with her despite the distance and hopefully you guys end up in the same school perhaps? Hopefully you get to take some time away and be able to relax now that it's winter break. I would love to hear about your holiday stories afterwards.","Mentor 2024-01-26, 20:38: Hi Sarah, I’ve now opened Wrapping Up so we can say “goodbye”.

If you don't mind sending the chart as an image instead of copying and pasting it, I would better be able to decipher it. In terms of budgeting, I often find that setting a limit helps, and once you suceed that limit you put away your wallet. Another trick I often use is that if I want to buy something and it is not essential (clothes, games, etc.), I would keep them on the shopping cart. This way I can still keep track of things I want, but ponder a little bit before I actually buy it. Usually after a couple week, you can go back to the cart, and if its something you truly need and want, then you can go ahead and buy it. Do you have any fears or apprenhension about, being an adult? I think for anyone leaving home, and going away, it's tough and I relied a lot on my parents in the beginning. As you gradually become comfortable living alone, you start taking on more responsiblities, until you're a full fledging adult. Mentee 2023-10-24, 09:05: Budget! This link should lead to my budget!

It was really interesting looking at your budget and how you bracketed and broken down everything. Housing can be rather expensive in Vancouver, but it shouldn't be that costly at least in the first year. From what I know, both UBC and SFU offers guranteed housing. Generally living on campus or in a dorm is much cheaper than living outside of school. SFU especially being on top of the mountain, it can be tricky going up especially during the winters. If you don't mind living with roommates in dorms, you should be able to knock your montly rent down by a couple thousand. The other I noticed is that transportation was mentioned. Usually universities offer a bus pass that allows you to travel any where in the lower mainland and its only around 150 bucks for the entire semester! Obviously if you're planning to own or drive your car down it can be very expensive and you should consider parking as well. I should also mention unfortunately, not a lot places allow cats or pets. I know for UBC there is ability to keep service animals or emotional support animals with them, so you might be able look into a similar program at SFU. Groceries in general are quiet expensive, especially if you're buying on campus, and many first years dorms offer mandatory meal plans. If you're proficient at cooking and you're willing travel a bit aways, you can always select the cheapest meal plan, and cook the rest yourself! Cooking for yourself is obvivously muchy more healthier cuz you control the intake of salt and other ingredients. Obviously, don't fret so much about following the budget exactly, there should be room for flexibility in all categories. Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:06: Hi, thank you for the advice! My rent was costly as it was the only apartment in the area that allowed pets. I am not allowed to leave him at home while I am at college. I do hope to have a roommate who will help with the cost of rent! Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:28: What do you recommend to help balance sports, school work, and a part-time job once I attend university? Mentee 2023-10-31, 10:48: The Reason my housing/ rent was so high is because it was the cheapest apartment I could find that allowed pets! My dad is not letting me leave my cat with him when I go to college, so I have to take him with me. Do you have any advice on how I can manage attending university, having a part-time job, and sports? Mentor 2023-11-02, 17:30: Hey Sarah! I am sorry to hear that. Have you thought of potentially giving your cat to another family member other than your dad or perhaps a friend that you trust very well? I think in terms of balancing work load its always going to be a struggle. I can say based on my years of going to university, most if not everyone struggles with this. It's hard making time for your friends and making sure you do well. The best suggestion, I have is to not rush into things and see how it goes. Maybe go into the first semester focusing on academics and maybe sports, and see if you can do well in your classes. If you can definitely add more to your plate, if not, scale it back. School is supposed a time of indepdence and have the freedom to have a little of fun! Pushing yourself too far, might cause you to be brunt really quickly. The first year can be a bit of an adjustment, and taking things slow might be your best bet in suceeding. Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:23: The reason rent is so high is my cat Bean! It was the cheapest living space available that allowed pets. My dad has told me on multiple occasions that I have to take him with me. Thank you for the comment on flexibility in my budget sometimes I get stuck in my own ways. Mentor 2023-11-09, 20:25: Hi Sarah, I see! Definitely pets can be an important part of ones life and I wouldn't want you to be separated from your pets. I think one thing you should consider is the fact a lot of the fun and festivities comes from being on campus and living on campus. I know from experience that a ton of friends are made this way. Do you know if anyone in your school or your close friends are considering going to SFU? Having roommates can definitely help ease the loneliness that you may experience as result of living on your own for the first time.",,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 09:08: Hi, Sarah. It's a pleasure to meet you and be able to be your mentor for this year. Below is my I am from poem. Feel free to ask any questions, that you might have or anything that you're curious about!

You mentioned a lot about wrestling in your poem and it was on your profile. I am not that familiar with wrestling and MMA myself, so I hope you can teach me a thing or two about the two sports. I love fried tortillas and Mexican food in general, so it was really interesting to hear that you're a fan as well. It was also really cool that you talked about the Pacific ocean and sailing. Have you gone recently? Is that your favorite outdoor activity? Jun Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:46: Hello! Sorry It took so long for me to respond, I couldn't figure out how :) How have the things that inspired you in high school changed now that you are older? Mentor 2023-10-03, 05:51: There are a couple of things that I am extremely passionate and want in my life: 1. Heatlhcare and access to it: As an immigrant growing up, I understand the challenges of accessing healthcare that suits and fits the needs of new Canadians. 2. A career that is rewarding and challenging: Once I finish my education, I want to be able to prusue a career that is both challenging in which it tickles my mind, but also rewarding. 3. A house! I grew up in the city, and have lived in apartments for most of my life. Therefore, owning a home is a huge deal for me. 4. Travel the world: It's hard to travel when you're a student and on a limited budget. When I have the resources to do so, I would love to be able to just take a couple months off and just go travelling. 5. Owning a cat. Unfortunately, I lived in places where ownership of animals was prohibitied. I love cats! Mentor 2023-10-03, 05:56: Hi Sarah! I may have gotten confused and thought I had to answer the dicussions questions myself. Feel free to ask more questions about me. I am also curious as to what you're passionate about and how you would turn the things you want into goals. Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:42: Sorry, I put my thing in the wrong chat! 1. Sports; Wrestling and Jujitsu (BJJ) - I would love to make these sports my career. I am working to get a world championship this December to apply for Fight Two win—this way I can make money off my fights. 2. Writing - I love to write short stories. my plan right now is to try to get a wrestling scholarship to any school that has a good English program. (UC Davis, UBC, or SFU) I want to major in English and Minor in journalism. this way if I am not successful as an athlete I still have a job I love. Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:57: Here are my goals and the habits that will make my goals happen! I would like to save money for a new car! --&gt; I am going to take a part of the money I make bi-weekly, out of my account and into cash. then I'm going to put it in my money folder so I don't spend it! by next month I would like to be 58-59kg --&gt; In wrestling we have to be on weight. my very first competition of the season is in October so I need to lose 6 pounds so I can be on weight for the season. To do this I am going to cut back on carbs and consume wayyy more protein! What goals did you have in school? were you able to achieve them? Mentor 2023-10-07, 11:55: Hey Sarah! That's incredibly cool that you are able to find a sport that you loved to play. As a high school student I played ultimate and did track and field, which was a lot of fun. I still play ultimate on a rec league during the weekends. Have you ever thought about documentating your journey of wrestling through your writing? I think that would be awesome to immortalize your memories. Mentor 2023-10-07, 11:58: How did you find your part time job Sarah and do you enjoy it? For me high school, a large part of my part of my goals were academically related. So getting to a good school, and getting a head start on life was the biggest thing for me. As for achieving these goals. I would say that I did managed to go to post-secondary, so that's a win, but my asiprations and passion for things I want to learn did not really come until much later into university.",,,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 09:48: Hello!

Jun Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:42: I havent gone sailing recently because I have been busy! but it is one of my favourite outdoor activities! I used to be on a sailing race team. Mentor 2023-10-03, 05:42: Hey! Glad to hear from you. I think as we grow older our perspectives changes. When I was in high school, a lot of the emphasis for me was on doing well academically and getting to university. But what I figured out was that really should not have been the focus. I spent much of my early university years trying to discover my passion and what I wanted, something that I should have thought of when I was in high school instead. Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:42: Things that I am passionate about and how they relate to my goals: 1. Sports; Wrestling and Jujitsu (BJJ) - I would love to make these sports my career.

My best friend is Jamacian and we grew up together! But I don't have any African Canadian friends at school or even online really. Mentee 2023-12-19, 09:12: We used to attend the same school before I moved away. I can share those experiances with her! When we attended the same school we often experiammced the same thing from the same teachers. Now that we go to different schools Its kinda funny how we are still experiancing the same things with different teachers across the province. I think Travelling to tournaments has had an effect on how I see the world by showing me there is more then just where I am now. A lot of people in my town have never left and can be a little closed minded.","Mentee 2023-10-06, 09:35: Hello! I live in a small town with 12,000 people. We are a port city and cruise ships always stop here during the summer and spring. our high school has roughly 600 students. There is really nothing for teenagers to do in this town. There are a few cute shops for tourists but pretty much nothing else. We don't have an arcade, bowling, fast food, etc. We do have a movie theatre and swimming pool but it's not open a lot. However, there are a lot of sports and clubs for students if they are interested. Even though this place is super boring it is special to me. I got to take a mental breather from the big city when I first moved here. Because of this town, I have greatly grown as a person and an athlete. without it, I wouldn't have joined jujitsu! Are you from a big city or a small town? Mentor 2023-10-07, 12:02: I moved Canada when I was 6 years old, and have lived in Vancouver for most of my life, so I would definetly say I am more comfortable with the city life. My high school funny enough has more than 2000 students, with each grade having around 500 students. I can definetly relate to escaping the hustle and bustle of a big city. This is why I love to go hiking, where I can breathe in fresh air, and hear the sound of nature rather than cars and road noise. Do you like the outdoors, and are there hiking trails where you live? Jun Mentee 2023-10-13, 09:10: There are many many hiking trails here! I do enjoy the outdoors as long as I don't have to exercise. I workout so much that I like my outside time to be relaxing and have minimal walking! Mentee 2023-10-13, 09:14: I am excited about city life and the accessibility that comes with it! living in a small town is very dull. there is little to no variety! What do you think the advantages and disadvantages are when living in a big city? Mentor 2023-10-16, 01:22: Hey Sarah! I can't speak to living a small city, but there are couple advantages and disadvantages that I can think of living in Vancouver. So for advantages: variety of food options, accessible transit, more events and fesitivites during the holidays, better night life, and greater diversity of people from all back grounds. There are some disadvantages: it's harder to make friends, seems to be a precieved level of coldness among strangers, less camaraderie, noise pollution (especially if you live in a busy area), and obviously it's more expensive to live in a big city. It really depends on what you make of it and what your values are that really determines whether or not you'll like living in a big city.",,,,

And I'm impressed, how did you get into lifeguarding? It seems like you know about fun water facts (deep harbours in Prince Rupert), being around water (visiting the cannery) and I guess working around water too - do you like lifeguarding? Has anything happened? Regarding adulting, before we complete the module, I'd love to know your thoughts on what 'adulting' is (or what your ideal version of 'adulting') is! Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:29: No worries! I'm also slow when it comes to responding haha. I don't have a huge interest in psychology, I just think it'd be useful to have. As for lifeguarding, it's something my mum and dad wanted me to do since I was a kid. They put me in alllll the swimming lessons. I have to say I'm really happy they did because I feel cool knowing how to swim haha. I do enjoy lifeguarding, some days are better than others, but it is how it is. So far I haven't had to jump in and save anybody *phew* So that's definitely something. Other than that nothing much happens besides the occasional nosebleed, cut or kids biting eachother. To me adulting is stuff like living alone (or with a roomate) buying your own groceries, paying bills or rent, y'know the the standard things you think of when somebody says adult. Although I also feel like adulting is being mature and making your own decisions, standing up for yourself and being responsible. I will say I'm pretty excited to start a new 'chapter' (AKA adulting) of my life. I know lots of people say its way difficult and you shouldn't take being a kid for-granted, and even if adulting is difficult I feel pretty good about it. Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:21: Hiya, I do live with my parents! And I haven't really done many of the things I listed haha. Okidoke so I do buy my groceries occasionally and the only bill I pay is my phone bill but even then my mum still delas with the money transfer or whatever its called. I do budget (ish) though, I have a few different saving accounts that I add a % of my paycheck into. One of them being my school savings! So I guess you could say that I am thinking about the cost of schooling :D I'd say I'm probably most worried about taxes and bills haha, other than that there's not much I can think of. Maybe phoning in orders at resturants lol. Oh living on my own seems a little dauting, hence my reason for staying at home after highschool (I'll leave eventually...) Mentor 2023-11-20, 15:08: Awesome, that's great that you've already tried your hand at some expenses! Have you tried making the budget template that's part of the module? I've uploaded it here again - Budget Template (hopefully this works? If not, it's part of the adulting module in lesson 2) :) Since you'll be living at home, the rent/mortgage piece should be $0! Let me know how this goes, and we can talk a bit more about it. In the meanwhile, I'll start the career exploration module just so we can do that a little bit...

Happy December! Budget is still in the works (I got a bit side tracked). I'm also kind of confused on how certain parts are supposed to be filled out.

Now I've just got to figure out how to send it. As for the next unit I'm leaning towards the msart studying or paying for school, those two seem the most helpful and relevant as of now! P.S.

I am from mason jars From vicks vapoRub and the water dispensor on my fridge I am from the lake every summer From make sure you wear your helmet I am from the forest From spruce trees I am from joint birthday parties From burgers From the watch out for sasquatch The Kendal The ocean It feels like home Mentor 2023-09-26, 09:40: Hi Mila, My apologies for the slow response! I'll be better moving forward :) Nice to meet you Mila - what an interesting poem! I look forward to starting the modules and learning more about you and your next steps. I'm Sarah, and I'm currently working as a data analyst! I studied at UBC for my BSc and MSc, so I've done almost 10 years of school.... phew! Outside of working, I like to play sports and that usually fills up my evenings and weekends. Do you have a preference as to which topic you want to start first? Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:36: Hi Sarah! Nice to meet you. I belive that my teacher wants us to start with the from rural to urban unit, if that works with you? Mentor 2023-09-29, 09:51: Absolutely! I've opened the unit so let's get to it :) Excited to hear more about your experiences and how class/life is going! Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:57: Ok sounds good! My careers class is almost over for the day :( I have it again on tuesday so maybe we could get started on the unit then? Sorry about that. Mentor 2023-09-29, 10:56: Absolutely no worries! I'll also go through the module and post my thoughts &amp; reflections so happy to chat more about it - whenever you're in careers class :) Mentor 2023-10-16, 10:58: Hi Mila, That's awesome, I had no idea about the harbour and the cannery! I love that there's so many options and cool places around :) What does general studies mean? And do you already have an idea of what you want to do for work? I certainly remember having no idea what to do after high school, so I'm curious! As a side note, I'll also be starting the ""Adulting"" unit - but happy to chat about both conversations at the same time:) Mentee 2023-10-17, 08:57: Okay sounds good! I'm ready for the next unit as well. The General studies program is from what I undrstand, majorly engish ans psycology and its transferable to other universities after. I currently work as a lifeguard at the pool, so I plan to continue working there! Mentor 2023-11-09, 09:34: Haha, I feel you on just being thrown into whatever my parents wanted me to do and just going with it! I'm glad you found the joy in staying with it :) I'm curious about adulting - it seems like you're living with your parents right now, but have you done any of the adulting stuff that you mentioned - like buying groceries, budgeting to pay bills/rent/etc.? Are there any skills out of the ones that you listed (or not yet listed) that you feel less good about? I'm also curious if you've thought about how much schooling will cost for you when you go to college after high school to pursue general studies? I love how you also touch on the more emotional/social pieces of adulting like being mature and making your own decisions. I'm almost tempted to say that's just as difficult as the classic 'adulting' stuff because there are so many things you can do, having to decide what you do for the rest of your life is... daunting haha! It's great that you're excited and already looking forward to it! Mentor 2023-12-06, 11:26: Hello hello! Just checking in, as we head into the holiday season! 1. How's that budget looking like? 2. Do you have any preferences of what you want the next module to be? Happy December :) Sarah Mentor 2023-12-19, 02:10: Hi Mila, Thanks for sending it over! Don't mind me replying to all of the messages at once - I took a few days off of work on vacation and promptly missed the notifications. I hope the last week (?) of classes go well! Your budget looks great - and that makes sense that you're leaving out rent. It's great that you're definitely making significantly higher income than your spendings, but of course, with the parts that you didn't include and potential expenses that come out of nowhere, it's good to have the buffer (and I love that savings/emergency fund line)! One piece that I learned was to try to save about 10% of your paycheque directly into your savings account or even an investment account - if that is something that you feel comfortable and knowledgeable doing. That way, it builds up slowly over time month by month :) AND on a total tangent, paying off your debit/credit card on a timely manner is also so important in building your credit score and avoiding any penalties for paying late! I found it helpful to set monthly reminders in my calendar/phone to pay off my bill and paying it off immediately when I get the email notification so that I don't procrastinate! I know that rent/housing definitely costs a large majority for a lot of students, so it's great that you're getting that piece covered by living with your parents - a great decision! I'm going to open the Smart Studying module now, so feel free to start taking a look at that one for the time being until classes wrap up for the holidays! Good luck on any tests or projects, and happy holidays!","Mentee 2023-10-10, 09:30: Hey, sorry it's taken me so long. I've just looked at the first part of the unit now so i'm just gonna go ahead and give a little information on my town and stuff. I live in prince rupert, its fairly small. Our population is 12220. We have a few cool clubs at the highschool here, persoanlly I like the book club. There's also an outdoor club and they go rock climbing which is pretty cool. We have an Esports team too, which I find kin of funny. I like this town because its so close to the ocean and I can go out quite often. I enjoy boating and paddlebaording, so its definently nice to be by the water. Ok there's some questions after this but I don't want to chunk too much at once, so i'll get to those after we talk about this! Mentor 2023-10-12, 15:16: Hey Mila! Thanks for telling me more about Prince Rupert :) I love that there are so many different activities around and it seems like you really enjoy the outdoor activities! What would you say makes Prince Rupert stand out? What are the perks of living in a town of 12,220? Are you planning on moving to an urban area after high school? What are your plans? I have so many questions! I'm currently living in Vancouver and I've been here almost my entire life. In high school, I didn't have any of those cool clubs but I was mostly in music and the different bands. BUT I just started paddling this year, so I am also in love with being on the water. While I don't know the population of Vancouver, I think that living in an urban area has definitely made me take public transit for granted and I have most definitely procrastinated taking my driver's license... Mentee 2023-10-13, 09:59: HI. I do really like the outdoors! I'd say Prince Rupert stands out because of it's very deep harbour (second largest deep-sea port on the west coast of canada!) We also have a pretty cool historical site (the north pacific cannery) out in Port Edward. I love to visist the cannery, especially when its sunny. I definitely like living in an rural area because of less traffic and it's much more quiet. After highschool I plan on staying here for a year or two, to take the general studies program at the college and to work. I went to Vancouver recenlty and yeah the trains were super convenient. I have to say my favourite part is Robson street haha. I used to be in choir and band so I think those are pretty cool too!",,,,

You don't have to tell me what you think (unless you want to), but it might get the wheels turning before we dive in. After that, there are some cool discussion questions. Try making a table with all the adulting skills and stuff you think you'll need. Mark down what you're good at and what might need a bit more practice.

Originally i wasnted to go into aerospace engineering since i had a freind who is currently all the way over in nova scotia going to school to become a pilot. I thought I wanted to do something with that but I ended up changing my mind because I want to help people. I decided on anesthesiology because im interested in a lot of the things they do. Currently where I am at it seems a bit unrealistic but I still want to try. Mentor 2023-12-03, 15:38: Hey Malachi, nothing to be sorry about things happen!

I'm very excited to be your mentor this year and get to know you. I read your profile and I love the idea of a travelling nurse. I also want to pursue a career path in medicine, and travelling is also big goal for me. I haven't been able to travel that much yet, but I want to take some time after I graduate to explore. Where is the top place on your travel list? Right now for me it's probably Italy or Iceland. Also that is very cool you are into sports. A friend recently convinced me to join their soccer team because they needed some more players. But I've never played before so I've been trying to figure that out. So I have much respect for you because I have been struggling there. I think for the meet your mentor activity it is fun to do the photo swap activity. This is a photo from a little trip I did this summer over to the gulf islands. This is galiano island. There were lots of seals in the water when I took this photo but they didn't really show up in this photo. Anyways, looking forward to hearing from you and starting on the program.

I have unlocked the first module for you to get started on. The email I got said your class would be working on the module From Rural to Urban first. My first year of university was the covid year, so I was at home the whole year. So when I did get to move out to go to school, I was really eager and excited, and I didn't think too much about the challenges. I'm curious to hear from you about how you are feeling about that transition overall, and what reservations you may have. Best of luck as you get started on the course and have a happy October!

Eric","Mentor 2023-12-01, 20:41: Strategic studying activity opened! Mentee 2023-12-01, 22:22: When I study for a math test I usually just practice by doing questions that my teacher gives me to do I don't know how to study English but for other subjects, I look through my notes. I also can't find a proper way to study, like I can't study because I lose focus very easily. I wish meditation music to help me focus for a longer period. what are some of the strategies that you have seen useful for studying what was useful for you during post-secondary? Mentor 2023-12-05, 19:43: Hey Landon, That's a good strategy for math tests. Sometimes, if I'm short on time I won't even review the concepts- I'll just keep hammering away at the practice questions until I feel like I've seen everything. There are only so many types of questions- if you've seen them all, you won't be caught by surprise. Trying problems, getting your butt kicked, and then trying again is actually a very efficient way of studying. You'll find that you'll start to grasp the concepts just by practicing alone. When you're approaching an exam, the time for grasping the big concepts is over- you should be focused on accumulating marks. The best way to do that is with repetition. If you think you have extra time, then you can read up on more theoretical parts. English is hard to study for- you're not alone! The best thing to do is try and read as much as possible. Your own writing will reflect the things that you read. If you only read social media posts, or crappy news sites, odds are, your writing won't be very good. Find a good author, or even a few free, reputable news sources like CBC or CNN. Read something that's well written every day. The other piece to the puzzle for doing well in English is to talk to your teacher about what they are looking for. English is the most subjective subject; as a result, there's the most to gain from talking to the teacher. Now, how does one keep focussed &amp; study for more content-based classes (i.e science, history) ? To increase productivity, there 3 things you should do while studying 1) set a schedule for what you need to study (i.e each unit), and on what days. 2) put your phone in another room, 3) set a timer (i.e 30 min / unit), and finish what you are supposed to do within that time period. Take a break every 30 min - 1 hour. Humans are not mean to sit &amp; study for hours on end. As for the actual studying part, here's what I do. I go for maximum efficiency, and the studying is done in stages, where I'll keep condensing my notes until they are committed to memory. - First stage: take detailed notes, on every unit that's on the test. Let's say you take 2 pg notes * 10 units. Use all the info you have- your own notes from class, your textbook, etc. Focus on understanding here. - Second stage: Try and reproduce these notes from memory, unit by unit. Write down a condensed version for each unit, say half a page. No one should be able to understand these, they are for you and you only. Use short words that trigger your memory, don't write sentences. You can make inside jokes to yourself or strange metaphors. You can also do this orally, instead of writing things down. Sometimes I'll cover my notes with a blank piece of paper, and try and recite what's on the page under it. - Keep doing the second stage until you are feeling confident. - Third stage: The night before the test, condense all your notes into a single page. Use ever shorter words, pictures, letters, to capture what you wrote in many more words in the first stage. This process will help you commit things to memory. These are the tricks I used in university for content-based courses that didn't have practice questions. Using these methods, I could almost guarantee an A with 2-3 full days of studying prior to an exam. Now, if you are studying for a course with lots of practice questions (i.e math), you should just do those. Only start on conceptual things once you've finished all the practice questions.",,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 21:25: Hey Landon, Nice to meet you! I'll be your mentor for this term. I think I mentored a student from your school last year as well. Some things about me: I took engineering in university at UBC and now work as a Biomedical Engineer. My job is to help make maps of the inside of the heart. I also know a few electricians, so if you have questions about that pathway I should be able to answer them. I like the outdoors, I spend a lot of time backcountry skiing in the winter, and I go hiking and sailing in the summer. I used to travel to lots of different places all over the work to race, so if you have any questions about travelling, feel free to ask! I've only broken one bone, my pinky finger, when my buddy took my mountain biking and I didn't have a mountain bike... I saw in your bio you broke a couple bones, how did you break yours?

A lot of older high school students like to drive around town or drive to the next town for the weekend Most of the students do sports like basketball, volleyball, or hockey or not in extracurriculars My town is special to me because I lived in my town for my entire life. How have they been able to leverage the strengths they gained from having a rural background? In what ways has being from a rural community benefitted them? Mentee 2023-11-13, 12:22: Right now I am taking a class called Work Experience. The class is about me going to a work place then get experience. I choose to go to an electrical company called Lighten up electric, if I impress them I could get an apprenticeship with them after I finish my hours that I have to do for Woork Experience Mentor 2023-11-16, 21:20: Hey Landon, Sounds like a great opportunity, work hard &amp; ask questions! It's always better to ask a question than pretend you know something and have it come back to bite you later because you ended up doing it wrong.... The most important thing is to build trust with the company. They'll want to hire someone they can trust. Don't feel bad if things don't pan out with them. Focus on the things you can control, keep working hard at becoming an electrician, and eventually another opportunity will pop up. Did you have any other questions about living in a city? If not, you can start with the discussion questions on the next section, called ""Adulting"" Eric Mentee 2023-11-21, 01:22: Adulting 101 how hard is it when you time manage your daily life on a regular basis? What did you find surprisingly challenging when transferring into adulthood? Budgeting Money I spend a lot of money at Tim Hortons on coffee and wraps for lunch and Pita Pit how can I bring my cost down so that I don't have to worry about paying my truck insurance? How do you keep track of your money by paycheque to paycheque? What is the most challenging budgeting issue for them? Mentor 2023-11-21, 21:14: Hey Landon, I keep track of all my expenses in an excel file, one for each year, with a sheet for each month. Here's how I put together a budget: 1) Figure out how much money you'll bring home in a year, after tax 2) Figure out your ""base expenses"". These are expenses you don't intend to change, and you know you are going to pay them. Stuff like insurance, rent, utilities, and amount you plan to save &amp; invest (15% of income is a good target if possible, but that might not happen until later in your career). Try and save some money for an ""emergency fund"" too- in case you get laid off, etc. 3) Figure out how much money is left over. Calculate how much, each month, you can spend in the ""discretionary"" category. These are things where you don't know exactly how much you will spend each month. Some of them are necessities (groceries, gas, phone bills), and others are not (eating out, random purchases, vacations, subscriptions). You want to get a monthly spending target for this ""discretionary"" category. Do not exceed it. Each month, look at your online banking account and tally every relevant bit of ""discretionary"" spending. Record this in a sheet titled the month. This doesn't take long- maybe 15-20 minutes. I split mine into sub categories (groceries, gas, subscriptions, eating out, etc...). You'll quickly start to notice where you are spending extra. Re Tims &amp; Pita pit: The pita pit should be the first one to go. The best thing is to have a morning routine, and in that routine, make coffee &amp; lunch. For example, I'll make oatmeal, and while that's cooking, make lunch. Then look at how much money you've saved in the monthly spreadsheet! Living close to a grocery store is also pretty helpful if you can do it- you'll end up cooking more &amp; spending less. Travel is a challenging budget issue for me. Whenever I go away, things are unfamiliar, I'm out of my routine, and end up spending more than I expect. RE time management on a daily basis: I use google calendar, it works pretty well. I always leave time to exercise or stretch every day. The intensity is not important, I care much more about the mental benefits than the physical ones. Exercise lowers stress, and stress is bad for you on a cellular level. You literally release compounds in the bloodstream that are bad in the same way something like which cholesterol is. Transferring into adulthood means that there are a lot of things to keep track of. The best way to manage this is to start keeping track of more things before you're an adult, so it doesn't hit you like a truck :) Mentee 2023-11-27, 18:56: Adulting response That is difficult for me to find my yearly salary I have a part time job, my hours are all over the place. Another thing that is difficult for me is that I am doing work experience I might get a apprenticeship and get paid so right now it's hard for me to get yearly salary. would I just try my best by averaging it out? Mentee 2023-11-27, 19:00: For are next chapter can we strategic studying Mentor 2023-12-01, 20:40: Hey Landon, I would try your best by averaging things out. Have a bit more of a safety factor, just in case you don't work as many hours as you expect - For example, try to average things out, then multiply by 0.9 (10% safety factor), and start budgeting from that number. I opened up strategic studying- take a look at the discussion questions and let me know what you think. Eric Mentor 2023-12-18, 20:46: Hey Landon, How's it going? Want me to open up another section? Eric Mentee 2023-12-20, 07:59: Hi Eric sorry I haven't replied I was trying your strategy it seems that it's working but I will try a little long to see if I like it","Mentor 2023-10-05, 19:51: Hey Landon, Good to hear that your account is up &amp; running. Your teacher asked me to open up the first unit ""From Rural to Urban"" asap, so I just opened it up. Message me the answers to the first discussion question! Eric Mentor 2023-10-15, 16:04: Hi Landon, Agreed, the instructions are pretty confusing... At the top of the page there should be a big green circle. click on the words that say ""From Rural to Urban"". Under Unit activities, you'll see a ""Lesson 1"". Under lesson 1 there's a like that says discussion questions. Let me know if you can see them! Eric Mentor 2023-10-25, 21:19: Hey Landon, how are things going? Mentor 2023-11-12, 20:25: Hey Landon, I totally get how your town is special to you- I'm the same way, I've lived in Vancouver all my life &amp; want to stay as long as I can. The kids I've met who moved here from smaller towns all do fantastic. They all work hard, have balanced lives, and are a lot more friendly &amp; chatty than most of the city folk. We actually have a student from Prince Rupert that just started where I work &amp; he's crushing it! Sometimes it takes a little time for people to move to cities to feel confident, but there's absolutely no reason it should be that way. I would take a colleague from a rural area or smaller town over someone from the city any day of the week. Do you think you'll ever have to move away from Prince Rupert to electrician training/apprenticeships?",,,,

Hope you have been doing well and everything is going alright! Worksheet: Adulting 101 Extension Activity – Well-being &amp; Self Care Conversation Here are some skills and responsibilities you’ll need to take on when you’re living independently as an adult. This list is just a starting point, feel free to add to it and ask your mentor what they would add. Identify the skills you feel confident about, and which ones you need to work on.

Hope you are doing well and the ball team is doing good. Kevin Phan Careers 12 Ms. Ling November 8th, 2023 Adulting-Response 1 I think that “adulting” is something that is on every high schooler’s mind as they progress through their last years of education. Some fear what is coming next, solely because they are moving into the unknown, and are being forced to become more independent individuals. Growing up as a first generation Vietnamese Canadian, I have a mother whose first language is not English, so I would have to help with many things that involved my mom interacting in English. Things like bank meetings, government meetings, and doctor appointments were things that I have been attending since I was around 11 years old as a translator. I have learnt many of the basic things that adults must evaluate and learn to strive in modern society. Certain calculations and terms have been imbedded in my mind as I repeatedly attend these meetings, and I understand which options would be the most beneficial in the future. Miniscule responsibilities like grocery shopping, cooking for myself, paying bills, finding means of transportation, etc., are things that I have learnt through practice in the past couple of years. I also have a sister that is currently attending her third year of post-secondary education, and she tells me about some of the things that she now must do herself. I am already practicing most of these things in my daily life, but they can always be refined. Questions for Mentor: What was the biggest thing that stumped you transitioning into adult life? What are some things that you would suggest I look into so I can be more prepared for adult life? Mentor 2023-11-16, 17:32: Hey Kevin, I'm doing well man school has just been pretty hectic lately. Basketball is good, the season is in full swing now which is fun because we have more games than practices now lol. How's school and sports been for you lately? Mentor 2023-11-16, 17:48: Nice stuff on the extension activity man, it's awesome that you're confident already in your ability to do things like cook healthy meals and get groceries. That stuff is super important as you become more indepedent, so having more practice and exposure to it at an earlier age is always best. Great response to lesson 1 of the ""Adulting"" unit too. It seems you're defintely more prepared and ready to become indepdent than a lot of other kids your age. Awesome that you have an older sister too who can kind of guide and help you as you get older too. To answer your first question, I think the thing that stumped me the most when transitioning to adult life is how busy you get. There are a lot of times where I find myself startled because so many weeks have gone by and I haven't done anything fun lol. I've found it's super important to make sure you stay grinding but also take time out of every week to have some fun whether that's playing video games, going out with friends, or spending time with family. To answer your second question, some things you could look into to prepare youself more for adult life could be a bunch of different things but a big one is time management. Being an adult can be crazy and busy at times, so having an agenda/planner to keep everything organized is super helpful. I feel like that wouldn't be too much of an issue for you though because you've kind of had experience with this from doing so many sports, which pretty much gave you a super busy adult-like life at times. I think it's useful looking into self-care techniques and what works best for you too because life can be super stressful especially when it comes to money and living situations. So having ways to take care of yourself and stay healthy during those times is huge. Great work on this lesson man! You can go ahead and do the next lesson of ""Adulting"" and then you can move onto the ""Career exploration"" unit, which I'll just unlock now. Feel free to ask any other questions too. Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:45: School and sports have been good. Volleyball is coming to an end pretty soon and my basketball season is about to start and I got named captain again for the third year in a row. Excited to get on with my last season of highschool ball. Schools been a little big overwhelming with midterms and unit tests, but those are all over now so I have a little bit of time to relax. Thanks for your response on the questions it really opened up my mind in what to expect after high school. Mentor 2023-11-19, 16:00: Great to hear man, being named team cap multiple times is no joke! Means everybody looks at you for leadership when things are uncertain, which is awesome. That's super convenient that volleyball ends right before basketball too, it would be super annoying if the seasons overlapped. Yeah, school has been the same for me too with exams and assignments lol. Take as much advantage as you can of the break so that you're fresh to go when final exams start rolling around! Again, don't hesistate to ask questions about anything and I look forward to hearing from you again man! Mentee 2023-11-21, 11:11: Attached is my completed worksheet for lesson 2 of the adulting unit. Some questions for the Mentor: -What was the biggest payment that you didn't expect to be as high as it was? -How do you stay fincancially smart with your money? Above is my response on the the discussion section of lesson 2 of the unit adulting. Hope you're doing well still and how's school and basketball goin? Mentor 2023-11-24, 16:57: Hey Kevin, Nice work on lesson 2 of the adulting unit! To answer your questions, I think the biggest payment that took me by suprise by how much it costed was defintely gas. It was defintely shocking to see how each time I filled my car it was about $75, but it was even worse when I would look at how much was spent in a month. I pretty much use the full tank every week, so I was spending about $300 a month on gas. I coach basketball but pretty much whatever money I made from that was all gone just to pay for gas, which was crazy to me. I try to bus/walk around now whenever possible haha. Staying financially smart with your money can be very hard at times, especially when you first start making money because you automatically want to start buying clothes and food with it. I think the best thing to do is put most of it into a savings account that you cannot spend, and use whatever is left for others things like expenses and occasional purchases. School and basketball have been good though man. School is almost done now, which is awesome haha. Hope everything is going smooth with you too!",,,"Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:43: The following text is my response to Lesson 1 of the career exploration unit. Kevin Phan Careers 12 Ms. Ling November 24th, 2023 Lesson 1-Career Exploration There are several values that I possess just like any other individual. Mine stem from the upbringing of my life in Western society but living in a Vietnamese Canadian household. This resulted in some confusion growing up as the two cultures clashed in my mind, affecting the way I presented myself to others. The most important thing that I value is my family. We always provide for each other, and they are responsible for influencing the way I think and navigate through life. I am always asking them for advice when the next step is unclear to me, or when I need a new perspective on the situation. This is also the case with my friends as well. Living in a rural community has brought me close to them, and we tend to do everything together. We attend each other's family dinners, gatherings, and each of our families has been as welcoming as the next. Another thing that I value is sports and my physical health. Growing up I have always been attracted to physical hobbies and working out, and I played any sport that I was allowed to. This is where my need for athletic validation began. Sports allows me to “disconnect” from all the external distractions and do something that brings me joy. So, I make time for sports and working out because I know it benefits both my physical and mental health. These things teach me traits that I can carry into my life outside of physical fitness as well. Things like self-discipline, respect, and motivation are things that I can carry into all aspects of my life. That is why I value physical fitness right now so I can directly translate it into my life after high school. Keeping my physical fitness up will also help improve my daily life as well and directly influence a healthy lifestyle. There are many ways that I hope to contribute to my community and the world. The largest one for me personally is trying my best to help combat homelessness and trying to make the world a better place for those that are less fortunate. In Prince Rupert, there are many less fortunate individuals that are placed in vulnerable situations, and I want to try my best to give back to these individuals because at the end of the day they are still a part of my community. The two careers I am considering pursuing are a position in a business setting or architectural engineering. In both these careers, I can prioritize my family and friends and my physical health. These are values that I have listed above. With these careers I can also influence change in the standard of living of the less fortunate. I can influence change directly from these careers whether it be funding for programs and/or designing cost-efficient projects. Questions for Mentor: -What careers do you think would fit the values that I possess? -How did your values help inform you of your career choice? Mentor 2023-12-01, 23:12: Hey Kevin, I can see you put a lot of effort into this exercise which is awesome! I've just had a super busy last couple of days with volunteering and studying, but I will make sure to answer and read your response in depth tomorrow! Mentor 2023-12-05, 12:19: Hey Kevin, nice stuff on lesson 1 of career exploration, it's clear you put a lot of effort into what you wrote, which is awesome! I love that family and friends is something that you highly value because its sad to see people who are more materialistic and focused on getting money only instead of spending time with the people around them. Pursuing a position in a business setting or architectural engineering defintely seem like great fits for you too. I think some other careers that fit the values you possess could be an urban planning role because it lets you contribute to the design and development of communities, which means you could address housing issues too. Social work is another good stream because you would get to work with people who need support and find solutions for them, which means you might be directely combating the homelessness people face. Another good stream is public policy because you could study and come up with new policies regarding housing, welfare, and other things that tie into societal change. All of these streams also aren't super crazy in terms of travel etc, meaning you would still have time to hang out with friends and family as this is important to you too. Personally, I also love spending time with my friends and family, which is a big reason I'm begginning to halt my pursit of being a doctor. They typically work hard hours and the many years you spend in medical school are pretty much spend glued to books. But I still love helping people as it brings me joy to help someone through whatever issue they are dealing with. I also love the human body and health care so I'm currently trying to get into Thompson River Universitiy's Respiratory Therapy program. This would let me work in a hospital and help people with their health, all while letting me learn about the human body and not have any insane work/study hours which lets me spend time with friends and family! Great stuff on this lesson man! Feel free to move onto lesson 2 of Career Exploration. You've completed all the modules your teacher wants you to do, now you just need to do 2 more modules of your choice. So after doing lesson 2 of Career Exploration, let me know which module you want to do next and I'll unlock it for you. Look forward to hearing back from you! Mentee 2024-01-10, 09:41: Hey i hope you're doing good, i had a lot on my plate with a full schedule with basketball games/ practice and uni applications so sorry for not keeping in touch. Mentee 2024-01-10, 09:54: Hi Kevin, Your message was flagged in our system because you included your last name. For that reason, I have not allowed your message to go through, but I have copy/pasted your message here so that you don't have to re-type it. In the future, please remember that last names and other identifying information is not allowed. Thanks, The eMentoring staff Kevin's message to Arjun: Career Exploration-Lesson 2 Career: Senior Managers-Financial, Communications and other business services Expected Salary: $130,350 Demand for job (job openings): 6700 This job title perfectly fits my personal interests and goals for my career. I have started my own online Printify drop shipping company, and I have seen lots of success with it. On average, I generate anywhere from $12,750 to $17,830 per month, this means I have scaled a six-figure business at the age of 17. I find business quite interesting and have already seen some success with my own. The one thing that I want in my career is the opportunity to work as part of a team. This career offers that luxury alongside personal efforts, all working towards a common goal. This career offers many luxuries such as being able to socialize in a work setting and creating new social connections, like many other jobs, but I think because this job requires individuals to constantly be collaborating with each other, these bonds build quicker. This job also gives lots of freedom in terms of time off. Sometimes individuals will need time away from the workplace to reflect and brainstorm new pathways for a goal. I think this will offer lots of opportunities for time to enjoy one’s life. This is an opportunity to ensure that social connections are strong and one’s physical and mental health are in check. With an expected salary of $130,350 per year, this is much more than the average income in Canada ($54,000-$59,000/year). This will offer the financial security to support myself and my family, with excess to invest, splurge, etc. There are many job opportunities in this field, as businesses will always need people to advise them in certain areas, and everyone has a unique perspective on situations. Businesses will always seek individuals who are able to contribute to a discussion and work out the best possible solution for a common goal. To pursue this career and find success, I will be required to move to a larger city with a business location. In smaller towns/cities it is difficult to find a large business that is seeking people in this position, but in larger cities, renowned businesses and/or up and coming businesses will always seek individuals with this specialty. This is because every new individual in this field can offer a new perspective on a certain issue, and it can result in a breakthrough in terms of how the business decides to tackle the problem. Questions for Mentor: How did you choose your career? Evaluate your career choice using the following questions; Do you have a strong personal interest in this type of work? Will your career choice allow you to achieve the work/life balance that you want? Will your career choice offer you financial security? How much opportunity or job security does this career offer? Where will you need to live to pursue your career? If you were to compromise one of these areas, how would you reconcile? Were you ever considering a different career? Why did you change your mind if you did? What are some things that you wish you had known about career choices while you were still in high school? Mentor 2024-01-12, 22:52: Hey Kevin, No worries for not responding, it was also winter break so it's understandable :) Hope you had a fun break though! Great response to lesson 2 of Career Exploration man! It definitely seems like a business job would suit your strengths and asipirations considering the amazing sucess you've already had!! To answer some of the discussion questions: I've decided to pursue a carrer in the medical field of being a doctor because I simply love the human body and being able to guide sick people to a better and healthier life. This job would potentially require me to live somewhere else because the only medical school in BC, so I would probably have to go somewhere else to study and would need to work in that city for a while. This job is very secure as there is a doctor shortage in North America, which we see with super long hospital wait times and most people not having family doctors. I've considered other careers such as physiotherapy and respiratory therpay a lot. They are still my backups and I wouldn't mind pursuing them more if medical school does not pan out. I wish I had known more about the path of becoming a doctor more in high school because I feel like I've wasted some time and years figuring out the path and making mistakes here and there. Great work on this module and pretty much every module so far. Let me know which module you want to work on next as you only need to complete two more modules, both of your choice. So once you let me know, I'll unlock it so you can get started! Take care bro and I look forward to hearing back from you, and as always feel free to ask me questions about anything!",,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 10:50: What's up?

I love that basketball is something you enjoy playing because it’s my favorite sport too haha I have played in the provincial tournament a couple times, and it is an amazing experience like you said. I remember that Charles Hays Secondary won the AA division when I was in grade 12. They had a super good player named Liam Mcchhesney, he is my age but I’m sure you’ve heard of him as the town is quite small like you said. Cool that you want to travel the world one day, that is something I hope to do in the future too. Like you said, there’s so many cool cultures and ways of life out there, so seeing different ones would be an awesome experience. I may have to add Greece to my list too because I love their food! Maybe I’ll share a little stuff about me as well lol. I’m a fifth year Behavioral Neuroscience student at UBC! I love basketball too and play on the UBC Men’s Varsity team right now, which has been super fun! I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family and playing video games. FIFA and Horizon are my favorite games right now. I hope to pursue a job in the healthcare field such as a physiotherapist or doctor.

Mentee 2023-11-08, 09:04: Below is my response to the Rural to Urban lesson 2. Hopefully you get it this time Kevin Phan Careers 12 Ms. Ling October 23rd, 2023 Rural to Urban-Lesson 2 Response City life has always been something that I have wanted to experience, especially coming from a smaller town. I go to Vancouver regularly, whether it be just for fun, basketball, or to buy something that I cannot get here in Prince Rupert. I have many friends in Vancouver and bigger cities, and their lives seem different in many ways than that of a teenager in Prince Rupert. The things they do in their free time and opportunities they have open to them are different to us here in Prince Rupert. I think I would be able to adapt to city life well because I like to keep myself busy, and my mind constantly thinking. If I lived in a city, I believe it would stimulate my brain just by the number of things that happen at once, whether it is traffic, external noises, or someone stopping you on the street for something miniscule. There are several advantages and disadvantages of living in a big city. Some advantages are there are a lot more opportunites in terms of education, extra-curricular activities, and things available. It is also easier to buy things in bigger cities as there are more retail stores present. In smaller towns and cities, it is sometimes difficult to purchase things because the stores here may not have the item that you wish to purchase, so you must order it and even then, it might take longer than you expect. This is because Prince Rupert is a rural area, and it is not directly in on the way of common shipping routes. There are still disadvantages of living in bigger cities as well. Things like traffic, the quality of air, and crowded public spaces are common disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage of bigger cities is the cost of living, especially with inflation. As inflation increases the cost of living, the pay of workers stays the same, this is one of the ongoing problems in Canada as inflation continues to affect the world. With all these things considered, I still wish to pursue my post-secondary education in a bigger city, and even live in a bigger city afterwards. Questions: -How do you feel about living in a bigger city? -What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of living in a bigger city? Mentor 2023-11-09, 13:35: Hey Kevin, Yeah, I can see this response which is relieving :) Awesome response for lesson 2 by the way, I never realized how much harder it can be to purchase certain items in a rural area like Prince Rupert. It probably makes it super hard when new basketball shoes come out like the new Lebron's or something. I think you hit a lot the advantages and disadvantages of the city life right on the nail. Having easier access to a lot more variety of shopping and retail items is super nice but the crowding and crazy inflation is defintely something I could live without. To add onto that I think another advantage is being able to network and connect with a wider range of people from a lot of different walks of life, especially in Vancouver where the population is super diverse. You can meet a lot of cool people that can become great friends and also help you out and give advice in a lot of different aspects of life. I think this kind of goes hand in hand with its disadvantage though, which is that it's harder to make super deep connections here sometimes. I feel like being from a rural area with less people probably brings you closer to the people around you. In the city, everything is happening so much faster and there's so many more people that the connections you build are a little more surface level apart from your handful of best friends. To answer your other question, I personally don't really like living a big city like Vancouver because I find it way too loud and fast. I'm probably the opposite of you in the sense that I don't like a lot of stimulation and like a slower pace haha. But I also wouldn't thrive in a super rural area either, which is why I love Surrey, which is more suburban and is a kind of in-between of rural and urban life. It's a happy medium of quiet and fast paced, and has decent stores but it also close enough where I can go to a big city like Vancouver. I don't mind the big city life though and go through it everyday when I go to school at UBC. Nice work on this lesson though man! Feel free to move onto the ""Adulting"" module whenever your ready but also don't hesitate to ask more questions or ask me to expand on anything else. The ""Adulting"" module should be unlocked and you just have to click on it by finding it in the navigation wheel. Look forward to hearing from you again soon man!","Mentor 2023-10-12, 17:04: Hey Kevin, Just checking in to see if evreything is all good. Get started on the ""From Rural to Urban"" lesson as soon as you can, and let me know if you have any questions! Mentee 2023-10-13, 09:28: I have tried sending my response to the first lesson multiple times, im not sure why you aren't getting them. Mentor 2023-10-14, 23:47: Ahh yeah that's weird that I haven't been getting them. I see that the E-mentoring management is trying to help you out with that though, which is good. Hopefully your messages are able to send soon. Keep trying what they suggest and hopefully I start receiving the messages haha Mentee 2023-10-17, 09:51: I have tried all the ways that management has suggested so hopefully you've recieved them. Just let me know if you've recieved my response to the first part or the Rural to Urban unit. Mentor 2023-10-23, 16:44: Hey Kevin! Yeah, I recieved this response which is relieving haha. Awesome response for this part of the unit, not having much traffic in Prince Rupert is awesome because city traffic like Vancouver totally sucks :( Love some of your goals like being able to give back to your city in the future too. Cool, continue to work on this unit or move onto the next one, which is ""Adulting"". Let me know if you have any questions about anything!",,,,

I will definitely keep in mind that it can get difficult in post-secondary because everyone splits off, and I will try and remember to reach out to them as well! I am super grateful for everything that you've helped me with! You helped a lot with my worries and helped to guide me in the right direction throughout this course, thank you so much for everything! I think it would be super nice to continue chatting after the course is done and I would love to keep learning from you! I will say that I might not answer as frequently once the term ends but I will definitely try my best to remember! I will start the wrapping up module now! Mentee 2024-01-18, 16:34: Hi Emily, Sorry I didn't realize that I wrote my last message in the wrapping up module already. I would just like to say thank you so much once again for everything you've helped me through. In the short time I've gotten to know you, you have left a huge impact on my life. I feel very inspired by you as we are taking similar pathways in post-secondary. I admire that even when it was hard for you during your education journey, you never gave up. There have been many times when considering medicine as a pathway where I've felt that I wouldn't be smart enough and that I wouldn't be able to handle it. You've taught me to not give up when things get hard and to follow my dreams. Because of you, I decided to follow through with this pathway and I couldn't thank you enough. You've taught me many different techniques for studying and for maintaining my mental health and I've already seen a vast difference in my day-to-day life. You were and are an amazing mentor, and I couldn't have asked for a better one! Thank you once again, and I'd love to stay in touch with you after this class is done! Wishing you all the best, Keira. Mentor 2024-01-20, 10:15: Hi Keira, Thank you for your kind words! You have done such an excellent job and from the short time we've met I can tell that you are a very hardworking, smart, reflective, and wonderful person. You will do amazing in post-secondary and beyond! Believe in yourself - you got this! I am glad to hear that I was able to provide you some guidance. You have also made a very positive impact on my life as well. I am currently in the process of my residency applications to specialize as a doctor (after our medical degree, we must complete 2-5 years of post-graduate residency training in Canada to become independently licensed). This has been a very interesting time for me - it's like going through medical school applications a second time - but being your mentor has made me reflect on why I started this journey in medicine and what a privilege it is to be in this role. I am more than happy to stay-in-touch even after this class is over! You can message me whenever you'd like. I wish you the best of luck! Best, Emily","Mentee 2024-01-15, 09:44: Hi Emily, Thank you for your responses to my questions, they were super helpful! I agree, writing notes by hand is definitely time consuming. I never thought to annotate notes but that sounds like it would be much easier than writing out your own notee as they speak. As for the self care unit, some warning signs that I may be in need of self care are my constant low energy, negative moods, brain fog, tiredness, procrastination, low motivation, and lack of creativity. Some activities I enjoy are reading, learning new things, dance, crochet, journaling, and cleaning. What do you do to revive yourself when you're feeling low and not like yourself? How have you managed to navigate your mental health whilst in post-secondary? What are your overall tips on maintaining a good mental health? What mental health challenges did you face when entering post-secondary/adulthood? What did you do to overcome them? I look forward to your responses! Kindly, Keira. Mentor 2024-01-17, 16:10: Hi Keira, It sounds like you have many wholesome activities for self-care, which is excellent! I also enjoy reading and crocheting. I think the most important thing during a stressful time is to pause and practice mindfulness. Being aware of your limitations is the first step in identifying that something is wrong so that you can find ways to cope with it. For me, my favorite hobby is playing the guitar. I find that it keeps me grounded and allows my mind to take a break from academics. I also cope with stress by talking to trusted friends and family! When I entered post-secondary, it was challenging to navigate stress because I no longer saw my friends every day like in high school. Everyone splits off into doing their own thing in post-secondary (i.e. different schools and majors) so I had to put in extra effort to meet up or reach out to friends. I overcame this by becoming more comfortable dealing with my emotions on my own, such as finding hobbies I could do alone such as playing the guitar, cooking, reading, etc. I hope that helps! I received an email from the mentorship program today that students in your class will be wrapping up next week. I'll open the ""Wrapping Up"" module so we can both work on that. As well, let me know if you'd like to continue working through the program, or just chat even after your class is over. Best, Emily",,"Mentor 2023-11-02, 13:30: Hi Keira, Please proceed with the ""Adulting"" module next! Emily Mentee 2023-11-13, 03:13: Hi Emily, here is my long awaited response to the adulting module. Currently, I have a lot of worries regarding future finances, living independently, and having to figure things out myself. My biggest worry is having to do things alone and I'm worried that I won't always be able to figure everything out by myself. I'm going to have to pay bills, get groceries, stay on top of school work, find my way around the city, and many other respondsibilities. It doesn't sound like much but I really fear I wont be able to handle it all. To be honest, I have been very lucky growing up regarding my parents financial situation as we have always been stable and my parents have helped me through everything. Though I'm incredibly grateful for their help, it worries me that I am not as strong independently as others may be. What were your worries before going to post-secondary and how did they turn out once you went? What are your biggest worries and struggles currently? Is there anything I should be worried about or start preparing for early? What were the hardest/biggest differences when you started? What skills would you say are important to have before continuing to post-secondary and what skills will I learn whilst there? I look forward to hearing your respone, thank you! Mentor 2023-11-13, 10:34: Hi Keira, Your worries regarding the future are very valid! It's the things that you mentioned that can make adulting scary and tough. It takes a lot of courage to face these worries, but you will definitely sort them out along the way. I handled my own finances and paid for tuition and expenses myself once I entered post-secondary. I'd say it's very important to budget wisely and sort out finances. Make sure you have savings to pay bills such as monthly rent, phone bills, etc. Limiting spending on more ""recreational"" things such as buying coffee and lunch at school can help a lot. If you get a part-time job while attending post-secondary, it can be difficult to balance work and studying, so make sure you don't overwhelm yourself. Working and making money is important, but falling behind in your studies is easy, especially in the beginning. Post-secondary studies move at a much faster pace than high school and support may be difficult to find. I'd encourage you to never skip classes and attend office hours. Also, there are bursaries/scholarships you could apply for. Always apply for government student loans as well! The government frequently gives out ""grants"" that you don't need to pay back. I hope that helps a bit. Let me know if you have more specific questions that I could address! Looks like the next activity is learning how to prepare a budget. Emily Mentee 2023-12-01, 11:41: Hi Emily, thanks for the reassurance on some of my questions! I think its definitely important to attend all of the lectures and office hours, so thak you for the tips. I dont see the prepare a budget highlighted, but I am ready to move onto that one when you get a chance! Thank you, Keira. Mentor 2023-12-02, 02:22: Hi Keira, The Prepare a Budget should be Lesson 2 in the ""Adulting"" module. Let me know if you can't find it! Best, Emily Mentee 2023-12-05, 11:27: Hi Emily, here are my questions regarding the ""Prepare a Budget"" section: What is a tip(s) that you recommend for balancing school and part-time work? What was a challenging budgeting issue you have faced and how did you handle it? Kind regards, Keira. Mentor 2023-12-08, 12:57: Hi Keira, 1) To balance school and part-time work, I'd highly recommend using a calendar app of some sort to plan out your days/weeks. I use Google calendar to sync it between my computer and phone. I'd also recommend always prioritizing school over work as it's easy to fall behind in your studies in post-secondary! 2) I think paying rent was the most challenging budgeting issue. Rent in a city can be much more pricey than in rural areas, and it will take up a lot of your savings. I'd recommend making a spreadsheet to budget spending necessities, such as rent, groceries, phone data plans, etc, and set aside a fixed amount of money per month to allocate for these expenses. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have other questions! Otherwise, we can move on to another module - let me know which one you'd like to do and I can unlock it. Best, Emily",,"Mentor 2023-12-24, 21:36: Hi Keira, I've unlocked the ""Finding Inspiration"" module. Feel free to get started when you are ready! Wishing you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! Best, Emily Mentee 2023-12-25, 23:34: Hi Emily, here are my thoughts on the prompts for the first lesson! There are many things I am passionate about in my life such as skincare/dermatology, dance, history/geography, sciences, and many more. I love educating myself in such topics and strive for growth. Something that inspires me is seeing the success of others. Though sometimes it can be hard to see others achieve so much, it also motivates me to work harder so that I too can achieve great things. My current goals are to get into post-secondary, do well in post-secondary with the outcome of a successful career, improve my mental health, financial stability, and to further my education in topics of interest. Where do you find your inspiration for what you do? What helps to keep you motivated? What is something you struggle with in terms of motivation? What has changed from what you wanted in highschool vs. what you want currently? I can't wait to hear back from you! Regards, Keira. Mentor 2023-12-28, 11:14: Hi Keira, Happy Holidays! It sounds like you have some fascinating passions. It's also great to hear how you've reflected on these passions and you're working hard to achieve great things! After high school, I did 4 years of a Bachelor's degree and now I'm finishing my 4 years of a Medical Doctorate. When I was in highschool, I knew I wanted to pursue post-secondary education and potentially become an academic researcher in the life sciences. It was during my first few years of post-secondary that I became motivated to pursue graduate and professional studies in medicine. As a medical student, I find inspiration in knowing I can improve the health of my patients and my community. There were challenging times during my training, but I stayed motivated in reflecting that 'it's a marathon, not a sprint.' Having resilience is a key attribute to build through challenging times and an invaluable catalyst in shaping both professional and personal growth! Some days may feel more uphill than others, but I also coped by sharing my feelings with loved ones I trusted such as friends and family. Wishing you and your loved ones good health and happiness in 2024! Best, Emily Mentee 2023-12-28, 20:00: Hi Emily, happy holidays to you and your family! Thank you for your responses to my questions, they were super helpful! Since I'm following a very similar post-secondary pathway I am very interested in your experiences throughout your studies. I plan to do an undergraduate degree in microbiology, go to medical school, and specialize in dermatology. Lately I have been worried that I may not be smart enough for medical school and that I wont be able to keep up or handle the workload. Have you had any thoughts like these during your studies? If so, how did you handle them and move forward? I also wonder, in your personal opinion, what has been the hardest part of medical school? Having watched many videos from med students, I have heard that the hardest part for many people was both the content and workload. Please let me know your thoughts on this! Here is my response for lesson 2: My current goals are to stop procrastinating my schoolwork, sleep earlier/get more sleep, and use my spare time more wisely. I can accomplish these by going to the library after school when possible to do my work, limiting my screentime before bed, and planning ahead how I will use my spare time. What are some habits that you've built and how have they helped you achieve your goals? What goals did you have in high school? Did you achieve them? If so, how? If not, what would you have done differently? Please let me know your responses, wishing you all the best in 2024! Kind regards, Keira. Mentor 2023-12-31, 16:48: Hi Keira, It sounds like you have a very thoughtful career aspiration! I empathize with your worries. In my opinion, the hardest part of medical school was the clinical work with handling patients, working with different doctors and other healthcare staff, and the hospital environment. There was lots of work and studying, but I found that an undergraduate degree in life sciences (such as microbiology) was beneficial. There were difficult times during medical school, but having a close and supportive friend group helped me cope. During my pre-medical years in my undergraduate degree, I found it challenging to balance academic work with extracurricular activities. I would recommend prioritizing academics first as your GPA will be very important for medical school applications. There are also lots of academic support (some are free) in post-secondary if you need more help! The process of getting into medical school can be daunting and it may take several applications to be successful, but don't be discouraged! I was not accepted to medical school on my first try and had to take a research gap year in between. For lesson 2: I like your goals! I think they are very thoughtful and it sounds like you have a plan to meet these goals. I also have a habit of procrastinating, but I've it helpful to put all my deadlines into a Google calendar so I don't lose track of them. During my undergraduate studies, I also always kept up-to-date with my studies and sought help from professors, classmates, and teaching assistants (i.e. office hours) immediately when I felt like I was falling behind. I hope my responses were helpful! Let me know if there's anything you want me to elaborate on! Happy New Year! Emily Mentee 2024-01-03, 17:19: Hi Emily, Thank you so much for your responses, they were super helpful and informing! It is quite comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with procrastination whilst going into medical studies. I was also wondering what kind of extracurriculars you took/are taking during medical school. Do they regard your studies (i.e. research groups) or are they completely separate (i.e. sports or activities)? I have heard that a few people in medical studies participate in research groups/projects, do you know anything about this and if so do you recommend it? I am also relieved to hear that multiple applications for medical school is common, as that was another one of my worries. I will definitely try a google calander for my due dates as well! I am ready for the next module and I'm interested in the strategic planning module. All the best to you in 2024! Happy New Year! Keira. Mentor 2024-01-04, 16:42: Hi Keira, Extracurricular activities will be essential for your medical school application! They will take into account both research and non-science/medical activities. I was involved in research starting in year 2 of undergrad and continue to take part. I'd highly recommend getting involved in research to see whether you like it or not. Before going into medicine, I entertained the idea of pursuing a Masters or PhD in biochemistry, but after trying research I realized that the academic route was not a fit for me. There should be Undergraduate Research Student Awards (URSAs) that may be available at your post-secondary institution and are an awesome way to get involved in research and receive monetary sponsorship as well! Aside from research, I also volunteered at a hospital, tutored math and science, held leadership positions in student clubs, etc.. I hope that helps! I'll unlock the Strategic Planning module and you can get started whenever you are ready! Best, Emily",,"Mentor 2024-01-04, 16:43: Hi Keira, I don't see a ""Strategic Planning"" module but I see a ""Career Planning"" and a ""Strategic Studying"" module. I'm not sure which module you were interested in, so I've unlocked both. Emily Mentee 2024-01-09, 22:32: Hi Emily, Apologies as I meant to say ""strategic studying"". I have used some of the study methods in the video before, but studying is one of the things that I struggle with the most and therefore none of them were super effective. I often end up cramming before tests due to my packed schedule and don't often get to spread out my studying. I often will try and use concrete examples but sometimes I will confuse myself more when using them so I try to avoid that method. I haven't used the visuals and words strategy as much, but I feel like it would be slightly more effective. I do think that it would be slightly more time consuming as I would have to draw things out, but I'll definitely give that one a try! Whilst studying I usually just read my notes over and over until I finally comprehend it, and sometimes I will teach it to others so that I ensure I do understand. I think my biggest obstacle when studying is actually comprehending what I'm studying, whereas I am decent when retaining it and explaining it. What stategies do you use to revise and study for exams? How do post-secondary classes differ from high school classes, and do you study and learn differently? What are the best methods that work for you and help you comprehend and retain the most? How do you stay motivated to study after taking breaks? I look forward to hearing your responses! Kindly, Keira. Mentor 2024-01-12, 11:47: Hi Keira, It sounds like you have very insightful reflections on your studying strategies and have identified areas you could work on moving forward! The pace of post-secondary is much faster than high school. Something that might've taken a week to cover in high school will be taught in a one-hour class in post-secondary. Initially, I had difficulty adjusting to this pace, but gradually you'll get a hang of it and realize that you are much more capable than you thought! For me, I was very lucky to find a trusted study partner in post-secondary who was very smart and had similar studying strategies as I did. We would spend time studying separately to consolidate our understanding, and then we'd review each lecture together and teach each other. I think teaching another person is the best way to consolidate our learning and identify learning gaps. I also prefer to study outside of the home as I tend to focus better in the school library or a cafe. I also take regular breaks, but I always set an alarm on my phone to remind myself to get back to work. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions! Best, Emily Mentee 2024-01-12, 16:04: Hi Emily, Thank you for your tips, they definitely help! I also prefer to study in the library as I'm more productive and me and my friend will study together often. I think that teaching someone helps me the most as it ensures that I truly know the subject. When you are first introduced to a topic in class, what do you do to ensure that you are understanding the material? Is there a certain way you take notes? Do you use any apps or other sources to help you study? If you're having a hard time comprehending something, what strategies do you use to overcome that? Do you take a break and come back to it or continue to try and understand? Let me know what helps you best! I'm super desperate right now to find study methods as I have harder courses right now and a heavy schedule so any tips will help! I believe that is all for this module and therefore I'm wondering if we could move onto the Wellbeing &amp; Self Care module? Looking forward to your response! Kindly, Keira. Mentee 2024-01-12, 16:04:  Mentor 2024-01-14, 10:29: Hi Keira, Excellent questions! In post-secondary, typically PowerPoint lecture slides are used for teaching so I like to annotate my notes directly onto the slides during the lectures. I don't find writing notes by hand that useful and it can be very time-consuming. I also like to use Microsoft OneNote to organize my notes because I can sync everything between my laptop, tablet, and cell phone. I think the best way to comprehend something that may be initially difficult to understand is by watching a YouTube video about it or asking a classmate. And you're right - taking a break and revisiting the topic typically works as well! I hope that helps! I will open the Wellbeing &amp; Self Care module. Best, Emily",,"Mentee 2023-09-27, 09:32: 3photoscareers.docx i'm also self-taught at guitar, sort of. in grade 8 we played it for a bit in school but then covid started and we didn't continue in lockdown. now i've recently started playing again in my spare time but im very much a beginner. i also really like sciences and am considering doing an undergrad in biochemistry. nice to meet you and i look forward to learning more about you!

Mentee 2023-12-24, 20:57: Hi Emily, thank you for your responses to my questions. I think the calandar app is a great recommendation, I actually already use one due to my hectic schedule and I use a day-planner as well so those definitely help! I would like to move onto the ""Finding Inspiration"" module next!! Hope you're doing well and Happy Holidays to you and your family!

Emily Mentee 2023-10-24, 09:14: Hi Emily, sorry I didn't realize that the link wouldn't open. From now on I'll start typing everything here so that doesn't happen again! Here is my response to the Rural Living querstions: There are around 12,000 people in my town and about 600 students in my school. In my town, there isn't much to do around town when with friends other than going on walks, so it’s more common to hang out indoors and watch movies or play video games/board games. Personally, as an extracurricular I dance but another common one is hockey or basketball. My town is special to me because I like the weather since it rains for the most part, which is my favorite type of weather. Living in a rural community gives me an advantage because I have better job opportunities here and a good sense of community. Do you find any similarities in your city with what I've described? What are the advantages/disadvantages of where you live? What do you like about your city? Mentor 2023-10-25, 21:22: Hi Keira, Thanks for sharing all the interesting facts about your town! It sounds like a lovely community. I grew up in an urban city and I think there are about 2.4 million people living here. There are lots of recreational activities to do in the city, including outdoor parks, big shopping malls, skating rinks, swimming pools, etc.. Since there are so many people, the sense of community is not significant, but I do have a group of close friends who I grew up with and are still connected to. I think the advantages of the urban city are that there are many places you can go and there's a lot of diversity in terms of culture and food. One major disadvantage may be the ""hustling and bustling"" in an urban area where it may be more difficult to find a close group of friends to connect to.",,,,

Cheers, Rafi Mentor 2023-12-05, 03:55: Hi John, As we head into December, I wanted to check in to see how you were doing. How are your classes this term going? As a reminder, you would need to complete the following by January 29th: From Rural to Urban, Career Exploration, Adulting, plus 2 of your choice. As these sections need some time to communicate back and forth, it would be easier to start slow and start early. Hope you have a great week! Rafi Mentor 2024-01-13, 06:17: Hi John, Hope you had a good break! As we're getting near the end of the program, please let me know if there is anything you might want to check in about, or if there are any activities you'd like me to open up. Otherwise best of luck with the new year! Cheers, Rafi",,,,,

Log into MentorCity and click on “Wrapping Up” in the middle of the Navigation Wheel. Read the poem and the information about its author. Think about what this poem means to you, and if you want, share your thoughts on it! Let me know if you have any questions about what to do! If you have any other final thoughts or questions to ask me feel free to do so! I look forward to hearing back from ya soon :)",,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-18, 20:42: Hey Jaiden, super exicted to meet you! I'm Austin :). I am a nurse currently working in the yukon, I moved up here last year and it was my first time leaving my family. I think I read in your profile that you want to move to a urban city but are a bit weary because you haven't been way from family? I can for sure talk to you about my expereince if you want to hear it and maybe it can help you decide? I can also talk to you about finances which is something else I think you seemed to be interesed in. Anyways, I was born and raised in Vancouver and went to nursing school in Vancouver. I have two older sisters who are both nurses and 2 dogs. I like to spend my time outdoors and spent most of my life playing sports especially soccer. I think I want to pursue more school in the form of medical school but that is a long journey so I am working on it. Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place haha thats just how I process things. I think we are suppose to choose between a poem swap or a photo swap to get to know each other better, is there something that you prefer? I hope to hear back from you soon and hopefully I can be of some help as we get to know each other! Mentee 2023-09-19, 09:28: Hi Austin, i'm excited to meet you as well! You are right i've never really been away from my family my whole life, so moving away is going to be a big change for me and talking about thats topic plus finances would be great. I was born in Vancouver as well, but more specifically Surrey haha. If we could also talk about nursing that'd be amazing I want to be come a travel nurse in the future. I have a 5 min younger brother, were fraternal twins and we've always been told we look the same but we definitely have our differences, that it seems only we can see. I also like to spend time outdoor although with covid that was near to impossible and with my school and work schedule i'm rarely outside and on my days off I just want to rest lol. I also apologize if my thoughts are all over the place I process things the same way you do, so I think we'll get along great and i'm open to exchanging photos. Mentor 2023-09-19, 18:24: Good to hear back from ya! For sure we can talk about all those things :) I also was raised in port moody and coquitlam to be more specific haha. So a little about this activity is we have to write a 3-sentence response to each of our photos describing why you chose to share it or why you find it meaningful. Then once we both have sent 3 pictures we will have to write a 3-sentence response to at least one of your each others photos. Lastly, I think there are some discussion questions that follow this that we can go through before starting our first unit! Anyways, I have attache my pictures into a document. I hope to hear back from you soon! Mentor 2023-09-19, 18:28:  Mentee 2023-09-24, 22:48: Hey Austin, sorry for the super late reply i've been super busy with week and missed a couple days of school, but those are beautiful pictures, its also one of my dreams to see the northern lights, i will be honest i was jealous looking at that photo lol, and that hike definitely looked worth it, that scenery is just gorgeous. My photo swap is almost done just finishing up the text. Mentee 2023-09-24, 22:50: ???Im actually not to sure how to link my document on here, if you know how or if there's another way i can share it with you that'd be great. Mentor 2023-09-25, 15:04: No worries! If you lookat the botom right of this text box, there should be an option to send OR save to your portfolio. Click on the ""save to your portfolio"" and it should open up the option to add a file! Hope to hear back soon! Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:06: Hi Austin, I think I have sent my photos. Let me know if it worked! Mentor 2023-09-29, 15:14: Hi Jaiden, I don't think it sent. Also, is there a chapter you want to start with once we conclude introductions? Mentee 2024-01-08, 09:36: Hi Austin, hope you've been well. I apologize for the silence on my end. I've completed the quiz and I believe a while ago we completed the other steps on the rural to urban unit.","Mentor 2023-10-03, 19:12: Hi Jaiden, I have opened the unit ""from rural to urban"" as per your teachers request. You can choose to do or not do the ""warm up"" but have a read regardless! I can start us off by talking about my experience growing up in a urban city and if you have any questions along the way feel free to ask! I grew up in a city of a couple hundred thousand people which seems like a lot but if you are born and raised in a larger city you don't even realize the size until you end up living somewhere a bit more rural like I am right now due to work. Somethings that we do for fun as high school students are going to the mall, beaches, camping, walking around downtown which is huuuuuuge (pretty much like in shows and movies) and going over and hanging out at each others houses. Is that much different from you? I think in term of extracurriculars it reallt depends on what you like. There is always something for anybody. Because there are so many people you will never have a hard time finding a new hobby or trying something new because there will be several other people already doing those thigns. The opportunities are very much endless. I think growing up in a large city has several big benefits. One, you are around people of varying language, cultures, ethnicities and race. The diversity and multiculturalism exposes you to people you would otherwise not meet/see. This helps especially in fields like healthcare becuase you will envitably work with patietns from all types of backgrounds. Also, the networking opportunities are big due to the sheer amount of people that live here. That is good because you never know when a connection with somebody might come in handy. Anyways thats enough of me, there are some good quesitons that I want to hear from you in the discussion section of Lesson 1. I hope to hear back soon! Mentor 2024-01-08, 10:36: Hi Jaiden, its great to hear back from you! Hope you had a good holiday ?? So, ill just continue with the activity for this section. I went to a high school where the city it was in was 140k. I think my graduating class had 3-400 students in it which I think is a lot? Typically, when we hang out with friends, we would go to the nearby malls to eat lunch. Or sometimes we would go for a run in the park beside the school. Some other things high school students do here is go downtown Vancouver, go to beaches ( which we have many), hiking the local mountains, snowboarding/snowshoeing, and tons of other things that you would expect highschoolers to do. The population here is very diverse and there are tons of opportunities to explore things you enjoy and find hobbies. You will not have any problems finding a niche of people who enjoy the things you like doing for fun! This town is special to me because the access to some amazing amenities all within an hour’s drive. There is absolutely nothing that you cannot find within hours drive which is great when you are bored and trying to find something to do. Enough talking about myself, how has your experience been living in a rural city and in what ways do you think our experiences have similar? What kind of strengths do you think you get from being in a rural city? I hope you hear back form you soon. Austin",,,,

I think the most important thing when applying to schools is being very meticulous when looking at admission requirements and making clear lists for youself to refer to. That way you have an easy place to refer to anc check things off as you go. I keep all my applications in a folder on my computer and I make sub folders for each school so that I have everything I need for each application neatly in one place. It's very exciting to start applying to schools! I wish you the best of luck, I know you will make a wonderful nurse! I have oppened up the ""wrapping up"" since your class is finishing up with this program. It's been lovely getting to know you, I am very excited for you to go on to become a wonderful nurse serving your community. Please let me know if you have anny other questions! Good luck with your capstone project :) -Vanessa Mentee 2024-01-27, 14:30: Dear Vanessa, I just wanted to thank you for the guidance and support that you have provided to me as my mentor throughout the past couple of months. Your encouragement has made an impact on my personal and professional growth. I have been able to overcome challenges thanks to your willingness to share your knowledge and experiences, your mentorship has made me more confident in my abilities as a student. I appreciate your patience and the time you've put into our discussions and feedback. Our discussions were crucial for the bones of my capstone something I probably wouldn't have been able to put together without your mentorship, my teachers were extremely pleased with how well I've thought out my post-secondary journey. Thank you once again, I wish you the best of luck with your schooling and whatever the next steps are for you. Sincerely, Hope Mentor 2024-01-29, 09:47: I am so glad to hear that. You have left an impact on me too and I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to provide this support and guidance. I truly wish you all the best! It's been a pleasure!

Best, Hope Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:35: Hi Vanessa, So sorry for the late response. I was wondering what the most challenging budgeting issue is for you? And what do you recommend for trying to balance part-time work with your school workload? - Hope Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:38: For some reason, the last file is missing the sources section so here's the full thing. Best, Hope Mentor 2023-11-29, 22:23: Hi Hope, This looks like a really well thought out budget plan, great work! What I found most challenging was sticking to budgets that I made. It can be really hard when friends want to hang out and do things becuase eating out with friends can add up quickly. It's important to be able to be with friends and socialize but it's also important to try and stick within our set budget. Balancing school and work can be extra tough during exam seasons, that's why I recommend planning ahead and booking time-off with work before any big exams or assignments to allow enough study time. When it comes to part-time work, make sure that the job you pick ins't too physically exhausting becuase if it is, it will make it harder to fully rest and be present for school. My last tip would be to schedule in study time into your calendar like you would a shift at work. This ensures you have time to study and makes it easier to hold yourself accountable to your study goals. The next conversation we explore is up to you! Let me know which one(s) seem most interesting to you.

Looking forward to hearing from you in the new year! Best, Vanessa Mentee 2023-12-21, 11:17: Hello Vanessa, I'm not yet on Christmas break but I hope you are enjoying the break and hopefully some family time. Going to a university or college can benefit a person in many ways, my top 3 reasons are: Getting a higher wage More career paths and open doors Personal fulfillment, achieving my dream degree My dream career and realistic career are the same because my dream career is realistic. The only difference is my dream is more specialized and that would be becoming specialized in labour and delivery whereas where I live it's more realistic to not have a specialty and just be a registered nurse working in all areas. Mental health/stress - This will be challenging for me because it can make it hard for me to study Financial barriers Having to balance school, work &amp; social For my specialty, the only extra challenge would be obtaining the specialty. I'm unsure of the process for that and also where you can do it. What were some of the challenges that you had to overcome to pursue a post-secondary education and how did you overcome them? Merry Christmas - Hope Mentor 2023-12-26, 10:17: Hi Hope, Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays! I think it's really amazing that your dream and realistic career are the same. Even if right now you think specializing wont be the best option, that's okay becuase things may change in the future and if not you will still have opportunities to support with labour and delivery. One big challenge I had to overcome were financial barriers. I did this by working part time during school months and full time during the summers while in school. It was still challenging because I had to be very diligent with managing my time so I had enough time to study, work, and still take time to relax and be social. I also made sure to look for any opportunity for scholarships and grants and apply to everything that I was elligible for. This is a great way to help aleviate some of the financial burden. Enjoy your winter break! Vanessa Mentor 2024-01-15, 18:52: Hi Hope, I hope you're doing well and have had a good start to the new year. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon! Best, Vanessa Mentee 2024-01-21, 14:32: Hi Vanessa, Apologies for taking so long to respond I've been busy with my capstone which I'll be presenting on Tuesday, I've actually been using this discussion to help form my capstone project as it is on nursing and I am discussing some schools I'm interested in. So far I have only applied to two schools in which I haven't heard anything back because I still haven't started the important required courses for my program. To ensure I get accepted to my school and program of choice I'm going to dedicate my time to studying and homework, making sure I get the best grades that I can. What was your strategy for applying to programs and schools? How did you ensure you met your admissions requirements? And how did you keep your applications organized? - Hope",,"Mentor 2023-10-04, 16:13: I've opened up the next conversation but we can keep discussing From Rural to Urban if there's anything else you'd like to further explore! Vanessa Mentee 2023-10-17, 09:59: Hi Vanessa, I don't feel like I have all of my life values figured out at this stage of my life, but I do know I value community and a sense of belonging within the community. I want to have a good relationship with the people and help them as best I can. I'm hoping me and my peers will be able to contribute to the community and world by making a difference during this healthcare crisis, I know so many people who are looking at going into some sort of medical field and it gives me hope that our contribution will have an effect. My focus is labour and delivery nursing but because our hospital here is so small I know I'll most likely be covering all areas, in fact, I'm unsure if there will even be many labour and delivery opportunities in town once I have my degree. Our neighbouring community which is a 2-hour drive is getting a new hospital and with this, there has been tons of talk of patients from our hospital being taken there, I believe people are already being sent there to have their babies which doesn't give me much hope of pursuing my passion if I continue to live in my community. I'm interested in what some of your values are and how they align with your future career. - Hope Mentor 2023-10-18, 16:13: Hi Hope, In case no one has told you this, your life values will evolve over time and it's totally okay to not have them all sorted at this stage. I think community and belonging are great values to have and it's so great that you want to contribute back to your community. I also want to remind you that you are young and things change, just because people are going to a far away hospital now does not mean that you wont have the chance to contribute and maybe even help create better labour and delivery facilities in your own community in the years to come. Some of my values include life-long learning, advocating for people, and giving back to my community. As a result, I am pursuing a career in clinical research so that I can continue learning and discovering while advocating to new and better treatments for future patients and providing better outcomes for people in my community. -Vanessa Mentor 2023-10-25, 15:32: Hi Hope, Have you had the chance to take a look at Lesson 2 of Career Exploration? Looking forward to seeing your thoughts on the discussion quesitons. Best, Vanessa Mentee 2023-10-29, 15:31: Hi Vanessa, The first career it gave me is a registered nurse, which is the career I’m aiming to go to school for. I know I don’t have all the skills for this job but I believe I can work towards those skills and succeed. I have already had to work on stuff to make myself better suited for the job, like overcoming a phobia throughout the past few years. Having a phobia of vomit is not ideal for being a nurse and once I knew this is the career I wanted I figured that was something I’d have to work at overcoming, and if I was able to do that I feel that I can work towards developing skills as well. Nursing allows you to meet tons of people, and there are tons of new opportunities when it comes to nursing. Nursing does provide financial security which is important to me because I do want to have kids in the future and raise them in a nice home and be able to provide for them. Travel is a big part of my life as well it brings me happiness so that’s another reason I would like a job with financial security. Nursing has a high percentage when it comes to job security, due to the demand for healthcare employees. The good thing about this job is that you can go anywhere and there will always be working opportunities, that might change in the future but for now there is such a high demand that you can live anywhere and have a job. Were you ever considering a different career? Why did you change your mind? - Hope",,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 10:34: Hi Vanessa, I chose to do the poem (it's not that good) hopefully this poem helps you get to know more about me and my community. I'm excited to get to know you and learn new things over the next few months. Poem: I am from a blanket From perfume and mascara I am from yearly vactions to the warmth From you're my delicate butterfly I am from the damp forest From candle larkspur I am from yearly seafest parades From smoked salmon From the city of rainbows The town that could've been great The beaches of Mexico Where I've laughed, played, and cried. Mentor 2023-09-22, 10:16: Hi Hope! Thank you for sharing your poem with me, do you do any creative writing for fun? It seems like you have quite a talent.I am looking forward to getting to know you too! I was reviewing the topics that we will work through and it looks like we wil go through: From rural to urban, Career exploration, Adulting, and two of your choice. I'll go ahead and open up the first topic. Best, Vanessa Mentor 2023-10-31, 11:09: Hi Hope, I thik it's really great that you can recognize you may not have all the skills you need to become a nurse just yet but that you will have plenty of opportunity to develop and grow as you get closer to reaching that goal. Though I definitly agree it might be hard to be a nurse with a vomint phobia, there are a variety of specialized nursing roles that will have a much smaller chance of exposing you to vomit. I'm glad you are not letting something like a fear of vomit inhibit you from pursuing nursing! I have considered a variety of different careers during my time in university. I would take courses on new subjects and enjoy the material so much that I would consider changing my studies to go that route. This happend 2-3 times before I found what I was most interested and decided to stick with it. I thik it's important to expose yourself to a lot of different things so that you can broden your perspective and take that with you in your future. Best, Vanessa Mentor 2023-11-14, 15:02: Hi Hope! I totally relate to your fear, but it's really great that your parents are supporting you to develop these skills. We will always learn new and better ways to ""adult"" as we go through life and its nice to have people in our lives to support us and help us learn. It's okay to feel scared and unprepared, practicing and thinking ahead like you're doing now is a great way to help with those feelings. For me, I found time management to be a bit challenging, ie. making sure to keep tabs on all of my appointments and activities. To help with this I have started using a daily planner and really making sur eto stay up to date with new/changed appointments and things. You have proposed some really great action items to help you gain experience and confidence. Remember that small steps are good and you don't have to master everything all at once. If you do your best to work on these you will develop some great ""adulting"" skills! Best, Vanessa","Mentee 2023-10-01, 23:04: Hi Vanessa, sorry for the wait here's part one from rural to urban. I feel like my town is in between rural and urban but for the purpose of this unit I'm going to call it rural. I like living in a rural town but sometimes it affects my mood in a negative way because it’s hard finding things to do. But at the same time, the nature surrounding me can be extremely relaxing and therapeutic. Whereas Urban seems exciting but stressful lots of things to do, and lots of people to meet, but it also has lots of traffic and can be expensive. The population of my town is 13 thousand, and there is only one high school with a Student population of 700 supposedly.. (it does not seem like that much). There’s not much to do around town as a teenager the main things I do with my friends are go out to eat or go to see a movie. There are also very nice walking and hiking trails so if you are an outdoorsy person those are quite nice, as well as in the summer there are lakes you can go to for fishing, swimming, kayaking, etc. Sports are quite popular. Our school offers soccer teams, volleyball teams, rugby teams, basketball teams, and a hockey academy. You can also join softball, dance, gymnastics, figure skating, hockey, swimming, and other soccer opportunities outside of school. The school also has a few non-sports things like a leadership club, chess club, debate club, e-sports team, choir, jazz, and concert band. Currently, I am in no extracurriculars and I haven’t been since middle school I used to enjoy soccer and dance, and I also played the clarinet and saxophone before high school. I think what makes my town special to me is that I was born here and most of my family lives here so I grew up with my grandparents always around and a few cousins. And because the population is so small you know a lot of people and everywhere you go there are new connections being made. Living here has taught me that family truly doesn’t have to be blood-related, I have so many people looking out for me here and caring for me, and for that, I’m extremely grateful. In my opinion, living in a rural community gives you more connections, just because it is so small. In a few months, I’m hoping to do work experience at my hospital which they weren’t going to offer but because my sister is an X-ray technician I have an easier way in which will hopefully give me a small feel of what it’ll be like to work in my hospital one day. Hopefully, with my nursing degree, I’ll be able to help my town quite a bit, sadly hospitals are heavily understaffed everywhere nowadays creating huge backups, and no one should have to wait for health care. I'd like to know how your experiences differed from mine. In what ways are they similar? - Hope Mentor 2023-10-04, 16:04: Hi Hope, Thank you so much for sharing all of this with me. It was really great to learn more about you and where you grew up. I grew up just outside Vancouver in an urban area. My high-school alone had about 700 students and there were many other high-schools in the area. So definitley a lot more populated than where you are from. That's great that your school has so many sports, mine had a lot of the same things but also some different things. We had anime club, photography club, yearbook club, and some others that I don't remember. Despite the larger population, I often found myself running into people I knew at the mall, movie theatre, bowling alley, etc. which was nice, because it provided some sense of community but as I have grown up that community has faded a bit. I think that in small towns, it's possible to find a more consistent community where in bigger urban areas there are a lot more people moving to and from the city. That is so exciting that you will be doing your work experience at the hospital! I do my research as a grad student at a hospital where I do lung imaging with MRI machines. I'm also very happy to hear you are interested in nursing, hospitals are definilty in need and I agree with your statement that people should not have to wait for healthcare. Best, Vanessa",,,,

UBC also guaranteed housing for first-year students only. After my first year, I lived off campus but still within a 20 minute to school. In first year it was pretty manageable because I shared a bathroom with one roommate and we both had our own rooms. I would say I had a decent experience living with a roommate but I know it would be much different if we had to share a common space. I prioritize cleanliness and not everyone will, unfortunately. Communication is super important when you have roommates. I definitely prefer living alone and have been living alone ever since I moved out of my first year residence. However in the situation that you have to room with someone, sometimes it actually works better when it is with a stranger. You will have to make sure that the stranger has similar habits as you and is not messy beforehand though. A lot of friendships get ruined when friends room together because they get into petty fights all the time. I almost roomed with a friend but I value our friendship too much and did not want to take the risk. Something to think about before picking a roommate! I would say there are a lot of advantages that come with living on campus because you get to meet more people that way and is also easier to get to classes. However, if meeting people and long commute times are not concerns for you then it's totally fine to live off campus. For me, I enjoyed living on campus because I could stay late working in libraries or go on walks on campus whenever I wanted. UBC is a really big campus with lots of nature including a beach. It was nice how I could literally grab a pizza and just go to the beach with some friends to unwind. I also had no problem spending me-time by myself without other people bothering me while living on campus. However, this truly depends on how much you enjoy spending time on campus and this will vary depending on the school you eventually go to. The cost of living alone vs with roommates is also something to consider. You can also try to connect with some current students at your potential school and ask them about their experience to be more precise in making your own decision about whether or not to live on or off campus. Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:39: Hi Christine, Sorry, I accidentally replied in the Career Exploration unit when I meant to reply to it here. Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-11-13, 13:08: Hi Heather, Hope you are doing well and school is going okay! I don’t know anyone enrolled in both University and the Armed Forces, unfortunately. I’m not sure if you use Reddit already, but a lot of people share their experiences on that platform and you can always ask people questions on the forums too. Each school usually has its own Reddit page as well so you can post your questions there too. Ever since I moved out of my first year dorm, I had to cook for myself. I only occasionally buy take out when I just don’t have time to cook or buy groceries. I’m not the best cook but I improved a lot since my second year in university. If you already cook at home, you’re going to be completely fine! Do you have favourite dishes that you always make? I never cooked during high school when I lived at home and I wish I did to save myself the stress of not knowing what make sometimes. Living alone, I also do all the chores myself and I definitely still have time to do fun things! It will take time to balance school work, research, and extracurriculars (I currently volunteer at 5 different places). I prioritize my free time by doing things that help with my mental health such as going to the gym, doing pottery, and meeting up with friends. Doing these activities helps relieve my stress and I also find a lot of joy in doing them. I would say doing activities that relieve stress will be important when your work becomes busy and tedious. Do you do similar activities that prioritize your mental health? Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-11-15, 14:50: Hi Christine! That's so cool! I've been wanting to give pottery a try, but unfortunately because Rupert is so small we no longer have a studio. What are some of your favourite spots to meet with your friends? I feel like I'd just spend all my time in a pool or in a grocery store. Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-11-15, 18:02: Hi Heather, Ahh that's unfortunate. Hopefully the studio will come back one day! I do a variety of things depending on the day. If me and my friend both have a lot of things to do, we would go work at a cafe together. This boosts our productivity compared to working at home because we keep each other in check. I also like bouldering with my friends, trying new restaurants, or shopping. :) Spending time alone is also very valuable and I can see why you find it relaxing going to the pool or shopping at the grocery store. How is school going by the way? Do you still have exams? Let me know if you need any help with academic related topics! Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-11-15, 22:08: Hi again Christine! I just finished a Pre-cal 12 midterm today and I have a unit test in biology on Monday. I think I'm doing pretty okay but nothing seems to be going to way I planned. I feel like my work is good, but not great. I'm feeling super busy, but I don't even know if I'm doing anything at all. Math this year is stressing me out. I've never been bad at math, but it's just kinda weird this year. I've never enjoyed math at school because I knew I was being graded on it, the thought of not getting an A in high school scares me. I decided to not take calculus after my term with Pre cal 12 because I don't think I'll be successful with the teaching style of my current teacher. Which is also the only pre cal/ cal math teacher right now. Do you think Calculus is necessary? I went back and forth thinking about the topic so much and decided to drop it cause all of the careers that I'm interested in don't require calculus as a prerequisite. Most only require pre cal 11 so I switched it with a specialized science course (Fisheries Science) because I live in the perfect place to learn about it and also because it's give me a little taste of marine biology that I'll probably never go into as a career. I also have a work experience class right now and I'm absolutely loving it! I get to spend around 6 hours a week in either an orthodontic office or dental office. I love the atmosphere, the work, and especially the x-rays! It's been so fun seeing different unique cases and getting a better understanding on how the doctors, hygienists, and assistants work! It kinda makes me sad to think that I decided to go with nursing sometimes, but I know I can't do everything all at once. Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-11-19, 18:43: Hi Heather! Hope you had a great weekend! Personally, the only reason I would say high school calculus is important is so that you can do well in university-level calculus because it prepares you for the harder math. Otherwise, in my day-to-day work, I don't really use it at all. If you know you won't need any math courses in university, I honestly wouldn't worry too much. Math isn't my strongest subject and an entire year of integral calculus in my first year of university was hell for me. It's great that you already did your research to check that it's not a prerequisite for the schools you are looking at. Can you tell me more about your work experience class? It sounds like such an amazing course to have during high school. Do you get to pick to shadow anyone or does the school provide you with some options to pick from? Also not to fret!! Nursing itself is already a great career path but it also serves as an amazing stepping stone to all other health-related careers! A lot of nurses switch to other things like medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry. You are definitely not limited to just nursing and you will have invaluable clinical experience from nursing if you ever want to transition to something else. Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-11-27, 09:58: Hi Christine, My work experience course allows me to choose any career in the community. I get to choose what I'm interested in and all I have to do is make a resume for my teacher to send to them. She then sends a requests for me to go into the business and shadow whoever I want to. The school makes a contract and makes sure that the business is insured with Worksafe BC before I'm allowed to come in and ""work"". I actually picked 4 placements but my teacher was having some technical issues and was only able to come in contact with 2. I'm not too upset about it though I love watching dental and orthodontic work. I'm currently back and forth between Dr. Brar's office (General Dentist) and Dr. Corbett (Orthodontist). I've been a patient in both offices and I love going to my ""class"". I get to observe and actually do some stuff. Dr. Corbett's work is especially interesting to me. He always explains why he's doing everything to me and asks me questions on how I think things work. He taught me how to bend wire and shows me how he plans patients orthodontic plans. He wants me to put my hands in someone's mouth before I finish my placement with him and I'm super excited to do it! I'm sure it'll just be something simple, but I'm really grateful for the opportunity that they're giving me! Did you have any work experience classes? Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-12-05, 11:22: Hi Heather, I apologize for the delayed response! I hope you've been well. We are nearing the end of the term with lots of projects and presentations going on. But I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel! Wow! Your work experience class sounds truly amazing, especially how nice Dr. Corbett is. A caring mentor is honestly the best to learn from. I like how he explains and asks you questions to keep you engaged. Have you gotten the chance to put your hands to work in someone's mouth? After having these experiences shadowing dentists, would you ever consider dentistry? Back in high school, we had something similar but they're more like internships. During the summer, we would apply to various research labs in university and intern with them for 2 months. I did it one summer with a microbiology and immunology lab. It was honestly very fun and I got my first glimpse of what graduate school life was like. And now 6 years later, I am also a graduate student now! :) Did you have any other modules that you wanted to explore? I can open that up for us. Let me know! Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-12-19, 11:52: Hi Christine! Sorry for the super late response! Eveything has been piling up and I responded to your last messeage in my head and didn't actually send it...oops. I haven't had the chance to do anything in anyone's mouth yet, but I'll be doing that in the new year! I would absolutely love to go into dentistry in the fututre if the chance ever comes up! School has been a bit of a pain they're making us go right till the 22nd this year. I had a math quiz, biology unit test, and a project for careers due yesterday. I was not having a fun day as I was super confused all day, but my friends got me a Christmas gift! It was an R2D2 toaster from Star Wars! I have been loving Star Wars lately and now my collection is growing! I've also been obsessed with buying pottery pieces! My goal is to collect all the nessecities needed to move out before I actually have to move. I'm super excited to have my own place! I'm going to be flying to Vancouver on the 3rd to go Prom Dress shopping! I can't wait to see all the dresses. I've booked an appointment at TBG and Lisa's Bridal and I CANNOT WAIT! Are you planning anything fun with your family? Do you guys have any Christmas traditions? Do you celebrate Christmas? Are you excited to do anything while you're in Taiwan? Hopefully you'll be able to get all your work done quickly so you can spend lots of time with your family! Happy Holidays! Mentee 2024-01-02, 00:50: Hi Christine, Happy New Year!!! I also hope that my tests and projects went well! R2 sounds so cute! I love dogs, but my parents have always said no, so I'm waiting until I'm financially stable and have my own house! Is your brother also attending University? My goal is to collect all the basic things that I'll need to avoid the stress of buying everything all at once. I still need to find a Tiger Brand rice cooker, a bread maker, a set of towels, cooking utensils, pots, pans, more bedding, Star Wars kitchen towels, and a few other things that I can't seem to think of right now. What's one thing that you have in your place that you can't live without? My goal is to have to reduce my waste once I'm living on my own. I want to start using cleaning supplies that come in less plastic packaging! I'm hoping to move to either Victoria or Nanaimo. My other friend is also trying to convince me to go to Prince George, but I'd rather not. One of my really close co-workers said that I'm welcome to come and be her roomate if I end up going to Victoria! If i'm in Nanaimo I'd like to have my own apartment though. Have you ever visited Vanvouver Island? I'm leaving for Vancouver tomorrow and I am so excited! I'm hoping to find my perfect dress. The prom look I have in my head is a dark green or burgundy dress with pearl and gold accessories. I've already bought my heels last year because I was so excited! They're white and the heel part is built to look like stacked pearls! I'll have to send you a picture once I find my dress! Did you have a ""prom"" or something similar when you were in high school? If you did what colour and style was your dress? I've also recently gone back to Taekwondo and have been bodyslamming myself into the ground trying to do flips... boy I was so sore the first couple days. I never realized how much I missed it! I'm thinking that I'll have to rejoin either now or when I'm in University. Have you ever tried taekwondo or any other martial arts styles? I hope you had a nice relaxing holiday with your family! Sincerely, Heather :) Mentor 2024-01-08, 16:32: Hi Heather, Happy New Year to you too! Hope you had a great start to the new year. Owning a pet definitely comes with a lot of responsibility and being financially stable would help a lot, especially when it comes to potential vet bills. I really want to have a cat (an orange cat or a ragdoll) because they're usually less demanding than dogs where you would have to walk them daily. However, I am still hesitant to do it because I'm unsure what my next 5 years would look like. It would probably be best to wait until I have a stable job. My older brother graduated from the University of Toronto and has been working in Toronto for a while now. He works as an investment banker, so quite different from me. Victoria and Nanaimo both sound great! I've only been to Victoria though. So I'm guessing you are looking at schools in those two places? I hope your dress shopping went well! I did have prom in high school. I was lucky enough to attend it twice in 11th and 12th grade. For both times I wore black actually, the first was a lace maxi dress with a high slit and the second was an off-the-shoulder sweetheart neckline maxi dress. I miss prom so much now that I think about it! I haven't really gone to a formal event like that ever since. Taekwondo sounds so badass! Do you need to be really flexible for that? My friend asked me to try jiujitsu but I haven't gone yet. It looks really interesting though. I guess the closest to martial arts that I've tried is boxing. I made it a New Year's resolution to get back into boxing and swimming, so hopefully I can do more of that this year. Thank you for your well wishes! I also hope you had a fun holiday and feel refreshed to start school again! Cheers, Christine Mentee 2024-01-09, 10:50: Hi Christine, I think that having an orange or a ragdoll cat would be so fun! They both look so cute. That's so cool that your brother works in investment banking one of my oldest cousins also worked at a bank doing something simmilar to that and has now retired at around the age of 40! I hope to be like him one day! I have been looking into schools in both Nanaimo and Victoria, but realistically now that I'm thinking about it. I think that Prince George would be the best option for me. It's close to home and the cost of living is a lot lower compared to other places. My parents would also be able to visit me whenever they wanted as it's only an 8-10 hour drive from Prince Rupert. I also know a lot more people there and my childhood taekwondo friend who I basically consider to be my brother also wants me to go there. He told me that it's hard to transition from living in a small town with family to moving on your own to a giant city. He told me that it'd be better to start small and transfer later on if i still don't want to stay in Prince George. I hate that he's right though... I had so much fun Prom dress shopping! Both my friend and I had a blast trying on different dreses. Eventually we each found our own dresses. I decided on a dark green dress with a lace corset top and a slit satin skirt bottom. I also fell in love with a black corset dress with lace, but decided to pick the green one. I think I'm going to try and find a similar black corset top dress, but in a shorter length for my walk up. I'm hoping to wear my prom dress as many times as I can. I want to attend prom, take pictures, have a tea party with my friends in our gowns, and get my coworkers to get really dressed up for a dinner before I leave. My coworkers are very excited to get dresses up for dinner as we don't have very many occasions to dress up for. Some of them still have their prom dress and have agreed to wait till the dinner to wear it one last time before selling it or getting it hemmed to a short dress. I think you shpould try to go to Jiujitsu with your friend! I'm also hoping to try Jiujutsu sometime before I graduate! Boxing is really fun too! My taekwondo teacher is really into sparring and combat stuff so he got us to try boxing a couple times and I enjoyed it. My New Year's resolution is to clear up my skin, workout more, try adult gymnastics, get back into martial arts, and swim more. Although I'm dreading school and it hasn't been easy getting myself back into the routine, I'm super excited to graduate in 5 months! I can't wait for graduation to come!!! I hope you had fun with your family and that you're getting back into the regular school routine with ease! Sincerely, Heather",,,"Mentee 2023-10-13, 10:00: Hi Christine, Now that we're moving onto our career unit, what made you decide to go into medicine? what did you do to get yourself to where you are today and how did you prepare yourself for it? What did you do to get the work experience opportunities that you did? I don't think my reasons for going into the healthcare field are that grand like other's are. Unfortunatley I just want a career that can support me and keep me financially stable while providing me with an ever changing work environment. Currently I have applied to CNC, Coast Mountain College, Selkirk College, Camosun College, NIC, VIU, UBCo, and the canadian Armed Forces. My goal is to become a Nurse Officer for the Canadian Armed forces for 4-6 years before deciding on if I want to stay or leave to a civialian position. I've been accepted into the three programs that I've applied to at CNC, which is great for me becasue that means that I've successfully secured a back up school. I want a job that changes daily and challenges me mentally and physically. It would be an honour for me to help people during their hardest times an being able to serve my country would be the coolest thing ever. My goal is to stay physically fit, so I think that having a job that requires me to be physically and mentally fit would be perfect for me. What careers do you think would fit my values? Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-10-15, 23:06: Hi Heather, I didn't always know that I wanted to go into medicine like many of my peers. Although I was always interested in science and anything STEM-related growing up. I completely understand where you're coming from about having a ""unique"" reason to go into a specific career. It is totally fair and normal to have a career goal for the sake of being able to support yourself and live a comfortable life. I would say I share the same sentiment as you in that regard. Originally, I wanted to be a marine biologist. Yet some part of me was hesitant to pursue that because I wasn't confident that this could be a reliable career for me to be able to support myself. I then decided to just go into science because it is a broad field and I would be able to make a decision later on. I also thought about going into biotechnology and working in corporate. However, as time went on I realized that I do enjoy helping others and being able to see improvement in people brought me a lot of joy and a sense of purpose. In my first couple of years in university, I never committed to the idea of pursuing medicine because I was too scared to try knowing how competitive it is. Then I realized that I would definitely regret not even giving it a try because I think I would enjoy practicing medicine as a career. Even though I made the decision much later than many others, and I know it will take me longer to get to where I want to be, I know that all of this will be worth it. Have you finished your applications already? That's a lot of schools and congrats on finishing your applications if you submitted them already! Being a nurse officer in the armed forces sound super cool. And wow! Already been accepted to CNC, that is amazing! I also would want a career that can challenge me mentally and keep me on my toes all the time. I think if you want something also physically challenging, I feel like being in the armed forces would require some training in that aspect so that might be of more interest to you. Besides nursing, have you thought about physical therapy/physiotherapist or occupational therapy? Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-10-23, 10:00: Hi Christine, I've considered just about everything that interests me. Police officer, dental hygiene, orthodontist, fisheries officer, dietician, nursing, and coast guarding. My top choices were nursing, dental, and coast guarding. Then I thought hard about what I wanted in life and how I wanted to got there. I know that I want to buy a house before I'm 30 and that I want to graduate with the least amount of debt possible. I also don't want to go to school for two long because I know my dad is getting old and I want him to see me have a life that is stable with a well paying job that I like. The most important thing to me is that my dad sees that I'll be okay. I also need to make more than I'm currently making, I refuse to go to school and spend my time and money on a degree that pays me less than my current job. That rules out a few of my options as some career paths pay too close to my current $30/h. I also hate working in a typical work office so that was never an oprion for me. I don't want to go on a job hunt after I graduate because I don't like the feeling of ""what if I don't get the job after 4 years of school"". The decision I came up with was a mix of basically all of my top career choices. Being a nurse officer for the armed forces seemed like the best choice to me. I was in between becoming a dental hygienist and a nurse for the armed forces, but after talking to a recruiter I decided to go to nursing for a couple reasons. As a nurse, because I'd have a bachelors degree I'd get to be an officer istead of an NCM. Both options sound great but I just like the sound of officer more. I'd basically be a supervisor, but we'll deal with that when we get there. I'm not thrilled about being a ""supervisor, but I think I'd hate being an NCM more. I'd work with them as soon as I finish school and I wouldn't have to make any further decisions after it. They'd pay for my schooling and my time so I won't have to worry about any debt. I would also have to be physically fit. I'm currently waiting for the recruiting office in Victoria to get back to me. I'm super excited now! Were you ever super confused on what you wanted to do? Did you figure it out yourself or did you ask someone for help? Thanks, Heather Mentee 2023-10-24, 23:02: Hi Christine, I forgot to mention earlier in my message to you. Can we work on the adulting unit next? I'm curious about living on campus vs. off campus and was wondering about your thoughts and opinions on both sides. What did you end up choosing? I typically manage cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, and transportation by myself. How was it to manage yourself during the first few years away from home? Was it hard building a routine in a whole new place? Would you say it's easier to live alone or with a roommate? I personally want to either live alone or with a friend I know and trust. I really don't want to move in with some random person. I'm worried about housing because I'm not sure if I want to live in a single dorm on campus or in a house/ apartment that im renting in my own. It's important for me that wherever I go has parking. I think I'd really struggle with living on campus and I don't even know why. I feel like after a long day of classes I'd just want to get away from the school and the people at school and unwind in my own space. What was your experience? Thanks, Heather Mentor 2023-10-31, 13:23: Hi Heather, I'm so sorry about the delayed messages this week. I have quite a lot on my plate right now as I am applying for a grant that is due in a few days. Thank you again for sharing your path to deciding what you want to do for your career. I applaud you for being so considerate and logical when it comes to planning your future. It takes a lot of maturity to do that! I resonate with you on the part about your dad. I also wish to be able to find a job where I can be able to support my parents. However, in this economy that seems extremely difficult. I also have doubts about whether or not I chose the right career. My path is in academia and healthcare, which takes much longer to be financially independent compared to people working in tech or business. However, I still believe that healthcare is something I am passionate about and would most likely be unsatisfied if I did something else. I am extremely grateful that my parents are supportive of any decision that I make. They actually tried to persuade me not to pursue medicine because they thought it would be too tiring for me. They just want me to be happy and I recognize that not all parents are like this. Originally, I was also unsure but meeting people along the way who are also giving their best shot at applying to medicine inspired me to try harder as well. You miss 100 of the shots you don't take. If I don't at least try, I know I will regret it in the future. Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:35: Hi Christine, I'm also sorry for the late response. I read your messages and replied in my head and then looked back and realized that I didn't send anything. Good luck with the Bursary! I need to start looking at Scholarships and Bursaries too. I really wan tto apply to a lifeguard bursary to see where it takes me. Although even if I get into the Armed Forces ROTC program and they pay my tuition for me, I'd still want to apply for scholarships. The recruiting office in Victoria has recently contacted me and put me on their list. I'n January I'll be meeting up with a recruiter in Prince George to do my Aptitude test! Do you know anyone is enrolled in both University/ College and the Armed Forces? That was very thoughtful of you to chose not to room with a friend because you value your relationship too much to risk it. I'm hoping to go to Uni/ College on Vancouver Island. I think I'm still leaning towards having my own apartment because they only guarantee first years and I'll probably have to move out my second year anyways. I think it'd save me the hastle of have to move another time and learn to get used to a new environment. CAmosun also doesnt have on campus housing and I'm hoping to attend either VIU or Camosun. I also want to be able to leave my belongings in my apartment while I'm at training for the Armed Forces during my breaks, having a deadline to move everything would cause too much stress for me. I also want to have a place if a family member or friend were to come visit for a night that I'd be able to provide them with a place to stay. I also really want a kitchen as I don't think i can survive off just campus food. I feel like I'd be miserable not being able to cook for myself. What do you usually do for food? Did you ever have a meal plan or were you responsible for your own meals? Although I usually do my own chores and tasks. How do you manage your time to be able to do these things? Do you have any free time or do you feel like you're always too busy to relax and enjoy your day? Thanks, Heather",,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 10:58: Hi Christine, It's Heather! I' your mentee from Charles Hays Secondary School. Here is my ""I Am From"" poem. I am from disney mugs From Olaplex and Glymedplus I am from Vietnamese New Years From ""We found you in a trash can and brought you home, Heather"" I am from the rain From cloud berries I am from Seafest From pho and spring rolls From the crow that exchanges starfruit for gold The Kendal The Earl Mah Aquatic Centre From spending hours and hours everyday as a patron to working there. Mentee 2023-09-19, 11:00:  Mentor 2023-09-21, 21:47: Hi Heather! It's nice to meet you. Thank you for sharing your poem with me! I can sense that you incorporated things in your life that are meaningful to you in the poem. I also briefly looked at your profile and it's cool to see that you have a range of career interests! Your interest in wanting to be a marine biologist caught my eye because that was also what I wanted to be when I was younger. But of course, things change and we might not always stick with what we wanted to do when we were younger. I am also an avid hair claw clip collector, although mine always breaks for some reason. To briefly introduce myself, I am currently a master's student at UBC Vancouver in the experimental medicine program. I'm excited to start this semester with you and please feel free to ask me any advice related to school or future careers. We will be working through some of the modules based on what your interests are. Please let me know which topic you would like to start with and I can open up the module for you. As a side note, I can understand how school can get hectic sometimes. If you feel that you need a break at any point or that you need some more time to reply, please feel free to just let me know! I look forward to hearing back from you. :) Mentor 2023-10-12, 16:30: Hi Heather, Hope you're doing well! Please feel free to add any comments or questions you still have lingering about the Rural to Urban module. Always happy to discuss more with you. In the meantime, I have also opened up the Career Exploration module as per your teacher's request. Happy Thursday! Cheers, Christine Mentor 2023-12-19, 02:24: Hi Heather, I haven't heard from you in a while and I hope you're doing well! How are exams going for you? Any exciting activities planned for winter break? I just flew back to Taiwan 2 days ago and I'm so glad to be back with my family for the holidays. Granted, I am technically still working from home but I am still very happy to be back. Hope to hear from you soon! Cheers, Christine Mentor 2023-12-21, 02:26: Hi Heather, Thanks for the update! I always love hearing about them! It sounds like you are almost done with school with one more day to go! Good luck! Hopefully, your tests and project went well. My friend is also a Star Wars fan and she named her samoyed R2. She's a huuge fluffy white dog. That's smart that you are collecting kitchenware early so you don't have to worry about it later. Do you know where you'll be potentially moving to? And, omg prom dress shopping in Vancouver sounds super fun! I hope you have a blast at your appointments and find the perfect prom dress :) My family doesn't really celebrate Christmas so it'll just be a normal day for us haha. But my brother is also flying in from Toronto back to Taiwan, so I am really happy to just be together with my family. We'll definitely be eating a lot of good food together though! That's our way of spending quality time. I hope you have an amazing holiday season and make sure to dress warm for the cold weather! Take care and I'll see you in a bit ( ???)? Cheers, Christine Mentor 2024-01-12, 00:19: Hi Heather, Wow, retiring at 40 sounds like a dream! And I see your friend has a good point, you can always transfer later on if you feel like you're ready for another change of scenery. Your dress sounds absolutely amazing! Is prom going to be on the last day of school? I definitely should've worn my dress more but unfortunately, I only wore them once and they are just collecting dust now back at home. Your New Year's resolutions are awesome, I should be more active too! I hope you have a smooth transition back into school and cherish your last couple of months in high school with your friends. Time will fly by very fast! Cheers, Christine Mentor 2024-01-15, 14:03: Hi Heather, I hope you're having a great start to the week! This is just a reminder that we still need to go through 2 more units before January 29th as per instructions I received from your class. Let me know which unit interests you and we can get started with them! Cheers, Christine Mentee 2024-01-15, 14:24: Hi Christine, I totally forgot that we even had topic to work on. Let's open up paying for school and getting hired! I might take a bit to get back to you as I'll be driving up to prince George on the 21st, my CFAT test is scheduled for the 23rd, and I scheduled my wisdom teeth removal for the 24th. Im giving myself a day before I drive back to Prince Rupert and I'll be taking my Biology and Pre-cal finals hopefully on the 29th if I'm not super bruised and puffy. Have you gotton your wisdom teeth taken out? i am so excited to see the process! I don't even know why. I just really hope that my face doesn't go too puffy....I'm not sure when prom is but it's usually the weekend after our commencement ceremony which is planned to be on June 7th! I'm not super interested in the actual prom party, but i just really want to wear my dress! Thanks, Heather Mentor 2024-01-22, 13:15: Hi Heather, I apologize for the delayed response and I hope you had some time to briefly browse the topics that you picked. I understand that you're course is wrapping up very soon, so please do as much as you are able to or if you have any other questions you want to ask me. You are also able to work on these and stay connected once the program ends, so there is no rush. Just let me or the ementoring staff know! I will also open up the Wrapping Up unit for you. Best of luck with your CFAT test tomorrow. I know you will do an amazing job! I haven't gotten my wisdom teeth removed because they are all grown and aren't causing any problems for me. But, I think it's probably still a good idea to remove them before they do start causing problems later on. Hope the procedure goes well! Cheers, Christine Mentee 2024-02-11, 00:32: Hi Christine, I am so sorry for the late response everything's been go go go for me. How have you been? Has anything new happened? I would love to keep in continue keeping in contact with you if you're okay with that! I've really enjoyed talking to you during these past few months. After finishing up my work experience class and ending my time at my dental and orthodontic office, I've decided that I want to switch back to my original plan and go into a career in dental. I'm planning to start in dental hygiene and advancing once I get tired of it or stay forever if I end up loving it. I think I'll end up loving dental hygiene though. I've decided to go to CNC in Prince George for their pathway to dental hygiene program and I plan to either stay all 3 years for my diploma or move to Nanaimo for years 2-3. I also plan to get my bachelors in dental hygiene once I'm registered as it'll only take another year of schooling. I'm planning to live on my own off campus and have contacted an apartment that I'd love to live in and added myself to their waitlist! My CFAT went well. I had to stay at the military base from 8-5:30... I thought I was going to lose it. It was a day full of tests, paper work, interviews, medicals, and waiting. I got my wisdom teeth out the next day and everything was fine. I ended up driving 10.5 hours home on the third day and arrived at 12:30AM despite them telling me not to do anything that day, which was a terrible idea as I couldn't take my medication while driving and the lower left side of my jaw was puffy for around 2 weeks instead of my expected 3-7. Everything else was fine though! I also had to rush and make up all my final projects and tests as we were starting a new term. Now I only have 20th Century History, English, Chemistry, and Fisheries Sciences! I've also decided to decrease my work hours after school from 30 to around 25. I now have 3 days off a week instead of 2! I've also signed up for a few 6AM spin classes and powerlifting classes during the week as I'm hoping to increase my endurance and strength. I do not want to fail the physical parts of basic training as that'd just be embarrassing for me. I'm really excited to graduate and get things started now! Mentee 2024-02-11, 00:41: Hi Christine, I almost to say happy lunar new year! ?? Sincerely, Heather Mentor 2024-02-15, 15:14: Hi Heather! Absolutely no worries for the late reply! I'm so glad you enjoy the conversations we've been having and I'm also glad to continue chatting :) If you ever have any questions about anything, feel free to drop them here. For some updates, I just presented my first poster for my master's project last Friday at BC Children's Hospital, so that was pretty exciting! But other than that, everything else is pretty much the same as usual. Ohh wow okay, dental hygiene sounds really awesome! Yea, I think it's smart and definitely worth it to get a bachelors because it's only an additional year. Glad your CFAT went well! But since you decided to go with dental, you won't need the CFAT anymore right? Ahh the wisdom teeth stuff sounds stressful but thankfully you're all recovered now. Woah, 25 hours a week is still a lot?! Where do you work? Is it at the swimming pool? And wow 6AM...You are an inspiration Heather. Keep up the good work!! I need to be more like you but I really am just not a morning person :/ Good luck with the rest of your classes and a happy late Lunar new year to you too :)","Mentor 2023-09-27, 11:23: Hi Heather, I hope you're doing well! I opened up the From Rural to Urban module for you as that is the first module that your teacher would like you to start with. We will need to complete 5 modules in total to receive credit. Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing back from you. Cheers, Christine Mentee 2023-09-29, 10:04: Hi Christine, I have been cracking my claw clips left and right lately and am running low, so obviously that means i need to get more. I live in Prince Rupert and it's the saddest town I've ever seen. I love it and hate it at the same time. The weather is almost always rainy and gloomy. There's basically nothing to do and there are very limited places to go to. If you love the forest and the ocean this is the place to go! Thats the part I love about Prince Rupert we have lots of trails and you can see the ocean from basically anywhere. Even with the natural abundance that we have I'm not the type to go paddle boarding in the winter or go on a walk in the rain. One of my favpurite places in town is where I work the Earl Mah Aquatic Centre. Our pool is like my second home and I find myself in that building basically everyday. If I'm not working, I'm swimming and hanging out with my co-workers. Our indoor climbing wall is quickly becoming another one of my favourite spots! The people there are so nice and encouraging. I've actually just ordered a new pair of climbing shoes to go with my new harness and chalk bag! Prince Rupert has a very touristy area called Cow Bay and I'd recommend looking up pictures if you're interested in the view! Two of my uncles own Java Dot Cup (a small cafe) and the other uncle owns Smile's Seafood Cafe. We have mountains lining our whole city. Prnce Rupert is a pretty small community but we're all pretty tight knit from what I've seen. Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:58: Hi Christine, I just realized that I've missed some things in my last message. Living in a rural area has helped me build lots of realationships with people of all ages. Being in such a small town, everyone knows everyone. That could be annoying for some people, but I don't mind it. It makes talking to people and connecting a little easier for me. Things are a lot slower here. The lack of variety in grocery stores and shops annoy me though. The lack of variety in Prince Rupert makes me want to leave for a couple years to see if I was just too young to enjoy the environment around me or if it wa really just not made for me. I'm hoping to leave for a few years of university and work. After that I'll see if I want to move back to Rupert or if I need to find another place for myself . What was it like for you living in an urban area? Mentor 2023-10-07, 15:32: Hi Heather, Wow! Thank you so much for sharing about your experience at Prince Rupert! I looked up some images and it does look beautiful, especially the ocean and the fact that you are able to see it from almost everywhere. I totally understand how you feel that sometimes there isn't much to do in a small town. Being in a slow-paced town isn't everyone's cup of tea. However, I do envy the aspect of having a tight-knit community. I would say that is quite the opposite here in Vancouver. It feels like everyone is in their own little bubble/ world. I didn't grow up in Vancouver and I only moved here 5 years ago. I think I settled in nicely but have yet to find a community that I truly resonate with. Hopefully one day though! But I'm glad that you are able to strengthen your hobbies through swimming and climbing! Those are actually two things I also wanted to get better at. At UBC, it's free for students to use the pool. I've been trying to get myself back into swimming but with the cold weather slowly approaching, it's been hard I have to admit. I also used to go bouldering pretty often and it was really fun! It's cool to know that you're doing similar activities as me. In terms of the lack of variety in Prince Rupert, I do think that it would be an amazing opportunity in the future if you are able to go to a new location, preferably an urban city, to explore for a bit to see what you like and don't like. Personally, I grew up in an urban city my entire life. I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan and moved to Canada after I graduated high school. I loved the fact that everything was so convenient and reachable in terms of transportation. We have a very integrated underground subway system and high-speed rail system that gets us to different places very quickly. I also enjoyed different parts of the city that are known for different things such as night markets and shopping areas. We have a LOT of night markets in Taiwan and there's always new food to try out. In terms of academic-related opportunities, we have quite a few universities in Taipei and I was able to secure a few different research assistant/ volunteering positions during high school. I think being in an urban city generally allows for more opportunities to branch out no matter what you're interested in. You can always find something that matches your specific interest because of the diversity in an urban city. Being in an urban city doesn't always mean that people are always running around being busy. There are also slow parts of the city where there's a lot of greenery and nature for people to take a break from the city. There's certainly a lot of greenery and forests surrounding UBC and I love that we can be so close to nature. Do you think you would enjoy living in a more urban city? Mentee 2023-10-13, 09:41: Hi Christine, Although I hate how boring it is here, I think my ideal place to live is in a small town near a big city so i can drive back and forth and kind of experience both whenever i want to. Growing up in Taipei seems so cool! What made you want to go to University in Canada? Do you plan to move back home after you finish schooling or are you planning on staying here? What was it like for you moving here and then getting hit with a pandemic? I've only been to Asia once for a family visit to Vietnam and although I didn't love being there for a whole month with the mosquitoes preying on me. I also stayed in a small area on my grandpa's farm in a town called Ben Tre, so there wasn't a whole lot 6 year old me could do. Where was your favourite place to go to in Taipei? Do you drive in Vancouver or do you use public transit? My favourite thing to do in Rupert year round is drive, so I think living in Vancouver would be really hard for me as traffic doesn't work the same way as it does in a small town. From what I've seen while visiting my family in Vancouver the roads are chaotic and everyone seems like they're in a rush to get somewhere. I think my biggest challange if I were to move to the city would be navigating the roads on my own while driving and finding parking spots. Parking sounds like a nightmare, and I dont even mind parellel parking. I feel like I'd have a breakdown while trying to park in a busy area, but I also can't imagine my life without my ca. It'd be much worse than having a breakdown mid-parallel parking. I think the upside would be all the grocery stores. I LOVE grocery shopping, it was actually becoming a problem for me so I had to cut back on it. Mentor 2023-10-15, 22:34: Hi Heather, Thanks for sharing! I really enjoyed reading your comments haha. So I was actually born in Canada and I stayed here until I was 6 years old, then moved back to Taiwan with my parents. My parents always had the plan of sending me back to Canada eventually for me to settle here. I don't think I'll be moving back home anytime soon and I hope to find a job here that is sustainable. The pandemic hit when I finished second year of university and I escaped back to Taiwan since school went online anyway. Taiwan had the pandemic under control and life was actually pretty normal while everywhere else in the world was going through a chaotic phase. However, I feel bad for the students who had to spend their first year of university attending Zoom University. I felt pretty lucky to have a safe place that I could go back to in Taiwan. Oh! That's cool that your family is from Vietnam. I've never been but I'd love to visit someday. And I definitely agree, the mosquitos back in Asia are something else. My favorite place to go in Taipei would be Shilin Night market! I started going there when I was very little so it holds a special place in my heart! Interesting observations you have about driving in Vancouver haha. I do a combination of driving and transiting, depending on the location and difficulty of finding parking. I actually don't find it too chaotic driving here, unless you drive downtown that is. However, I think chaotic driving downtown is expected everywhere so there is no surprise there. Everywhere else, driving and transiting is quite convenient. I heavily rely on Google Maps wherever I go and I am able to navigate pretty decently. As someone who is extremely directionally challenged, I'm sure you'll do much better than me! And yea, definitely would not want to have a breakdown mid-parallel parking..that would be my worst nightmare. Ahh, we do have an abundance of grocery stores here ahaha! I do enjoy grocery shopping very much too. I find it relaxing. :)",,,,

It's been a pleasure working with you. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have any questions or need advice. Micheline","Mentor 2024-01-02, 21:56: Hey Fiona! This unit is open now :) Micheline Mentee 2024-01-05, 02:33: Discussion Question My warning signs: Noticing that I'm doomscrolling Lacking energy to get through classes Cant concentrate Procrastinating Activities I enjoy Reading Crocheting Watching book content on youtube Petting my cat Talking to friends Mentee 2024-01-05, 02:47: Discussion Questions: self-investigation What do you like to do when you notice you're not at your best, or in a slump? Have you had any mental health issues in or due to post secondary? If so how did you go about navigating it Are they any mental health benefits from post secondary? How do you maintain your mental health? Mentor 2024-01-08, 11:04: Hi Fiona, Thank you for sharing your list! My warning signs are pretty similar. I have trouble concentrating, and my head starts to hurt. Things I like to do to help me feel better are going for walks to get some fresh air, spending time with my friends or running errands just to change what I'm doing in my day! If I am feeling down, or tired, sometimes I will nap to try and give myself more energy. In my second-year of university, I felt very sad for a couple of months. I missed my family, and I felt isolated in Montreal. I knew I needed to integrate with the community and spend time with friends. So, I messaged someone I had met in my Math class and asked if she wanted to study together. We became really good friends over the next few years, and she helped me through a lot of hard times. I also applied for a job, because that made me get outside and spend time with other people. Being in the company of others really helped me get back on my feet. Almost all post-secondary schools have mental health support. It is VERY common for students to feel overwhelmed, sad, anxious, etc. during school. There are some incredible resources out there from each school to support students. I maintain my mental health by staying organized, writing lists of everything to do, and making sure I have time for self-care. Time for yourself is super important. Each day, I try and walk or bike outside because that is what helps me stay happy. What is the first thing you do when you notice you are feeling down or in a slump? Talk soon :) Micheline Mentee 2024-01-11, 17:42: When I notice I'm in a slump, making an organized schedule or checklist of the things I need to do helps me. Ive only started doing it recently but I've noticed it helps me feel more in control of my life rather than just getting pulled along by responsibilites Ive put off until the last second. I also like taking a long shower, and taking time to do my skincare to feel refreshed and more prepared to tackle work. When I'm feeling down I like rereading my favorite book, watching a show or just going to sleep. Mentee 2024-01-11, 17:52: Lesson 2: self-care action plan Action How I will make it a part of my life Get more sleep Set reminders to go to sleep, read a book instead of going on my phone before bed, drink de-caffeinated tea instead of black. Lower my phone screen time Read more. Take out books that have been reccomended to me from the library Start going to the gym Talk to my friends who I know already go about gym axiety and how to use equipment. Make a schedule (tuesday, thursday, weekends) that works with dance and ask Dad for membership. Discussion Questions: How do you prioritze self care? And how do you balance it well with school. Mentor 2024-01-14, 11:06: Hi Fiona, Thank you for sharing your action plan! I think those are great ideas. Gym anxiety is a real thing - it is really hard to feel comfortable in a new setting, especially with other people around. But everyone starts somewhere! I hope you get a chance to talk to your friends who go, or maybe you can join them. That is a great question about prioritizing self-care. That is actually something I struggle with. If I am studying for a test, I sometimes will not get outside for a walk because I am worried about not doing well on my test. To avoid this, I focus on time management. I study early, so I don't feel overwhelmed. Also, I realized that going for a quick walk actually makes me study better. So I try and make enough time each day for self-care, even if it is only for 30 minutes. That took me a few years to learn. I will open up the next lesson ""Career Exploration"" for whenever you're ready to start it. Talk soon :) Micheline Mentee 2024-01-15, 08:52: Ive never tried going for walks during or before studying, but I do enjoy walks alone so I might give that a try. I will start the next unit.",,"Mentor 2023-11-03, 12:57: Hey Fiona! This unit is open now. Let me know if you have any questions. Talk soon :) Micheline Mentee 2023-11-04, 21:15:  Mentor 2023-11-06, 09:42: Hey Fiona, You make some really good points on your list, and I think you have the right idea about asking for help for some of the things you don't know. I still call my dad if something goes wrong with my car, and he always loves to help! There is nothing wrong with asking for help, whether it's from your parents, or people in the community or school. That brings me to my next point - if that ""reality check"" of studying comes along in university, you are not alone. I can guarantee every other student in that class is feeling the same thing, and that is what 1st year is all about. You learn how to study! You learn what works for you and what doesn't. And fortunately, there are many many people to ask for help. Universities have tutors, teacher assistants, and even the professors are all there willing to help and support you. I felt I had more support in university for courses than I did in high school. Was it hard for me to find good groups of people in university? No, it wasn't! In fact, in my first year, I lived quite far away from campus. But pretty much the entire first year class is looking to make friends, so schools host a lot of events to help you meet other students. I also met friends by sitting together with them in class. On top of this, I made friends in the community. There are lots of community groups or places you can go where you like to do something, and then you often find other people there who have the same interests as you! So it's a very common worry to have, but you would be surprised how easy it is to make friends. Just don't be afraid to put yourself out there :) Micheline Mentor 2023-11-23, 15:39: Hey Fiona! Feel free to move on to the next lesson in this unit when you have time. Thanks, Micheline Mentee 2023-11-28, 09:27: Hi Micheline, Im so sorry for the late reply, I've been really preoccupied latedly with school an the high school musical coming up. Ill get started on the next lesson. Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:31:  Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:37: Discussion Questions: Budegeting and managing money I will be honest, money was never a thing I had to worry about, my parents gave me an allowance because they knew it was important for me to able to handle money by myself. This has helped me growing up to know the difference in wants and needs, and how to budget. I know its not really the subject of conversation but how would you go about finding a part time job? I believe that funding for yourself is the first step to being independent, and while I know I can rely on my parents for bigger important things like rent, tuition, I dont want to cost them too much. I've never had a part time job before but I' want one with fair pay, and is enjoyable, at least for me (I know many people who hate their part time jobs) Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:38: Concerning part time jobs, how do you balance working time with shool work? Or how do you know how much of your paycheck to save vs. keep for spending? And how do you reccomen keeping all you funds organized? Mentor 2023-12-01, 18:11: Hi Fiona, No problem at all! I hope school has started to settle down for you. Have you had the musical already?? Great questions. I completely agree with you, finding a job that you enjoy is very important. Earlier you mentioned you were interested in going to a university in a city. This will be helpful in finding a job, because there are a lot more options in a bigger city. My recommendation is to come up job ideas that you would be interested in doing. Coffee shop? Music store? Restaurant? And then, target those fields to try and find a part-time job. Instead of applying for a job because you think it's the only one available, try to wait until you find the one you really want! There are websites like ""Indeed"", that have job postings. Often times there are jobs there that you never even thought of, but may sound like fun! That brings me to my next point of work-school balance. Transitioning to university can be challenging. Many people try and spend the first term adjusting to the new school, rather than getting a job right away. It is nice to have free time after class to be able to meet new people, hang out with friends, and build the university life you want. Studying will look a lot different too, so first term is a good time to figure out what works for you. Then, once you have found your rhythm and you feel that you have the time to get a part-time job, I would start looking then! Also, some people take 4 not 5 classes to help manage their school-load and work. That is great you have experience with budgeting money already. There is no magic answer on how much to save vs. spend, unless you have bills that must be paid. Some people work jobs so they can spend all the money, and others save it all. Depends on your preferences. I like saving more than spending, because then when there is something I really want to buy, I will have the funds ready. Keeping your funds in a bank account is the best way to stay organized. Most banks also have spending tracker software on their website, so you can know how much you're spending. That seems to help! What kind of part-time jobs would you be looking at? Micheline Mentee 2023-12-15, 16:13: Id like to do strategic studying. I've been getting better at handling my course load but its still something I struggle with.",,,"Mentee 2024-01-15, 09:26: Discussion Question In life I value honesty, loyalty, creativity, truth, self-care, independance, awareness and relationships. In my future career I want to contribute to society research in science sectors. Realistically I dont have any idea what career I want int he future. I know that I want to do somethig related to sciences and math as they are my favorite subjects. Being a researcher would let me follow those paths. On a completely different and unrealistic route I love reading and I always think of plots and writing books. Do you have any careers that you think would align with my interests/values. And how did your values influence your future career choices? Mentor 2024-01-23, 11:01: Great questions! For me, I knew I wanted to go into medicine since I was very young. My values influence who I am today and the type of doctor I want to be, but I don't think they made me pick medicine. I think you are on to a great idea with society-related research! I also love math and science. I think being a researcher is a terrific career. If you like teaching, you could consider going down that road too. When I was in University, I discovered so many different research fields related to society. More than I ever thought possible. I think you will find your passion!

Talk soon :) Micheline Mentee 2023-12-22, 09:49: Discussion Questions: Take Notes I have not used any of the study skills in the video in the past For me I think the spaced out studying would be most effective for me. I am a crammer so even if I keep some of my crammer tendecies I wont have as much content to cram the night before tests. I think I would I would struggle with words and visuals. I wouldnt want to draw things each time to memorize. Id much rather read over my notes or make flashcards. I probably wont get to trying all of these strategys. My activities would get in the way of tryign new techniques. Discussion Questions How do you study for exams? And what strategys have helped you in the past. Mentor 2023-12-24, 09:26: Hi Fiona, Spaced out studying is a useful technique! For me, I start studying early. I re-write my notes all the way through, then when I am done, I review them again. I find repetition is very helpful. I do not try and rush through it - so I start studying 4-5 weeks before my test! Do you remember concepts best when you hear it, read it or write it? Merry Christmas! Micheline Mentee 2023-12-29, 01:26: I hope you also had a Merry Christmas! During the last 2 weeks of school I tried going to the library after school with a friend to study/do homework and I found that just being in the environment helped me actually concentrate on my work and I got a lot done. It helps me to remember concepts when I read or listen to them. I also find that reading out loud, or re-explaining things to myself helps. Mentor 2023-12-31, 16:49: Hi Fiona, That is great! Those tactics will help you a lot in your continued studies. That completes this unit. Which would you like to work on next? Happy New Year!

I’ve always had small classes so if I need help, I know how to ask for it. I probably won't use my further education to specifically help my community. Are you from a rural community or city? Mentor 2023-10-24, 12:55: Hey Fiona, Thank you for your answers. That is a great strength to have - it is very good to know how to maintain boundaries and especially know when you need boundaries. I am not from a rural town. The population of where I grew up is 50,000 people. It has very similar extracurriculars to your town, but news does not travel that fast! The thing I wish we had is a more tight-knit community, with friendly neighbors. I didn't know my neighbors growing up. Feel free to move on to Lesson 2 whenever you are ready. Thanks! Micheline Mentee 2023-10-27, 09:36: Lesson 2: I already know that depending on your lifestyle public transport can be better, I'd like to live in Greater Vancouver either when Im older or while going to college. Some advantages I'd consider of living in a city are more ammenities. I for example love to crochet, the town I live in doenst have any yarn stores, I either buy everything online or when Im away. Living in the same city as a yarn store would be nice because I'd be able to touch the materials I'm going to work with. As someone whos lived in an urban community their whole life wuld you ever consider living in a rural community when youve grown up? a Mentor 2023-10-29, 20:21: Hey Fiona, Good point about public transit! I feel like I can get anywhere in Vancouver easily because of all the skytrains and buses that are available. I would love to live in a rural community when I am older. I find that the sense of community you experience in a rural community is very special. I also find people to be quite friendly in rural towns, and people are always willing to lend a hand. I would miss the variety of options for restaurants, but the pros would definitely outweigh the cons. Which unit would you like to do next? I will unlock it.

I've opened up Career Exploration!",,,"Mentor 2023-10-22, 22:46: Hey Ethan, please give the few videos in lesson 1 a watch, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as you go through them. What do you value in life? Any thoughts on community and society at large? Mentee 2023-10-23, 10:01: Hello, Mehak, things I value in life is honesty, truth, and community. In society I am scared of the furture I fear the ""wokness"" or whatever right wing peoples call it. I have what many would consider backwards views, so I fear what we as a country are becoming, and fear of voicing my opinions. So right now I am scared of society. Mentor 2023-10-29, 22:07: Hey Ethan, I completely understand your perspective and I am glad that you took the initiative to share your thoughts! Appreciating all that you have and holding the community in high regard is truly a great view to have. And as you were mentioning holding traditional views, I do not think there is anything wrong with that! Rather it is great that you are aware of the views that you hold, and thus you should stick to your views, and not be ashamed or fearful of voicing out your thoughts! I am sure you have had your own experiences that have brought you to such a level that you have come to fear society but is there anything you would like reinforcement on? Is there anything I can do to help, be it understanding more aspects of society or sharing some of my experiences in todays society? Mentee 2023-10-30, 08:40: I was wondering, first what kind of social differences there were between your town, and the city. Like how you apporach people and situtions. As an example, I used to call people faggots in gym class in elemetary, i did not know it was bad word even what it meant. Then when I moved to my new town, I discovered what that word meant, and no longer use it in vocabarlary at all. I am not asking if something simliar has happend to you. Just if there was a culure shock when moving to a big city. Mentor 2023-11-06, 22:21: Hey Ethan, hope you've been well! I just had my university midterms this past week and didn't get the chance to respond ?? As for social and cultural differences between different areas, they definitely exist but I don't think they are as exaggerated as some people make it out to seem. Some examples are exactly what happened in your case in which certain towns employ different words in this vocabulary that may not seem appropriate in other areas. For example, when my friend moved to my city, he brought with him a lot of different words that I had never heard of, which only went to show how cultural and language differences are a major part in movement. Nevertheless, he did not find it too difficult to adapt to the city and I think making new friends really helps in that endeavour! So there is definitely a culture shock when moving, but I am sure that it is not as difficult to adapt as some may make it out to seem! Let me know if you have any other questions and if not, I'd love to move on to a new conversation, if you had one in mind Mentor 2023-11-22, 08:36: Hey Ethan, you still there?

Mentor 2023-09-22, 14:07: Hey Ethan, It's really nice to meet you! I'll be your mentor through this program; I hope we both can learn something from this and ultimately have some good chats. I see that you have also had some experience in mentoring another, namely Daniel, who seems fortunate to have you supporting him throughout his high school journey. I also very much like his drawing and believe he has the potential to accomplish great things, like all others. On that point, what was your experience like with Daniel? Did you enjoy helping him and such? Also, you have a very cute dog! What is his/her name? And how long have you had them for? Mentor 2023-09-22, 14:08: This is an image of a cat at my senior home! I love animals in general haha Mentee 2023-09-26, 11:13: Yes I enjoy helping him. My experience with him has been extremely positive and he has taught me alot about how to interact with people who are younger or just less mature. He is extremly kind and creative and I love helping him. And my dogs name is Rook and he is 3 years old I hope that you can teach me and advise me on many things. And hopfuly I can give you some knowlege in return. Mentor 2023-09-29, 10:55: Oh that's great to hear! He seems like a great person, I'm sure you two are good friends at this point. Rook is such a unique name, did you come up with it? Also, I think we can start on our formal conversations; I'll open up the Rural to Urban conversation for us.

And Again thank you so much.","Mentor 2023-09-29, 10:57: Hey, could you give this a read through and let me know your thoughts. I'd love to know more about your community and share some things about the area I'm from! Mentee 2023-10-03, 09:17: Hello, I do not know alot about my community exept that my town is on unceded land of the tsimshian territory which is pretty interesting because before moving here I did not know that any land in Canada other than reservations were still Native land. And we have one of the deepest sea ports in the world. I do not go outside much so I am not that in tune with the community that much. But I do plan on leaving Prince Rupert to live in ethier Alberta or Israel. I plan on making aliyah to Israell one day once I convert to Judaism. I want my childern to grow up in a reilgous community. Unlike the town I live in because I do not like the type of community like the ones I have experianced like Rupert. Mentor 2023-10-09, 10:03: Hey Ethan, sorry for getting back to you so late, I was actually gone camping for the last couple days and just got back. It is quite interesting that you know the history and background about the land you live one! But I completely understand; I for one did not know much about my community until I stepped out and actually took the initiative to learn more about it. You plan on leaving Prince Rupert eventually, so do you have any knowledge about what life would be like in Alberta or Israel? I live in an urban community and have been for the past 15 years and can help guide you through the aspects to expect from urban Alberta. There are of course some aspects that are the same, and some that are different between rural and urban areas. But do you have any questions regarding urban areas and what it is like to live in one? But I am actually very glad that you have such goals and intentions in mind already! It seems like you are aware of what you want from the future and I am here to fully support you! Mentee 2023-10-10, 08:52: Hi Mehak, in Alberta I just plan on going to university, and start my career and finally after a few years move to Israel. Then serve in the Israeli Defense Forces (so I have to move there before I am 35) then continue teaching in Israel. And that is about it Mentee 2023-10-10, 08:53: I the city I plan on moving to in Alberta is relativly small at only 100 thousand people, and I plan on living in a smaller community in Israel. Mentor 2023-10-16, 11:04: Hey Ethan, it is great to hear that you intend to pursue post secondary education. I am sure you will find Alberta to be filled with opportunities! Also, it is really nice to know that you have a solid plan for your future, I think you are in great shape for the coming years!

Please feel free to ask me anything that is on your mind rather it be related to this module or if you need advice for anything else. I love your peom btw. :) Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:46: Hi, Im Ellie its nice to meet you. I see that we have some of the same intrests relating to art and phsycology. Are you planning on being a theropist when you are done school? I was interested in that field but im not sure i want to commit to all of that schooling lol. How old are you if you dont mind me asking, im 17 btw. Mentor 2023-09-29, 16:29: Hi Ellie! Nice to hear from you. Yes I do love art and psychology and plan to be a psychologist in the future(which is similar to a therapist). I do agree with you that it is alot of schooling, hoever if you like what your studying and view your time in school as a way of getting to the career you want to have in the future I think its all worth it! I am 18 turning 19 soon. Let me knwo if you have anymore questions, Do you have a particiluar feild in psychology your interested in? for instance (child, adult, clinical etc) Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:21: Sorry its been a while I got logged out of my account and could not figure out for the life of me how to get back in. However yes I am interested in the child side of psycology as when i was a child i needed lots of help and I kindof want to do that for other children. Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:31: Also i was wondering if you could please open the rural to urban unit that is on the wheel? Mentee 2023-10-31, 09:30: Hi Kyla, Yes i am very interested in post secondary. However after highschool I will be taking a gap year so I can work full time as a lifegaurd and make some more money to help me in the future. During that time i am going to take some courses at the local collage to get a head start on things. After that year is done i am thinking of going to UVIC, VIU, UBC, or maybe even SFU. I am not to sure yet on what I want to study thats why I'm not going straight out of highschool. However i am very interested in helping people. Mentor 2023-10-31, 18:38: Hi Ellie, That sounds like an execellent path to take! If you are interested in helping people there are many fields you can take, the possibilities are truly endless! If you still find interest in therapy, a bachelors in psychology is one option but there are many others too. Do you have any ideas of what degree you might potentially want to do yet? if not that is completely fine too. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:53: Hi Kyla, Thank you for answering my questions. I really like how you said finding a small town like part in the big city can help. My uncle who lives in vancouver has done that and when i go visit him its like a little town within the big city. Mentor 2023-11-22, 17:52: Hi Ellie, that is great to hear, I have opened up another module. Let me know if you have any questions, I will be there to help.","Mentor 2023-10-30, 11:48: Hi Ellie, Nice to hear back from you I opened the wheel. Thats also great to hear that you are interested in child psychology. I am too do you know if you want to go to graduate school at all? Mentee 2023-11-14, 10:35: Anyways getting back on track to the rural to urban unit haha. I live in a small town of about 13,000 people. There is only one highschool here and theres about 660 students. In my graduate class there is 150 of us. Theres not a whole lot to do here for fun so us highschool students dont have many options. One thing that me and my friends do is go for long drives around the town and go to the occasional party. There are quit a few extracurriculars here such as, basketball, soccer, track, vollyball, hockey, piano, band, debat, and so many more. personally I dont participate in any extracurriculars having to do with the school although i do play piano. Many students here cant wait to leave this town but honestly i really like it. I like the small towm vibes and knowing everyone. Some strengths i have gained from living in a small rural town are cummunity skills. For example i have done lots of volunteering in the past for the community. I believe having these past experiences will help me in the future. I have always had a keen interest in helping people and volenteering has really helped in that sense. I think it will benifite me when i go off to university. I really want to give bacl to the peopel who helped me while growing up. Therefor going into the medical or mental health field will allow me to give back. I would love to help people especially kids. Mentee 2023-11-14, 10:45: I do know a little about living in the city since i have lots of famiy who live there. i know that transportation time is way longer and living expenses can be alot more. I definetly like visiting the city but im not sure if i would want to live there long term. I think some advanteges of living in the city are there is alot more oppertunities to do things such as jobs, shopping, getting different types of health care, etc. Some disadvantedges for sure are travel times. What are some advantages and disadvanteges of lining in the city? What are things one can do to ujust to city life when coming from a small towm? Are you originally from a rural town, if so what were some challenges you had moving to an urban city? Mentor 2023-11-14, 14:33: Hi Ellie, Here are my answers to your question: What are some advantages and disadvanteges of lining in the city? Some advantages are that there are alot of events and opportunites around the city to do, and you get to meet alot of people if you do live in a city. Some disadvantages are that it can be too busy at times, if you enjoy a smaller community, living in a city might make it hard to foster a sense of community. What are things one can do to ujust to city life when coming from a small towm? Are you originally from a rural town, if so what were some challenges you had moving to an urban city? I am not from a rural town but some tips I have for someone moving to the city is honestly to be open to going to different events and meeting people, if that seems too much you contact people on social media that might be in the city for university, work etc. and get to know more about them and eventually form a relationship. Another thing is, if you are missing a rural town feel I think finding a quite spot that feels cozy, such as a bookshop, coffee shop etc. and going to that might help, basically trying to find places in the city that feels a little bit like home.",,,,

Do you have a certain time you study? Where dfo you study? Do you prefer quiet or can you tolerate other conditions? Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:33: Hello Sahib, i hope you are well. I'm sorry for taking so long to respond to you. These past few weeks, or however long it's been, have felt like a blur. Every day goes by so fast and I don't feel like I'm present. To answer your questions: My current study habits are honestly terrible, but better than they used to be. In my current schedule, I study every sunday night for about two hours in order to prepare for my routine monday math test. Apart from that, I set no time aside to study during the week, apart from the night before the unusual chemistry test. I understand that this is not good, and If this habit continues, I will have no future in university, let alone medicine. I only study in my kitchen because I have no space in my bedroom. Even though I have two desks, one is taken up by my pc setup, and the other is occupied by my piano (I don't have a stand). I only study late into the night; I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because it's quieter and I feel isolated from my family. Or maybe it's purely out of procrastination. I procrastinate a lot out of fear of failure. I prefer a quiet study environment, and whether or not I can tolerate other conditions depends on the subject which I'm studying. I can study math in pretty much any environment. Side note: Over the last two months I've developed a strong passion for math, specifically my pre-cal 12 math class. The environment feels so warm and safe. The content isn't very difficult either. I feel as if math is the only thing I'm in control of in my life. Anyways, I'll start on the ""strategic studying unit"", and hopefully have it done within the next few days. Once again I apologize for responding to you so late.

How many years have you been lifting? How much can you bench press? sorry for the bombardment of questions- i'm just curious Mentor 2023-10-13, 11:51: Hi Daniel, Firstly I would like to apologize to you for not respodning sooner. I was lovcked out of my mentoring account and had a variety of technical issues and on top of that its midterm season. But I am on track now and here to help guide you toward your univrsity or post-secondary goals. I really like your questions and its engaging. It seems to me you might be interested in a career in medicine. After readinfg about your bio in your profile you definitely have the right mentor and I will not disappoint you (at least not further than I have). If you want success I will show you the way without sugarcoating it to you. My plan is calculated, smart, and rigourous. In terms of the MCAT I did decently at 517, but that isn't the best either. I took it in the summer while taking other classes (PDE class) and commuting about 3-4 hours. day so it wasn't the best for my studying. In temr sof the MCAT you should wait a bit, take the summer after your second or third year, so that is a long time from now. A lot of the content is first or second year things, but you want to give yourself some time to understaznd and hone these concepts. In terms of studying everyday, for the MCAT I gave myself the four month of summer where I was working online part time for a professor and taking a difficult math course. I'd study anywhere between 4-12 hours depdneing on the day foir the MCAT. The MCAT for you is quite some time away, I would worry about much more important things right now if you want to get into medical program and those are GPA and extraciricular activites. Don't worry about the latter yet. I see you wan tto go to UBC, that means your percent average is important. UBC is different from other universities in BC because instead of letter grades they put your exact percentage grade on the transcript. This is a dangeorus doubl;e edged sword. Most universities in BC use letter grades which correspond to certain percentages and they don't put the exact percentage on your record only the letter. For example, the standard letter grades are A+ for 90-100% then an A is 85-89 %, and so on at most universities such as KPU or SFU. That means that a student who gets a 90% and a student who gets a 98% are no different when we look at the transcipt because it opnly shows an A+. At UBC this isn't true, the student who has a 98% will have that grade on their report. The part that makes this a dopuble edged sword is that UBC medical school gets applicants from all places. If an applicant from SFU who has letter grades on their trnascirpt applies, UBC medical school has to convert the letter grades to percentages using a fixed table. They say that if you have an A+ it is a 95%, even if the SFU student had a 92% in reality, similarly if a student at SFU got 98% in a course UBC medical would not know that and would convert the letter grade to a 95%. This is more unfavourable to UBC students because our exact percentage is show and there is no need to convert letter grades to percentages, they will just average the percentages on your trnascipt. My average over my physics career is in the 90%+ last time I checked but I have to go back and claculate because I haven't calculated it since last year. If you really want to get into medical school you need to realize that every class you take, every assingment no matter how small it is matters. It can be the differecne between a 92% or a 93%. Do not take anything lightly, you must strive for perfection. This is key. I am not going to sugarcoat anything Daniel. This is a tough journey you are setting out on, one that will push your limits, make you sacrifice times with friends and family, and your health. I am not scaring you, and this may sound bad but know at the end of this tunnel the light is bright and if you work hard while young you will live a better life afterward. Always be focussed, be prepared, ypour midn should always be working and aiming for perfection. The more sugar you put in the cake the swweter it will be, so the more work you put in now the better it will be later. Do your best in every single class in every year level because they all matter. In first year do your best to get the highest grades possible because first. year classes wull be easier than higher year classes and if you do have one bad class in higher years it will not effect your average a lot if you did well in classes before it. Weight lifting, I lifted on and off in high school for a while. When university started I stopped lifting or hitting the gym since school was so intense. I gave school all my time and only went ot the gym in the summers. I have a new schedule now where I fit in the gym with school. In terms of bench press, I can do a bit over a plate. Mentee 2023-10-17, 10:00: Yo Sahib, My teacher has informed me that not of my e-mentoring assignments have been reported as complete. This is strange because I have completed up to the rural/urban assignment. Have I been improperly submitting them? Or do you need to report them to my teacher as complete, and just haven't gotten the chance. Either way, all is well. I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand how suffocatingly busy it can get in uni, especially since you're trying for medical school. My brother is in the second year of UBC med, with a score of 521. He majored in biology. My sister has finished her undergrad with a major in biomedical studies. She is taking the year to study for her mcat, and improve her score of 506. She hopes to get accepted to ubc medical school (any medical school is cool as well, she just hopes for ubc). Sorry, back to the point- if you can help me with my assignment issue it would be greatly appreciated *prayer hands. your mentee, Daniel :) Mentee 2023-10-17, 10:08: Sorry, forgot to mention also that my dad is a doctor. I am telling you all of this to provide insight into my future career choice. From my youth I was always told by my parents that i would become a doctor. I felt/ still do feel imense academic pressure, and sometimes i deal with it in negative ways. I will become a doctor, but me dream job would be being a conductor for large orchestra. I am now content with being a doctor. Even though the school is extremely competetive and stressful, I will be put into imense amounts of debt, and the work it self with put unimaginable strain on my mental health, and the relationship with the people around me, I am content. The income, stability, and social status is worth it. Mentor 2023-10-23, 11:47: Hi Daniel, I am currentyl working on the e-mentoring assingment portion to see how to complete it. Sorry again for not responding, its mid-term season and I have my last one today, so the time crunch really has me down. I will be much better at respodning after today and fixing this issue for you. I can agree that the mental health strain from trying to into medical school is very intense. But you are right, the stabilioty sand other perks are woekth it. Tell me more about being a conductor bcause I am interested in modern classical music Mentee 2023-10-24, 09:58: yo yo yo, how is it going my boy sahib? I understand how time consuming and stressful (my friend angus is wondering if you have played nintendogs on the 3ds?) uni can be, especially if you're preparing to go to med-school; so please take your time. Don't worry about this stupid mentor-mentee thing. Make your studies your priority. As far as working on e-mentoring goes, i'm feeling pretty suffocated with everything else in my life, so i will most likely not be doing anything for this week. And responding to your interest in conducting, I honestly have no knowledge on the topic. I could go on and on about classical music, but my penchant is soley because i think it's cool. Imagine controlling an entire orchestra- waving your hands, signalling each section and hearing them roar. When i picture it in my head it feels really cool. Idk. Anyways, how have you been my boy sahib? are you okay? i hope you do well in whatever you chose to pursue. your mentee, Daniel. Mentee 2023-10-27, 09:47: BRO OMG SAHIB I LITERALLY SPENT LIKE A WHOLE HOUR TYPING LENGTHY RESPONSE AND THEN REFRESHED THE PAGE WITHOUT THINKING, FML i don't know what to do i just vented to you so hard and now it's gone anyways, to summarize what i said for your question: i will stay at my uncles house 40 minutes away from campus. I will commute to campus by bus. My brother and uncle both have cars, so they can give me the occasional ride. I haven't put much thought into my life outside of my studies. And I don't know what i'll do for food. Bro i was so excited for you to read it. I put so much thought into my wording, so you would best understand :( Anyways, how did your midterm go? I wish you the best your mentee, Daniel Mentee 2023-10-27, 09:52: sahib i really enjoy talking with you. you are very similar to my big brother. he is who i look up to most. my brother and I never got along when he was living at home, because of our age gap. if i go to ubc, i want to futher develop my relationship with him. when i talk to you i pretend that i'm talking to him and it makes me happy. Mentor 2023-11-01, 11:13: Hi Daniel, thanks for the comment Mentor 2023-11-01, 11:14: I am glad that you want to reconnect with your brother and see it as a potential way to build a stronger relationship with a family member. As a part of your class, what module do you want to do next? Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:21: yo sahib how's it going big bro? i hope you are well. just so you know, i gave you a pretty grand review for the survey they gave. to answer your question of what module i would like to do next; what modules have i completed, and what modules am i able to start right now. I know i did at least three so far. Please pick from the modules available so you have lots of time to work on it. I'm sure that whatever you pick will be great. your boy, daniel Mentee 2023-11-08, 12:23: Hi Daniel, We noticed the assignment you dropped on SharePoint on Oct 4th isn’t opening. Can you send it over again? If the link doesn't work, just copy and paste the text in a new message on the platform. Thanks a bunch! Management Mentee 2023-11-08, 12:23: Hi Daniel, We noticed the assignment you dropped on SharePoint on Oct 4th isn’t opening. Can you send it over again? If the link doesn't work, just copy and paste the text in a new message on the platform. Thanks a bunch! Management Mentee 2023-11-28, 17:08: Hello sahib, I just have some questions if that is okay. I'm just worried about my future (as one does) and I will be more at ease if I can know as much as I can, and prepare. It's okay if you don't want to/can't answer What was your university percent average/gpa? How well did your physics program prepare you for the chemisty and physixs section of the MCAT? Out if the four sections of the MCAT, rank their from you perspective. (from practice tests) How much do you know about the medical school interview? What will you do if you don't get into medical school in your first application? If you determine that medical school is not for you, what will you do? How many hours a week do you study? How are you preparing for the MCAT? (how many months did you set aside? how many questions did you do? how many practice tests). What was/is your finincial situation like as a student? How did/does that affect you? (grades, mental health, etc). Please take however long you need to respond. I wish you the best, - Daniel Mentee 2023-11-28, 17:09:  Mentee 2023-11-28, 17:09: please excuse any typos/forgotten words I apologize Mentor 2023-12-04, 10:05: I am great How are you Mentor 2023-12-04, 10:08: I really like your answers regarding the challenges and advantages of city life. I think it is important that you realized that bigger cities will propvide you with more resources and opportunities; however, sometimes the bustle of a city cam ebecome a drag and really weigh on the mind. Its good you have family to stay with and habving a strong connection is a good way to stay sane alongside some good friends. Furthermore, I feel you with the pressure. My parents used to take me down to main and hastings in vancouver and show me the tent city and say that either you can go to school or you can live on the streets. In the end they just want whats best for you. Mentee 2023-12-13, 09:42: Hello sahib, I sent you some questions reguarding the mcat a bit ago. Please check your email if you've not seen them. If they're not there, I'll be happy to send them again. I wish you the best and I hope you're well. P.S. My sister got 2 interview invitations for ubc med!!!! Rural and general!!! Mentor 2023-12-18, 13:23: Congrats to your sister Daniel! I hope she succeeds in her inteview! Mentor 2023-12-18, 13:24: Furthermore, I am a little confused Daniel, I do not recall putting my email here because it is against policy so I am not sure what you emailed and to whom. Could you put those questions in the chat? Mentee 2024-01-08, 09:16: Hello Sahib. How are you doing? I understand that you are very busy but I hope you can answer some questions of mine. You mentioned how you majored in physics. How did you independantly study the MCAT material which was left out such as biochemistry? I assume you've taken practice tests. Based on your scores on these tests, would you say indenpendad study is a viable way to prepare? Or would majoring in health science program be more beneficial, despite it being harder to achieve high grades? How much do you know about medical school interviews? I've been pretty much left in the dark by my older sibling regarding them. One final question: regarding e-mentoring, what do we have left to do? -like section wise. I'm pretty confused. Thank you so much for mentoring me; I wish you the best. - Daniel Mentor 2024-01-11, 23:14: Hi Daniel, I am doing amazing. Before I answer your questions how was your break? Mentee 2024-01-12, 09:57: Hello Sahib, My break was honestly pretty mid. It went by like flash; but honestly I'm happier now than I was on winter break. I rejected everything and began to self destruct. I ghosted my manager, friends, and family. I rotted in bed when I was awake. I had no desire to talk to anyone, or to even smile. My appetite was noticably increased. I'd get frustrated by my desire for food. Usually, I don't eat until 6pm due to school and extra curriculars (I play piano at lunch rather than eating). I don't actively try to restrict my diet, it kind of just happens. I've been doing this for many years now so I don't even feel and hunger until around 6pm anyways. I was a little gremlin who slept during the day, and doomscrolled at night. Everything is normal now. Normal may not be good, but it's better. Please let me know how your break was; I hope it was better than mine. If you find yourself without time, or too tired to respond to me don't worry about it. You gotta put yourself first big bro. I know how exhausting it can be for those who want to apply to med school. It feels like my two older siblings are perma depressed. Honestly, I feel like everyone in my family is perma depressed. My father has been on SSRI's for many years now, ever since I was young. My two older siblings I previously mentioned have both been on anti depressants previously. My brother specifically, had to get his stomach pumped when he had a bit too much to drink, on purpose. My mother started anti depressants in july of last year. It's been very saddening to me because she feels like a completely different person. She's usually a very frugal person despite having more than most, but she's been going on shopping sprees for things she does'nt need every day for the past few months. She's shown little attention to me or my younger brother. She was also usually instigating fights all of the time to release her stress, but now she's calmer than me. Basically my parents were beefing and they were initiating a divorce. My mom took it really badly; my dad not so much. They ended up doing the worst possible thing which was ""working it out"". Things in fact were not worked out. They live in the same house, but the dynamic is just as terrible. It's only a matter of time before history repeats. I think that I may have taken it worse than I initially thought. I'm a straight A student, but my grades this semester have been very bad. I'm getting like an 88 in pre cal and 60 in chem. It may be partly due to my mother not ""encouraging"" me like she used to. Personally, I have been feeling a deep sense of nhilism, and pain. I think I may be depressed. It feels like there's a black hole in my stomach (not in the sense that i feel hungry, but in the sense that i feel empty). I do things that I shouldn't do. I go through many band aids. I've also recently started drinking. I've had no desire to drink in the past. I actively avoided parties, and looked down on other who drank. Now I understand the appeal. Sometime's it's nice to leave your problems for a little while. I think about things I shouldn't think about many times a day. I intricatly plan, and scheme. Sometimes I'm scared of what I might do, and other times I'm content in my decsion as It feels like my only option. I apologize for ranting to you about this. My parents recommeded therapy but I immediatley shot the idea down. I just don't think I could ever open up to somone like that. It's much easier to do so annonymously. Please don't respond to the previous paragraph. Only talk with me about school. I wish you the best, -Daniel Mentor 2024-01-13, 10:49: Hi Daniel, I get it dude, sometimes you just wanna vent, that's total cool. On the school side of things, you really got to pick it up and like always I am not going to sugar coat it, but you need to do better. I see where you are coming from with the encouragement side of things and the lack thereof, however, you need to build a self motivated drive and encouragement. Let me tell you a little story about myself, I was always the ""smart"" kid in elementary and high school. I was the kid who was the genius and that was my reputation among everyone. My peers respected me and it was a form of encouragement. But when I got to university, that was all gone. That major form of encouragement in my life vanished because I entered an environment where no one has a reputation. The form of education is cold, you do not have a close cohort and people don't encourage you the same way. In times like these, you need an internalized encouragement. You need to buiuld self motivation and not source it from outside. This is a very important thing and a very difficult thing to do, but you need to do it just like I did. This is the age (16-18 years old) where you need to decide if you are willing to put yourself through difficult processes and become self sufficient or rely on geting these things from outside such as encouragement and something to numb the pain. Make your choice Daniel and remember that to get to success one must traverse the road of diffuluty and grief. It will not be easy. Now, to answer your other questions regarding the MCAT. You are right that my major doesn't cover the majority of importatn MCAT stuff and I had to do a lot of independent studying. My go to source was MCAT prep books such as Kaplan and Princeton review. I used the latter and a friend used the former. The Princeton books go into more depth, but they have a little too much useless information. The MCAT has a lot of content so you don't want to be remembering useless stuff. Kaplan books are shorter but may miss some small concepts, so you need to fill in the gap with other resources like khan academy and AAMC material. Now each of these review book sets come with online practice tests, but these tests are usually harder than the actual MCAT, so don't feel bad if you do bad on them. The AAMC material is more reflective of the actual MCAT. Furthermore, a lot of the content isn't diffcult to learn, there is just a lot of it. It is suprising that the biochemistry content had the smallest review book and the content was super easy if you've taken first year biology. You don't even need a biochemistry course and I didn't have one. A lot of the chemistry stuff is covered in first year biology and chemistry so it would be good to take these in the first year and cover a majority of the content. For the CARS (Critical Analysis and Reading Section) this is one of the more diffuclt sections to do well in and study for. I mainly did AAMC and Jack Westin passages, but found that the Jack Westin passages aren't that good. This part of the test is actually the most diffculty becasue you really need to build your reading skills and be able to quickly analyse a passage and answer questions. So read your books! For pyschology and sociology part, don't bother wasting your time in a university course on these subjects. It won't help and don't bother reading prepreatory books either. Just go onlone and find the 88 page condensed review for pyschology and sociology and read that you will be fine. There is a reason this section is last since it is the easiest. Overall, you don't need to be a health science major to do well. A lot fot he content is first year stuff so go and do what you find fun and just make sure to take the first year biology, chemistry, and physics and you should have a good basis. Also mental math skills and needed because you get no calculator. In terms of interviews, this one is a little more difficult to answer. Each university has its own way of doing interviews, but I'll tell you what I know about UBC's interview system. For BC they do Virtual Multiple Mini interviews where you will go through 10 mini interivewswith acadmeics and 3rd and 4th year medical students. These interviews are designed to probe you about why you chose medicine or other things about yourself and why you want to study at UBC. I am not sure about more than this because I haven't sat an interview. Mentee 2024-01-17, 09:12: Hello Sahib. Thank you for giving me such in depth and honest advice. I'm working hard to pull up my grades for myself. I'm also trying to find my own drive. Initially, I didn't care that everything in my life was falling apart. I figured that if I couldn't become a doctor I could just end myself. I now know that this way of thinking is very harmful. No one is coming to save me, and no one is responsible for my future except for myself. You, along as my older sister helped my open my eyes. I've really been apreciating your advice over the past few months. While my highschool grades don't matter for my goal of getting into medical school (so long as I get into my seleced program), it is important that I build the required discipline, study habits, and work ethic before university. I will complete my remaining e-mentoring modules before the end of this week. Thank you, Daniel. Mentor 2024-01-22, 10:04: Hi Daniel, You are exactly right that high school grades matter in builkding discipline. I believe you can achieve your dreams through hard work and determination. Do you have more questions for me? Mentee 2024-01-24, 09:15: Hello Sahib. I'm aware that the last day of class in on friday. I'm honestly unsure of which units I have done/not done. Could you please tell me the names of the units/sections which I have to do. I can just grind them all in one night either thursday or friday. I'm aware that our time together is coming to an end, so if there are any questions you have for me feel free to ask; I have a few for you. What is a comfortable MCAT score for you? (I think the average medical school accepted score is like 512, but would you be satisfied with 512 or would you re-take and shoot for more?). How many times do you plan on appying to medical school before considering a different career? If my sister doesn't get in on her second year of applying she's going into nursing (She' already taken her casper).She'll still be studying the for the MCAT and trying to improve her score (Her previous score was 507). What is your back up plan? I honestly have no idea of mine. I'm deeply aware of all of my options (via my sister), but I have no desire to be anything other than a doctor. I will think more about this moving forward. Why do you mentor? Is it for the resume/application? How are you supported money wise? I'm sorry for dumping all these questions on you two days before the end of class. If you're pressed for time please just answer my inital question as it would be a big help. I want to get full marks for e-mentoring. Thanks for mentoring me big bro, -Daniel","Mentee 2023-10-12, 14:01: Hi Daniel, We are trying to get ahold of your mentor, but don't want you to get behind. So in the meantime we've opened up the From Rural to Urban unit for you to get started on. Click on ""From rural to urban"" on the navigation wheel above. View the warm-up (and share your thoughts if you want), and then click on ""Background Info"" for Lesson 1. Then send your mentor a message telling them all about where you live - hopefully by that time we'll have tracked him down and he will respond! Thanks for your patience, and let us know if you have any questions The eMentoring staff Mentor 2023-10-25, 22:32: Hi Daniel, I am well. I am finished my midterms thus it is smooth sailing from here on until the semester is done. So tell me some ways you plan on making the rural to urban transition. What vision do you have for that in your head? Mentee 2023-11-29, 09:54: Yo yo yo sahib how's it going. I think that i still have section 2 or rural/urban to do please let me know if submitting my answers through messages this way is sufficient for completeing my assigned sections Q. What are some advantages and challenges of city life? I think the main advantage of city life would be more opportunity. There are just more things to do. When talking about university, living in a big city means you can do pretty much anything you want; not just for activities outside of school, but a bigger city often means a bigger university, so more options and resources. It said that i only have to answer at least one, so i bettter not lose marks for not answering the others...RAHHHHHHHH!!! Q. Ask your mentor anything you still want to know about life. Why do you want to become a doctor? The reason I chose this path is because of strong pressure from my parents, as well as indirect pressure from my siblings. Every since kindergarden, my mother would tell me that I would either become a doctor, or I would work at McDonalds for the rest of my life. I was pressured from a young age to get excellent grades in order to go to university. I'm aware that when I turn eighteen I can chose whatever career I want, but because of my parents, I feel as if I don't have a choice/ my choice doesn't matter. Anyways, I just curious to learn your reason. I wish you the best, -Daniel",,,,

It’s been amazing to get to know you and I’ve really enjoyed my time – I hope you have too! I hope you've had a great semester, and will continue enjoying the rest of your school year! If you want, we can also continue the program beyond the end of your class to talk about whatever you want. Feel free to let me know!",,,"Mentor 2023-10-16, 11:20: Hi Christopher, I hope you had a great weekend! I received advice from your teacher to unlock the ""Adulting"" unit for you as well, so you can work on both From Rural to Urban and Adulting at the same time. This unit is an exciting one since I know you want to leave your town in the future- it's about living independently! Personally, I was really overwhelmed when I first thought about everything I'd have to plan when I started living outside. Feel free to browse through the unit and consider the ""Think, Share, Ask"" discussion prompts. I'm excited to hear what you have for the Share prompt, and to answer any questions you have. Also just a friendly reminder, since we have two units together now, remember to click into the right unit (it will be underlined) when sending your answers for each of them! I hope you have a wonderful week, Madeline Mentor 2023-10-31, 21:12: Hi Christopher, I hope you had a great Halloween! I wanted check in with you since we're wrapping up October. We completed a whole unit (yay!), and all your answers were very insightful. They covered a lot of areas I didn't even think of before our discussions. Do you feel like you're progressing at a pace you want through our lessons/units? Are there any goals you have that I should be aware of? I would also love some feedback about how you think our mentor-mentee relationship is going, and if there are any things you think I could improve on to support you better! I hope to hear from you soon, and also to discuss the Adulting unit with you. Mentor 2023-12-20, 10:53: Hey Christopher! I hope you're having a great December. If you get the chance to check in, I'd love to hear your thoughts about our unit. What are some responsibilities you think you will need to take on as an adult? Take your time and let me know if you have any questions or comments. Enjoy your winter break!",,,,,,"Mentee 2023-09-19, 10:53: Hello! I did the 'photo-swap' assignment in the attached Word doc. If there are any problems with it let me know. In regard to the next unit, I think I would like to do 'from rural to urban living.' If I am jumping the gun with choosing the next unit feel free to ignore this line lol Mentor 2023-09-20, 09:17: Hi Christopher, nice to meet you! Your 3 photos were all really thoughtful. I found the story behind the guitar amplifier particularly interesting. I can't imagine how I'd deal with an amp malfunction on stage, that situation requires a lot of quick thinking on the spot! I feel like it would really develop you as a musician- other small mistakes on stage would be easier to adapt to afterwards. To get to know each other a little more, we've still got to complete the discussion questions in the Start Here unit if you'd like :) I think the Discussion Questions section says that after you ask me a question, we can get started with From Rural to Urban Living! Mentee 2023-09-29, 09:40: Hi Madeline, I enjoyed your photos. I might need to invest in one of those wrist rests myself, I didn't know those existed! As for a discussion question, I noticed in your profile thingy that you listen to K-pop. I have only dabbled slightly in K-pop, but my friend who sits next to me is a big fan, and she would love to know: which artist(s) do you listen to? I believe the artist/group (?) my friend listens to primarily is called 'Seventeen.' Mentor 2023-10-02, 22:39: Hey Christopher! I would say that the wrist rests are helping a lot so far so I totally recommend them. Seventeen is actually one of my favorite groups as well, my favorite member is Jeonghan! I also really like NCT and I also listen to Enhypen and Stray Kids. Since we're on the topic of music, I'd love to know which songs (doesn't have to be kpop) are your favorite! I'm always looking for new music to listen to. If you're ready, I've opened up 'From Rural to Urban' now- you can navigate to the unit by clicking on its title in the circle above! Lemme know if you have any questions. Mentee 2023-10-04, 09:59: Hi Madeline, I like all sorts of music! I wouldn't say I have super-specific taste, so I'm always open to trying new types of music. Currently I'm listening to a lot of the 'Something Rotten' soundtrack. It's the musical my school is putting on this year, and I am involved in the production, so I'm trying to memorize it as fast as possible! Under regular circumstances, I listen to artists like the Beatles and Gorillaz. Some maybe lesser-known songs that I like that I can recommend are 'Sleepwalk' by nelward and 'Comedy' by Gen Hoshino. Now for some unit work: My town is ~13,000 strong and around 600 students go to my school (according to my teacher). I don't think high school students do much differently for fun than you'd do elsewhere, lots of students party and stuff like that. I'm personally not terribly social, so I wouldn't really know. The most common extracurriculars are sports, like dancing, hockey, basketball, soccer, etc. The main thing that sets our town apart is an impressive port and coal terminal, which are sort of the 'lifeblood' of our town, so to speak. I'm struggling to think of a benefit or strength I've gained living here in particular. The best I can come up with is that it's harder to avoid people in a smaller town, so perhaps here we're better with regularly dealing with people we dislike than people would be elsewhere, which could be useful in a situation where you have a co-worker or boss you don't like for whatever reason. I'm not sure how my future career could really assist my community, either. I can't see how anything I do in careers related to computer science-y stuff could make a direct impact. Mentee 2023-10-10, 09:28: Hi Madeline, I hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend Thank you for your thoughts on the career stuff! What you said makes a lot of sense. To be honest, I've been so set on moving one day that I didn't really consider the career questions as carefully as I could have, but a part of why I'm interested in computer science is because of how it can apply really anywhere, in most (or all!) fields, so I should keep this sort of thing in mind. Moving onto the 'Ask' portion: what would you say is/are an/some advantage(s) or strength(s) you have gained from living in a city? Have you met anyone from a rural community who has been able to leverage their background in a significant/notable way to their advantage?","Mentor 2023-10-02, 22:52: Hi Christopher, here’s our first unit! We’ll be working through it one lesson at a time. Feel free to read through the warm-up and materials in Lesson 1, and then work through the ‘Think, Share, Ask’ parts of the discussion questions. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about Lesson 1! Mentor 2023-10-04, 23:15: Hi Christopher, I don’t know much about the details of producing and performing a musical but your role sounds super exciting. I hope it goes well for you! I listened to both songs and they’re really catchy, especially Comedy. They've both been added to my playlist. Thanks for sharing your answers with me. The strength you thought of is really meaningful! I’ve had a lot of situations during partner/group work in class or as an intern where I struggled to interact with people I disagree with and having those skills would definitely help! As for the career discussion: I’d say that from my experiences as a computer science student, there are a lot of roles that could impact your community that involve developing/testing the software and hardware involved in the port and coal terminal that you mentioned. Perhaps programs for running port operations? Depending on your interests, you could also focus on human-computer interactions for products in your community! Our next step is for you to pick a question to ask me from the ‘Ask’ page in the Discussion questions, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on anything else. To get you started- I’m from a city! Mentor 2023-10-12, 16:37: Hi Christopher, Thanks! My Thanksgiving weekend was good, I had a couple of midterms this week so I spent most of it studying. I hope yours was good as well! It's great to hear about your interest in computer science, and I totally agree that it's super applicable. I think that is a huge reason many people decide to do it, since you can almost choose any field to apply your knowledge. To answer your questions: I would say that one major advantage of living in a city is how I'm constantly exposed to a lot of diversity, with a lot of people from different places and cultures. It's given me a lot of insight about how important it is to understand things from other perspectives, and ways to interact with people who might not hold the same values as you. For your second question, I had a Biology teaching assistant who was from a rural part of BC. Throughout the semester, she always gave us very insightful real life examples that I wouldn't have thought about initially. I think she did some research in hydrangeas (the plants), and used observations from her hometown and other areas of BC to see how the pH/acidity of our water affects the flowers' color. I'm not much of a plant person, but it was really interesting! It seems like we've touched upon a lot of important points in Lesson 1 already, so feel free to start on Lesson 2 :) PS- it seems like your messages are still showing up under the Start Here activity. To send messages in this unit, make sure that the Rural to Urban unit is underlined in the circle at the very top of the page when you send a message. If it's not, click this unit and it should work! Mentee 2023-10-17, 09:54: Hi Madeline, Thank you for the answers to my questions, they were very illuminating. My responses for the ""Share"" bit of Lesson 2: ""What you think are some advantages and challenges of city life?"" What seems appealing to me about living in a city is just having a bunch of stuff (fairly) close together, like events and stores and that sort of thing. In my rural community, our closest neighboring community is about a 2 hour drive away, we have to take what we can get with that sort of thing. Having more elaborate public transport is appealing to me as well, though having well-funded public transport doesn't entirely apply broadly to every city. I recently got my driver's licence, and having to drive everywhere is pretty scary to me (not to mention the price of gas these days), so that sort of public transport would personally be very nice. In terms of challenges, the amount of other people is daunting. I've been to cities like Vancouver and New York, and the sheer density of people walking around the streets and in the buildings is absolutely crazy to me. Though, I imagine that's just a matter of getting adjusted to the new environment. I think I'd also feel less safe. In my rural community, while things aren't quite as safe as they were a few years ago, I still feel comfortable walking around on my own in the evening, but I don't think I'd be able to do that at all in a city. Now to ask you some questions: What would you say are some advantages/challenges of city life? What advice would you give for adjusting to a new city? Is there something about living in a city that someone who hasn't lived in a city might not expect? Mentor 2023-10-21, 00:52: Hi Christopher, happy Friday! Sorry for my late response, I caught the flu this week and got a little overwhelmed. I think your answers perfectly encompassed a lot ideas that I had when I read over the lesson. The advantages and challenges I have in mind build upon your answer. It’s convenient to have so many resources available near me, and public transport is pretty good! It does get extremely overwhelming near rush hour but I’d say you get used to it (or used to avoiding it haha). One challenge is definitely the pressure that comes with crowds and so many people around you constantly. It gets easy to start rushing through your day because of external stress and much harder to take time to think about what you're doing, if you get what I mean. One biggest point of advice I have for adjusting is to explore the city, with a friend or alone if you feel comfortable! I think a large part of feeling stressed about a new environment comes from not knowing much about it. It’s nice to find some places that can support you emotionally, like a quiet park or a cafe you can go to! Getting to know people is also great, finding connections definitely helps you adjust. Despite being in a city surrounded by people, it’s easier than expected to feel socially isolated. I think one big reason is that because of how many people you’ll meet, it’s hard to form a community/close circle of friends at first. I feel like I was able to reflect on a lot of things with this unit, we touched upon a lot of topics I never took the time to consider! I'd be happy to discuss these topics with you further, but great job on the lessons!",,,,

If you have any more questions about our last module (from rural to urban), feel free to click on that one and add to it. Please have a look at this new module. How do you feel about taking on new responsibilities as an adult? For example, grocery shopping, booking appointments, cleaning etc.? If you'd like, there is a worksheet under the 'Background info' in lesson 1, that can help you answer these questions.

Mentee 2023-11-14, 10:42:  Mentor 2023-11-15, 18:18: Hi Ava, It's great to hear from you. That's a great question! I don't think there is one right answer, but I can definitely tell you some things that have worked for me to balance work and school (I go to school full time, 5 days a week, and work on the weekends for context). I found it helpful to schedule and plan my days (using a calendar, or some other organizational tool on my laptop and phone) - this helps me make sure I space out my time, priorities, assignments, and work shifts. I also make sure I create some designated time for myself. It can be hard to balance things when you're not taking care of your own physical and mental well-being because it usually leads to burning yourself out. So I try to include something once a week that I really enjoy doing. Sometimes this is a yoga/workout class, spending some time with a friend, or just allowing myself time to stay home and be a couch potato and watch TV! I hope this helps! How has school and work (if you are working) - or general work-life balance been for you so far? Is there anything that you've found helpful that you can do to de-stress and ensure time for yourself? I'm also going to open up our next module: career education, which you can find on the green colour wheel on the bottom left. Please have a look whenever you get a chance!

I particularly enjoy this module because it's very open-ended and allows you to explore your thoughts and feelings surrounding possible career paths. Can you think of some things you value in your life? For me, I value creativity, hard work, and kindness. What are your thoughts on how or in what way you'd like to contribute to the world? This is a tough question, so take your time! Based on those questions, have you thought of any career ideas (in the past, or now reflecting on those questions)? What kinds of things draw you towards that career path? Hope to hear from you soon, Agam Mentor 2023-12-03, 20:46: Hi Ava, I hope you're doing well! I'm just following up from my last message to you.

Mentor 2023-10-12, 17:23: Hi Ava, It's good to hear from you :) Thanks for sharing about your hometown. Those are both such great questions, and sometimes a bit hard to answer, because the experience can be different for everyone. Personally, when moving for school, I found that joining clubs about things I was interested in was really helpful. For example, I joined a club for other women in Science, which was amazing because I got to meet other people like me who were taking the same classes as me/were in the same program as me. I would say the same thing for making friends as well - clubs are a good thing for that. As well as sports teams, talking to people in your classes, talking to roommates/other people in my residence building. Little things like that can go a long way!

It was great being able to chat about university and what interests you over the last few months. I learned more about living in rural areas and what concerns high school students have about the transition to postsecondary through our discussions. I hope you found our chats helpful as well. Thanks again, and I wish you all the best!",,,"Mentor 2023-10-19, 08:43: Hi Annabella, Just sending a message here to get us started on this new conversation topic! One of the discussion questions is about something surprising or challenging in transitioning to adulthood. I think for me living on my own was the most difficult thing, mostly because I had to make sure I stayed organized and ask others for help when I needed it. Staying in contact with my family definitely helped me during the process, though! Please let me know if you have any questions! Thanks! Mentee 2023-10-23, 11:23: Hey Alexandra, I have a few questions on adulting. How was the transition between having your parents do the ""Adulting"" for you, to you doing it on your own? Was there anything that was confusing or complicated to you? Was starting to budget difficult and did it get easier? How about having to buy necessities, did you have a hard time figuring out the best options, etc. There's something I'm very curious about; taxes. We are learning about them in class but i just can't seem to soak up the information. Do you do your own taxes? Were they complicated or confusing at first? How about now? I'd like to know anything you think is important for me to know about adulting. Thank you for your time, Annabella. Mentor 2023-10-24, 14:37: Hi Annabella, Thanks for your message! I think the biggest difference was that as I got older and moved out, I had to be more organized on my own and reach out to ask for help more often if I needed it. For budgeting, I think it helps to write out how much you're going to allow yourself to spend on certain things every month for example, and how much you plan to save. It's good to plan ahead. I suppose it just depends on which things you know you'll buy are necessities and comparing options or discounts when possible. Sometimes you have to try out new options to see what works best for you. About your question on taxes - my family and I get an accountant to do our taxes, but it's definitely good to have an idea of how the process works, especially since you'll often have to provide paperwork about your spending (for example, handing in proof that you're enrolled in post-secondary and paying tuition, or reporting how much money you make if you have a job). Like other aspects of adulting, making sure you're organized and that you have information written down for you to refer to afterwards if you're unfamiliar with a certain process is important. I realize some of these answers might be a bit general and not very specific, but hopefully, they're at least a bit helpful. I'll be happy to try to answer any more questions you might have! Looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-10-26, 10:43: Hey Alexandra, Thank you for answering my questions, it helped my understanding alot! I have a few more questions about adulting! Did it take you a long time to get the hang of doing everything yourself? Do you still get confused and need help from time to time? Do you have a job to help pay for your expenses? If so, how is balancing school and work? Is there anything you think I should know that I haven't asked about? Thank you for your time, Annabella Mentor 2023-10-26, 20:36: Hi Annabella, It's good to hear from you! I think it definitely did take me a while to get used to doing things myself and living alone! Yes, I still do get confused and need help from time to time, and luckily I have friends and family who are very supportive of me. At the moment I have two part-time jobs. For one of my jobs, I tutor elementary and high school students. For my other job, I'm a student research assistant at my university (helping with educational projects related to history). I also help the other student research assistants with running social media accounts and marketing. Admittedly, it's pretty tough balancing work and school - I'm very busy! I try to stay organized by using an online calendar, reminders on my phone, and setting due dates for myself so I complete assignments on time. I think that you've been asking lots of great questions, Annabella! Please feel free to ask more about Adulting if anything else comes up, and we can also continue to discuss some of the topics under the From Rural to Urban module at the same time, too, if you're interested.

Some of the discussion questions involve thinking about what we value in life, how we want to contribute to our community, and how these points might help us think about which career path we'd like to pursue. I'll start by sharing one career path I'm interested in - I'm hoping to become a high school teacher one day. I've always loved reading, which is why I chose to study English and History at university. I had a lot of great teachers in high school who were really supportive of me, and I hope I'll be able to help students much like my teachers once helped me.

Mentee 2023-09-26, 11:28: Hey Alexandra, I was wondering if we could have a conversation on ""Adulting"". How was moving out of your parent's house? Was it hard? Do you live in a dorm at school? If so how is it? How is budgeting and balancing school with your other responsibilities? Also, how is studying English Literature? Is it hard or fun? The change from highschool to university must've been drastic. Thank you for your time ! Annabella. Mentor 2023-09-26, 15:07: Hi Annabella, Thanks for your message, it's great to hear from you! Yes, I can open up the ""Adulting"" conversation for us to work on first. Currently, I'm living in a dorm at UBC. I first moved out of my parents' house into my dorm around two years ago, and I did miss home at first. I think that as time went by though and I got busier with school, being away from home felt a lot easier. Living in a dorm is pretty nice! I live very close to where I attend my classes and it's convenient, but I did have to make sure I stayed organized when I began living on my own. For budgeting, I try to set a certain amount every month to spend on certain areas (like food, etc.) and try to stick to it. I try to stay on top of my schedule by using Google Calendar, reminders on my phone, and writing to-do lists. Studying English Literature has been pretty interesting, and I'm glad to have been able to read many different genres and texts I probably wouldn't have read otherwise. The change from high school to university was drastic, as you've anticipated. It was really different especially when I first had in-person classes in my second year at university because my first year was completely online. Students get more freedom and chances to be independent in university, but a lot of new responsibilities, too! Hope these answers helped! I'm looking forward to discussing the new unit with you! Mentee 2023-10-03, 10:39: Hi Alexandra, Thank you for your last response, it was very informative and helpful. It is nice to hear things in your perspective-- especially with the plentiful explantions you give. The new topic I want to discuss is confronting discrimination. I am an asian woman and have had my fair share of microaggresive comments, racist jokes at my expense, and more revolving around my gender, race, and sexuality. My question is have you ever faced discrimination? If so, did you confront it? How? Do you still face discrimination even at school? What is your take on this subject? Thank you for your time, Annabella. Mentor 2023-10-04, 12:24: Hi Annabella, Thanks for your message! It's good to hear from you. I realize that your teacher would like you to start on the Rural to Urban unit first, so I have opened that up for us to start on instead. In response to your question about discrimination - fortunately, I haven't really faced many cases of discrimination in my lifetime, despite being an Asian woman. However, as you've mentioned, when they do occur rarely they're usually microaggressive comments. It can be really difficult to face comments like that especially when they are directed at us personally. Although I try my best to ignore comments like that, I understand how that might not be the best way to deal with the situation. I think it's important to have people you can talk to and confide in if you are being bullied or discriminated against, and prioritize your safety as well. So try to discuss this with a trusted adult as well, or friends who you can reach out to. I don't really face discrimination at school, I think almost everyone at my school is very inclusive. Of course, some people simply do not wish to learn how to be understanding and inclusive of others, which is really unfortunate. If you ever experience discrimination though I think the most important thing is to ensure your own safety, as well as document and report the incident if possible. Here's a link you might be interested in, having to do with activism and how someone can get support if they're facing discrimination. The 1907 Project, which you can learn about in the link, was created by Asian women who have many of the same concerns you mentioned! I hope this helps! Mentee 2023-10-17, 09:57: Hey Alexandra, Do you live on campus? If so, is it enjoyable and comfortable? I'm not even sure how much it is to live on campus, I assumed it wouldn't be cheap. Should we move on to the topic of adulting? Thank you, Annabella. Mentor 2023-10-19, 08:38: Hi Annabella, Thanks for your message! Yes, I do live on campus right now. I enjoy it and it's very convenient! Unfortunately, living on campus is pretty expensive, but that also depends on which residence you live in. Often, it is even more expensive to rent off campus, but that varies as well. Yes, we should move on to the topic of Adulting. Thanks!","Mentor 2023-10-04, 12:28: Hi Annabella, I just wanted to send a quick message in this new unit to get us started. The discussion questions above in Lesson 1 suggest that we can talk about your experience living in a rural area. What is it like where you live? I've pretty much lived in cities my whole life (Vancouver and Burnaby). If you've got any questions about living in cities, please let me know! I think that would be a good place to start. Looking forward to hearing from you! Mentee 2023-10-11, 09:54: Hey Alexandra, Thanks for your reply on discrimination, it was very insightful. For the unit of rural to urban, I live in a ""city', that should be considered more of a town. It is very small and relatively quiet, low crime rate, smaller population, and not lots of options when it comes to resturaunts, stores, etc. It's one of those places where you kind of know or know of everyone because it's so small. The weather is also often gloomy and it rains more often than it doesn't. I was born in Burnaby, and have visited Vancouver many times, to me, it seems like an awesome place to live. But how is it from your perspective, since you've lived there most of your life? Do you think it ever got tiring to live in Vancouver? Were you always meeting new people? Assuming you have visited a more rural area, which do you prefer? Rural or urban? I'd like to know if there's anything you'd think i'd need to know before moving to an urban area. Thank you, Annabella Mentor 2023-10-11, 23:50: Hi Annabella, Thank you for your message, and for your detailed description of what it's like where you live! It's very rainy here in Vancouver, too. I've actually lived in Burnaby longer than I've lived in Vancouver, but at the moment I'm living in Vancouver attending university. I like living in the Lower Mainland, and I'm not really sure if I'll be tired of it! Maybe one day, though. Vancouver is definitely a busier city than Burnaby is, with many more restaurants and businesses to visit, and things to do! However, since I'm living on UBC campus right now, it's a bit more isolated from the other parts of the city and downtown. I've heard from some people who have moved from other places to Vancouver that it's difficult to make new friendships in the city because everyone is really busy and usually has their own circle of friends already, but I think being in a school environment helps people make friends more easily. There are lots of opportunities to meet people at postsecondary - like in classes or in clubs, for example. I have visited rural areas in my childhood, but not that often - it was mostly with family while we were on vacation, so I have good memories of visiting the countryside. I'm not quite sure whether I'd consider settling down in a rural area though, especially since I've lived in cities my whole life. I think moving to an urban area can be pretty overwhelming, so I recommend looking up lots of information online and being organized (and asking friends and family for any advice they might have for you as well). In Vancouver, rent is very expensive and many students struggle to find housing, so if you plan on moving to an urban area for postsecondary be sure to do your research, and if at all possible, choose to live on campus or nearby. That's pretty much what I can think of so far, but if there's anything else, I'll let you know!",,,,

I saw you mentioned that you've acted in a play recently, what was it? Was it part of a theatre festival, or a one-off performance? I was in a local theatre festival over the summer, wherein I played a stereotypical knight in shining armour, who was afraid of everything; and then stuffed in as a third part of an unnescessary love triangle in an attempt by the author (a character not the playwright) to stop the two totally in love (women) lovers. Apologies again for the late (and admittley quite short response) Angus. Also here is my three-pictures assignment: here Mentor 2023-09-29, 11:56: Hey Angus, No worries at all, good to hear back! The play was written in a different language and set in a village - basically a slice-of-life retelling of a few particularly eventful days in the inhabitants' lives. I played the role of the friend of one of the main characters so lots of quips and banter involved. Your role (and the character!) seems really interesting, did you wear anything resembling real armour? That would be quite something.

Hope you had a good weekend, and Thanksgiving (if applicable)! I wore a hoodie with an armour print on it with some non-descript black pants. But, we did use real swords! Granted they were dulled for the perfomance. But still very much real, we even had a few stage-fights involving said swords. I don't know why our director had 5 spare swords sitting around, but it definitey added a fun flair to the whole production! If you don't mind sharing, what language was your play written/performed in? Was it initial written abroad, and then performed locally? or was it written in Canada in a non-English language? If it was the latter, was it being written in another language a intentional choice to make a point, or was did it just-so-happen to the playwrite's first language? I've also saved my document to the portfolio as a .docx, and .pdf if the Word document doesn't work. I should be done my response to your, assignment by this evening. P.S. (I don't mean any offense by this) How do I pronounce your name? I've been saying it like ""Ee-shan"" with ""Ee"" as in 'beet,' and ""shan"" as in 'equation.' Equation isn't the greatest example, but I can't really think of a better one haha. Thanks again for the response! Hope that you've been having a good day! Regards, Angus Mentor 2023-10-12, 11:32: Hey Angus, No worries at all, I hope you also had a good Thanksgiving weekend. I see, I see, that does sound interesting. Not often that you get to work with actual swords! I'm sure the stage fights must have been a pretty unique experience. The play I was part of was in the Marathi language, which is spoken in Western India. It was originally written in the region and adapted for the production. I think you chose a really eclectic and unique group of pictures in your document and appreciate your effort in describing each one. I especially liked your clouds picture - I also have a great liking of the atmosphere and weather phenomena in general. It's like you wrote - there's just so many mechanistically diverse things going on around us every day! I also found your pulley picture quite interesting - is that an area that you're hoping to explore more in your career? Feel free to ask if you have any questions about any of my photos btw! I appreciate your effort to pronounce my name correctly and yes that is very close - the ""shan"" part is pronounced almost like ""shawn"", but with very little emphasis on the ""w"" if that makes sense. Do let me know of your thoughts on the lesson 1 discussion questions when you've had the chance to go over them like you mentioned! Best, Eashan Mentee 2023-10-17, 10:15: Hey Eashan, I really enjoyed your photos! The most striking thing about your chosen photos to me was the fact that they all were of nature (and taken by yourself). Do you do photography as a hobby? Like going out looking for something to photograph or just a spur-of-the-moment desicion? Another thing that tied all your photos together was the beauty found in mundane or ordinary things found in everyday life if you take a moment to appreciate them reveal their beauty. To quote yourself like the pretentious little goblin I am, “...particularly those who we see on a daily basis but don’t always appreciate the beauty of.” This quote from yourself regarding the goose photo reminds me of the cloud example from my own three photos; though the cloud was more focusing on how awe-inspiring the mundane can be, rather than the beauty. Do you have a moment where you could point to and say that you started appreciating the beauty of the mundane? Or was it more of a general belief you have held throughout your life? If it was the latter, why? On the topic of the pulley system, physics is personally my favourite STEM subject! It's has always been fascinating that we could (accurately) calculate and predict how things move. When I was younger, I was obsessed with space and orbits, not that I'm interested in than anymore; just i had that little kid obsession with it. When I was first in highschool, the physics bits (Ohm's Law) was what I tendended to find myself just ""getting"" the most. I've bounced the idea of persuing physics / engineering around for my post secondary education. I'm writting this just before my next class starts so I'm going to leave it on here. It was nice hearing from you, Regards, Angus","Mentor 2023-10-19, 09:53: Hey Angus, I'm glad to hear you liked the photos! They were more spur-of-the-moment - visuals that I throught were really interesting and so wanted to keep with me - but I do like photography in that respect. It's great to hear your thoughts on the photo descriptions, I'd say I've always had that kind of appreciation but it does emerge more when I'm in the midst of nature and see something special (wild animals, interesting plants etc.). It's also really interesting how the same photo (the cloud) can bring out different, equally interesting interpretations! That's great that you have an interest in physics! I'd definetely encourage you to explore that interest more as it will come in handy for post-secondary and career planning - I reckon we'll talk more about this in the coming units. I've always held great respect for how physics can essentially tie the world around us together + the people actually practicing it even though I'm more of a biology person myself (which you could say builds on physics haha). Now that we've had a chance to introduce ourselves, do take a moment to go through the lesson 1 and lesson 2 discussion questions and let me know of your thoughts and questions around them. I'd really like to hear what you think about what those questions generally cover, i.e. the differences between urban and rural life. We can then go on to the next unit (Adulting - which I've opened up for you - can also be found in the wheel above) after. If you can spare a moment to look at the warm-up picture and come up with some questions and thoughts, that would be splendid. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and questions! Best, Eashan Mentor 2023-10-26, 09:43: Hey Angus, Just checking in to see how it's going! Did you get a chance to go through the discussion questions in this unit? It's been great to hear your thoughts on the things we've discussed earlier and I'd really like to hear what you have to say on those too.

I’ll introduce myself quickly here incase you haven’t had a chance to read my profile yet: After highschool, I spent a year at Douglas College, then transferred to Simon Fraser University for a year, and then finally transferred to UBC. I am in my 3rd of Psychology I want to become a therapist focusing on gender identity or sexuality issues. I chose this because I want to help people feel better about their identities and in a small way help make a more inclusive world. I’m super excited to chat with you since we seem to have so much in common. I read your profile and saw that you enjoy reading, writing, and swimming. Well, me too! Do you have a favourite book? If so, what makes it your favourite? I’m always looking for new book recommendations if you have any :) Writing is fun for me too, though I don’t practice as often as I’d like--though I do keep a journal. If you ever want to share some of your writing with me, I’d love to read it! I also saw that you’re looking to go to either UBC or UVIC for psychology; I might be a little biased, but I’d say that’s a great choice! I also read you’re looking to learn some more about applying to university and adulting in general: well, look no further! I know how stressful it can be when you’re looking to apply to post-secondary. It’s a bit of a process, but sooo worth it. University is so fun :) Get To Know You Activity Have you decided which “Get To Know You” activity you want to do together? (the “I am” poem or the photoswap). Let me know when you do and I’ll get started on mine too :) Other Stuff I know my first message here is a lot, but I want to make sure I cover all our bases so we can start the fun stuff ASAP. SO: I have a few questions I’d love for you to answer to make sure we’re both on the same page while we’re chatting :) I’ll send you a worksheet to fill out! It was to e-meet you and I’m excited to hear your responses!! If you have any questions about anything about the program or anything, feel free to ask! (Unless it's physics. Physics is no fun. LOL) Talk to you soon :D Sam Mentor 2023-10-05, 17:46: Oops. Turns out I can't send you the worksheet, but you can find it under the ""Resources"" tab in the bottom left hand side of your screen. It's called ""Program Goals Worksheet for Mentees"" Mentor 2023-11-07, 10:18: Hi Anna! I hope your semester is going well :) Just a reminder I'm here to chat about any of your concerns about school or life, and also about the fun and exciting stuff too. No rush or pressure at all to chat! Have a great Tuesday, Sam",,,,,

I've been pretty good, been catching up on some reading and some games since I had a bit more free time on my hands. I'm glad you got to sleep in though! I've opened up the Adulting module for you. Glad to hear from you again, and let me know if the module is not working for you. Mentee 2024-04-09, 09:49: It has been a while, it's good to talk again. I have a question unrelated to adulting, what's your opinion on Theodore from Alvin and the Chipmunks?",,"Mentee 2024-01-17, 09:14: I'm starting on the finding insperation unit. Somethings I want in life would be, a nice house, a job I enjoy so I can be happy while I work, dissposable income, a good education, and eventually a wife and some kids. I was wondering what keeps you motivated, how do you have the motivation to learn and practice all those instruments and play all those sports. The one thing I struggle with motivationaly would be working out, sometimes I'll just stop working out for like five days. I try to stay motivated but sometimes it's difficult. Mentor 2024-01-19, 13:05: Hey Wyatt. Absolutely no problem! I hope you enjoyed your break. Christmas was not bad this year. Most of my family are elsewhere on vacation so I spent it with my friends instead. In terms of New Years resolutions it's been the same every year. Just be better than last year. How was your break/xmas? Do anything fun? Any resolutions for you? Mentor 2024-01-19, 16:31: Those are great things to want and work towards! With regards to what motivates me... I think finding things you enjoy is the crucial thing (and the love for learning). If you enjoy what you do, it feels like you don't even need motivation to want to start. Although sometimes I skip the gym as well. It's something all of us could probably work on and improve. Mentee 2024-01-25, 09:02: I was sick for most of Christmas break which really sucked, a resolution I had was to try and stay motivated. Thats why I picked this unit, What kind of habits have you created to help you do stuff you don't enjoy doing? Mentor 2024-01-28, 21:56: For tasks that I don't particularly enjoy doing. I tend to set aside a certain timeframe during the day for that task specifically. I find that when you form a routine out of it, it ends up feeling not so bad. Especially if you schedule something you enjoy right after it! Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:28: Alright, I'll be trying that. This unit was pretty helpful, thank you. I think "" Paying for school"" would be a good unit, I'll do the survey and then we can start. Mentor 2024-02-02, 02:50: Sounds good! I'll open up the next unit for you.",,,"Mentee 2024-02-07, 11:23: Thanks, I've always been a bit scared about how I'm going to pay for school so I hope this unit wil help. Someways I'm thinking about paying for school would be with scholarships and bursaries, I don't think I'd be able to pay for my schooling fully but it would sure help. If you don't mind me asking but how did you pay for your school and is there any advice you could give me on savings and stuff like that? Mentor 2024-02-11, 01:30: Hey Wyatt. Paying for school can be daunting for sure. Scholariships and bursaries are great ways to help pay for the cost of tuition. Most schools usually have some sort of financial program (such as bursaries) that you can apply for as well! I was able to pay for schooling thanks to funds from the government. StudentAidBC is a great website for applying for student loans. Depending on your financial situation, you can get grants in addition to the loan as well. Think of it as money you don't have to return! Mentee 2024-02-23, 09:59: Sorry I've been absent for so long, it was a long weekend and I almost forgot about this. Anyways thank you for the advice, I still have a question. How do you apply for scholarships and bursaries? Mentor 2024-02-27, 00:01: Absolutely no problem! Scholarships and bursaries are both sources of financial assistance. Scholarships are either granted to you without any sort of application (normally if you qualify for something, lets say your grades are really high, they'll automatically offer the scholarship in your letter of admission), or you apply for specific scholarships on the schools website. Bursaries are a bit different, and I can only speak for UBC, but I imagine it should be similar. Bursaries are applied for when you're already a recognized student at the school. You can usually apply for these on the student service center (or whatever the schools calls their main ""hub/site"".","Mentor 2023-10-15, 18:23: Hi Wyatt! This will be quite the long introductory message, so bear with me haha Just a quick introduction: I'm a recent graduate from UBC and I studied microbiology and immunology. Like you, I also plan to attend medical school one day and learn more about infectious diseases. I think medicine is such a great way to apply knowledge that you and I find interesting in a patient setting. Since science is always evolving, I thought it would be the perfect field for lifelong learning, as I find myself to be highly curious about everything. It's definitely a combination of being able to interact with patients face-to-face and to use medical knowledge to better their lives and their health. What draws you towards medicine and cardiology specifically? I do play a few games here and there, but not as much as I used to back in high school. I prefer the singleplayer titles over multiplay stuff, and particularly liked Elden Ring and Sekiro. What kind of games do you enjoy? Would love to hear about it. I've recently gotten back into working out as well after a hiatus. It's nice to see other people enjoying the gym as well! I also read on your profile that you are looking to learn how to find a job after school, as well as general advice for getting into post-secondary. Those are things I can definitely assist you with, so feel free to ask any questions that come up as we work together through these modules! One last thing, I've already opened the next module (From rural to urban) that your teacher wanted you to complete first, but do complete the ""Start Here"" unit (Lessons 1 and 2) before heading over there. I've only opened it in case you finish everything and want to move on. To get there, scroll up to the big green circle at the top of the page. Access to all units we'll be doing - including Start Here, are accessed via this wheel. I'm looking forward to to this! It's a pleasure to meet you! -Aidan Mentee 2023-10-24, 09:45: Hey Aidan, Sorry I've taken so long to wright back, I had no idea how to view your message but I understand it now. I've always been interested in science and recently I've been looking into cardiology, I think the study of hearts would be a cool thing to learn about since it's such a intricate organ. I'd love to hear your thoughts about cardiology. I really enjoy horror games like the Resident Evil series but me and my friends like to play games together often. I've also have a VR headset that I games on, do you like any other genres of games? Sadly out where I live there is no gym but I enjoy working out at home alot, I've got weights, a pullup bar, pushup bars, dip bars and a few more things. I think it'd be great to get on a call with you at some point, again, sorry for the wait. -Wyatt Mentor 2023-10-27, 01:20: Hey Wyatt. Absolutely no problem, the online platform can be confusing at times haha. The heart is definitely quite the interesting organ, highly resilient and complex, as you've said. I think studying cardiology is a great choice! With the rise of cardiovascular diseases, you'd be interacting with a good chunk of the population. I believe heart diseases were in the top 3 leading causes of death globally last time I checked, so I think it's a very rewarding field. Resident Evil is the BOMB. Pretty much a good chunk of my childhood right there. I really enjoyed the remake of RE4 back in March this year, and it's probably my favourite one in the series. The horror genre has some pretty great titles. My friends and I like to try out new games together so we're jumping genres here and there. I do appreciate a good RPG title every now and then. Been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy games since I was little. Having your own gym at home sounds really nice! I live in an apartment so I tend to use the equipment provided in the amenities gym, but it definitely leaves something to be desired. All the actual gym facilities here in the city require membership, and some of them can get pretty expensive. I've been back and forthing with the supervisors about trying to set up a time to call as well. Unfortunately, I'm running on quite the busy schedule but I'm trying to slip in some time, so fingers crossed! Aidan Mentee 2023-11-15, 09:59: Hello, I've decided to choose 3 pictures to share with you that I connect with. This one is of Perkins peak, I've gone up there a few times with my Dad and friends. It was a nice way to bond with my Dad and it was a great experience. Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:03: This is a picture of a B.C ferry, my dad takes my brother and I on a trip to Vancouver Island every summer. The reason I resonate with this is because I used to live in comox around 7 years ago. It's nice to be able to see my old friends and family every once in a while. Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:06: This is a picture of some German Shepherd puppies. The reason I resonate with this is because our dog just had puppies a few weeks ago. I tried to find a picture that looked the most similar to my puppies. Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:38: I've decided that for one of the ice breakers I'll share something that is cool from my cultural identity, I'm Norwegian. Mentor 2023-11-21, 01:39: This picture is of a white persian cat breed! I LOVE cats (and all animals honestly). I think they're more suited for my personality, as they don't require too much attention and are pretty quiet. Mentor 2023-11-21, 01:40: Music has been a huge part of my life since forever, and I've learned how to play several instruments throughout the years. My favourite instrument currently is the acoustic guitar! I don't think there's a day that's gone by without me playing it. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:01: I also love animals, I've been told I'm very empathetic and compassionate. I have a leopard gecko that's around 4 years old right now, they live for about 20 years. I named him Rango. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:37: ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."" -Ferris Bueller This is the quote I've decided to use for my other icebreaker activity. I remember hearing this quote a while ago but not knowing where it was from. I think people should just enjoy life, it isn't that long, you might miss some pretty great things. Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:39: ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."" -Ferris Bueller This is the quote I've decided to use for my other icebreaker activity. I remember hearing this quote a while ago but not knowing where it was from. I think people should just enjoy life, it isn't that long, you might miss some pretty great things. Mentee 2023-11-22, 08:59: This is some backround info on where I live. Mentor 2023-11-27, 01:10: Hey Wyatt! That's crazy to hear. I used to have 3 leopard geckos as well (sadly, they've all passed away already, it's been quite a while). I also really like the quote you shared. I agree with you in thinking that life is too short to waste, time really does start flying by the older you get, so you gotta make every second count. I personally really like the saying that if you can reflect back on your past year - whether it be certain interactions or events or how you responded to something - and feel uncomfortable/cringe, it shows that you've grown over the last year and learned a great deal. I'm really big on reflecting on mistakes and learning from them, and self-improvement is a continuous journey. I read the background info you provided about where you live. It's really interesting to see the differences between where we grew up. The city I live in has quite a high population count. The student body of the schools I attended were also on the higher end. I would imagine that having a smaller class/school size means you can know everyone you go to school with and connect with them. It sounds like you have a blast with your friends, and you activities are simple yet enjoyable! I think the complexities that come with living in the city can make plans complicated, and sometimes we forget to disconnect from the internet, social media, and our phones to simply connect in the moment. Mentor 2023-12-04, 17:53: I think the points you listed are all valid. When you have less people around you, its easier to form more connected, intimate relationships with all of them. As our friend groups get larger, we tend to trade intimacy for stability instead. Some cool parts of living in a city come to mind immediately: There's a lot of things to do and explore with your friends, or on your own! A lot of the times my friends and I drive off to different cities just to go on a little adventure Entertainment and social life - the cities offer a lot of options and is often quite dynamic and diverse Access to public services and infrastructure is really nice too! A lot of 24/7 services Those are just some of the things that I've grown to appreciate while living close to the city. I don't think I've ever lived anywhere that I would consider rural though. Are there any aspects of rural life that you particularly enjoy? Any expectations of the city that you've always been wondering about? Mentee 2023-12-05, 09:42: I agree that having stores 5 minutes away most of the time is pretty nice, if my family needs to get groceries its a 3 hour drive to the nearest walmart, then a 3 hour drive back. One of the main things I like about a rural lifestyle is the seclusion, when I visit Comox during the summer it gets pretty crazy with all the people everywhere. I think I could get used to it if I moved to an urban lifestyle though. I'm expecting the city to be pretty practical and all around easier to live in. I'm wondering how to start a new unit, I think I want to do the "" Finding insperation"" one. Mentor 2023-12-07, 22:59: If you're someone that values your peace and quiet (which I sometimes do too!), living in a rural setting sounds like a blessing. However, the 6 hour drive for groceries is quite scary for me as someone who gets motion sick pretty easily haha. Considering I get groceries weekly too, I'm not sure if I could ever get used to that. You're correct in saying that in this regard, the city is quite practical. There's almost always what you need nearby. I believe the unit your teacher wanted you to start on first is From Rural to Urban, which I've already unlocked for you. Mentee 2023-12-22, 12:58: Hey Aidan, Winter break starts tomorrow so I won't be able to respond until January 7th I think. I hope you have a merry Christmas and a happy New year. -Wyatt Mentor 2023-12-24, 16:16: Thanks for letting me know Wyatt. Hope you and your family and friends have a wonderful Christmas and New Year. -Aidan Mentee 2024-01-16, 13:09: Hey Aidan, I completly forgot to message you after the break. How was Christmas for you, do you have a New Years resalution? Mentee 2024-04-03, 09:28: Whats up Aiden, how have you been? My spring break was great, I got to sleep in for a good while. I was thinking we could do the ""Adulting"" unit next.","Mentee 2023-11-30, 09:19: Thanks for sharing, it's nice that we both love animals. Anyways, I think I'm going to finish up this unit so we can get started on the next. I think an advantage of living in the city would be getting to meet new people and also being able to know more people. I think a disadvantage of living in the city would be since theres so many people, maybe you can't form closer friends with to many people, since I live where theres only a few kids in my class I can form a good friendship with all of them. What do you think are some advantages of living in a city? Have you ever lived in a place you'd consider rural? Mentee 2023-12-08, 09:35: I think I'm all done with the unit, I feel like the ""Finding insperation"" unit would be fun and in informative. If I'm not done with the unit I dont think I know how to finish it. Mentor 2023-12-12, 21:36: You're right, my apologies. We can move on to the next unit. I've opened up Finding Inspiration for you.",,,,

I will be your mentor for the next few months where we'll delve into a lot of interesting topics as weeks pass and I hope we both can use it as a chance to learn more together! Just a short intro about myself: I am currently a biomedical engineering student living in British Columbia. I really enjoy learning about technology and how it's used in medicine, and I enjoy working on complex problems which usually involve math. Outside of school, I love to play soccer, badminton and basketball. I am also a big reader and I play video games too. Your profile says you want to learn more about ""living on your own."" I live on my own away from home, so I can definitely help learn more about that! As a get-to-know-you activity, after you watch the program tutorials above, please take a look at the I am from the poem, which you can get to by pressing ""Background Info"" and then ""Create an I am from poem."" Please take some time to write your own version of the poem. Here's mine: I am from mirrors From salt and sodium chloride I am from having a snowball fight on a cold day From the monsters which hid in the basement I am from the cold but suddenly warm winters From the pink hydrangeas I am from weekly park picnics From warm pizza and fries From the magic fountain The giant anaconda in the forest The blue outdoor benches where we always stood for lunch Let me know what you think and if you are curious about any part of my poem, feel free to ask! Be sure to take a look at the discussion questions for ideas about what to ask, if you are stuck. I'm really excited to hear back from you! Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything, and I'll do my best to help! Once we finish up with intros we can slowly start working on the first module, which is ""From Rural to Urban."" -Rayyan Mentee 2023-10-27, 10:16:  Mentor 2023-10-30, 19:54: Hi Tobias! I saw that you seemed to have tried to send a message earlier. It's great to know that you have logged on to the platform! Unfortunately, however, I am unable to read your last message! Please try sending it again, or let me know if you are having trouble with Mentor City, and I can try to help! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:13: hi rayyan this is my i am pome Mentee 2023-11-17, 09:29: Good Morning Rayyan, I am Attachinhg a cultural identity powerpoint , This shows some of the things I love doing and where I live' Toby Mentee 2023-11-17, 10:02:  Mentee 2023-11-17, 10:26:  Mentor 2023-11-18, 13:31: Hi Tobias, I'm glad you were able to complete the poem! Your poem was very different from mine, and that's a good thing! I'm glad I got to learn more about you through the poem. Thanks for also the other documents that you sent! I thought it was cool that you are interested in motorbikes! I've never had the chance to drive one, but I think it would be an exciting experience. Would you recommend it? Your PowerPoint about your identity was also excellent! It gave me a better idea about what it's like living in a rural community and about the things you enjoy doing. Since we are done with introductions, we can now move on to the ""Rural to Urban"" module, as I see you already have. If you have any more questions for me though, please feel free to ask! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:40:  Mentor 2023-11-24, 20:20: Hi Tobias, Good to see that you tried to send a message once again. However, sadly, nothing ended up going through. I'd recommend trying again to see if the message can be sent correctly. As usual, let me know if you need any help working with MentorCity and I'll do my best to help! -Rayyan Mentee 2023-12-12, 09:06:  Mentor 2023-12-14, 14:23: Hello again Tobias, Thank you again for putting in a response! Sadly though, it seems I am still unable to view your messages for some strange reason. If it shows up on your end, could you please send it again? If you have any questions please ask your teacher or feel free to reach out to me as well. Look forward to hearing from you! -Rayyan","Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:34: rural vs urban there is good and dad liveing in the city and country im gonna list the pro and cons City pros- I am closer to my family and stores and it is easer to access stuff cons- it is noisy. I hear sirens all the time. Ther are too many homeless people and drug addicts Country pros- you have more space and privacy. There is more freedom and less rules cons- it is hard to buy groceries and get stuff you need as the stores are 3 hours away. It gets too cold as we only have wood heat and it can be hard to start the car in the morning in the winter I like living in both but like the country a bit more most of the time Tobias Mentor 2023-11-18, 13:32: Hi Tobias, That's a great list of pros and cons! I think you covered some very key points. Living in the city, I have noticed that it does get quite hectic sometimes, and privacy is also sometimes difficult. I haven't lived in the country before, but every time I visit I do enjoy the peace and quiet which is something you can never get in the city. Just as an addition to the first two discussion questions above: could you maybe tell me a bit more about what school is like in a rural community? What do you do in your spare time, or after school? Feel free to take a look at the Discussion Questions from Lesson 1 for some prompts about what you can share. Let me know if you have any questions for me, as usual! Once you have finished, also please let me know what module you'd like to move on to next, and we can go from there! -Rayyan",,,,

Sounds like we should do these I am from poems? I'll send you mine soon. Mentor 2023-11-02, 19:20: Hey Simon! Just checking in since I haven't heard from you. I wrote an I am from poem. Kind of embarassing to share but here goes. Did you write one? I am from the hidden backyards, From coffee makers and upright pianos and unknown instruments in cases. I am from late night buses to late night tacos, under the orange street lights beneath palm trees at night. I'm from redwoods and also from poison oak. From the house that burned down when no one was home. I am from from Dungeness crab, saltrising bread and cioppino, from the pool on the school rooftop the pool in the river and the overgrown concrete slide on the hillside. I am from the twin peaks that hold back the fog but funnel the wind, the peaks from which you can see my whole world. Mentor 2023-11-28, 09:25: Hey Simon, how's it going? Want to maybe set up a Zoom call sometime and say hi? I could do Wednesday mornings or Monday mornings if one of those work for you. Mentee 2023-12-11, 12:17: Hi Max, Here is my I Am poem. Simon Mentor 2023-12-12, 12:14: Hi Simon, great to hear from you. Thanks for sharing the poem! I haven't heard of the legend of wildman, tell me about that one? And what's going on with the expired food at Double Dave's? Seems like I should open up one of the units above so you can look at some of the material. Do you know which one you want to do? Mentor 2024-01-09, 11:46: Hi Simon, Happy new year! Did you have a good holiday? I spent a few days with my parents, which was nice, but mostly my girlfriend and I stayed home and watched some TV and movies. I wanted to let you know that the From Rural to Urban unit is now open. I figure this is a good place to start since it's the required one. Check it out, I'm looking forward to chatting with you about it. Max","Mentor 2024-02-08, 17:11: Hey Simon, just saying hi. What did you do over your holiday break? Did you get much snow? We've had some snow days here in Vancouver. Hope you're doing well!",,,,
1047627115,9/18/2023 9:42,1047628802,68125,,,"Mentor 2024-01-31, 14:13: Hi Lyndsey, Welcome to the well-being and self-care unit! This unit will allow us to explore how to take care of ourselves. Please start by considering this question, ""Think about the circumstances or situations when you’re most and least healthy. Physically? Mentally?"" If you would like to share your responses, you can (but you are not require to do do). Once you are ready to start lesson 1, please watch the video ""A Self-Care Action Plan"" and read the article Anne Bokma. We will have some follow up discussion questions as well. Mentee 2024-03-08, 10:05: Hey Luka, I've watched the video and read the article. I found both very interesting (Hank Green is a cool guy). Anyway, I am ready to move on to the discussion questions Mentor 2024-03-09, 18:34: Hello Lyndsey! Hank Green is a cool guy! There are so many Hank Green videos on different subjects, I often use the crash course videos before exams. The psychology series is also fun to watch :) Thanks for looking at this unit's material, I think it is really helpful (or I found so, anyway). The discussions questions are to prompt us to think more about our mental health. The first step is to find the discussion questions under Lesson 1: Self Investigation. You'll see the discussion starts with making some lists (lists about warning signs and about things we enjoy). I'll make a list too, then we can share them. As always, if you have any questions, please let me know!",,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-10-04, 12:58: Hi Lyndsey, It's nice to e-meet you! My name is Luka and my pronouns are they/them. I am currently attending the University of British Columbia, studying Environment and Sustainability as well as Psychology. It took me a long time to figure out what I wanted to study, so I have tried Earth and Ocean Sciences and Social Justice as well! While I am deeply interested in everything I have studied, I am focusing on psychology as my career goals involve opening a counselling clinic for queer youth. I am very excited to meet you as it seems we have many interests in common! I also love art and I learned to love writing while at university. Your profile says that you are interested in attending post-secondary education. I had a very difficult time selecting a school when I was in high school, I can definitely help you explore different options! In order to get to know you better, we can either complete the I am from poem or photo swap activity, let me know which one you would prefer! Mentee 2023-10-24, 10:30: Hi Luka, It nice to e-meet you as well. I am sorry for the late reply. I am still figuring out what pronouns I am most comfortable with but at the moment I prefer they/them. I haven't told my teachers this so I would appreciate if my pronouns were kept private outside of our conversations. I would prefer to do the photo swap activity. Mentor 2023-10-24, 19:41: Hi Lyndsey, Thank you for sharing your pronouns with me. Would you be comfortable with me using your name only when I address your teacher? If not, please let me know what works for you! For the photo swap activity, we will both share 2-3 photos and provide a brief description of those photos. These photos can be of anything as long as no people or identifying features (i.e. your address) are in it. Afterwards, we can comment on each other's photos and complete the discussion prompts. To look for this activity, you can find it under Lesson 2: Meet Your Mentor and select background information and then 'Photo Swap Activity'. Please let me know if you have any questions! Mentor 2023-10-24, 20:12: Photo 1 (taken by me): I chose to share this photo as I find a lot of calmness looking at the colours and how they interact with each other. There is something warm about this photo that makes me feel at ease and supported. In a way, it makes me feel like the colours represent the friends that support me everyday. Mentor 2023-10-24, 20:14: Photo 2 (a section of a photo taken by me): I chose to share this photo as our lives are like puzzles. Our life experiences make up the overall story of us. We are given the opportunity to make meaning of our experiences, and I think this is when you put the pieces together. Mentee 2023-10-25, 08:54: Luka, I am confortable with you using only my name when you address my teacher. Thank you for asking. Mentor 2023-10-26, 08:57: Hi Lyndsey, I will do that! Please let me know if that changes at any time :) I'm excited to see your photos! Mentee 2023-10-26, 11:10: Photo 1 (taken by my mom) This is a progress photo my mom sent me. It is one of her crochet projects, she mostly makes dreamcatchers. Both my mom and I crochet and knit and it’s become a significant part of our lives after my dad passed. This isn’t a recently learned skill for either of us though, we could both learned to crochet from a young age. Photo 2 (taken by my mom) This is a finished product of my mom’s crocheting. As said before she makes dreamcatchers. Dreamcatchers are a part of our tradition and it is nice to have a touch of that in our household as so much of indigenous traditions have been lost. Photo 3 (taken by my mom) These are all books I own, the cause of this picture is that I wasn't sure where they were and asked my mom if she knew their location, she sent me this photo in response. Since I was young, I always remembered wanting to read or envying people who could. Books helped me escape from this reality and are part of the reason I enjoy writing stories. Though most of my stories go unfinished and my characters underdeveloped, I still enjoy the process. Mentee 2023-10-26, 12:14: Luka, response to photo 1: I interpret this photos meaning is that most people muddle together like when you've mixed too many paints together. Instead of muddling together let your colour show and be bright, as bright and outlandish (if that's what you prefer) as you can because muddling is boring and uneventful. Mentor 2023-10-27, 12:43: Hi Lyndsey, Thank you for sharing these photos! I will respond to photo 2. To me, this photo demonstrates imense meaning. I feel like it represents the weaving of stories together and that it holds memories and identity. I also find the photo to be very peaceful from the complexity of the art. Mentor 2023-10-27, 12:47: Next we can begin with the discussion questions. Here are the questions in the discussion section for this module: ""What do you notice about your responses to the images and your mentor’s responses? Were they similar or different?"" ""at least one thing you hope to learn from your mentor AND at least one thing you found interesting in their profile or their poem/photos."" ""your mentor a question about their poem/photos or themselves. If you can’t think of one, try one of these questions: • Choose one thing that stood out in their poem/photos, and ask about its significance or why they chose to share it. • Ask them to explain something in their poem/photos or their profile that you are not familiar with. • Ask them why they wanted to be a mentor in this program"" Also, please let me know if you would like to do another icebreaker activity. Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:12: Discussion questions: Something I noticed about our responses to eachother's photos was that our responses were (in my opinoin) very different. For example, my response to your photo was to be ones true seld no matter how much of a challenge it is and your response was a much more complex message. One thing I hope to learn from you is how I can become more myself because I feel restricted in my self expression. Something I found interesting about your photos is that both of them are very coluorful and optimistic. Colour seems to mean a lot to you. It appears vibrantly in both of your photos and I was wondering what colour ment to you. So, that's my question: What does colour mean to you? Mentor 2023-10-30, 16:44: Hi Lyndsey, I agree that our responses to the photos were different I think that it is really cool that people find meaning in something in unique ways. I also think this highlights how our experiences, histories and personality shape us in ways that affect our perception of a photo. I really enjoyed this exercise, so I thank you very much for your engagement! Thank you for your question about what colours mean to me! I will be honest, I love colours. Having spaces that are filled with different colours makes me feel safe and also happy. When I was growing up, we painted our house in many different colours (bright orange, dark green, purple, red, light blue) and I think that it was well representative of my family. We were happy and safe together. Now my walls are painted white, but I make sure that they are filled with colours by hanging up paintings and posters. When I have time, I enjoy making pieces of art that I can decorate my space with. I have always made colours the central theme in these decorations. I love when people notice the colours. I also feel that my identity is represented with colours. As I indicated in my profile, I am queer. I believe in an expansive view of gender and sexuality that is not limited to the binary structures (that being man and woman for example) that are imposed on us. I feel like one of the best ways to exist as myself is to show everyone my colours, especially where they do not fit in with others expectations. I often take notes with coloured pens and I love having colourful stickers on my laptop. I think that I feel like colours remind other people of my uniqueness. I hope that my experiences of learning to express myself can help you develop a sense of who you are, who you want to be and what that looks like. I also hope that you can discover more about yourself through the upcoming modules. Mentee 2023-11-14, 10:21: Hey Luka, I can''t acces the section titled ""Finding Inspiration"". Could you help me? Mentor 2023-11-14, 10:59: Hi Lyndsey, Your teacher has requested that we start with the rural to urban unit. Once this unit is complete, you can choose 4 other units that interest you (and this includes the finding inspiration module). I will unlock the rural to urban one and we can get started on that! Mentee 2023-11-14, 11:01: Okay! Thanks Luka!! Mentor 2023-11-14, 11:08: Hi Lyndsey, you should now be able to see the rural to urban unit on the wheel. Simply press on the words and it will take you to the unit. I've already left you a message there! Mentee 2023-12-13, 09:38: Nevermind lol! I was opening the wrong spot. My mistake","Mentor 2023-11-14, 11:06: Hi Lyndsey, Welcome to the Rural to Urban unit! In this module we'll both get to learn more about rural and urban environments. Once you have had the opportunity to read the description and the warm up activity, we can start the lesson 1 discussion. Mentor 2023-11-14, 11:16: The warm up activity includes a reflection, if you would like to share you are welcome to! Mentor 2023-11-14, 11:19: *taken from the Discussion Questions Rural Living Tell your mentor all about where you live! Some ideas for things you could share: • How many people live in your town and go to your school? • What do high school students do for fun and where do they hang out? • What do students do for extracurriculars? • What makes your town special to you? • Share your answer to the following questions: • What are some strengths that you have gained as a result of living in a rural community? How will these strengths give you a leg up in your education or career? • How might you use your future education or career to help address some of the challenges your community faces? Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:47: When people ask where I live I usually respond with ""the middle of nowhere,"" because I feel it's truthful. About 20 students attend the school. As a high school student I can answer the question ""what do high school sutdents do for fun and where do they hang out?"". Since most of my friends have moved to the city to continue their education, I cannot hang out with them so I usually stay home. At home I keep the fire going, watch the dogs, read, play games, watch movies, and walk to the river. Some strenghts I've aquired from living in a rural area are: some basic survival skills, and communication. In any career or education communication is important. I do not know how I would use my future education or career to address challenges in my community. Mentor 2023-11-21, 10:12: Hi Lyndsey, thank you for sharing a little bit about your community. While I have spent most of my life living in an urban area, I spent a few months living in a rural community. You mentioned that people often leave to the city, and that it affects what you are able to do. I did not spend enough time living in the community, but I did have many friends who commuted to school, but they lived too far to visit outside of school. The result was that I spent a lot of time around my home on the weekends. Today, many of my friends have indeed moved to the nearest city to go to school. The strengths you said you gained from your community will definitely come in handy in your future career and/or educational pathway. As someone in university, I can confirm that communication is incredibly helpful at school. However, communication will always be needed. Having basic survival skills will certainly help you out as well. Which skills have you learned that may help you in an urban setting? Mentee 2023-11-22, 10:07: Luka, To answer your question, I am not sure what skill(s) I have learned that might help me in an urban setting. Mentor 2023-11-22, 14:38: That is so fair! Many of the skills you've learned will help you in some way, but sometimes it takes a lot of time to see how they help you. Is there anything else you would like to share about your community? Mentor 2023-11-22, 14:39: Alternatively, are there any skills you have that you are wondering if they may help you in a city? I might be able to provide some insight :) Mentee 2023-12-06, 13:09: Uhhmmmm, I cannot seem to think of any skills that I wonder might help me in the city. Mentor 2023-12-06, 20:28: Hi Lyndsey, That's okay! You never know when the skills you have will support you in different settings. Mentor 2023-12-06, 20:30: Now we can work on Lesson 2: Same but different. For lesson 2, please start by watching the video included in the background information. I would love to hear your thoughts about ""Mobilize"" after you've watched it! Mentee 2023-12-13, 09:16: I think there is a problem in the lesson. When I open it, I'm taken to a document and there is not a link to the video you mentioned. Mentee 2023-12-13, 09:43: Nevermind lol! I was opening the wrong spot. My mistake Mentee 2023-12-13, 09:59: To answer the discussion questions, I do not know much about living in a city but I do know that you need an okay sense of direction and if you are femme presenting you should be aware of your surroundings. My feelings about city life are split in some ways. Some of my hobbies are better suited to living in a city where others are not. Living in a city after living in a rural area is probably quite a shock as there are obviously going more people and different kinds of dangers. Some advantages and challengese of living in a city are, having better to more resources (and in some cases better education) a challenge would be socializing and adjusting to the mass amounts of traffic. What are some of the biggest surprises for people moving from rural to urban areas when they moved to a city? When watching ""Mobilize"" it felt very rushed and seemed like rapid modernization. The person in the green dress near the end of the video seemed out of place but still blended in with the crowd. The reason I assume they were out of place is because they were not used to such a different environment and the different noises a city produces. Mentor 2023-12-13, 17:14: I'm glad you found the video! When I watched the video I found it to be anxiety-provoking. I think it was how it felt like such an abrupt transition to the fast paced, sometimes isolating, feelings of the city. However, I found the video to be inspiring in that it connects rural and urban. We often separate these two but they are interlinked! Your comment about the person out of place is interesting, that was not something that I noticed. I certainly see this perspective, thanks for sharing! Mentor 2023-12-13, 17:31: Your discussion responses are great Lyndsey. I find the question about living in a city to be a little overwhelming. I have lived in 2 cities and a small community in my life and I find them all quite different. In terms of the cities I have lived in, I have noticed the importance of being able to navigate through the never ending city blocks. However, when I moved to Vanouver, I did not know where anything was. It took me a long time to develop a sense of direction. I also know there is so much of the city that I would struggle to navigate in. I find I have learned to figure out where the mountains are to know where North is. From there, I am able to guess where I am! It is also true that you need to be aware of your surroundings in cities. I find staying in busier spaces to feel much safer, but this will be different for every person. The important thing to note about cities are the many resources you have to feel safe. For instance, UBC has a program where someone will walk with you on campus at night so that you are not alone. If you ever have questions about safety in the city let me know! Which hobbies do you have that are suited for cities? From my experience, it is true that rural and urban living are quite different. For instance, the small town I lived in had a community swimming pool where you would always see your classmates and neigbours. In the city, there are so many pools that you may never run into someone you know. I also find that the people are different, in that there is often a sense of less of a community. It is important to build connections in cities to decrease feelings of isolation. When I moved to this city, I had no friends, so I had to join sport leagues, clubs on campus and I started working to make friends and connections. You may find that it takes a little more effort. However, one of my hobbies is exploring the city streets, and Vancouver certainly is a good city for exploring! I would say that one of the biggest surprises for moving to a city is the change of familiarity. This comes anytime you move, but my time in cities compared to small communities were quite different! I had to get used to skyscrappers everywhere! I would say there are also many stereotypes about cities that you may find to not be true. For example, in Vancouver, when you are not downtown, the buildings are mostly low rise buildings (less than 5 floors). There are also many neighbourhoods filled with families and many local stores that make the city feel less big. You are certainly correct about the traffic in cities. It is usually best to travel during the day haha. Mentor 2023-12-13, 17:31: Do you have any more questions about living in the city? Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:42: i do not have any other questions about city living Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:42:  Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:58: To answer a question you asked earlier, some hobbies I have that are more suited to city life are: skateboarding, rollerblading and couple others. Mentor 2024-01-30, 12:33: Ooh yes! Those are great in cities for sure! The UBC campus in Vancouver has a really great skate park :) Mentor 2024-01-30, 12:38: Thank you for our discussion! I really enjoyed our conversation about city and urban life and I hope it’s been helpful to you. I'm glad you were able to think of fun activities you would enjoy in the city while also acknowledging that some activities are less geared for citites. Let me know which unit you want to do next, then look out for a message from me with next steps!” Mentee 2024-01-31, 12:06: I also enjoyed our conversation and I found it very useful. I think I would like to do the Well Being &amp; Self Care Unit next. Mentor 2024-01-31, 14:08: Perfect! I'll open it now.",,,,

I've opened up the Post-Secondary and Career Planning unit for you, and I think you'll find it's got a lot of food for thought. To kick things off, there's a warm-up activity waiting for you that's all about looking ahead. The activity starts with a big question: What do you see yourself doing after high school, both right away and in the long run? It's your chance to sketch out the future as you see it now. Don't hold back—let your hopes and dreams take the lead. Once you've worked through the unit, you'll circle back to your initial thoughts. It'll be interesting to see if your views shift after diving into the unit. Remember, there's no pressure to share what you come up with unless you want to. But if you do feel like discussing your predictions and any changes in your thinking, I'm all ears! Looking forward to seeing how you envision your future, Liam. If you need any help or just want to chat about your ideas, I'm just a message away. Catch you later, Ali Mentor 2024-01-25, 21:15: Hey Liam! I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with you. How are you finding the Post-secondary and Career Planning unit? Is there anything that's sparked your curiosity or something you're particularly eager to learn more about? Also, if you've got any questions, whether they're about the unit or anything else, I'm here to help out. And if there’s something new you've been thinking about or are excited to explore, let me know. I'm always interested in hearing what's on your mind. Take care, Ali Mentor 2024-01-27, 22:17: Hi Liam! It's time to dive into Lesson 1 of the Post-secondary and Career Planning unit! In lesson 1, there is a link to Work BC where you can explore all about various careers your interested. You'll see what education is needed, what the job involves, and the kind of salary you can expect in BC. I've also included a link to UNBC's admission requirements as a starting point, since it's closest to you. It details the courses you'd need to ace in Grade 12 for a program like software engineering. But hey, if UNBC isn’t what you had in mind, no sweat! We can absolutely look into other universities that pique your interest. Just let me know what you're thinking, and we can explore together. As you’re checking out these resources, reflect on a couple of things: How do you feel about the education journey for your chosen career? What benefits could college or university bring to your life? And if there are any hurdles you might encounter, let's list them out. We'll brainstorm ways to clear those hurdles. If you have any questions about university requirements or if you're curious about exploring other universities, feel free to ask. I'm here to help you understand the requirements and find the best fit for you. Once you've looked into these, we have some discussion questions to go over. They're a chance for you to reflect on your aspirations and the practical steps you'll take to achieve them. You can share as much as you're comfortable with, and together, we can plan how to navigate any challenges you might face. Looking forward to your thoughts and any questions you might have! Catch you later, Ali UNBC admission requirements --&gt; https://www2.unbc.ca/calendar/undergraduate/high-school admissions#BCandYukonHighSchools Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:13: Hi Ali I'm just senading you this, because i dont know if im supposed to send it but i'll fill in the rest later in the unit. And i will get started on lesson 1. Mentee 2024-02-02, 09:02: Hi Ali Hey i'm just wondering what your schedule is like, like what time you wake up and what time your most likely to send messages. What are you doing on your free time. Mentee 2024-02-02, 12:16: Hi Ali I just finished the post secoundery and career planning, for lesson 2. Now i think its the right one but if it looks wierd then just let me know problably not the right one. k thanks liam Mentee 2024-02-14, 09:52:  Mentee 2024-02-14, 09:53: Hi Ali Yeah for sure i'll send it again, Mentee 2024-02-15, 12:15: Hi Ali Thank you, im trying my best and Yes of course i have NBA stars i really like, theres Steph Curry and Kobe Briyant, and what is your favorite basket ball team i would love to know. Liam Mentor 2024-02-21, 14:34: Hi Liam, Steph Curry is a legend, and Kobe Bryant was one of a kind – great choices! I'm right there with you; my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors too. There's something about the way they play the game that's just thrilling to watch. Now, as we close out Lesson 2, let's take a moment to think about the next steps. The application process and choosing a school can stir up all sorts of feelings. Excitement, a bit of nerves – it's all part of the journey. How are you holding up with it all? Remember, it's totally okay to feel a mix of things. As you reflect, consider the changes you might need to make for a smooth transition into your chosen program and school. It's all about planning your journey. Take a look at the discussion questions attached – they're a good way to sort through your thoughts. If you're up for it, share your responses with me. I'm here to help you make sense of it all and to offer any advice or insights you might need. And if you have any questions, whether they're about the application strategy or how to stay organized, just ask. Looking forward to hearing from you! Cheers, Ali Mentor 2024-02-25, 18:14: Hi Liam! Just wanted to check in and see how you're doing! How was your weekend? I'm hoping you had the chance to take a break and enjoy some downtime. If there's anything fun or interesting that happened recently that you'd like to share, I'm all ears. It's always good to hear about the little things that bring a smile to your day. And of course, if you have any questions or if there's something on your mind that you want to discuss, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you however I can. Take care and have a great week ahead! Cheers, Ali Mentee 2024-03-01, 08:59: Hi Ali Okay i'll have a look at the discussion questions and im doing great, i think this is really helping me with what and how to do things and thank you for leading me through it all. what is the plication strategy? i would like to know and how did you go through it your self?. I Agree the NBA games are very exciting, I love how they play the game as well. Warm regards Liam Mentor 2024-03-03, 21:24: Hi Liam! It's awesome to hear that you're finding the sessions helpful and that you're getting the hang of planning your future. I'm glad to be part of your journey! The application strategy is all about having a clear plan when you're applying to schools. For me, it was a bit of a learning curve since I was the first in my family to head to university. I had to do a lot of research on my own, chat with friends already in college, and get advice from my school's guidance counselor. Nowadays, it's streamlined with Education Planner BC, where you can apply to multiple universities in BC from one platform. It's a game-changer and should make things a bit smoother for you when the time comes. Also, how was your weekend? Did you get any snow last week? And how's school been going? What's your favorite class, and is there one you don't like as much? Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2024-04-03, 06:52: Hi Liam! Welcome back! I hope you had an awesome spring break, full of chill vibes and good times. Did you get up to anything exciting or discover any new hobbies? Now that we're swinging back into our regular routine, I’m here to help you get back on track with any school or planning stuff you’ve got lined up. Let’s catch up soon, maybe share a highlight from your break? And if you’re ready to jump back into our discussions or if you’ve got questions about what’s next, just say the word. Looking forward to hearing from you! Ali Mentee 2024-04-03, 09:31: Hi Ali Hey how was your spring break? anything fun? and I""m doing great in school, i just got done socials unit 1 done, i'm starting this week on unit 2. Thanks for asking. can you remind me of what i have to do now, i""m not sure what i have to do now, what do i have next? My favorite class is probably sciance and i dont really like socials but thats it. Kind Regards Liam Mentor 2024-04-04, 08:23: Hi Liam! Thanks for touching base! My spring break was jam packed with studying. I have final exams coming up so I was in the library most of the time. It's fantastic to hear you're doing great in school and already diving into unit 2 in socials. Even if socials isn't your cup of tea, getting through unit 1 is a big step! If you find yourself needing a bit of a hand or some clarification on concepts in unit 2, don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be happy to help where I can. Science being your favorite doesn't surprise me, it's my favorite too! Now, as for our mentorship program, we've wrapped up the ""Post Secondary &amp; Career Planning"" unit. So, it's time to think about what's next. What unit would you like to explore now? Cheers, Ali Mentee 2024-04-09, 10:02: Hi Ali That's sounds like a lot of work, what are you studying on? and thank you for filling me in i would like to start on (Paying for School) that would be great. I will let you know if i need any help. Warm Regards Liam",,"Mentor 2023-12-01, 10:58: Hi Liam, It was fantastic meeting with you over Zoom yesterday! I really appreciated hearing about your life in Tatla Lake. It's quite remarkable to learn that the closest grocery store is a 3-hour drive away. That must take a lot of planning and self-reliance, which is truly impressive. I'm eagerly looking forward to our next meeting, especially to see your artwork. It'll be wonderful to see your creative expression. We'll also dive into some career building, which I'm sure will be enlightening. I've opened up the Career Exploration unit for you. In this unit, I'd like you to focus on identifying what's most important to you in a career. Think about your values, interests, and the lifestyle you envision for yourself. We'll use this as a foundation to explore various career paths and see which ones align best with your personal goals and values. Remember, this is a journey of discovery, and I'm here to guide and support you along the way. Keep up the great work, Liam, and I'll see you soon! Kind Regards, Ali Mentee 2023-12-05, 09:33: Hi Ali Thank you so much for opening the career exploration. i'll start it right away, yeah the meeting last time was great, im glad we got to talk about stuff in the meeting then over email. Thank you again. Warm Regards Liam Mentee 2023-12-05, 09:33:  Mentee 2023-12-05, 09:34: Hi Ali I have a question can we ask personal questions like how tall are you and birthdays, im just wondering. Liam Mentee 2023-12-06, 13:53: Hi Ali Heres my career exploration. Liam Mentee 2023-12-06, 13:54:  Mentor 2023-12-07, 12:28: Hi Liam, Great work on the Career Exploration activity! It's super to see you're thinking about a variety of paths for your future. Becoming an archaeologist sounds fascinating, doesn't it? If you're keen to learn more about history and uncovering ancient stories, we can definitely dig deeper into this field. Your interest in software engineering is equally exciting. It’s a field that combines creativity with logic, and if that's where your dreams are, I'm here to help you map out the journey. As for playing in the NBA, your love for basketball shines through, and that’s a solid foundation to build on. It's a tough road, but determination goes a long way, and I believe in you. The artistic talent you've got is something to be proud of. Watercolor painting is a skill not everyone masters, and I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing your work. Let’s plan out your next steps in our upcoming meeting. Whether it's past civilizations, tech, sports, or the arts, we'll explore what makes the most sense for you and how to get there. Keep up the excellent work! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-12-07, 12:37: Hey Liam, For your Lesson 1 activity in our 'Career Exploration' unit, it's movie time! You've got some cool videos to check out about different jobs in hospitals and clinics. Think of it as a sneak peek into a day in the life of people who help others stay healthy. Watch a bunch if you can. Each story is a chance to see what makes these folks love their jobs so much. Maybe you'll find something that makes you say, ""Hey, that's kinda awesome!"" After you're done watching, let's chat about it. Here's what I'm curious to hear about: • What's super important to you and why? • How do you want to help out around town or even the big wide world? • Let your imagination run wild—what kind of job would be super cool to have? Think about mixing things you love, like sports, tech, or art, with helping people stay healthy. I can't wait to hear what you think. And if you've got questions or want to bounce around job ideas, I'm all ears! See you soon, Ali Mentee 2023-12-08, 11:29: Hi Ali Heres my lesson 1 career exploration i really think these careers are going to be really fun. Liam Mentor 2023-12-10, 12:53: Hey Liam, Your insights from those videos are spot-on, and it's super to see you thinking deeply about what you want in a career. Valuing your personal time is key, and it's great that you're aiming for a career that respects that. Your vision for contributing to your town is incredibly thoughtful. A rec center and improved healthcare facilities would be a game-changer for the folks at home. It's amazing how you're already thinking about combining community and wellness. The mix of doctor and software engineer? That's a brilliant blend. Did you know fields like radiology and medical genetics are really into tech? Having a handle on coding can open doors in those areas, where technology is huge for diagnosing and treating patients. So your coding chops could really set you apart in medicine. Let's keep the ball rolling on these ideas, Liam. You've got a knack for envisioning a career that's fulfilling and balanced. I'm excited to brainstorm more about this with you. Cheers, Ali Mentor 2023-12-10, 13:09: Hi Liam, It's time for Lesson 2, and you've got a neat challenge ahead! You're going to play detective with your own talents and dreams by taking a career quiz! There are three quizzes: Abilities, Work Preferences, and Interests. Pick at least one to start, but hey, if you're up for it, why not try all three? The more you do, the clearer the picture you'll get about what jobs might make you jump out of bed in the morning, excited to start the day. After you're done with the quizzes, it's time to dive into some deep-thinking disucssion questions! • Think about what's super important to you in a job. • Dream about how you'd like to make a splash in your town or even the world. • Cook up some career ideas that mix your skills and passions. And you know what? You can even grill me about my career choices. Ever wonder why I chose my path, or if I've ever wanted to do something totally different? Ask away! Can't wait to see what you find out about yourself. Remember, there's no right or wrong answer—just what feels right for you. Catch you after the quiz, Ali Mentee 2023-12-12, 09:58: Hi Ali Thank you, heres the career exploration lesson 2 , i hope you like it Liam Mentee 2023-12-12, 09:58:  Mentor 2023-12-14, 22:01: Hey Liam, Thanks for sending over your thoughts from Lesson 2 of the career exploration. It's really cool to see how much thought you're putting into this. Having time for yourself is a big deal, and it's great that you're looking for a job that fits with that. A lot of people end up wishing they'd thought about that more, so you're ahead of the game there. Your ideas for making a difference in your town and the world are super inspiring. Building a rec center and a home for the elderly would mean so much to your community. And cleaning up pollution in the water? That's a huge goal, and the world definitely needs people who want to tackle big problems like that. The career ideas you've cooked up—firefighter, software engineer, artist, athlete, healthcare worker—they're all about action and helping others. That's a fantastic mix and shows you're someone who wants to be on the move and make things better for people. Can't wait to talk more about all of this and see how we can turn these ideas into a plan that works for you. Kind Regards, Ali Ghafoor Mentor 2023-12-14, 22:07: Great job wrapping up the career exploration unit! You've put some solid thought into your future, and it's been fantastic to see. Now that we're moving on, what's got you curious? There are plenty of other units to dive into, so let me know what's catching your eye, and we'll jump right in. Also, there's a survey about the career exploration unit. It's totally up to you, but if you want to give feedback on whether it was helpful, go for it. It could shape how the unit helps other students like you in the future. And hey, how are you doing in general? School going okay? If there's anything new you've been wanting to talk about or need a hand with, I'm here. Plus, I'd love to hear what you've got planned for the Christmas break! Let's also find some time for a Zoom chat soon. It's always good to catch up face-to-face, even if it's through a screen. Looking forward to hearing from you, Ali Mentee 2023-12-19, 13:17: Hi Ali Sorry it been a while since we talked, i've been really busy but i got cought up on math and im done english, I'm doing great and what about you how have you been? I'm really curious in the software engineering, it gives me lots of time in the day, and i only have to work for 3 to 2 hours, so i get too work on lots of diffrent things like my hobbies. but yeah we should start a nother call sometime survey about the career exploration unit. i would like to start on that. Warm regards Liam Mentor 2024-01-07, 20:22: Hi Liam, Happy New Year! I hope you had a relaxing winter break filled with fun and maybe a little bit of adventure. ?? It's been a little while since we last caught up, and I'm excited to hear all about what you got up to during the holidays. Did you do anything exciting or try something new? Also, I'm looking forward to getting back into our sessions. Have you had a chance to think about which unit you'd like to dive into next? Just let me know, and I'll get it set up for us. Can't wait to catch up and hear all about your break and what's ahead for you this year. Kind Regards, Ali Mentee 2024-01-17, 09:31: Hi Ali Sorry i havent been responding to you but how are you doing? i have been really busy, but i'm done the Career Exploration unit so i would like to move on to the Post-secondary and Career Planning unit, next please. Warm Regards Liam Mentee 2024-01-23, 09:41: Hi Ali Wow thank you i'll get started right away, you have been vary helpful though this i hope to keep going. Thanks Liam",,,"Mentor 2023-10-11, 15:16: Hey Liam, I hope this note finds you well! I’m Ali, and I’m really looking forward to being your mentor. It’s going to be a fantastic adventure where we can share, learn, and grow together. Here’s a bit about me: I’m currently studying nursing at UFV. I was drawn to nursing because I love both the science of medicine and the human connection that comes with caring for others. Before this, I pursued microbiology and immunology at UBC with a focus on research. However, witnessing the heroics of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic inspired me to shift my path towards nursing! Although nursing keeps me busy, I still explore the world of research through a position at the UBC hospital. It’s fascinating to see how research directly influences patient care. Beyond academics, I love staying active to unwind. Hitting the gym and playing basketball have been my go-to activities. Basketball was a huge part of my high school life, and I even got to celebrate a provincial title! I saw on your profile that you're into health and fitness too, which is awesome. Did a particular sport spark your interest in fitness? I also noticed your aspiration to attend a reputable university. That’s a commendable goal, and having navigated through university admissions myself, I’ve collected some insights that might be helpful. We can work together to fine-tune your university applications, explore subjects that catch your eye, and address any areas you’d like to improve on to ensure you’re well-prepared for university life. I’m really interested to learn more about the fields of study you’re considering and any specific universities you have in mind. To kickstart our mentorship, I thought it’d be great to engage in a 'get-to-know-you' activity. Here are a couple of fun options: I Am From Poem: Create your own verses inspired by George Ella Lyon’s poem to share about your background, culture, and community. Photo Swap Activity: We exchange photos that hold special meaning to us and explore the stories behind them. Which one catches your eye? Once we choose, we’ll delve into some interesting discussion questions! This is a chance for us to start sharing our stories, and I’m truly looking forward to it. I’m here to listen to any thoughts, concerns, or excitements you have as we embark on this mentorship. There’s a ton to explore together, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Eagerly awaiting our first interaction and the many enriching conversations to follow! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-10-20, 16:37: Hey Liam, Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to touch base since it's been a little while since my first message. I know life can get busy, so no worries if you haven't had a chance to respond yet. I'm here to support you in any way that you find helpful — academically, career-wise, or even just as someone to talk to. When you get a chance, I'd love to hear more about what you're looking for in this mentorship. Looking forward to hearing from you soon and diving into our first unit together! Warm Regards, Ali Mentee 2023-10-24, 08:45: Hi how are you doing, Mentee 2023-10-24, 09:38: Hello my name is Liam, im doing great by the way and sorry its been a while i was pretty busy but i also just found out how to use the messageing thing, im vary excited to start on the mentoring i wonder how much this will help me, i like doing a variety of sports basketball is my main sport but i do hockey and baseball thats the activitys i like doing and i go to the gym as well when i can buttheres no gym out in tatla lake so i do alot of it in my house. Whats your favorite things to do. Kind Regards, Liam Mentor 2023-10-26, 23:51: Hi Liam, Thank you for taking the time to respond! It sounds like you have a strong passion for sports, especially basketball. It's truly awesome to have multiple sports under your belt, like hockey and baseball. And it's commendable how you've adapted to staying fit even without a gym nearby in Tatla Lake. To answer your question, apart from playing basketball and spending time at the gym, my favorite pastimes is hanging out with my pet birds. They bring so much joy! And between you and me, I've mastered the art of bribing them with treats to stay on my good side. I also love hiking; being amidst nature always rejuvenates me. Do you have any pets or favorite places you like to visit to relax? And don't worry about the messaging; it's always a bit of a learning curve when starting on a new platform. I'm glad we've connected now. As for the 'get-to-know-you' activities I mentioned earlier, do either the ""I Am From Poem"" or ""Photo Swap Activity"" resonate with you? It would be a great way for us to share more about ourselves. Remember, I'm here to support you in any way you find beneficial, so feel free to share any thoughts or questions you might have. Looking forward to our next conversation! Warm regards, Ali Mentor 2023-11-14, 22:08: Hi Liam, I hope you're doing well! I noticed it's been a bit since we last connected on the mentorship platform. Just wanted to reach out and see how things are going on your end. I understand life can be quite busy, and checking in on the platform might not always be top of mind – totally get that. Also, I thought it might be great to schedule a virtual chat soon. It’d be a fantastic way for us to connect more personally and kickstart our conversations. If you could let me know a day and time that works for you, we can set something up that fits into your schedule. I’m pretty flexible, so feel free to suggest whatever works best for you. Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-11-14, 22:09:  Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:02: Hi Ali My i am poem is attached. Liam Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:21: Hi Ali Its nice to hear from you and for your question i want to traval all over the world and see new things thats what i want to do but the first place i would want to go is italy. yes i do have a lot of pets but thats because i live on a ranch , i have two cats, seven dogs and horses it gets really busy up here. Why did you stard mentoring? and what types of birds do you like and have. Warm Regards. Liam Mentor 2023-11-16, 20:37: Hey Liam, Thanks for sharing your poem and a bit about your life – it's been great getting to know you. The imagery of your environment - the trees in your backyard, the tallest hill with the little grey house, and the dandy lions in the grass - brings to life the rustic and natural setting of your ranch. It sounds like a place full of life and close to nature, which must be incredibly inspiring. Your adventures on the ranch and your dreams of traveling, like to Italy, sound amazing. The way you describe your surroundings really brings your world to life. I have a couple of budgies named Rocky and Ruby. They’re quite the characters! How about your ranch animals? Any favorites among your pets? As for why I started mentoring, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences to help others grow and achieve their goals. Being a mentor allows me to connect with amazing individuals like you, offering guidance, support, and a listening ear. Plus, it's always rewarding to see someone flourish and pursue their dreams. On a different note, I'd love to set up a time for us to have a virtual chat. Could you let me know when you’re usually free? It'd be great to talk more in-depth and get to know each other better. Kind Regards, Ali Ghafoor Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:17: Hi Ali Im glad that im getting to know you as well, thats really cool that you have two birds, Ruby and Rocky are great names but can you tell me what a budgie is?, is it a breed? I think my favorite animal is the cows or the horses, thecows are really nice and so are the horses. im free mostly on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the video call. I am sending a word document with my In the eye of the beholder reflection. I will finish the icebreaker activty this morning and would like to start the Rural to City unit. Can you unlock it please? Warm Regards Liam peterson Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:39: here is my Words to Live By Mentor 2023-11-22, 17:35: Hi Liam, It's great to hear back from you! Budgies are a small parrot species originally from Australia. They're really social and known for their vibrant colors and chirpy songs. Ruby and Rocky keep things lively around here! It's wonderful to know you're fond of cows and horses. They're such gentle and majestic animals. Your interest in nature and animals shines through in your ""In the Eye of the Beholder"" reflection. The way you describe the vibrant colors and the serenity of nature really paints a vivid picture. It's fantastic that you enjoy hiking with your dogs and even camping out. Those must be some amazing adventures! Thanks also for sharing your ""Words to Live By"" from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" That's a classic movie with lots of memorable moments! The quote you chose is a great reminder to stay active and engaged in life. It's easy to get caught up in routines and miss the extraordinary things happening around us. It seems to tie in really well with your love for nature and exploring the outdoors. I'm curious, are there any specific experiences or adventures you've had that made this quote particularly meaningful for you? It's always interesting to hear how certain words resonate with us based on our personal experiences. Regarding our video calls, I'm free all day on Thursday, November 28th, so feel free to pick a time that works best for you on that day. If Thursday doesn't suit you, I'm also available on Tuesday, December 5th. Just let me know what time on either of those days fits into your schedule. If neither of these days works for you, don't worry – we can definitely find another date that suits both of us. I've unlocked the ""Rural to City"" unit for you. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it! Kind Regards, Ali Mentee 2023-11-27, 09:41: Hi Ali I forgot to ask but do you where you were born and did you grow up in the city or coutry? If you are from a city: How has your experiences differed than mine? In what ways are they similar? If you are from a rural community: How have you been able to leverage the strengths you gained from having a rural background? In what ways has being from a rural community benefitted you? Liam Mentee 2023-11-28, 08:55: HI Ali Heres my rural to city dicussion. Liam Mentee 2023-11-28, 10:35: Hi Liam and Ali, So glad that you were able to schedule a video call. Here is a Zoom link for you to use. Link: https://ubc.zoom.us/j/62522397794?pwd=V3o2enRURzlRbThhWVp4eDd3MTEwdz09 Password: 987431 It says it's for my (Juliet's) zoom room, but I set it up so you can use it without me (I hope). If you run into problems, please email me. Thanks and have a great time chatting! Juliet from the eMentoring team Mentor 2023-11-29, 21:53: Hi Liam, Thank you for sharing your thoughts and asking about my background and it's great to hear your insights from the ""Rural to City"" discussion. Your observations and questions are very thoughtful. Like you, I have lived in both rural and urban settings, which has given me a unique perspective. I was born in Afghanistan but moved to Canada at a very young age, growing up in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto is a bustling city, alive with energy and activity. However, for me, the fast pace and constant busyness were a bit overwhelming. I've always been drawn to the tranquility and closeness to nature that rural areas offer. In 2008, my family and I moved to Abbotsford in British Columbia, a place that beautifully blends city and farmland. It's surrounded by stunning nature, yet close to essential amenities – a perfect mix of urban convenience and rural serenity. This environment feels like having the best of both worlds, similar to your preference for rural areas over the city's loudness and density. Your observations about city life are spot on. Cities provide more job opportunities, cultural experiences, and various amenities. However, the cost of living is indeed higher, and the pace can be daunting. To adapt to city life, exploring local neighborhoods, trying different transportation modes, and joining community groups can be very helpful. Also, finding quiet spots like parks or libraries can offer a peaceful refuge. When I moved from Toronto to Abbotsford, I was struck by the strong community feel, closer nature connection, and the slower pace of life. Though there were challenges, like fewer entertainment options and a more limited job market, the peace and space greatly compensated for these changes. Moving brought a mix of excitement and nervousness, but I managed by staying open to new experiences, keeping in touch with loved ones, and appreciating my new home's unique qualities. I admire your thoughtful processing of these different environments and what they mean to you, Liam. Your preference for the quiet and freedom of rural life resonates with my experiences. I'm curious, how do you envision your future living environment? Do you see yourself in a rural setting long-term, or do you have aspirations to explore city life more extensively? Looking forward to our chat tomorrow! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-11-29, 21:54: Hi Juliet, Thank you very much for setting this up! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-11-29, 22:01: Hi Liam, I'm excited for our call on Thursday too! It's fantastic that you have such fond memories of Victoria, especially all those bike rides. It's great how different places offer different experiences and adventures. And definitely, getting back into biking sounds like a fun idea! About living in a city, I know quite a bit! Cities are lively with energy, with lots of people and a variety of activities. You'll find diverse restaurants, museums, parks, and theaters. The convenience of having everything nearby is a big plus. However, it can sometimes be noisy and crowded. Each city has its unique charm and challenges. I've unlocked the career exploration unit for you. As you go through it, think about this: If you could create your ideal job, combining your love for the outdoors and the new skills you might discover in the unit, what would that job look like? This could be a fun way to explore the possibilities that align with your interests and passions. Looking forward to catching up tomorrow. If there's anything else you want to know or talk about, just let me know! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2023-12-07, 12:03: Hi Liam, It's great that you're starting on the Career Exploration unit. I think you’ll find plenty of valuable insights there. I really enjoyed our recent Zoom conversation. It adds so much to our communication, doesn’t it? Regarding your question, it’s absolutely okay to ask about things like height or birthdays. To answer you, I'm 6ft tall, and my birthday is on August 3rd. Feel free to share yours too if you'd like! It's these little personal details that help us get to know each other better. Looking forward to our next meeting and seeing the art you’ve been working on. Your creativity is always a highlight for me. Best, Ali Mentor 2023-12-14, 22:00: Hey Liam, Thanks for sending over your thoughts from Lesson 2 of the career exploration. It's really cool to see how much thought you're putting into this. Having time for yourself is a big deal, and it's great that you're looking for a job that fits with that. A lot of people end up wishing they'd thought about that more, so you're ahead of the game there. Your ideas for making a difference in your town and the world are super inspiring. Building a rec center and a home for the elderly would mean so much to your community. And cleaning up pollution in the water? That's a huge goal, and the world definitely needs people who want to tackle big problems like that. The career ideas you've cooked up—firefighter, software engineer, artist, athlete, healthcare worker—they're all about action and helping others. That's a fantastic mix and shows you're someone who wants to be on the move and make things better for people. Can't wait to talk more about all of this and see how we can turn these ideas into a plan that works for you. Kind Regards, Ali Ghafoor Mentor 2024-01-22, 22:56: Hi Liam! No problem at all, I completely understand that things can get hectic! I'm glad we're reconnecting now. I've been doing well, staying busy on my end too. How about you? How's school going, and did you manage to find some time for fun over the break? Anything new or interesting happen? Great to hear you're ready to jump into the Post-secondary and Career Planning unit. It's a perfect next step after your thorough work in the Career Exploration unit. I think you'll find it quite valuable as it digs into the nitty-gritty of planning your future steps. As always, I'm here if you have any questions, need some guidance, or just want to chat about how things are going. Feel free to share any new thoughts or experiences you've had lately—I'm all ears! Take care, and I'm looking forward to our discussions as you tackle the new unit! Kind Regards, Ali Mentor 2024-01-24, 21:38: Hey Liam, You're very welcome! It's been a joy to be a part of your journey, and I'm just as excited as you are to keep going. Remember, I'm here whenever you need guidance, support, or just want to bounce ideas around. Cheers, Ali Mentor 2024-01-31, 18:40: Hey Liam, Thanks for sending over your initial thoughts on the warm-up activity. Taking some time to travel right after high school is an exciting idea! It's a great way to experience new cultures, gain some life experience, and maybe even get inspired about your future studies in computer science. When you're ready to fill in the rest, I'll be here to discuss any of the ideas or plans you're considering. Plus, if you want to start thinking about universities for computer science or how to make the most of your travels, we can definitely dive into that together. Looking forward to hearing more about your plans as you work through the unit. Take care, Ali Mentee 2024-02-02, 12:15: Hi Ali I just finished the post secoundery and career planning, for lesson 2. Now i think its the right one but if it looks wierd then just let me know problably not the right one. k thanks liam Mentor 2024-02-08, 19:05: Hey Liam, Thanks for your message and for sending over your work on lesson 2 of the post-secondary and career planning unit. It looks like the document came through empty. No worries at all, it happens sometimes! You might have attached the wrong file by mistake. When you get a chance, could you double-check and resend the right document? I'm looking forward to seeing what you've put together. If you run into any trouble with it, I'm here to help out however I can. Just give me a shout. Thanks, and talk soon, Ali Ghafoor Mentor 2024-02-08, 19:17: Hi Liam! I'm glad you're curious about my routine! My days start pretty early—I'm usually up by 5:30 am on weekdays to get in a good workout at the gym before the day kicks off. It helps me stay energized for the rest of the day. My schedule's pretty packed with school from Monday to Wednesday. Then on Thursday and Friday, I switch gears and work at the hospital. Because of that, my best time to catch up on emails and messages is usually in the morning. But on days when the morning rush doesn't give me a moment to breathe, I'll sit down in the evening to make sure I get back to everyone, including you. Hope this helps you know when you can expect to hear from me. Looking forward to your next message and that document when you have a chance to resend it! Cheers, Ali Mentor 2024-02-14, 13:51: Hey Liam, Great job on Lesson 2! You've got a clear view of why college is a smart move – better job chances, key life skills, and making friends. Spot on. Your career picks are cool and ambitious. Graphic art and design engineering are all about creativity and tech – solid choice! And aiming for the NBA is a big dream with big rewards. For graphic art and design, six years might sound like a lot, but with your interests in bio, engineering, and science, you'll be busy building a diverse skill set. As for basketball, sure it's competitive, but your drive counts for a lot. By the way, with your NBA dreams, who's your top team? Got a player you look up to? Remember, challenges are just steps on the way up. Keep pushing, stay flexible, and use your passion as fuel. I'm here to chat strategy or anyting that's on your mind at anytime. If you also want to have a vritual meet through zoom again, we can arrange that as well. My birds want to say hi again. Can't wait to see where you go from here, Liam. Best, Ali","Mentee 2023-11-23, 12:14: Heres my reflection on living in a rural community. i'll have a look at the next units and decide today. Liam Mentor 2023-11-23, 21:08: Hi Liam, Thank you for sharing your reflections on living in a rural community. Your description of Tatla Lake paints a vivid picture of a serene and close-knit community. It's impressive how you appreciate the beauty and tranquility of your surroundings, and it's clear that you've developed a strong connection with nature and your community. Your insights into the challenges, especially regarding employment opportunities, are thoughtful. It's a common issue in many rural areas and something that's important to acknowledge. I'm also intrigued by your hobbies and extracurricular activities. Playing sports like basketball and football, and being musically talented with the guitar and piano, shows a well-rounded set of interests and skills. It's great to see you engaging in such diverse activities. Your strengths, as you described – self-sufficiency, grit, artistic talent, and patience – are indeed valuable. These qualities not only make you a well-adapted individual in a rural setting but will also serve you well in any future educational or career endeavors. The idea of building a care home and a recreational center for your community is commendable. It shows your forward-thinking mindset and your desire to give back to your community. This kind of vision is what makes a true difference in the world. As you look into the next activities and units, consider how the skills and values you've developed in your rural environment can be applied in different contexts, be it in education, career, or community service. Your experiences and perspectives are unique and can offer a lot in various settings. Looking forward to hearing about your choice for the next unit and discussing it further. Also, have you decided which day would work best for the video chat? I am free all day on Thursday, November 28th and I'm also available on Tuesday, December 5th. Just let me know what time on either of those days fits into your schedule. Kind regards, Ali Mentee 2023-11-24, 08:31: Hi Ali Thank you for opening it for me, im glad im starting to catch up andstart doing more. And yes i had lots of fun adventures most of thoughs are with my friends we would go for bike rides all over my home town thats when i was in victoria and we would go to the corner store and buy some snacks. how is it like living in a city? i know a bit, but i mostly lived by the city not in it. Thats amazing how your parrots can sing a song, i wonder whats it like having a parrot it must be fun. for the video call i'll be free Thursday i still have to talk to me teacher about it though so i'll let you know i we can. Thank you again Warm Regards Liam Mentee 2023-11-24, 12:11: Hey Ali i have a question, what time should we start the video call on thursday? Mentor 2023-11-24, 13:32: Hi Liam, It's wonderful to hear that you're engaging more with the units and making good progress. Your adventures in Victoria sound delightful, especially the bike rides with friends and the simple joys of visiting a corner store for snacks. Those experiences create lasting memories. Living in a city has its own unique set of experiences. It's bustling and lively, with a lot of diversity and opportunities to explore different cultures, cuisines, and activities. However, it can also be quite fast-paced and noisy compared to the peacefullness of rural areas. Each environment has its own charm and challenges. Regarding the parrots, yes, having Ruby and Rocky is a lot of fun. They're quite the characters with their singing and playful antics. It's like having a little piece of the vibrant outdoors right at home! I'm glad Thursday works for our video call. Would 12:00pm be a suitable time for you? Please confirm with your teacher and let me know if this time works or if we need to adjust it. I'm flexible, so we can find a time that suits your schedule. Looking forward to our discussion on Thursday. Keep up the great work! Kind Regards, Ali Mentee 2023-11-27, 09:26: Hi Ali And yes i'm free when ever this week, thursday is a great time, im looking forward into doing that call. I have made a lot of memories in Victoria i really liked it there caz of alll the bike rides almost every day it was so fun but i like it up here to i really want to start biking again. But what do you already know about living in a city? Warm Regards. Liam Mentee 2023-11-28, 09:00: Hi Ali Can you open up the career exploration unit please.

Unfortunately next week won't work for the zoom, unfortunately I'm working Monday-Friday 6:00am to 6 pm! The surgery schedule is unfortunately busy :( but hopefully we can get started on this unit and then the following week I night have a bit more spare time! Hope you're having a good day! Thanks, Kira Mentee 2023-11-30, 09:46: Hi Kira, Here is the Warm up for Career Exploration. I wasn't to sure of what to do so I just wrote about my vet life at home. I hope you like it, Jade Mentor 2023-11-30, 16:39: Hey Jade, Thanks so much for starting the Warm Up! It looks great, I really enjoyed reading it! That's cool that you've gotten to try some vet activities already! Have you had the chance to watch the videos in career exploration yet? Once you watch them, I think you're supposed to answer the following questions. SHARE: with your mentor your responses to ALL of the following prompts: What do you value in life? How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? Sounds like you already started the third one! A vetrinarian is a great idea for incorporating your love of animals! Thanks Jade! Hope you're having a good day! Kira Mentee 2023-12-13, 11:22: Hey Kira, Do you know a vet that I can talk to for the Career Exploration thing? P.S. How are you doing Talk soon Jade Mentee 2023-12-15, 09:29: Hi Kira, Ya, I'm in school next week, and I will try to get in conntact with a vet. Since we don't have a vet where I live, I'll try and talk to the one in the town next door. Winter break strats on the 25th, so I'll be free almost all week, send me the best time for you. I'm alittle exited for the break, but we don't have any plans. Can't wait to talk to you, Jade Mentee 2024-01-15, 10:00: Hi Kira, Sorry I haven't messaged in awhile. I'm determaned to finnish G.8 Anyway, how did you choose your career? Sorry again, Jade Mentor 2024-01-15, 18:20: Hey Jade, No worries! Nice to hear from you! Are you excited to finish grade 8? How's school going? Did you have a good winter break? What a good question! Choosing a career can be really really hard for sure, it can seem like a lot of pressure! I always really liked working with people, problem solving, and I loved science; especially chemistry and human biology. I've always like understanding how things worked, for example, when I was in high school, I remember loving my biology 10 class where we learned the mechanical process behind breathing, and how oxygen got into our lungs and into our bloodstream. This made me think that I might like to do something with the human body! Because I liked figuring stuff out and problem solving, I became interested in medical school, because being a doctor is kind of like being a detective, figuring out what is wrong with someone and how we can fix it! I then applied to the Rural Pre-Medicine Program in my small town, and then I applied to med, and the rest is history! So my advice to you is try figure out what kind of things you like! What could you like to do every day? Is there anything that you are particularly passionate about or interested in? Hopefully that will help some! Any other specific questions? Nice to hear from you! Kira :) Mentee 2024-01-16, 09:19: Hi Kira, Thanks for your answer, it was great. That must have been a lot of work. I think I told you this earlier, I can't quite remember, but I want to be a vet. When I do something vet related, I feel like I'm where I belong. I found a vet to ask those questions to, ( this might get complicated! ) My dad's friend's son's wife. She is really nice. She came up for Christmas/New Years and helpped me with a problem I had with my cat, her husband is also a vet. Any way, I hope you're have a great day! Jade Mentee 2024-01-16, 10:13: Hey Kira, I finnished Career exploration, so what unit should we do next? have a good day, Jade Mentee 2024-01-17, 09:30: Hi Kira, I got the anwers back from the vet I emailed, and I learned a lot. I hope we can get to do a zoom meeting some time. Have a great day, Jade Mentor 2024-01-17, 10:41: Hey Jade, That's awesome! It's so cool that you already have a head start and know what you want to do! Have you thought about planning your high school classes towards that goal of becoming a vet yet? Glad you got the answers you were looking for from the vet! Did you figure out what kind of degree they had beforehand? The vet school is in Saskatchewan, right? One girl that I went to undergrad with in the Kootenays at the RPM program recently got into vet school! I'm not sure the facetime will work soon, I'm working Monday through Friday and you can only do during school hours, right? We can do whatever unit you want next! Do you have any preference? I can unlock whichever one you like! Thanks! Hope you're having a good day! Kira Mentee 2024-01-17, 10:55: Hi Kira, My teacher thinks we should do From Rural To Urban next so I guess we can do that one next. The vet said she got a Science Degree, whitch makes sence since she is a vet. For high school I'm going to do a lot of Biology, Chemistry and Math. Ya, I could try to log in to my school email from home so I can have the zoom link there, I'll get back ot you on that either tomorrow or the next day. If that works, would you have time on Saturday to do a zoom? I mean that's only if I can get get the zoom link at home. I could email it to myself! Yes I will do that. Well have a great day, Jade",,"Mentee 2024-02-02, 11:32: Hi Kira, Thanks for oppening the next Unit. I can zoom on Saturdays now, not Sunddays though. Hope your having a good day, Jade Mentee 2024-02-02, 16:03: Hi Kira, I'm free this Saturday if you'd want to zoom. Hope you are doing well, Jade Mentee 2024-02-05, 09:21: Hi Kira, I hope you are doing great. I can zoom Sat. now. Jade Mentee 2024-02-28, 10:50: Hi Kira, I can't do paying for school lesson 2 because I'm not eligible for any. Sorry Jade","Mentee 2023-10-04, 11:42: Hi Kira, I'm Jade. I can't wait to get to know you better. How are you doing? Mentor 2023-10-05, 16:07: Hey Jade, Nice to meet you! I'm Kira, I'm a third year medical student at the University of British Columbia. I currently am living and studying in Vancouver, but I was born and raised in Nelson BC. I'm a big fan of hiking, volleyball, camping, and basically doing anything outside! I did my undergraduate degree at Selkirk College's Rural Pre-Medicine program in Castlegar BC. It's a three year program, which I graduated from in 2021. I started medical school in the fall of 2021, and I'm currently in my clinical year, rotating through different hospitals across the lower mainland. I used to be a mentee when I was in high school/college, and now I work as a mentor for rural students. This program is pretty cool (in my opinion), it's really run by the students! So you get out of it whatever you put into it. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you can decide how these meetings go! If you want to meet up and chat over zoom, that works! If you want to complete these modules, sounds great! If you have a whole bunch of questions about medical school, university, what it's like moving to a big city, how to pay for undergrad, scholarships, the MCAT, really whatever you might think of, I will do my best to answer! Could you please tell me a little bit about yourself? What grade are you in? What do you like to do for fun? What are you hoping to get out of this mentorship/how can I best help you? Hope you're having a great day! Kira Mentee 2023-10-10, 10:29: Hi Kira I'm in grade 8 I realy love reading books and beeing with my animals. I am hoping to learn how to wavebord. i've nly done it once, but it was so fun! What are your favorite animals? I like platypus,orcas, aye ayes, pandas, in short I realy just love any animal. ( exept mosquitos ) Jade Mentor 2023-10-10, 11:33: Hey Jade, Grade 8? That's so cool! What's your favourite subject? I really like reading books too. What kind of animals do you have? My favourite animals are probably giraffes, sloths, and baby cows! They are so cute. I also really hate mosquitos. I had to google what an aye ayes was, I've never heard of it before! Do you know what you want to do when you grow up? Hope you're having a good day! Kira :) Mentee 2023-10-10, 12:14: Hi Kira My favorite subject is math or sicence. Math is easy for me so I like it. I have cats, dogs, fish, and chickens. My dad has a Rottweiler named Paro. ( we didn't name him ) I didn't know what an Aye aye was ether till I saw a picture of one resently. I loooooooove Highland cows! They are so cute and fluffy. A friend of mine's land lord ha s some. I have my heart set on being a vet when I'm older. Il ove helping animals. At home I have to do all the vetty kind of stuff, because my family can't realy deal with boold and stuff. I had to remove stickes once from my horse's head, we lived to far from the vet clinic for them to do it. And I got to give Paro a shot once. I like doing vet stuff. I t makes me feel like I'm getting practice. Do you want to set up a zoom meeting? Can't wait to talk to you again Jade Mentor 2023-10-18, 19:19: Hey Jade, Sorry for the delay! I think theres been a glitch in the system, because my replies don't seem to be sending! Hopefully this one goes through! That's so cool about your love of animals! Definitely all the makings for a good vet! And you're getting your practice in early! We could definitely try to meet over zoom, what is your schedule like? Yes, Highland cows are soooooo cute! Do you know where you want to live? Like, in the big city or somewhere in a smaller town? Do you also want to try working through one of the units there? Are there any that jump out at you? Let me know what you're thinking! Thanks so much! Kira :) Mentee 2023-10-19, 11:24: Hi Kira, I could only read your message through my emails, I can't see them on the e-mentor platform. I would love to start on of the units! I think I'll be be free Wednesday next week, if that works for you, I can send youa more spisific time. I realy like living in a smaller town, more peace and quite, What about you? I hope we can figure out the problem with the messages, Talk to you soon, Jade Mentor 2023-10-20, 16:39: Hey Jade, That's great news! Maybe just pick whichever one sounds interesting to you, and we can start! If you complete it then it gives us more to talk about :) I'm unfortunately working and I don't know the hours yet for next week! Sorry! Small town living is so nice! What's your favourite part? I grew up in a really small town and lived there for about 21 years, and then moved to Vancouver! Vancouver is a little bit too big for my liking, and I love going back home to visit my friends and family and dog! Plus, I love hiking and camping, which is MUCH easier in the Kootenays. I think we've figured it out now! Please let me know if you haven't heard from me in a while though, because maybe my message hasn't sent if it's been over four days! Hope you're having a good day! Thanks, Kira :) Mentee 2023-10-23, 08:57: Hi Kira, I can still only see your messages from the email I get, I think my favorite part of the small town is that you realy get to know everyone pretty well. You can send me a date and time that fits for you, I'm free to have a zoom meeting any time realy exept Tuseday and Thursday mornings,and the weekends.But apart from that i dosen't realy mater. Do youu want to start Career Exploration? Talk to you soon, Jade Mentor 2023-10-25, 11:25: Hey Jade, Have you watched the tutorial? That could help you see the emails in the website hopefully! I could be free next week after 7 pm. Career Exploration sounds great! The module is on our website here, have you seen it? Hope you're having a good day! Kira :) Mentee 2023-10-27, 11:49: Hi Kira, I don't want to message you to much, so you don't feel lke I'm annoing or somthing. Any way how would Friday next week work for you? For the zomm meeting.

If it dose not I will most likely message you. Hope this works out Jade Mentor 2023-11-05, 11:41: Hey Jade, Sorry I saw this too late! I can meet up tomorrow at some point this week? If that would work for you? Otherwise I'm afraid I'm on a really busy surgery rotation and I wouldn't be able to set up a zoom meeting at any other point this week, sorry! I am always accessible by email though, so whatever you find easier! Let me know your availability. Thanks, Kira Mentee 2023-11-06, 09:18: Hi Kira, I tried, but failed to loge into MentorCity from home, so I can't have a zoom meeting out of the school hours.Sorry! If you have any time next week that would be great, but no presure! Hope we can figure something out, Jade Mentee 2023-11-06, 14:57: Hey Kira, Can you unlock Career Exploration so we can start it? I hope we can find a time to do the zoom!!! Talk soon, Jade Mentee 2023-11-15, 14:53: Hello Kira and Jade, I hope you're both well. It seems the Zoom link I previously sent has expired. If you need to schedule a future Zoom meeting, please don't hesitate to reach out with a date and time that suits you, and we'll be happy to set up a new link for you. Thanks, eMentoring team Mentee 2023-11-30, 12:22: Hi Kira and Jade, As requested, here's your new Zoom link :) Join Zoom Meeting https://ubc.zoom.us/j/64986743168?pwd=RHJ5TjRzYTM0cGlVaUdmQ2p2aU5rZz09 Meeting ID: 649 8674 3168 Passcode: 658492 It says it's for my (Juliet's) zoom room, but I set it up so you can use it without me (I hope). If you run into problems, please email me. Thanks and have a great time chatting! Juliet from the eMentoring team Mentee 2023-12-11, 09:43: Hi Kira! Here is the answers to the questions to the videos. P.S I am also going to travel alot! Tallk soon, P.S.S When is the next time you can do a zoom? See ya Jade Mentor 2023-12-14, 12:44: Hey Jade, I'm really sorry, but I don't know any vets you can talk to! Are there any near where you live? Maybe you can go see them (or call) and ask them if they would be willing to share their email so you can ask them some questions! Or, maybe try googling some local vets and emailing them! I'm doing really well, very busy with work the last couple weeks, sorry for being so distant! I might be able to zoom next week if you're still in school? What's your schedule looking like? Hope you're doing well! It must be almost winter break for you, are you excited? Have any fun plans? Talk soon! Thanks, Kira Mentor 2023-12-20, 14:29: Hey Jade, How is tomorrow around 3? Hope you're doing well! Thanks, Kira Mentor 2024-01-24, 07:55: Hey Jade, No worries! I'm afraid this weekend won't work for me though sorry, I'm on call! Call is when we stay and work at the hospital for 28 hours and stay awake the whole time! So I'm afraid I won't get away. But I'm starting my general surgery rotation which is kind of cool! Those are good questions to ask the vet! I could tell you a little bit about post secondary or scholarships too, if you think that would be helpful! Let me know :) Hope you're having a good day! Thanks, Kira Mentor 2024-02-05, 10:42: Hey Jade, Your entry looks great! Paying for school is definitely a challenge! I had a job throughout high school and college, and I did a lot of volunteering at that time so that I could win scholarships! I was really lucky with scholarships, that paid for pretty much all of my undergrad. Otherwise, I was very lucky because my parents had put some money away for school for me in the form of an RESP. Finally, now that I'm in medical school and school is much much more expensive, I'm using student loans! They also gave me a line of credit for medical school which is kind of like a giant credit card, but I will have to pay the last two options back! For rural medicine, there's a lot of grants and scholarships, and a loan forgiveness program which is pretty cool! Unfortunately I'm on call again this weekend so I can't phone, sorry! General surgery hours we're usually working 6-7 days a week. Hope you're having a good day! Are there any other ones you'd like me to unlock? Thanks, Kira Mentor 2024-03-01, 09:50: Hey Jade, It's nice to hear from you! I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand, is it a problem accessing the content or are you saying you're not yet eligible for scholarships? Thanks, Kira Mentee 2024-03-01, 09:56: Hi Kira, Sorry for the confusion, I'm not eligible for any of the scholarships because of the remote area I live in. Hope your day is going well, sorry again Jade Mentor 2024-03-03, 22:35: Hey Jade, No worries at all! If you'd rather do a different unit, that's totally fine! I do want you to know though, there are a lot of scholarships available for rural and remote students! I funded my entire post secondary career before medical school in rural scholarships! Definitely look into it and speak to your school counsellors; often times local businesses also offer scholarships and many rural kids don't apply! For example, most credit unions have scholarships! Or, if your parents work for certain companies, sometimes they have scholarships for children of the company! For example, my dad works for a mill in the rural town I live in, and the mill offers a scholarship every year for grade twelve students. I know you're not in grade twelve yet, but definitely something to consider! Let me know if you'd like to do a different unit, or if you'd be interested in doing some research into rural scholarships in your area! Hope you're having a good day! Thanks, Kira Mentee 2024-04-03, 09:37: Hi Kira, Sorry for not talking for awile, Could you please open Getting Hired? Thanks, Jade","Mentor 2024-01-20, 10:25: Hey Jade! Just opened up ""From Rural to Urban"" for you! I'm so glad that you were able to find someone to help answer your vet questions! Sorry I couldn't be of more help on that front. What kind of things did you talk about? Bio, chem and math seem like a really good idea for someone interested in veterinary medicine! Were you still wanting to zoom today? Thanks, Kira Mentee 2024-01-22, 10:10: Hi Kira, Sorry I didn't gat back to you about the zoom. I can only check my mentor-messages at school. If we can get a time and date durning the week, we could do it this saturday. I just asked the vet stuff like what was easy and hard about being a vet, or how she paided for the whole thing. I hope you are having a good day, Jade Mentee 2024-01-30, 09:07: Hi Kira, Here are the answers to Rural to Urban lessonn 1 Mentee 2024-01-30, 11:54:  Mentee 2024-01-31, 10:48: Hi Kira, Here are the last things for the Rural to Urban unit, Could you open Paying for school next please? I hope all is well for you, Jade Mentor 2024-02-02, 06:02: Hey Jade, thanks so much! That looks great!! I totally understand how you feel; it can be really hard being away from family and friends! It was really hard to adjust to that when I moved, but now I've made new friends here as well, so that helps make the city a more enjoyable place! Plus you can always visit home while you're living in the city for school! Vet school is in Saskatchewan right? Yes I can definitely unlock the next one for you; great job on the last one! hope you're having a good day! Kira",,"Mentor 2024-04-05, 10:27: Hey Jade, No worries at all! Hope school and everything is going well! Let me know if you have any other questions :) Thanks, Kira Mentee 2024-04-08, 09:14: Hiiiii Here is lesson 1 fromm getting hierd. Mentee 2024-04-08, 09:21: OMG i am soo sorry i forgot to erase my personal information on my resume!!!! is there any way i can unsend it to change it?!??! Mentee 2024-04-08, 09:21:  Mentor 2024-04-10, 16:22: Hey Jade, I'm sorry I'm not sure if there's a way you can take back your post! I won't share it anywhere, and I won't use it myself. As for the content, thank you for all of your hard work! It looks really good! I like your fake vet assistant resume! It's a really good idea to tailor each resume you hand out to the specific job you want! Did you make a real resume or a cover letter for your job you have? If you did, what did you say in it? Also, I was wondering what kind of work you do you do at the local restaurant? I would say that my scariest interview ever was definitely my medical school interview; it's kind of like a job (without getting paid that is!). It took a lot of time to prepare for. Otherwise, another intimidating interview I had was for the fancy restaurant in the small town that I worked in; I definitely felt too young and underqualified, but they ended up giving me the job! Hope you're having a good day! Thanks, Kira",,

Those statistic's about the gender division must have been old they sounded illegitimate. I am curious about the population is it actually 60,000 people? Something interesting I found was when I looked up Goldenbridge it was just on the other side of the chilcotin mountains mountains from where I live. Mentor 2024-02-23, 10:28: Hi Gideon, No worries at all. How was your trip? That sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah your are right. Looks like the number of students last year at UBC was 72,585! So crazy! Looking forward to your next assignment in the Well Beaing and Self-care module. Just wanted to let you know that you are making great progress. After this module you will have one more before you have completed the requirements, and we still have three months to go! Great job Mentee 2024-02-23, 11:43: Show off My town My town is very small. It is subdivided into parts each about half an hour away (2 of them are bigger than the third. The 3 sections are: Tatlayoko (where I live) Tatlayoko is right next to Tatlayoko lake which is in a valley the mountains that form the valley are the coast mountains and the Chilcotin mountains Tatlayoko has a fairly small population some ranchers some people who only come half the year, an interesting thing about Tatlayoko lake is it has world class kitesurfing. (don’t tell anyone) Tatla is a bit further away then 30 mins away and is where I go to school it has the biggest or second biggest population it is hard to tell, there is a store a small restaurant a nursing station and of course the school, the school has twenty some kids, and only a few of them live in Tatla, 6 kids live in Tatlayoko. The rest live in Kleena Kleene which has one of the biggest populations, Kleena Kleene is about half an hour away from Tatla. Tatla is the central place which is why all the critical infrastructure is there. Kleena Kleene is quite big not only population wise but also land wise. I don’t go to Kleena Kleene much but it has quite a variety of terrain, high mountains sweeping green fields and desert-like sections with very little vegetation. Tatla has much more moderate terrain compared to Tatlayoko and KK. It is a thin pine forest with small hills and a few small lakes/ponds. With the mountains of KK and Tatlayoko in the background. There are not many job opportunities here; it is mainly forestry or roads after highschool students leave and go to one of the surrounding cities, as the jobs are not very accommodating to get into and also there is a lack of affordable real estate for people. For entertainment and recreation there is the lake and a cross country ski club, plus my neighbor has a private theater and he will occasionally do a showing. The total population is around 200 in about a 50 km radius. I am very happy with where I live and love living here. Mentor 2024-02-26, 16:31: Hi Gideon, Thanks for sharing your answers to the warm-up activity. I agree, hiking is a place where I feel really healthy to. I think its a mix of the exercise and the benefits of being in the forest. But like you talked about meeting your goals and the excitement you get from pushing through something that is challenging is really a huge part. That's so great that you already recognize that social media makes you feel bad. I am the same but I think it took me longer than you to figure that out. I still notice that if I come home from a long day and just scroll, in the moment its nice, but later on it makes me feel bad for the time I wasted. I think its always a balance. Mentor 2024-02-26, 16:37: Wow, your town sounds beautiful. I think I will have to make a trip up that area at some point! It sounds like there are so many fun outdoor activities you can do and that you really make the most of where you live. Do you kitesurf? I am just trying to figure out, do you remember what unit the Show off my Town assignment was in? Thanks! Mentee 2024-02-29, 09:35: Hi Matilda, For the well being and self care unit, I need to come up with a list of mental health warning signs, it is reccomended that we both do it and then swap lists. Would you be up for this? Mentor 2024-03-05, 08:38: For sure, let's do that! Mentor 2024-03-05, 08:40: Okay, that makes sense now thanks for clarifying. I can imagine, kite surfing in the winter sounds cold! Mentor 2024-03-19, 06:19: Hope you have a great spring break Gideon! Mentee 2024-04-10, 12:07: 3 changes I can make to be more healthy I am fairly mentally and physically healthy, but some changes I can make would be to exercise more. What this would do would not just increase my physical capacity but would also give my days more structure and just make me feel better. Going outside more would just be all around beneficial for me and I can take my dog too and she will like that. Getting more sleep is a pretty basic one and I think that everyone can benefit from getting more sleep, you function better, are more social and all around better when you have had a full restful sleep. The questions for me to you are: What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and post-secondary student? Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.)",,,"Mentee 2023-12-05, 11:55: Hi Matilda here is the warm up for career and post secondary. After school immediately I will probably think about what I want to done next either university trades some other profession, I think university will be the path to go down but I am going to try to keep my options open Longer term I will need a job to pay for my expenses and university. I am considering firefighting in the summer, some reasons for this are: It is a highly profitable summer job some people I have talked to made around $60,000 in a summer this will allow me to pay for my education and also other expenses It is a team job that is outside. I enjoy being outside and working as a team. It is a job that has meaning with firefighting you are actively trying to save someone's home not all the time, but probably quite a bit. Mentor 2023-12-16, 12:46: Hi Gideon, I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to see when you are finishing up for the Christmas break. You must be looking forward to a break. I just finished yesterday, it feels so nice to be done. Are you staying in your town for Christmas break or traveling? I also wanted to check in about where we are so far. It seems to me like we are on Postsecondary and career planning Lesson one. Is that right? Looking forward to your next response. I think you have made great progress through the course so far and are definitely on track to finish on time. Happy holidays! Tilly Mentee 2023-12-18, 09:29: Hi Matilda I am doing well thank you, just finishing up my Christmas shopping and wrapping up my school. I finish school an the 22nd and then go back on the 8th, I will be doing some travelling around BC for skiing (big white mainly) How about you, do you ski or snowboard or neither? I am definitley looking forward to finising up school for the year. we are about halfway through post secondary and carreer planning I will try to finish that up this week. Also do you prefer Tilly or Matilda ? Gieon. Mentee 2024-01-16, 09:26: Hi Matilda, sorry it took me a while I am still getting back into school. Here is my lesson one assingment I will start working on unit 2. Gideon Dream Career: Professional Skier Grounded career: physician/ medicine Three reasons I would benefit from attending University or College Getting a higher education and a degree can help you get a job that you like and opens many new doors Going to college or university is a way to meet new people and have new experiences, especially if people have similar interests to you. Can be a great way to make connections Can lead to a well paying career. And depending on what you get your degree in something that you really love doing. Three reasons the education for these careers would be challenging Skier You need to be very good at skiing You need to have enough ski days and days when there is good snow If you are traveling around looking for places to ski that can put a lot of stress on your personal relationships There are not many education barriers with this profession but it is a very competitive position because you just get to ski all day. Medical Paying for school, medical school is known for being very expensive (how did you pay for your medicine school?) You need to take a wide variety of courses (what courses did you all take?) which can be very time consuming and stressful. You need very good grades to get into med school (did you find this to be the case with you, what did you need to do to bring your grades up?) Mentee 2024-01-29, 13:55: Hi Matilda I am working through lesson two right now. I just had a question to become a doctor (medical wise) do you need a PhD in medicine? Mentor 2024-01-30, 06:59: Hi! Good question, it's a bit confusing. No, you actually just need a bachelor's degree in any discipline (3-4 years), then you do your MD degree (the 4-year medical degree). PhD degrees are more focused on research and you also need a bachelors before doing them as well. Hope that helps! Mentee 2024-02-07, 11:22: Hi Matilda here is my project on a university UBC Vancouver Going to UBC is far from home (10 hrs) . I would need to find accommodation there. UBC has the largest residence in Canada. UBC has a food hub, also has amenities on campus, plus many restaurants including booster juice. There are gyms on campus and UBC has a massive campus which you can walk around. A bike should be suitable to get around, but to get home I will need a car. UBC has around 350 clubs so finding a cultural club should be no problem. Ubc has an extensive online learning community and has been offering online courses for 20 years. UBC has many bursaries, scholarships and even work opportunities. UBC has the most successful co-op programs in Canada, UBC definitely has peer mentoring programs and supports to help students settle in. UBC as far as I can tell has a very developed counseling department, UBC has a great variety of sport clubs to join (for me I think rowing would be a pretty cool sport) UBC also has 64 olympic medals. UBC is the 6th best party school in Canada. Because of UBC’s status as an elite school it has a strong academic requirement and so I assume a big workload. Luckily you will have 13 libraries (the largest research library in Canada) plus plenty of space to study outside. UBc has a student council but I can’t find much about it online. UBC students are mostly white or asian, and 82% of these people are male.I find this statistic hard to believe but there are approximately 60,000 students enrolled in UBC Vancouver UBC has around 17,000 staff. Minimum requirements to get into UBC 70% in English 12 or 11 At least 6 grade 12 courses(recommended) Graduated 100hrs volunteer or paid work experience This seems fairly easy to get into. You also need english which is something I can speak. All in all UBC seems like a solid choice. It is a university that isn’t impossible to get in but a prestigious one at the same time. It offers a wide variety of courses and has a great campus and from what I have heard, culture. Mentee 2024-02-07, 11:23: I am curious about the show off my town thing, would I just attach the photos to my portfolio and then write a paragraph or two? Mentee 2024-02-09, 11:13: Hi Matilda Do you think we coudl do the well being and self care unit next? thanks Gideon Mentor 2024-02-11, 10:29: Hi Gideon, thats great you have completed the post-secondary and career planning module. I have unlocked the self-planning one now so that you can keep working away. Thanks for your very well-done activity 2! This looks great. I hope this activity helped answer some of your questions too. It looks like 56% of undergraduate students at UBC were women last year, I think the statistic you found was probably old. Thankfully its much fore balanced now. UBC is a great school and I think you will definitely be able to get in if you set it as a goal. Knowing the requirements early is a great start! I also know from seeing your work ethic that the workload would not be an issue for you.",,,"Mentor 2023-11-06, 19:47: Great, I have unlocked study strategies when you are ready. Looking forward to chatting with you on Wednesday. Let's say 2:30! Mentee 2023-11-07, 09:23: Could we plan a bit earlier I have to leave just after 2:30 if you could do 2:00 that would be great, but if not it['s okay. Mentee 2023-11-13, 11:01: In the past some study strategies that I used have been: doing practice questions from different websites and places (Khan academy) also just rereading parts of the textbook or guide. I find that doing. I found that for me the practice question method worked the best as I gained further understanding of the topic I was covering, where when I just reread the textbook unless I was searching for something specific I didn’t really learn much.

Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:34: • Have you ever used any of the study skills recommended in the video? No, before I watched this video I was not really sure how to study. I usually did long study sessions of one topic without much of a schedule, I think these strategies will help me and I plan to use them for upcoming tests. What was your experience with those skills? My experience with how I studied was that it wasn’t always effective. My methods were rereading notes and watching videos on the topic. I often forgot large amounts of key information which I believe to be caused by not taking key information seriously, in a ten minute video or 30 page note doc I find it easy to skip over information that I need to know to understand the topic. • Which strategy seems the most useful to you? Explain your thinking. To me the two most important strategies are having a schedule and doing short amounts of studying each day. The second one is the write out method, I haven't tried it but it sounds like it could be extremely beneficial to understanding concepts and making sure there are no holes. • Which strategy do you think would be most challenging for you? Why would this be the case? I think setting up a study schedule would be quite challenging as I have a quite sporadic schedule, all the other strategies seem like realistic things the schedule is realistic too just I think would be the most difficult. • Are there any strategies you would add to this list? Can you explain what would make this additional strategy effective? Studying in a group with people who are more focused and have a better understanding of the topic, I find that with having a group of people that are actually studying I also study and strive to get things done and stay on task, you also can always ask your group for help and people can come to you for help which is an invaluable situation, the very best way to learn something is to teach it. Another strategy I personally use a lot is when I am reading I get 5 seconds into reading then pressing down the arrow key so the cursor thing goes through the text and I need to read ahead of it or I “lose” it keeps me focused on the task makes it kind of fun and I find I read faster when I do it. • How likely is it that you will try some or all of these strategies? Can you think of anything that might get in the way of you trying these strategies? I will definitely try these strategies, especially the write out one., I can’t foresee anything really getting in the way of that. Mentee 2023-11-15, 10:36: Would you like to do the track and compare study habits? it looks kind of fun. Mentee 2023-11-16, 10:52: Here are some questions I had for you about studying. What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? • How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? • How do their study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to their study strategies from high school? What have they learned about studying since they were in high school? Mentor 2023-11-19, 16:37: Hi Gideon, Thanks for your responses for the study strategy module. Im gald you found it helpful. It sounds like you are doing a great job studying. You are coming up with your own great strategies to keep yourself focused. I think its one of those things that you are always learning how to do better. Even now after many years of school I am still learning good strategies. Also, every person has their own style and I think you just have to try different things out as you go to see what works for you. Kahn Academy is great, and I am definitely with you. Practice questions are how I learn most of the time. They help you apply the knowledge and you are able to best see your gaps. You mentioned that sometimes you dont retain a lot of the information that you read. That is totally normal. It sometimes takes seeing the information in many different ways to finally remember it. One thing I have been told is that if you are able to teach the information to someone else, you are more likely to remember it. Sometimes I will just talk about the topic outloud with my family and its a great way to help the information stick. Thanks for the questions. I have answered them below. What strategies do they use to study and prepare for exams? For my exams, I review my notes that I wrote during lectures. I will read them through a few times to get familiar with the content. I then work on practice questions. If I notice any gaps, I go back and do some more reading on that topic. I find that I have to take lots of breaks, I do 30 minutes then I take a 10-minute break. This helps me stay focused. I also have one playlist of calming music that I always play when Im studying. This also helps with my focus. How are post-secondary classes different from high school classes, and how does that change how you learn and study? What was the most difficult or surprising part of transitioning from high school to post-secondary classes? I dont think there is a huge difference in how you learn in high school and post secondary. I would say there are higher standards as you continue, but by the time you get there you will be more then prepared to take that on. The most difficult part for me was essay writing. I am much more of a science person so I had struggles with writing in the first year of undergrad. With good teaching I was able to catch up to the others quickly. I always like to tell a story of my borther who went to UBC engineering. He barely did any math in highschool, and it was really overwhelming for him when he started engineering and all his peers were way ahead of him. He had fully caught up by 6 months. No matter what challenges are thrown at you, I am sure you will succeed if you are motivated and willing to learn. How do their study strategies as a post-secondary student compare to their study strategies from high school? What have they learned about studying since they were in high school? Great question. I think every class requires a different strategy. In medicine, there is sooooo much to learn and so much memorizing that you have to be really good at making sure you are studying on a regular basis to keep up with the content. I also started using flash cards with a program called ANKI (online flash card app). This really helps to be able to memorize things. The track and compare study habits sounds great. Let's do that this week and you can send me it on Friday if that works for you? No pressure. After this which module would you like to do. I can unlock that this week so you can work on that as well. Hope you had a great weekend! Mentee 2023-11-21, 09:04: Hi Matilda I have started to track my study hours, for the next unit could we do post secondary career planning. I had a great weekend, I did a guitar recital and was selected to perform in a gala showcase. So I am very excited about that. Mentee 2023-11-28, 13:12: Hi Matilda, yes I practiced quite a bit for the recital, I have an upcoming science test so most of my studying is for science. I thought of this a bit to late I guess but for studying I mean active reveiw of a topic not just my alloted course work and the time I spend on that. I will start working on the next unit.

How are you? Mentor 2023-10-04, 19:53: Hi Gideon! My name is Matilda. I’m so happy to be your mentor and I’m looking forward to getting to know you better over the next few months! I was so excited to see that you have lots of interests, that’s really cool! I have always wanted to try kitesurfing, it looks so fun. I’m sure you can read my profile too but I thought I would give you a quick intro here. I’m from a rural Vancouver Island town and I am now in my third year of medical school studying to be a doctor one day. Outside of school, I also love to bake, cook good food, watch terrible reality TV and do lots of outdoor adventures. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have about school, university, careers or just general life stuff! One question I had, is what grade are you in? Im happy to be a mentor and I hope that I can be helpful for you. Do any of the icebreaker activities look interesting to you to get started on? Mentee 2023-10-05, 09:00: Hi, I also enjoy outdoor activiteis and baking (all though I am not very good) I am in grade 9, I think the beauty is in the eye of the beholder looks pretty fun. Mentor 2023-10-08, 10:14: That sounds like a great one! I sent a link to a photo of the crater of Kilauea. It is a volcano in Hawaii I visited earlier this year. I thought it was so cool and beautiful. At the time I visited, it was dormant so there was no lava flowing, but sometimes you can see the orange glow. We were able to walk all the way across it. I just think it is so beautiful and reminds us how the earth is so big. https://www.explore-the-big-island.com/images/xactive-volcano-hawaii-kilauea-iki.jpg.pagespeed.ic.ykHE68aS8p.jpg Mentee 2023-10-13, 10:54: https://peakvisor.com/range/niut-range.html Hi Matilda sorry I took so long to get back to you.; The photo I chose is of the niut range in British Columbia because I have hiked there a lot and it is a very special place to me and very beautiful. Mentee 2023-10-13, 11:01: Wow that photo is really cool. When did you go to Hawaii? what did you all do there? Also a question about mentoring: why did you start mentoring and what made you keep mentoring, what is your favorite thing about mentoring? Mentor 2023-10-14, 23:21: Hi Gideon, Thanks for sharing that photo. That is such a beautiful place. I hope I get the chance to visit the Nuit Range at some point. BC is such an incredible place to live. I went to Hawaii for my summer break this year in June. We were able to do lots of hiking, snorkelling, and swimming. It was really special. I decided to do mentoring because I grew up in a small town and I really appreciated some people who encouraged me in my academics. I am doing this as a way to pay that forward. I also love getting to know people this way and seeing you guys as you are in such an exciting time in your life figuring out what your next steps will be after high school. I hope that my experiences will be useful for you. What are you hoping to get out of this program? It looks like your teacher wants us to start on the module ""from rural to urban."" I will go ahead and unlock that so you will have some of those activities to work on when you have time. Looking forward to reading your responses. Mentor 2023-10-30, 13:27: Hi Gideon, I'm so sorry l never received confirmation back about a time. I am available al afternoon. I just emailed the program to see if they are able to set it up. What time works for you? Thanks for the reminder! Mentee 2023-10-31, 08:58: Hi Matilda. Could we plan for 11? I can't make a zoom link but if you could send me a link I can join Mentor 2023-10-31, 12:12: Hi Gideon, I'm sorry for the confusion. I'm not the one who sets the zoom up, it is someone from the program. I'm busy all day today at school. I will try to organize a day with her later in the week if that works for you. I hope you have a great Halloween ?? Mentee 2023-10-31, 12:14: Hi Gideon and Matilda, Once you figure out a time, you can use this zoom link: Link: https://ubc.zoom.us/j/64501284113?pwd=bG5OK1QrbTJpdGZENGVYbUFvVmRjZz09 Password: 654317 It says it's for my (Juliet's) zoom room, but I set it up so you can use it without me (I hope).

Mentor 2023-11-02, 20:39: Hi Gideon, Thanks for your patience with the zoom set up. We now have the zoom link so we just have to figure out a time that works for both of us. I can meet tomorrow afternoon if that works. I can also meet next Wednesday. Let me know what times work for you. Thanks! Mentee 2023-11-06, 08:49: Wednesday afternoon works for me too, see you then. Mentee 2023-11-06, 12:07: For the next unit do you think we could do study strategies? (I have a test coming up) Mentor 2023-11-08, 13:05: Of course, see you at 2!

This looks great. This week was a bit off for me because I was sick so instead I included my average study week. I study about 1h a day in the week doing practice questions, on the weekend I review certain topics that will be on my exam, average 4h a day. In third yea,r you are studying a lot on the go too. I am always reviewing things when I see patients in the hospital and read around the case to figure out what we are going to do to help them. With this included I probably study 2h a day at during the weekdays too. My big exam is on Monday so I am going to spend most of the weekend studying. Hope you have a great weekend! Mentee 2023-12-06, 12:17: Hi Matilda I had a great weekend my science test was great(97%) hopefully you get better soon, sounds like you do a lot of studying. I have started the post secondary and carrer planning. Gideon Mentor 2023-12-11, 22:12: Hi Gideon, hope you are doing well. Thanks for the next assignment. Summer firefighting seems like a great idea. I had a few friends that did it and really enjoyed it. It was an amazing way to fund university. Do you think you would want to do that on summer breaks from school or for a couple of years before you start university? Mentor 2023-12-11, 22:13: Also, congrats on your science test, 97% that's amazing! Mentor 2023-12-24, 06:27: Hi Gideon, Congrats on being done school. I just wanted to wish you happy holidays! I hope you have a fun break and get to do lots of skiing. I am more of a snowboarder actually but I am hoping to learn to ski. To answer your question, I go by both names. Whichever is easier. See you back in the new year for the rest of the modules! Merry Christmas! Mentor 2024-01-18, 21:02: Hi Gideon, so nice to hear from you. How was your Christmas break? Did you get to do lots of skiing? Thanks for the assignment this looks great, and I am biased but I am so glad you are thinking about pursuing medicine along with skiing. You did a great job on the assignment and I can really see that you thinking a lot about your future and what these different paths would look like. I am a big advocate of university. I think when I was in high school I though it's just more school to learn academic stuff. But really I think it is much more about learning bigger life things like how to be a good learner, meeting interesting people, pushing you to thinnk outside the box. You are right that it opens up more doors and leads you to things you never expected. I went into my undergraduate degree not knowing I liked medicine and then realized it was the perfect fit for me. I went to undergrad with a few professional skiers/snowboarders who were able to study and ski at the same time. So many options. Its just so nice to see you have so much passion for these things. I will answer your questions about med school below. Please let me know if you have any other questions about med school. I am always happy to help answer them. Paying for school, medical school is known for being very expensive (how did you pay for your medicine school?) This is somewhat true but there is so much financial support. I get student loans which have no interest and will probably be forgiven by the government when I finish school. There are also so many scholarships and bursaries. To be honest, I am going to graduate with very little debt. We also are given a huge line of credit of $350,000. Because you know you will be making pretty good money when you are done, its not as risky to go into a little bit of debt either. This really should not be a barrier. You need to take a wide variety of courses (what courses did you all take?) which can be very time consuming and stressful. If you are going into medicine, you actually only have to complete two English courses and besides that, there are no restrictions on what courses you have to take. They really encourage diversity. Because of this in my undergraduate degree I really just got to follow what I was interested in. I can see from your work ethic that you will do great in medical school, and it is a lot less hard then you think it is. You need very good grades to get into med school (did you find this to be the case with you, what did you need to do to bring your grades up?) This is somewhat true as well. They do consider grades as part of your application. I definitely did not have perfect grades, but I was able to make up for it in other areas like my extracurriculars. Being from a rural place is a really big benefit when applying for medical school and I think helped me get in. Mentee 2024-02-26, 09:50: Testing Mentee 2024-02-26, 09:50: Situations where I am most and least healthy One situation that stands out for me is hiking, especially when I reach my goal, not only do I feel good about myself after achieving my goal. I also have been physically exerting myself for quite a while and then as Ed Viestrus says “The summit is just a halfway point” and usually going down is harder than going up. When I reach the top or my goal on a hike I feel extremely tired but also energized and ready (after a break) to go on whether to the next summit or the back down. It is as if getting to the top is never enough and as I come down I am already planning my next hike. That's where I feel my best physically and mentally. Where I feel my worst is usually when I am sick or just spend too much time on social media I just feel unfulfilled and all around bad. Mentee 2024-02-27, 09:42: Hi Matilda The show if your town was an incentivised activity, and wasn't a required part of the course. Sorry for the confusion. Gideon Mentee 2024-02-27, 09:43: I started kitesurfing last year it is on hold for the winter but this summer it will resume. Mentee 2024-03-11, 10:04: Hi Matilda I am having trouble finding your messages to me. Do you think we could try the new program? Mentor 2024-03-13, 22:37: Hi Gideon, I totally get what you mean. It's challenging because there are so many message threads. I would definitely be interested in figuring out if there is a better way to communicate. What is the new program? Mentee 2024-04-03, 09:08: Hi Matilda I hope you had a good spring break, do you get spring break in uni? I will finish up the well being assinmgnet later today and send it in. Mentor 2024-04-04, 15:41: Hi Gideon, How was your vacation? What did you get up to? No sadly i dont get spring break, but my summer break is coming in 2 months so Im excited about that. Sounds great. Looking forward to seeing your assignment. Thanks! Mentee 2024-04-05, 09:53: Mental health warning signs -Bad sleep This one is very relevant and I think is the main factor for me I will feel unmotivated and not get things done which will only make me feel only more unsatisfied I will be irritable especially around my siblings I won’t go out of my way to go outside or exercise I will be on my phone or computer much more and not doing school or anything productive. I think these factors play into each other and it sort of dominioes. I read the article about the girl who after to much pressure collapsed and I found some connection there I definitley do not have as much stress as she does but still I have some stress academically especaially with multiple instruments, so I think that understanding warning signs and how to mitigate risk is important for me. Mentee 2024-04-05, 09:59: For spring break I went skiing again the snow definitley was not as good but I got to ski with some of my friends so it was pretty good.","Mentee 2023-10-24, 10:11: Hi Matilda sorry I have not been responding I have been very sick recently but I am now better. In my community there are about 200 people in a hundred km radius 24 of those people go to Tatla school. There are there are maybe 7 highschool students, not all of them go to the school. They hang out at home mainly and there are not many extracurricualr activities . The reason my community is special to me is becuase it is very beautiful and wild, I have also built many great long standing friendships that I found to be strong and more authentic compared to the ones I had when I lived in Edmonton. Some strengths that I have found that I have gained from living here are the abilities to makes stronger friendships I have found that I don't have much trouble building close friendships over this summer and online. I find that I can also problem solve and work very indepepndantly. I can use to these skills to better my education by building close personal relatioships with my peers and community members. Mentor 2023-10-24, 13:44: Hi Gideon, No need to apologize. I'm so sorry to hear that you have been sick. I'm glad you are feeling better. I was also sick last week too. I think it's just that time of year. Thanks so much for your thoughtful responses to lesson 1. You have a very inspiring approach to living in a rural community. I think you are so right. For me, growing up in a rural place made me much more independent and adaptable. You have to be much more creative to find things to do and challenge yourself. I found that all these skills have really helped me stand out in university. I have also found that being from a rural place is quite unique and many programs really value students who grew up in a rural place. For me, it has been a really big benefit. Im sure it will for you too. Have you had any challenges being in a small town? Feel free to move on to lesson 2! Mentee 2023-10-26, 09:13: Hi Matilda The main challenge I have had in a rural community is education, the school here has mixed grades and I did not find that that worked for me. So I tried online school and that wasn't really the best thing for me either, now I do a hybrid program where I do all my academic courses through an online school, and all my others through Tatla. What benifits did you gain from living in a rural communiy? I will start lesson two. Gideon Mentee 2023-10-26, 09:31: I lived in Edmonton for a few years recently, I found that it was nice to have the accesibility of everything right there and a great school. I found that living in a city was good previous to that I had no idea what it was like and it showed me some of the oppurtunities. Some of the challenges I faced was that it was quite crowded and always loud (sirens, neighbors, coyotes). Some things I would like to know about living in a city are what is besides university or school what keeps people in cities. How was the shift for you from rural to urban? What is your favorite thing about the city? Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:05: Are we still planning to meet today? Mentor 2023-11-02, 20:52: Hi Gideon, Sorry for my late response. It has been a busy week. I have been in the Emergency room all week learning about ER medicine, which has been a big learning curve. I'm so glad you were able to come up with a good system for school doing a hybrid model. It sounds like you are very proactive about your learning which is great. I did a bit of that too when I was in highschool. I took quite a few online courses, which I found pushed me a bit more academically. I think learning to be proactive in situations like this is one of the good things about growing up in a rural place. Thank you for your response to lesson 2. That's great that you have had some experience already living in a big city. It is a big adjustment to get used to the noise. The shift for me to move to the city was easier than I thought it would be, before long you find your place and are able to take advantage of all the opportunities there is to offer. I have to be honest, my favourite thing about the city is the food choices. I love trying unique foods and that is my favourite thing to do when I'm not busy. I also love being able to go to events and galleries to experience arts and culture from around the world. I think you will be surprised how fast you get used to living there. Do you feel nervous about moving to a city? It is your choice what unit we move on to next. Are there any that look interesting to you?",,,,

I’m really grateful not to be an overly angry person these days. Long term it causes so many health conditions. I learned how to use positive self-talk, affirmations, gratitude and mindfulness and it changed my life. There are still large injustices in the world that really bother me. Like when kids don’t get proper dental care, especially when all kids get some free dental in BC. Building something with your Dad for your bunny would be an awesome experience. Building things has a great sense of accomplishment. I think all that’s left for us in finding inspiration is to watch the video and talk about it J Then we can move on to another section.

It would take my mind off of things that bother me. Also, that would work. I don't have any preference's. Mentor 2023-11-17, 13:19: Thats awesome so youre doing the practice test online? Ive been sick with the flu almost missed your message, glad i saw it though. Youd be surprised how fast your brain will pick up on driving :) youve got this. Mentee 2023-11-21, 11:47: Yes I am. And thank you. Hopefully I can learn quickly so I can enjoy driving.",,,,"Mentor 2023-09-27, 07:45: Hi! Sorry for the delay in reaching out. I was out of cell service for 4 days. How are you? Mentee 2023-10-03, 12:10: Hi I'm also sorry for not responding for a bit. But I've been good, how are you Mentor 2023-10-03, 13:27: I'm good thanks :) just got exciting news that I get to write another grant in the next ten days. Have you had time to explore the website? Is there a unit you've been asked to do first? Or do you have a preference? Mentee 2023-10-10, 13:46: Yayay I'm happy for you. I have explored a bit, not much though I don't know what I should look at. I don't have any preference. Sorry if I take a bit to respond I usually stress too much because of other work which stops me from checking on here Mentor 2023-10-10, 16:28: No worries, I'm usually at work while you're at school. What else are you working on? Mentor 2023-10-10, 16:31: It's cool you're living in Hope!? I went to elementary school in Boston Bar. I've gone ahead and unlocked the finding inspiration Unit. :) Mentee 2023-10-18, 10:10: I am living in hope yes, its a small town and i like it. I used to go to the coquihalla elementary school here so I've been here most of my life, until I moved to ontario then I moved back here after four years. Right now I am trying to work on a cover letter for a resume, which I don't like doing Mentor 2023-10-18, 10:13: I find when I'm writing about myself, cover letters n resumes, it can be beneficial to ask my friends what my strengths are. Sometimes it's easier for ppl we're close with, to see the best in us. Mentor 2023-10-21, 17:27: We just adopted the fluffy black rescue cat that we fostered :) I designed a catio that's just over the top for our kitties. Do you have any pets? Mentee 2023-10-26, 08:43: Awww. How old is it?? I want to do that some day except a dog. Though I already have one and I hope I can get another soon. I have 3 cats, a dog and a bunny. Mentee 2023-10-26, 08:45: I think I might ask my friends what they think my strengths are yeah. I assume they would know some. Thank you! Mentor 2023-10-26, 09:35: She was found ferral, no one knows her history. We've had her just about a year. If you even looked at her she would run and hide. She's still sketchy lol but she's learned to play, beg, loves belly rubs and sleeps with out old pitbul. The other night I woke up with her beside me and she let me pet her on the bed. A huge feat! Soon she'll be cuddling me wahaha ha ha :) Our dogs name is gypsy she sings.. mostly to urban hip hop... snoop dog etc. Sounds cute until your on a road trip lol Haven't had a bunny since I was a kid though. I built a two story catio... I'd like to start working on the finding inspiration material. Let me know when you have time, I have the day off tomorrow if that works? Mentor 2023-10-26, 09:46: I'll try to figure out how to send pics of them tomorrow too :) the catio is insane! My inspiration as a kid was kind of hindered... I knew I wanted to help people but wasn't told I was smart, or that I could do anything I wanted. Most my life I believed I wasn't good enough, I definitely never won any awards. It wasn't until I was older, when I started my recovery that it occurred to me I might be able to get a post secondary education. Now I run an anti domestic abuse program, am writing a book, and designing a non profit society :) it's a big change from believing having children was my only value or worth. There wasn't a lot of inspiration in my family or the town I was living in either. You will be happier in life, more successful, and even live longer if you can find work associated with your passion. Put some thought into that if you can, without the limitations that you may feel. What lights a fire inside you? Mentee 2023-11-01, 10:35: One day you and your cat will be besties. (I hope lol.) Practice makes perfect. I want to build something big for my bunny soon. It's a dream of mine and I want her to have a big area I don't know I might try building with my dad, something for my bunny. I'm gonna assume what lights a fire inside me means something that inspires me, and I actually don't know. Maybe my parents, like I don't want to feel that i've let them down ever so I do my best for them. And I don't think I have ever won an award ever really, so I'm hoping one day that could change. Or I just hope everyone knows I'm trying my best. I'm not the smartest but I think I am a good person. Tomorrow works for me too also. Mentor 2023-11-01, 10:57: If you can't think of what inspires you... Think what makes you furious inside? It's pretty normal to be finding yourself as a teenager. Making your parents happy is an admirable goal. Life is about making you happy too. I know a lady up here who runs a animal rescue society. Also where are rescue kitty's from. Did I tell you? I have bipolar adhd ptsd and an anxiety disorder. Never an award. My formal education now is boss... I've been called an over achiever lol just bought my first new truck too. It's so much easier to get things in life with post ed. Being smart isn't everything, but being determined and motivated is. I have to take pics of the cadio without my address visible to share it. (Rules). Its very inspiring lol people stop in the street to take pics and complement me on it. Just been sick and avoiding the cold. Was minus ten yesterday :( I work split shifts Wed/Thursday. I'm off betwee 1 and 5 pm I think if we messaged back n forth for a set time we could tackle all these requirements in a hour or two. Mentor 2023-11-01, 13:31:  Mentor 2023-11-01, 13:46: I made a collage :) The fluffy kitty is charlie our rescue. Theres the catio full view, inside shelves, outside and inside doors, doors for cleaning. Cat scratcher post that looks like a crayon lol and upstairs/second story entry too. A person could make a decent living designing and building these pet additions. The nature picture is a photo from on a 13km in 13km out backpacking trip I did this summer. It was dense woods and brush for a lot of it, but finally I got to see the sun shining on the mountians for that picture. Making that hike was somehting I wanted for a long time. I'm actually the first family member to make it to the family lake in my generation, possibly the generation before. An older distant cousin I havent met yet is coming up with me next summer. Grizzley bear protected forest. It was the most extream trip of my life. If the pictures are too small i can send them seperately. Are there things that you know you want in life? Mentee 2023-11-07, 09:07: Theres a lot that makes me furious, like little things sometimes. I remember when my mom tried to get me into a program thingy to help with my anger issues. I can't remember if I actually participated but all I know is that I still have anger issues lol. I can sort of see the pictures even if it's small and from what I can see it looks really cool! The mountains look really pretty too. I need to motivate myself to build something big for my bunny, it's my dream. That sounds like a really cozy house for your cat. :) I've been sick too. I had cold and I think I got my friends sick on friday too, oops. I can try to message every careers class I have. Sometimes I just forget because of this travelling assingment I'm doing for careers. I don't know what I want really. I think maybe my own car, once I turn sixteen in december I'll probably take the test. I've always wanted to drive. Theres definitely more I want, more important things I just can't think of any now. Mentee 2023-11-28, 13:11: I did have a good week yes thank you. I spent my weekend at my friends and now back to school. I hope you had a good weekend. I want to get my nails done for christmas. Something simple but christmas alike. I'm hoping to work a little more so I actually have money. Also yes yes we can discuss. Mentee 2023-12-05, 12:01: Ooooh. actually my friends are getting their nails done on the 9th and i was gonna go for my birthday with them but i wouldn't be able to make it. I havent done the test yet. My birthdays on the 8th so i have to wait till friday. I probably won't do it right away but sometime this december maybe. And yes I do.:) Mentor 2023-12-08, 11:36: Happy Birthday!!!! Mentee 2023-12-08, 14:55: Thank you so so much!! :)))) Mentor 2023-12-14, 15:35: Hey Just wanted to see how your birthday was and if you had a chance to look over the material? Chat Soon Mentor 2024-01-04, 16:23: Hey how was your holidays? Mentee 2024-01-04, 17:36: It was really nice. How was your Christmas?? I go back to school on the 8th so it's pretty close and I'm not that excited for my 2nd semester. Mentee 2024-01-04, 17:37: And I'm sorry I for some reason never seen the last message you sent. My birthday was really fun Mentor 2024-01-05, 16:24: Happy friday no worries, you could always mention that its easy to miss messages in your feedback so that they can develop the site better mine was good, i made a big turkey dinner this year with all the fixings. then we bake raisin and walnut buttertarts and caramel popcorn balls. they were so yummy! now im back to the grind, its nice you still have a few days off if you want to get caught up on here, ill be around this weekend :) Mentor 2024-01-15, 13:22: Happy monday! I hope your day is off to a better start than mine LOL I wanted to send a message so that we could get back on track :) From now on I will just response to your last message in hopes that it will be easier to find. I think we talked a bit about the rural to urban setting, and that you felt that you do live in a urban setting. Have you ever considered living in a larger city or going to school somewhere far away? Career exploration, post-secondary and career planning, adulting are the topics left to chat about. Do any of them interest you? Mentee 2024-01-15, 13:32: My mondays been boring but good aha. I hope your Monday gets better ?? I don't know how far I'll want to go for another school but whatever is the best. I like big cities I think. I also like smaller areas but with a bigger city there's more to do and explore. I keep forgetting I can text on here on my phone too so I forget often to text back on here sorry lol. Mentor 2024-01-16, 15:47: I have it on my phone but I always just check it on my computer. I should login on my phone though. it would be quicker. If theres suddenly 20 typos, Im probably messaging from my phone LOL I think post secondary is a great place to explore like that. It could really allow a person to fully experience a larger place while still contibuting to a successful future. The dorms are usualy pretty nice, but tiny. They have common areas which is great for meeting new people. I'm still friends with a few people people that i went to university and college with Mentor 2024-01-16, 15:48: Does that sound like the kind of enviroment you would enjoy? Mentee 2024-01-16, 16:18: It does sound like something I would enjoy :) I don't know if it's odd for me to say but I've always wanted to be in a dorm it sounds like it would be nice and cozy lol. I would love to just have time to study with my friends in our rooms if they went to the same university as me. Mentor 2024-01-17, 16:17: Thats awesome! I think you should really go for it. Its one of the few things I wish I did. Unfortuantly I had kids already, so I missed out on it. Its one of those things that if you dont plan and do it while youre young you miss out. Even choosing which classes you take might matter dependng on which career you pick. So weve talked about a few thigns over the last few weeks. I think we should chat a bit about career planning. My week has been so crazy :? so Ihavent reviewed our next two topics yet. But you know what you want out of life which is great, now you just need to consider what feild of work interests you and then exploring a fewoptions that could financially give you what you want. Mentor 2024-01-26, 08:34: Happy Friday! I hear today is our last day and I just wanted to thank you for the good conversation. Feel free to send a message if you ever get a chance to review the other topics and want to chat about it :) Good luck!","Mentor 2023-11-24, 16:48: Thats awesome. I hope youve had a good weak. Im painting my nails red for holiday cheer tonight. I think weve covered all of the discussion questions from finding inspiration and thought we could start on the rural to urban disscussions next :) Mentor 2023-12-01, 20:28: Happy Friday! I havent been gettng message notifications from here lately. I do my nails in that really strong led polish so they are still red and very long. Im hoping they dont break before christmas. But wrapping presents was harder. I am done my xmas shopping! woot woot! Havent set up the tree yet though. Did you try your test? Do you live in the city there? Mentor 2023-12-07, 13:37: Happy thursday! WOOT WOOT! Are you excited for tomorrow? I think our messeges are not syncing up. The site creates a new thread for each different conversation. So we should be in the rural to urban section now. Mine didnt load a video for this section but wants us to chat about what we value about living urban or rurally. What do you value about where you live? I live in a larger urban city and I value its resources. We have one of the the best Universities in Canada, and a huge recovery support system. But our community college is one of my favorite resources. I would definetly master the onlnie quiz before taking it. I failed my first try but I didnt study though LOL",,,,

A bit about myself: I enjoy working out and playing sports, especially soccer, and, above all, meeting new people like yourself. There is a lot I could say about myself, and sometimes I tend to go on tangents when discussing myself. However, I'd like to hear about you and the things you enjoy doing in your spare time. Feel free to share!",,,,,
1047590948,1/22/2023 22:21,1047628130,67581,,,,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-10-31, 18:19: Hi Danika, I wanted to reach out again to check on you, how are you doing? A lot of successful people learn from mentors, imagine you make a mistake and it costs you time/effort/money and you learn from it. Now imagine that you talked to someone else who already made that mistake and they warn you about what not to do or provide advice. You can save so much time learning from the mistakes of others. When things happen I usually look at them as lessons learned, and I've learned a lot of lessons. One would be making sure you pay attention to scholarship deadlines and acceptance deadlines. What do you know about scholarships in British Columbia? Are there any questions you have about bugeting or saving? How to buy groceries? Easy recipes? I'm happy to help :) Hope to hear from you.","Mentor 2023-10-12, 23:49: Hi Danika, My name is Kineena and I am your mentor for this semester! A little about me, I've been described as an academic weapon, I recently fell in love with surfing, I'm working towards a career in law, and I used to work at a bank so I know a little about saving, investing and credit cards. Feel free to ask me any questions you have, studying or general life advice, whatever you need :) I look forward to getting to know you better!",,,,,
1047584290,10/11/2022 13:49,1047628128,67580,,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-12-09, 14:16: Hey Connor, your teacher decided we don't necessarily have to follow each units lesson plan the way its layed out. Instead I'll open up a topic and ask you a question and we can have a conversation about it. For finding inspiration: What inspires you to achieve your goals? Whether that be short term like completing homework or long term like becoming a pilot.",,,,"Mentor 2023-10-04, 23:52: Hi Connor, nice to virtually meet you! I'm Kodie, you can learn more about me in the bio on my profile but feel free to ask me any questions you might have. To start off, you can have a look at lesson one and two above, then there are some discussion questions you can respond to/ask me. Once we complete that we can move onto the modules your teacher assigned! If you're confused about the program at any time don't hesitate to let me know and I'll do my best to walk you through it. Mentor 2023-10-18, 19:22: Hey Connor, just wanted to check in. I saw that you updated your bio and that you're thinking about going into law! Not sure if you saw my bio but I am currently in law school so let me know if you have any questions about it or the process of getting in. Hopefully your teacher will give you sometime to work on this first lesson soon. To reiterate: You can have a look at lesson one and two above, then there are some discussion questions you can respond to/ask me. Once we complete that we can move onto the modules your teacher assigned! If you're confused about the program at any time don't hesitate to let me know and I'll do my best to walk you through it. Mentee 2023-10-19, 10:06: Hey I sent you a message yesterday then re-sent it Incase you didn't get it but I guess you didn't get either of them? I didnt realize that I had updated my bio but, I actually realized that going into law was an unrealistic goal for me. In elementary school I had good grades, nearly straight A's. Once I got into highs book I started handing in assignments late or not handing them in at all, I went from having A's to C's. This year I am doing a lot better I have no missing assignments and I am in the A's and B's but not good enought to get into law. There was a few years that I wanted to be a pilot and I think I am going to continue to try and do that. It still can be expensive, but not law school expensive. Mentor 2023-10-23, 20:55: Hey, yeah I didn't get the previous messages, hopefully the messages send fine from now on. That's great that you are getting back to better habits in class. I wouldn't worry about having bad grades early in highschool. I had really bad grades all through grade 8-10 too. My best advice would be to look into the program that you are interested in whether that's a pilot program or something at UBC. If you look at the high school classes and grades that are required for those programs you can just take those in grade 11 and 12 and work towards those grades. It is really cool that you want to be a pilot! Law school is cool but piloting sounds alot cooler. But you have all the time in the world to figure it out, so keep your options open. As for finishing this module, if you go to lesson 2 and click ""Background Info"" I think you have to choose between making a poem or exchanging photos. Let me know which one you want to do! Mentee 2023-10-25, 20:15: Hey sorry I've had a hard week but I would like to do the photo exchange Mentor 2023-10-29, 23:58: Hey Connor, This is a photo of my schools law library. I come here to study because the environment really helps me focus. All of the books can be a little overwhelming since I have no idea what any of them are but at the same time seeing them reminds me how lucky I am to be here. Mentor 2023-10-30, 00:00: This is a photo of a trail near my school. I like to be outside to disconnect from school when I find time. I think it is really important that you have activities and hobbies that you are passionate about outside of school and work to make sure you have a way to remove yourself from the stressful nature of those things. Mentor 2023-10-30, 00:03: I shared two images below, hopefully they uploaded fine. You can share two or three images as well that you either took or some that you found online and write a short reflection of why you find them meaningful. To attach the photos just press ""Save to your portfolio"" under the text box. Then you have to write a 2-3 sentence response to one of my photos and I'll do the same for one of yours. Mentor 2023-11-13, 22:48: Hey Connor, just want to check in and see how things are going. I know it can be tough to get photos and stuff uploaded to the website so I opened up the second activity ""From Rural to Urban"". You can go to the wheel up top and click the activity, and I'll leave a quick intro and some instructions there for you. Feel free to upload some photos if you have any you want to share, I'd love to see them! But, if you dont have any we can just move on to the other activity.","Mentor 2023-11-13, 22:50: So to start this activity you can read the warm up and then the background info and discussion question under lesson 1. It'll give you some prompts to respond to and questions to ask. Mentee 2023-11-21, 12:33: Are you from a larger city or a smaller town? Mentor 2023-11-24, 10:22: I grew up just 30 minutes out of Vancouver so it was definitely a larger city. Because it was a bigger city it was nice to have more options for things like food, shopping, work, and school. But it was defintely harder to make new friends and connections growing up. What's it like living in a smaller town like Hope? What kind of advantages do you think it gives you? Mentee 2023-11-27, 10:05: Growing up in Hope sucks. I live far from town so growing up I couldnt just walk to my friends house or to the store and if I did it would take an hour. Also there isn't much to do here after living here for 14 years. I have done everything there is to do. We don't really have anywhere to shop, we have basically no restaurants. 4 pizza places, 2 ""diners"", 4 cafes. There is no diversity. Also eveyone knows everyone's business. Not really any advantages. Mentor 2023-11-27, 13:59: I used to think my town sucked when I was growing up too but as I got older I definitely found some positives. I am sure you will too eventually. I really like visiting Hope, I think the Skagit Valley and Silver Lake areas are some of the most beautiful places I've been too. For lesson 2 you just have to watch a 3 minute video in ""Background Info"" then respond to some discussion questions. Then we can move onto the next module! Mentor 2024-01-17, 11:04: Hey Connor, how was winter break? Sorry for the delay since my last message, I was locked out of my account for a bit. I know you guys are wrapping up soon so if you have any questions you'd like to ask about anything please ask away! Of course, if you want to continue the conversation beyond the end date, let me know. If you don't have any questions then I'd love to know: What inspires you to achieve your goals? Whether that be short term like completing homework or long term like becoming a pilot.",,,,

When you're ready, take some time to go through the prompts and videos for Lesson 1, brainstorming ideas about what inspires/motivates you. Some questions I have for you are... What do you want in life? What are you passionate about and why? Try to list 5 things that you want in life, and why you want these things (they can be materialistic, experiential, etc.). Do you have any questions for me? (You can find inspiration for questions from the discussion PDF in Lesson 1.) Cheers, Sarah Mentor 2023-11-05, 09:43: Hi Autumn, How's it going with this unit? Do you have any questions?",,,,"Mentor 2023-09-29, 09:39: Hey Autumn! I'm Sarah, and I'm thrilled to be your eMentor this semester. ?? First things first, let me share a bit about myself. I recently graduated from UBCO with a degree in Biochemistry, but outside of all that nerdy science stuff, I'm all about embracing the great outdoors! Whether it's skiing with friends or simply basking in the sun, you'll find me outside whenever I can. Oh, and I have a serious weakness for coffee, and getting lost in audiobooks. Speaking of adventures, my next big one is exploring Europe. My grandparents hailed from Italy, and they brought with them a treasure trove of cultural knowledge and mouthwatering recipes. If I had to pick a favorite, it'd definitely be neapolitan pizza – the real deal! But enough about me; I'm eager to learn all about you! What are some of your favorite hobbies and interests? Let's dive into this mentoring journey together, and I can't wait to hear from you soon. Take care, Sarah Mentor 2023-09-29, 09:49: Here's a sneak peek at our journey together from now until January 26th. We'll be diving into five awesome lessons/chats that promise to be a blast. We can stick to the suggested schedule of about 2 weeks per lesson, but hey, flexibility is our middle name! ?? So, which of these upcoming lessons has you doing a happy dance? Are you as pumped as I am? And hey, do you have any super-specific goals you're aiming for with this program? From Rural to Urban: Buckle up for a rollercoaster of contrasts! Finding Inspiration: Get ready to unleash your creative genius. Career Exploration: Exploring paths less traveled and some that are well-trodden.

Yes, this is where we are supposed to chat :) Please let me know if you have any questions about the platform, I know it can be a bit ocnfusing at first. I saw from your profile that you like to bike - I love biking as well! Are you into road biking, or mountain biking? Mentee 2023-10-24, 12:56: Hey Sarah, my favorite type of biking is mountain and trails but I love all kinds.. I was wouldn't what you struggled the most with in highschool? where your peers nice? did you struggle in your classes? I'd love to know! I'll talk to you next time! bye.. Mentor 2023-10-26, 21:44: Hi Autumn! It's great to hear that you're a fan of mountain biking - I definitly share your enthusiasm and am hoping to get a few more rides in before the winter season arrives. High school was a memorable time for me, and I appreciate your curiosity about it. Like many people, I faced some challenges during high school. One of the things I struggled with the most was time management. Balancing schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and a social life was quite the juggling act. But through trial and error, I learned to organize my time effectively. In terms of peers, I was fortunate to have a mix of experiences. While some classmates were incredibly friendly and supportive, there were also a few who were less so. However, I found that forming strong connections with like-minded friends and finding supportive teachers and mentors made a big difference in my overall high school experience. Academically, I had my share of challenges, too. Some classes were more difficult than others, but I realized that seeking help when needed, staying organized, and staying persistent helped me overcome those obstacles. High school can be a unique journey for everyone, with its ups and downs. If you have any specific questions or need advice on navigating your high school experience, feel free to ask. I'd be happy to share more and help in any way I can. Looking forward to our next conversation! Have a great day! Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:22: What class did you do the best in? what one did you do the worst in? Mentor 2023-10-30, 21:53: Hey Autumn :) I did best in my science classes, specifically math. I found the concepts and problem-solving aspects really engaging, and it came more naturally to me. On the flip side of things, the class I struggled the most with was history. Remembering all those dates and events was a bit of a challenge for me, but I managed to get through it with some extra effort. Do you feel that you have good study routines? Is there anything in particular that you're struggling with? It's completely normal to have strengths and weaknesses in different subjects. What's important is that you find what you're passionate about and put in the effort to excel in those areas! Now that we've had a chance to chat and learn a bit more about each other, are you ready to dive into our first course topic, 'Finding Inspiration'? Let me know if you're ready to get started, or if you have any other questions or thoughts you'd like to share :) Cheers, Sarah Mentee 2023-10-31, 09:45: Hey Sarah no I don't have anymore questions.. Let's get started!! Mentee 2023-11-07, 09:52: Hey Sarah its going ok what about you? Mentor 2023-11-10, 15:07: Hi Autumn, All is well with me, slowly getting used to the shorter days and preparing for the winter snow fall! The fall time change always seems to throw me off a bit, I prefer when it stays light out later into the evening. Do you feel the same? Also, I did send you a message within the 'Finding Inspiration' unit, were you able to find that section on the website? I know it can be a bit tricky to navigate at times. Thank you, Sarah Mentor 2023-11-20, 21:06: Hey Autumn, hope you're doing well! I know it's a busy season with the winter break quickly approaching. Let me know if you have any questions about this unit, looking forward to chatting :) Mentee 2023-12-05, 11:47: Hey sorry I haven't been answering life's just been hectic recently my nephew was born yesterday, and with the holidays approaching I'm trying to get a job to pay for presents for family and friends. Hope all is well Autumn Mentor 2023-12-05, 18:22: Hi Autumn! Congratulations on becoming an auntie! That is so exciting, especially during the holiday season. Such a special gift for your family. I understand it is a very busy time right now, so no need to apologize. It's awesome that you're thinking of looking for an after-school job. Do you have any questions on how to go about that process? I am always here if you'd like any help with that. Also - have you been able to review any of the prompts in the 'Finding Inspiration' section? Do you feel that you'd like to move onto the next section?

If you'd like, we can move onto another topic. Are you thinking of attending postsecondary after high school? Warm wishes, Sarah Mentee 2023-12-15, 21:45: Hey Sarah, It's amazing having a baby to hang out with.. And I'm thinking of becoming a social services worker to help kids in rough places Autumn Mentor 2023-12-19, 07:56: I bet! Babies are so funny &amp; cute haha And that sounds awesome! It sounds like a very rewarding career path - one that you could help a lot of people. Have you looked into which schools offer programs to become certified in social services? Happy holidays! :) Sarah",,,,,

Please look at the discussion section and choose whatever activity you want to work on. please note to follow along with your class requirements for completing the activities if specific things are required. And for the ""scared part"", I hear ya!!! But that's a good thing. It means you have a world ahead of you to explore. I came here to live alone when I was 17! And I came from a different country. So if I did this, so can you! Read stories of people and seek knowledge I'd say. The very important reason of the things that scare us is that we don't have enough information about them. Feel free to reach out with questions. Cheers, saba Mentee 2023-10-30, 09:16: Lesson One: Thinking about adulting does stress me out quite a bit. I am Indigenous and in my culture family and people are extremely important. I have lived around family my entire life and I am not sure how well I'll be on my own. I am a lifeguard so I know that I have a steady source of income no matter where I go in Canada but seeing the rising costs of rent and stuff like that is concerning. My parents have spent their entire lives raising children so they know how to prepare children for the real world. I've been taught how to keep a house, be clean, grocery shop, budget, wants and needs, and how to cook and get places no matter where I am and what transportation is avalible to me. What I am worried about it making appoinments, possible medical issues, and repairs and such. My dad know how to do eveything so I've never seen a repairman step foot into my house and I have absolutely no clue how I'm supposed to tell whos good for what, and medical issues, My mom makes all my appointments and knows what to say to the doctor. Questions: Was there anything that you thought would be easy to handle but turned out to be harder than expected? Was there anything that made the transition from depenant to indepentant easier? Mentee 2023-11-28, 09:58: I'm a lifeguard with multiple different additional certifications that allow me to get paid more than a standard lifeguard and I work full time to save up for tuition but it's exhausting being a manager at 16 for the city as well as school with AP classes and volunteering and I was wondering how to cope with a full schedule and if you have any tips on how to manage money in uni",,,"Mentor 2023-11-19, 14:51: Hello Hailey! Hope you are well! I just opened the ""career exploration"" module for you. Do you have any questions about the other modules or their discussions? Hope everything is going well in the school. I know it must be a very busy time and finals must be around. please feel free to share any thoughts with me about this busy time. Don't ever think you are alone, so reach out to people, your teachers and family, if you need help. Cheers, saba Mentor 2023-12-20, 11:34: Hello Hailey! Hope you are doing well and happy holidays! Now that you have done a great job completing the ""Adulting"" module, you should be looking at the ""Career Exploration"" and ""From Rural to Urban."" Please go over these modules and look at their activities. Pick some questions and send them to me so that we can discuss them further together. Enjoy your exploration and let me know if there are any questions. Cheers, saba",,,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 11:49: Hello Heiley, I'm Saba. I study biomedical physiology at SFU and I am in my last year of university. I am applying to medical school next year. I immigrated to Canada 4 years ago by myself and everything still is new to me! So I'm willing to learn many new things from you! And I can share some of my experiences as well. I viewed your profile and I think we have a lot in common! That is really exciting and I think it gives us the opportunity to have good conversations! So how the program works is that first, we work on a ""get to know you activity"", which one do you want to work on together? then you will tell me which units to unlock for your course to work on and I will do that. There are discussion questions at the end of the unit. You will ask one from me and I do the same and we move forward. Hopefully, this should go smoothly. Please let me know if I am missing something or anything else about your class requirement or yourself! Cheers, saba Mentor 2023-10-05, 10:42: Hi Haily, I haven't heard from you, so I'm just going ahead and opening the first unit for you. Hopefully, you read through it and do the activities. PLease let me know if there is any question. Cheers, saba Mentor 2023-10-14, 19:07: Hello Hailey, Hope you are doing well. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you decide to work on some of the discussion questions in this module. I can open the next module if you let me know as well. Please note that I can only put some time in a week for our conversation and if you decide to work on the modules later, I cannot efficiently respond and participate in all the discussion parts. So I recommend getting started with the modules so you have your work done by the end of the term. Cheers, saba Mentee 2023-10-16, 08:49: hey! sorry it took me so long to answer I honestly completely forgot lol but I am super interested in your carreer choice I also want to go into the medical field and honestly I've been super terrified to move away from my family as I live in a small town with a huge support system, I'm scared to lose it Mentor 2023-10-30, 18:58: Hello Hailey! It's wonderful to see that you've embarked on the lessons in this module. They have proven to be incredibly helpful as life unfolds. I'm here to provide answers to your questions to keep our conversation going. Was there anything that you thought would be easy to handle but turned out to be harder than expected? I initially believed that leaving my family and relocating to a different country would be a breeze, but I must admit, it was tougher than I had anticipated. Moving to Canada to start a new chapter in my life was a bold step, and realizing that I had no familiar faces nearby was indeed daunting. However, I refused to be discouraged and did everything in my power to make it work. Whenever I found myself in a tough and discouraging situation, I would remind myself why I had embarked on this journey and muster the courage to persevere. Nothing is insurmountable when you hold onto your motivations. Was there anything that made the transition from depenant to indepentant easier? I believe that pursuing my passions and engaging in work that truly excited me made the transition from dependence to independence much smoother. For instance, when I secured a job that I deeply valued and enjoyed, my overall outlook on life improved, and I found myself more motivated and content. Overal, I can see that you have some great life lessons already! So I'd say don't be discouraged or overthink the process or the all the things that could go wrong. Instead emphasize on the positive sides of this great life experience that you'll be heading toward. It's exciting! It's new! And it's ready to be discovered by U!!! Keep on doing the great work. And please let me know if you have any more questions. Mentor 2023-11-28, 11:46: Hello Hailey, Hope you are doing well! That is awesome that you are doing all that at such a young age. I'd say the way to keep up with all those is to love what you do! I know it sounds like a cliche and it seems impossible to love working on all these when you are just so tired, but also I think that if you love them, breathe through all these experiences, and enjoy the fact that you are such a capable person that can manage all these, would make you feel better! And as for scheduling everything, well, there is only some much that you can do. Remember that you cannot predict the future, so you won't know what is next for sure, however, the only thing you can do is to best prepare for it; in other words ""expect the best, and practice for the worst"". I think as you go on with life you'll get better and better at managing every bit of life. As of now, I don't see any gaps that feel that you don't have it. ""You do have it, gilt"" and you'll learn a lot more along the way. Trust yourself and the journey and look at every moment as an experience building up your character. Note on my story=&gt; I worked as a doordash delivery on my bike for so long to pay rent in high school!! You are in a much better position haha!! Let me know if that is helpful or if any other questions arise, Cheers, saba","Mentor 2023-10-05, 10:45: Hi Haily, I have opened this first unit for you to move into. Please let me know if there are any questions and about the activities you want to do.

The students here just hang out at their friends house because there isn't really a place in town to go for fun besides the movie theatre and walmart. Me and my friends just drive around town talking and stuff. The most popular extracurriculars here are hockey, soccer, basketball, and dance. This town is special to me because i've lived here my whole life and have many great memories. it's also where a majority of my family lives and so i never felt alone. An advantage i think i have from growing up in a rural community is how i can connect with people and making sure i don't rush things. I want to go into computer engineering and i dont know how that would help the challenges here. i guess i would help this school with all their broken and slow laptops. Are you from a rural community or city? Mentor 2023-11-07, 21:41: Hi Madison, It's great that you are enjoying the rural community. I come from a city background, the city is all I know since I was a child. I find it so precious to have strong connections with other people, and in the city it is a bit harder to have that.",,,,

Here we can discuss what it is like going from high school to post-secondary, being required to ""adult"". It can be quite the eye-opener if you aren't ready for it. Do you have any older siblings? Perhaps you have already seen someone go through the ""adulting"" process. It is not straightforward and can be overwhelming at times, but the good news is that there is a lot of support. Everyone wants you to succeed and knowing who to ask for help can make things easier. Looking forward to hearing from you! Your mentor, McKenna",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 10:37: Hi Liam!

(habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) Mentor 2023-11-25, 22:10: Hey Kenzie, no worries about the late response, I totally understand. Here are my answers to the questions: Do they have any tips on getting out of a funk? In other words, what do you do to snap out of it when they’re feeling low, or not like themselves? Personally, I enjoy talking to my friends. I find it helps to vent my frustrations and talk something out. This probably does not work for most people, but I like to think about things logically and try to solve the root of my problems and that makes me feel better. How have they navigated managing their mental health while in post-secondary school, and as an adult? Balance is very important. I try to find time for both work and play as if I only worked, I would be very burnt out and my mental health would decline. Being able to still do things you enjoy can greatly help with improving mental health. Do they have any advice for finding mental health resources? There are many resources out there! For example, my school (UBC) has some great websites with places to access mental health resources. What mental health challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? Adjusting to university might be challenging and could lead to mental health challenges. I recommend reaching out to people to talk about your issues to help overcome them and to use the resources provided by the school. On the other hand, are there any mental health benefits to being a post-secondary student and adult? I found that in university, there were many more people who were similar to me and people that I could get along with. This helped my mental health as I had more people I could relate to and have as support. What tips do they have on maintaining overall good mental health? I find that exercise is a great way to maintain good mental health. Exercise can help increase overall well-being and is necessary to balance with school. How do they prioritize self-care? What tips do they have? I like to use the recreational spaces at school to give myself some fun time to balance the large workload. After a long day of work, going to the gym or going to play table tennis with my friends was a good self-care strategy for me. My tip is to find things you enjoy doing and try to balance that with school, as you cannot always be working. Can they share any time management tips? I like using the reminders and calendar app to manage my tasks and tips. Every morning when I wake up, I schedule my day and organize what tasks I need to finish. How has the way they approach self-care changed now that they’re an adult? I learned a lot from my classes about self-care. For example, I didn't really care about my sleep schedule in the past, but I learned how important sleep really was and the science behind it. I now try to get a minimum of 7-8 hours a day. What self-care challenges should you be prepared for upon entering post-secondary and adulthood, and what can you do to overcome them? Sleep is a big thing in university. A lot of people sleep less and stay up later. My tip is to sign up for classes that are not very early in the morning so it does not affect your sleep schedule. On the other hand, what’s easier about self-care when you’re an adult and postsecondary student? In university, I have a meal plan, so food is never a worry, I just go into the dining hall and the food is made for me. Do they have any tips on breaking bad habits that lead to poor self-care? (habits like, e.g., eating fast food every day for lunch because it’s cheap and easy, staying up too late because you’re watching cute dog videos, being a workaholic, etc.) This is very difficult and I still struggle with things such as procrastination. But I found that the best thing for me was to put my phone in a place that I couldn't reach. This helped me stay more on task and not check my phone every few seconds. Mentor 2024-01-15, 11:29: Hi Kenzie, I was wondering if you ever got my message in response to your Well Being and Self Care questions? You haven't been responding and I am getting quite worried! If you do see this message is there something you would like to do next??",,"Mentee 2023-10-30, 14:37: Worksheet: Adulting 101 Extension Activity – Well-being &amp; Self Care Conversation Here are some skills and responsibilities you’ll need to take on when you’re living independently as an adult. This list is just a starting point, feel free to add to it and ask your mentor what they would add. Identify the skills you feel confident about, and which ones you need to work on. For the skills you are not feeling confident about, think of some concrete things you can do right now to start building those skills. Skill/Responsibility Confident? Concrete steps to gain experience and confidence Grocery Shopping Yes! Not Yet Cooking Healthy Meals Yes! Not Yet House Keeping/Cleaning Yes! Not Yet Getting Around Town - Using Public Transit Yes! Not Yet Finding a Doctor, Dentist, etc. and making appointments Yes! Not Yet Paying Bills (on time!) Yes! Not Yet Ask friends and family to teach me and go to the bank when receiving my first bill Doing Household Repairs/Calling for Repair Services Yes! Not Yet Banking - opening an account, making e-transfers, bank draft, writing a cheque. Yes! Not Yet Finding somewhere to live. Yes! Not Yet Talk to a relator and get some financial help to lead me in the right dirrection Hi James, I completed the worksheet about and have bolded my answers. some questions I have for you n this topic are: 1. what is something that you didn't expect you needed to know 2. what is something you shouldve brought with you 3. how much money did you need to make it comfortablely through your first yearof adulthood 4.what did you find challanging and what did you do to help yourself 5. how do i balance my healthy eating with myh budget and time 6. what are life hacks / things you leaned on 7. what were your struggles Mentor 2023-10-30, 19:16: Hi Kenzie, thanks for the questions! 1. what is something that you didn't expect you needed to know Learning to live by myself was definitely very different. Even though I have access to a meal plan at UBC, going to eat took much more time than I expected. Although I am quite proficient at time management, university took a lot more planning than expected. 2. what is something you should bring with you If this is referring to university, I have actually planned very thoroughly, though I was missing some snacks in my dorm. 3. how much money did you need to make it comfortably through your first year of adulthood Right now, I am not spending too much money, as I have already paid my tuition and my residence fees. However, if I were to live by myself and pay off things such as groceries or rent, I would assume that 60,000 a year would be needed to survive in Vancouver (this is just a complete guess). 4. what did you find challenging and what did you do to help yourself The workload in university is very different than in high school. A lot more time needs to be put into assignments and studying, and the initial adjustment was quite challenging. However, I learned that using apps (such as the Calendar app), has helped me chunk off my time and organize what I need to do. Also, deleting social media apps has helped me focus and reduce distractions. 5. how do I balance my healthy eating with my budget and time There are many great food options out there. Another option would be making your own food. Picking foods that support a healthy diet is crucial. For example, you should be eating fruits and vegetables, as they are high in antioxidants. You should reduce sodium and fat (especially trans and saturated fats) intake. 6. what are life hacks/things you learned I realized the power of using apps such as Reminders or Calendar, to schedule my time and list everything I need to do. This helped me put my priorities and goals somewhere that I would never forget. 7. what were your struggles Right now I am struggling to find time to hang out with my friends. University is getting quite busy, especially with lots of exams and assignments that are coming up. I try to incorporate exercise into my schedule, but I sometimes have to leave out socializing. However, I am trying to fit some socializing in during times where it is convenient, such as lunch or when I am volunteering.

Thanks Kenzie Mentor 2023-11-08, 16:44: Awesome, thanks for letting me know! Let's do it, I'll open it right now ??",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-20, 19:44: Hi Kenzie, I'm James, and I'm so excited to be your mentor! I just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about who I am and what I'm passionate about. Firstly, it's awesome to hear about your career aspirations in athletic physiology and your plans to study sports medicine at UBCO. I'm currently a first-year Kinesiology student at UBC, so I've got a bit of experience navigating the path you're interested in (feel free to ask me anything about it). Also, you mentioned that you were looking for advice on keeping motivated, balancing school and fitness, tips on studying, and insights into life in the big city (and other things, but I won't list them all). I really admire that dedication and curiosity, and that's how I felt in high school too. I've been swimming competitively for over 10 years, and I was even on the national team. However, the amount of training that I had every day took up a lot of time, and I had to learn how to balance swimming with school. Though, despite all of these challenges I got into all the universities I applied to, and I was hoping I could help you do the same! I was in your shoes not too long ago, and I remember stressing out about getting into university and just having so many questions (btw, I am also quite a perfectionist and I love being organized too, but we can chat about that later). But just remember that if you ever want to talk about university or need some advice about anything, feel free to reach out. Don't worry about being formal or anything like that, and you can literally ask me whatever (as long as they follow the rules lol). Anyway, I look forward to getting to know you better and it seems like we have a lot in common, so I think we'll get along really well! I'm looking forward to connecting with you and supporting you in your academic and personal pursuits!

I was just wondering if you were able to find a unit you wanted to do next? Mentee 2023-10-11, 14:47: I dont know much about living in the big city. Id like to say that I do but I really dont. I know that during busy hours I need to give myself enough time and be patient in traffic. Im really exciited to live in the city though, so much to do so many people to meet. I do stil have some questions on teh city to help me overcome my fears. 1. is there lots of drama or does things not spread very easily 2. how to i stay myself and not get caught up in crowds 3. what are healthy options for on the go 4. do u have time for the gym 5. how is school life balance 6. how do i get out there 7. is there a lot of toxic people 8. how do i not compare myself 9. your favourite part of the city 10. thoughts on vancouver? Mentee 2023-10-11, 14:49: the next unit i would like to do is ""well being and self care"" :) Mentor 2023-10-11, 23:03: Hi Kenzie, thanks for the response! It is true that traffic can get pretty bad, so be prepared :) 1. is there lots of drama or does things not spread very easily If you mean how drama spreads through the city or in school, it is how it would normally be spread. It depends on how big or small the drama is and what type of people are involved. 2. how to i stay myself and not get caught up in crowds That will be up to you! Even though a big city might have a lot of people, everyone sort of minds their own business and are busy doing whatever they need to do. Just keep being yourself and try not to let other people influence what you want to do. 3. what are healthy options for on the go Personally, I enjoy eating at Chipotle. Their bowls are pretty good and are definitely quite healthy. However, they can be a bit pricy sometimes... 4. do u have time for the gym Yes, no matter how busy it gets, you can always manage. However, at university, you have to learn how to manage your time efficiently. 5. how is school life balance School-life balance can definitely be difficult, but I find it very helpful to schedule my time using a physical or digital calendar. You can definitely manage to fit in some fun activities, but make sure to finish your work first. 6. how do i get out there If you are talking about friends, in university, everyone is super nice! Everybody is in the same boat and also wants to make friends as well, so don't be afraid to strike up a conversation. 7. is there a lot of toxic people There definitely are some toxic people, but I wouldn't say there are more here. I find everyone to be extremely nice and friendly! 8. how do i not compare myself Comparison is the thief of joy. That is definitely difficult and something that I struggle with too, but I realized that we all have very different situations and that I should be happy with who I am. Even if someone gets a better grade than me, I do not let that define me and I know that deep down, as long as I tried my best in something, I should be happy with the result. It will take time, just try your best and go day by day. 9. your favourite part of the city In general, the city is quite nice because transportation is quite convenient, and there are a lot of options for food and entertainment. 10. thoughts on vancouver? Vancouver is absolutely beautiful. We have the mountains and beach just minutes away from each other. I love the scenery and the abundance of nature.

When we arent at parties we are usually on cruises with our friends. It can be quite boring here however we make the most oyut of it. We have some amazing resturants that we tend to visit quite often. There is also the gym and work that we tend to do often as well as a few scenic trails teenagers visit when feeling like being in nature. We have lots of sports here which keeps the students in shape and out of trouble. Some include baksetball,volleyball,soccer,baseball,rock climbing, dance, figure skating, and gymnastics. Like I said before I danced my entire life up to this year and now am the senior on the volleyball team. Definetly smething new and exciting. WE LOVE SPORTS GAMES, you will always find us cheering on either our local hockey team or school teams at any tournement. We always come together to celebrate and support and take ownership of team play. My town is an island, what makes it so special to me well really its the scenery. We truly live ion a beautiful place and yes it may be boring as teengagers however it brings us closer and makes bonds stronger. questions: 1. Living in a rural community has taught me how to be friendly It has also taught me that the little things in life are what really matter. I will take these things into my future whether that be for school or work, I will rememeber the kind person I was raised to be and the poeple who have taught me that its okay to be small at times. LIfe is to short to not enjoy it, and with that I will enjoy every little thing possible. 2. I will use what I learn in school to help young athletes like myself to become successful. I will help them with their recovery processes and volunteer at our local events with taping sports injuries. WE have good talent here and I would hate to see it go to waste over an injuring. Its an inspiring future generation. How have your experiences differed from mine, how are our experiences simular James. Mentor 2023-10-21, 20:16: Hi Kenzie, It's great to hear about your experiences and how they've shaped you. It's clear that living in a small, close-knit community has taught you valuable lessons about the importance of kindness and appreciating the little things in life. These lessons can indeed be applied in various aspects of your future, be it in school, work, or personal life. I can relate to the idea that life is too short not to enjoy it fully. We all have unique experiences that shape us, and I've had my own set of experiences that have influenced my perspective. In my own experiences, I've lived in diverse urban environments and had the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds, which has taught me the value of cultural diversity and open-mindedness. I've also had the chance to pursue a wide range of educational and career opportunities, which has broadened my perspective on life and its possibilities. Also, it's wonderful that you want to use your knowledge to help young athletes and support their recovery processes. Your dedication to your local community and its talented young individuals is awesome! Keep up the good work Kenzie, and thanks for sharing.",,,,

I'm in the Bachelor of Science + Master of Management Dual Degree, so I'm both in the Faculty of Science and Sauder at the same time. I love playing sports, listening to music, watching YouTube, going on social media, and talking to people in my free time. I see on your profile that you are really into business and sports. That is pretty cool! It also mentions that you have an interest in becoming a barber! What sports do you like to play? Have you taken any action or steps for your business ideas, maybe a barber shop? Mentee 2023-11-22, 23:26: Hi, Jason I am very sorry for leaving you in the dark and not emailing you back, I've been very busy and lazy as well if I'm being honest. Mentor 2023-11-27, 00:31: Hi Keanen. No worries at all! Take all the time you need to get ready and let me know when you start on the modules and if there's anything I can help you with.","Mentor 2023-10-07, 21:31: Hi Keanen!

I've been told that the last day you have to work on this program is January 26th. I wanted to let you know that you are welcome to continue working on the program or chatting with me afterwards if you would like. Just let me know! :) If not, no worries! I have enjoyed talking to you and I wish you all the best!",,,"Mentor 2023-11-16, 18:37: Hi again, hopefully now you’ve found the Adulting unit! To start you can do the warm-up activity if you’d like, which is to think about what you know about being an adult. After that I think it would be good to work on the worksheet. You can find it by clicking “Background Info” under lesson 1. Then under the first instruction there is a link to a table/worksheet that you can fill out. This worksheet will get you to think about some adult skills that you may or may not feel confident with. Afterwards we can talk about it! If you have any trouble finding out the worksheet, or if you have any questions please let me know! :) Mentor 2023-12-05, 17:38: Hi Jayne, how are you doing? I just wanted to check in, have you found the Adulting unit and/ or are you ready to work on it together? Please let me know if you have any questions! :) Mentor 2023-12-19, 14:37: Hi Jayne, I just wanted to check in again. I hope you are doing good! I know it's a busy time, and Winter Break is soon... do you have any fun activities planned during Winter Break? Also, I would be happy to work on the program with you over the break too! I'm available anytime :) Mentee 2024-01-25, 09:36: Hi there! I apologize for not responding. I really appriciate you and your time in this program. Thank you. I took a look at the adulting questions and here is some thoughts I had... Some thoughts about being an adult is paying bills and working. Going out into the real world under your own supervision. Something that puzzles me about adult responsibilities is having to work all the time. It totally puzzles me that in order to have a balanced life to pay for food, activities, and other stuff we need to work every week to provide for ourselves and family. Why can't everything be free and we can just survive and travel. But I know that that wouln't work well if everything was free. To explore skills about transitioning into adulthood I think getting a job and traveling can help. Getting a job can build skills like being punctual, work ethic, and creating relationships with people in your community. I am excited to move on from highschool and experience the world in a differnt way!",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-25, 15:46: Hi Jayne, my name is Anita! I took a look at your profile and it looks like we have lots in common! I’m also Indigenous and like outdoor activities, sports and science. I particularly enjoy mountain biking, snowboarding and playing ringette (a sport played on ice that’s similar to hockey). I recently finished my Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry at UBC. I’m also interested in marine biology and last summer I got to work in a marine science lab with jellyfish and salmon. I’m looking forward to working with you in this program! For the program we need to work through the from rural to urban unit first, career exploration second and adulting third. After that we can do any other two units that you would like. Let me know if you have any questions about how the program works, or if you have any questions for me. Whenever you’re ready we can get started on the From Rural to Urban unit. :) Mentee 2023-10-02, 20:02: Hello! This is exciting, I am looking forward to getting used to this platform and working through these units. I also look forward to hearing you're experience in the marine science lab! I have also worked in a lab for water testing and love the experience I am getting. I am still getting used to this site and learning slowly how to navigate through all the tabs and buttons. I will get the starter photos off as soon as I can. Thank you for your patience and I look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentor 2023-10-03, 11:32: Hi Jayne! I'm also excited for this program, and that sounds like such a cool lab experience! Also your class will be starting the From Rural to Urban unit this week, so I went ahead and opened it up for you. After we’re finished with the Start Here unit you can access it by clicking that unit on Navigation wheel. Mentor 2023-10-11, 14:46: Hi Jayne! How are you doing? I went through my photos for the photo swap activity and found these that I'd like to share with you. The first one is a picture that I took of a river. I chose this picture because I love spending time in nature. I think it is so beautiful and the sounds of the water, wind and birds are very calming to me. Mentor 2023-10-11, 14:47: The second picture I chose to share is of a bouquet of flowers that was on the table at a family member's wedding. I thought that this arrangement was really pretty. This photo also reminds me of this special day and how my family was all together and having a great time. If you have any photos that you'd like to share for this activity then feel free to can send them when you can. Also I want to make sure that we stay on track with your class, so if you'd like to get started on the From Rural to Urban unit please let me know. :) Mentor 2024-01-16, 12:31: Hi Jayne, just checking in again! How was your winter break and first week back to school? When you get the chance to work on the program we can start with Lesson 1 of the Adulting unit. To find the unit you can click on ""Adulting"" in the wheel at the top of the page. Mentor 2024-01-26, 12:21: Hi Jayne, no problem! I'm happy to help! Yeah, I agree. It would be so nice if we didn't have to work, but it's the only way to get money and be able to afford to live and do fun things (like travel). Although, there are lots of fun jobs out there, so it's possible to find a job that you enjoy so that it doesn't feel like work. I remember you mentioned that you were interested in museums and the rematriation of Indigenous artifacts, such as totem poles. A job in this area might also allow you to travel while working if you have to travel somewhere to see/ find these items, so thats something to thing about! You're also right that getting a job can help you build important skills too! Please let me know if you have any other questions about this unit or anything else. I'm happy to answer your questions or continue chatting even after the program is finished!","Mentor 2023-10-17, 11:28: Hi Jayne! I hope you are doing well! You class will be starting the Adulting unit this week, so I just opened that unit for you. To access the units, you can click on that unit in the circle/ wheel at the top of the page. When you get the chance to work on the program, we can start the From Rural to Urban unit. :) I am from a big city in the lower mainland. I am interested to hear more about where you are from. What is your favourite thing about your community? I'm also interested to hear your thoughts on these questions: - What are some strengths that you have gained as a result of living in a rural community? How will these strengths give you a leg up in your education or career? - How might you use your future education or career to help address some of the challenges your community faces? Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:26: Hi there, My favorite thing about my community is the friendlyness and nature. Everyone knows everyone and gives a wave or hi passing. The land we live on is gorgeous, there is the ocean right beside us, with mountains surrounding! It rains A. LOT. here and I am grateful for the people I know that offer rides when they see me walking. I do enjoy walking in the rain though! Some strengths I have gained living in a rural community is wanting to help volunteer. Everyone has close connections with one another and i've had many amazing opportunites to volunteer at a fish hatchery. Having experience with volunteering, and reaching out will help me in my education because it will give me that extra step to feel comfortable putting my self out there to help others and gain new expeiences. haha i got excited for this next question. My education plan is to go into Indigenous studies, anthropology, and what working is museums is like. This will help adress my communitie/nations close to my community by learning and educating people on ways of living, and bringing artifacts back home. I recently attened a Pole Rematriation, it was a real eye opener and made me decide on what my post secondary focus was going to be. I have done lots of research on the pole that was returned home and asked family members about the history. I want to saftely bring back the other poles that were stolen years ago. Apologies for the long long wait for response. I appriciate you opening the other units! Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:26:  Mentor 2023-10-29, 18:20: Hi Jayne, thanks so much for sharing! Your community sounds amazing, it's great that everyone is so friendly! It rains so much where I live too lol, but at least the nature on the west coast is so pretty and it makes up for all the rain!! It’s also good that you’ve had the opportunity to gain volunteer experience, I agree that it’s great for building confidence! That’s great to hear that you are interested in Indigenous studies! I took two courses in the Indigenous studies department, both of them were about Indigenous language revitalization and documentation, and they were some of my favourite courses I took at UBC. I remember we talked a lot about the work being done to return artifacts. There is still so much work to be done and I think it’s such an important area to be a part of. Do you have any questions for me about what it’s like to live in the city? I’m also happy to answer any other questions you may have. If you don’t have any questions we can move ahead to the Adulting unit! :) Mentee 2023-10-30, 14:19: Hi there, One question I have, is what are ways to get used to living in a city and traffic. Is it best to have a car, walk, bike, or take a bus? Mentor 2023-10-31, 14:57: Hi Jayne, good question! I think it depends how far you live from work and/or school. If you are able to live close to school/work then walking, biking or taking the bus would all be great options, but if you live far away then travelling by car would be best. I lived on campus for my first year of university, and I didn’t have a car and walked to my classes. It was great, I never had to deal with any traffic and it was also good exercise! I lived at home for the other years and it was a really long commute. I mostly drove/ carpooled, and the drive took about 1 hour, but sometimes longer when there was lots of traffic. I had to take the bus a handful of times, and it took me about 2 hours to get to school from my house! It was definitely a challenge and I lost a lot of my free time. If you live in the city I would definitely recommend living closer to school/ work so that you can walk or bike, but it depends on what works better for you. For me it was more affordable to buy an older used car and live at home, than pay the high price for housing at UBC. Mentor 2023-11-10, 11:06: Hi Jayne, how are you? I just wanted to follow up with you. Did I answer your question, and/or do you have any other questions for me? If not, then I think it would be good to start the Adulting unit next. :) Mentee 2023-11-16, 14:33: Hi there, apologies for not responding. That did answer my question perfectly! thank you. I'm not sure what to press for the next unit to start. But I will start thinking of questions!! Mentor 2023-11-16, 18:36: No problem! To go to the next unit click on “Adulting” in the wheel near the top of the page. Then we can start working on Lesson 1, which is called Adulting 101!",,,,

I'll also have to cook for myself which will be interesting. money mangement is also something ill need to learn before i move. What did they find surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? Can they share advice about building the skills you are not yet confident in? -janelle Mentor 2023-10-31, 14:50: It is stressful! Especially if you are living on your own for the first time. I was lucky that I could live with my parents, but I assume you'll be living in residence? Luckily they're great about helping first years navigate living by themselves for the first time, and you won't have to cook all your own meals! If you're living by yourself in an apartment or something you will, but then you get more choice about what you make! I also don't know how to do taxes. If you have family that does it for you know, you can usually get them do it even if you're not living together. Or, take the time to go through it with them this summer and learn! Money management is HUGE. When you're spending the whole day at Uvic in clases, then studying, then maybe going to a club meeting, then meeting a friend, and then playing intramural sports or something the temptation to buy all your meals and snacks and special drinks is huge. I'm still learning how to say no! But designating certain days as ""no spend days"" has helped me. I think for me a big thing that was surprising was how profs treat you differently compared to highschool teachers - there is a lot less handholding when it comes to assignments and tests. You find out when everything is due at the start of term, but then most profs don't give too many reminders! That being said, I still like university more and the majority of mine have been amazing.

I'm not sure if you submit this to anyone except me, but if you do, you could change your ""I'm not sure""s to ""TBD (to be determined/decided"" or ""not applicable"". I did not live in residence, but I had tonnes of friends who did. They did not love the meal plan at Uvic so ended up buying way more groceries and eating out than they were planning to. First year you don't have acess to a kitchen so as for groceries it's more like cup noodles, vegetables and fruit (because you will not eat enough from the dining hall) and drinks. You could definitely cut that out though. In terms of eating out, again, that's very dependent on you. I know some people who only ate food from the meal plan, but others who door dashed 2 dinners a week, went out for lunch on the weekend and bought Starbucks (which is on campus) every day. I would plan to budget a little more for eating out just because first week when you're making friends at orientation or going downtown, grabbing food is one of the biggest things students do. Public transit in terms of the bus is actually free! It's included with our tuition at Uvic students. It's a super great way to get around and most people take it everywhere. From Uvic it's easy to get anywhere so most first year students don't have a car here. None of my friends did first year did, but now they do because they live a 20 minute drive from campus. If you think you can get away with not having a car first year I'd suggest it because parking is super expensive at Uvic, our gas prices are insane in Victoria and honestly you probably won't need it. Second year it's really useful though. We have taxis and uber in Victoria, but most people don't use them unless they've been drinking downtown and it's late enough the busses have stopped running. Unless you'll be 19 it's not really applicable to you in first year. Unfortunately you will likely have to pay for the gym (it's called CARSA), which is decently expensive. I think there is a smaller gym at UVic called Mckinnon that might be free (not positive) but almost everyone goes to CARSA because it's a way better facility, has more equipment and more space so even though it's busier, it feels less busy. I might also budget more money for entertainment as there is lots to do in Victoria that as you're making friends you might want to do. With my friends I often go rock climbing, play mini golf, go to movies, go to the board game cafe, etc. The debt repayment will only apply if you're getting a credit card (you can't till you're 19) or getting student loans (your family will have to decide). Great that you're planning to work! I wouldn't plan on too many shifts a week though as the transition from highschool to university in terms of workload is insane and you don't want to fall behind. My friends work 2 times a week. I sugggest talking to your family about how much they're planning to contribute (you can show them your budget sheet) and whether or not they have an RESP. Everyone's family does it differently - I live at home so my parents cover my basics and food but I pay for anything extra (entertainment, clothes, going out, etc), some of my friends are given a certain amount at the start of the school year and they have to make it last, some do sort of a montly ""allowance"", and some just request money when they need it. I know it's awkward but it's better to have the conversation earlier so you can plan your university experince better. Let me know if you have any other questions and I hope this helped! Mentor 2024-01-15, 11:46: Hi Janelle! I hope you had a great Winter break, I just wanted to check in and see how your progress is going. Let me know if I can do anything to help! I will open up the next unit, so if you prefer to work on it, you can.

How have your experiences with both places shaped your feelings?"" You are absolutely not required to tell me your answer, but I would love to know. We will then work through the lesson 1 discussion questions, where it asks you to share some challenges and advantages you have experienced living in a rural area.

Manyu students extracurriculars are sports like soccer, dance,and hockey. this town is special to me because of the family i have here. What are some strengths that you have gained as a result of living in a rural community? How will these strengths give you a leg up in your education or career? strengths i have gained from living in a rural area is becoming more rescourseful. living here you have to become creative if you want something done. This will help me after highschool, to help me figure out different ways to find help if and when i am struggling. How might you use your future education or career to help address some of the challenges your community faces? my future career as a pshycologist would benifit my commiunty in many ways. there are many people struggling with mental health issue here. coming back home to become a theripest or something in that feild would help my community since there is a lack of mental health rescoures here. Mentor 2023-10-26, 21:32: Thanks so much for your response Janelle! There are definitely some similarities between Prince Rupert and Victoria - most students here also play sports, going on drives with your friends is always fun and Victoria is also special to me because of family. I have all my family on my mom and dad's side here, which definitely contributed to me wanting to stay here for university. I strongly agree living in a rural community will make you a resourceful student, and I think it's awesome you are considering a career as a psychologist or therapist back in your hometown. Uvic has some awesome clubs you can check out if you come here. Lots of peer mentoring, mental health support and psychology clubs. For the next lesson, feel free to share some advantages and disadvantages you think there are to living in a city (even Victoria specifically if you want to) and ask me some questions about living in a city, especially for school. Looking forward to hearing from you, Annika Mentee 2023-10-27, 16:27: What do you already know about living in a city? i honesty just go there for vacations so i really do not know much about normal life in the city. Share your feelings about city life. I visit victoria frequently because i have a lot of family there. i love it there it kind of reminds me of Rupert in way. lots of pretty places to visit. Vic also has nice beacghes which is something rupert is lacking. What you think are some advantages and challenges of city life? some of the challeges of living in a bigger city i would assume is the traffic. advantages i would say their are more opptions fo hobbies. What are some advantages and challenges of city life? What are some things you can do to get acquainted to life in a new city? Mentor 2023-10-29, 11:27: Hi! Thanks for your quick response. I like Victoria because it is a nice sized city - big enough that there are tonnes of restaurants and things to do, but small enough that we do have nature (the beaches are gorgeous like you said) and there are close by hiking trails and camping. It does feel like everyone knows everyone, but I'm guessing that's even more so in Prince Rupert? Also Victoria is great for students because the city is centered around the university. All the busses start and end at Uvic so it's easy to get to and from the university. One disadvantage is definetely traffic which can be avoided by using our numerous bike lanes and the insane cost of living - housing and food is crazy expensive here. My biggest tip would be that if you're living on campus first year, go downtown and check out what Victoria has to offer. I know so many people who basically just stayed on campus the whole year, which means you don't get acquainted with city life at all. We can start on ""adulting"" now if you'd like to get us started.",,,,

So I have opened up the well-being and self-care module As a warm-up discussion, tell me about the ways you feel you practice healthy habits physically, mentally and emotionally! Mentee 2023-11-20, 02:08: Hi, I thought a bit about how I practice my personal well being and self care and came up with a few things. For my physical health I am definitely doing enough. I train in the pool 9 times a week and go to the gym 4 times a week for my training. Even though all of the physical activity is good for my health, overdoing it has caused me some shoulder injuries which I am trying to fix with exercises given by my physiotherapist. Eating a healthy balanced diet is something I also practice which I really enjoy. I also give my self days off to give myself a break from swimming. On these days I like to relax with a hot drink and a book or show. Something to get my mind off things. I am ok mentally and emotionally. I sometimes get super overwhelmed with school, relationships and swimming that I knew I needed to find some kind of outlet. I started journaling and practicing gratitude which has helped. Finding even a single good thing in my day has made me feel grateful for where I am. Once a week I practice meditation in class and I have found that this has also made me feel much calmer. I want to continue it in the future. Being around the right people can also affect how I feel and deal with things. I know by now who can support me through bad moments and who can't. Surrounding myself with positive people has definitely helped how I think as well. I wasn't quite sure what the difference between mental and emotional well being was but I hope I covered them. Hope to hear back soon, Iona Mentor 2023-11-21, 23:38: Nice! I can tell from the amount you swim you are a competitive swimmer! I too was a competitive summwer and can relate to the morning and night workouts. Do you have a favourite event you like to swim? My favourite was the 100 free as I really struggled with distance events. Mental wellness has more to deal with your thoughts. For example are you always thinking about exams or homework and that keeps you stressed? Emotional wellness has more to deal with your feelings. For example if you wake up and you feel sad, why is it that you feel sad? It is awesome to hear you journal and practice gratitude. This is very important as you mature as you start to recognize how fortunate you are and shouldnt compare yourself to someone else who may seem as they have more benefits in life. As we dive into the unit, take a look at the youtube video associated with Lesson 1. it discusses ways to recognize when we need a self-care break. After watching the video, let me know what signs do you know that tell you that you need self-care! Keep up the great work! Mentee 2023-11-23, 14:04: 100 free is a stressful event for me because I either do very well or very bad in it. My goal is to go under a minute this year but it's going to be hard. My favourite events are 50 fly and 100 breast. My best event is 200 fly which is brutal but oh well. I am also not a distance swimmer. When you were in highschool and early university how did you deal with your mental health? As a swimmer how did you deal with doing bad in a race or not making a time standard you were aiming for? What did you do when you were missing home or got stressed out with school work? I look forward to hearing back soon, Iona Mentor 2023-11-23, 14:47: Wow that is impressive. Believe it or not, 200 fly is the only event I never attempted to swim in my entire career (I swam competitively for 12 years). I do believe that 400IM is better than 200 fly but both I would say are quite brutal. I will be honest that early on in my highschool and early university, I did not have healthy coping habits for mental health. I would often eat a bunch of junk food or candy because I thought that even after I stopped swimming, my body would would still be healthy and fit. As I got later into my university life, I realized it was important to keep up with exercise even if it was only for 15 minutes. This can be really hard for swimmers espcially since we are used to long workouts and dry land but consistency even if its short time is really important to staying physically fit and having good mental health. As a swimmer in terms of a bad race, I have actually had a lot of time to think about this one. When I swam, I used to get so stressed out with trying to make a certain time to either qualify for nationals or certain swim meets and I would be devastated when I did not get those times because I thought it eliminated all chances of swimming competitively in university. In the end, I did not end up swimming at University and I am kinda glad that I didnt since the school workload was quite heavy. If I were to tell my younger self anything about competitive swimming, I would say there is a beginning and an ending where you will no longer swim and after years have gone by, you wont think and have memories about the time you didnt get a best time or you didnt finish as well as you wanted to. Rather you will remember your teammates, the fun of actually racing and random things that made you laugh while you swam. Based on that, to answer your question, I would tell you to try and live in the moment when you swim and think about good things and why you keep swimming because those are the true memories you will still have rather than the bad race you had. My last answer sort of answers your next question. When I moved to Montreal for school, I found my times often hating being there due to different culutre and environment. However, years later I have learned to appreciate how unique of an experience it was to live in a new town across the country. I think when you are missing home and being stressed with school work try and live in the moment and recognize these troubles wont last forever. For example, go out for walks and experience the new environment you are in and remember you may never experience this again. Also remember university is a unique place and time where it is really easy to reach out to peers/professors around you for help. Great work on your self investigation. Keep this document as a reference as you move on to Lesson 2 where you will design an action plan when you have warning signs of burnout Mentee 2023-11-29, 14:52: Hi, thank you for sharing about your swimming experience. I found it very helpful and interesting. Here is the second lesson assignment. How did you work on breaking bad habits that weren't great for your health? How did you prioritize your self care throughout highschool and university? Hope to hear back soon, Iona Mentor 2023-11-30, 23:00: Good work on your assignment! it is great to hear you have a plan to eat and sleep healthy and if things dont go according to plan you can still love and appreciate yourself. In terms of breaking bad habits, I think over time i recognized the importance of self care. I think i already mentioned this, but as competitive athletes we are so used to training for long sessions and having additional activities such as dryland. Moving into university, you will find yourself a lot busier and you can still prioritize your self care by setting aside exercise. The challenge in this will be it wont be as long or as vigourous and that is ok. The key to self care throughout university is small consistent amounts of self care whether that be through the food you eat, how much you exercise and how much you sleep. Great work on this unit! Let me know if you have any further questions. If not, let me know which unit you would like to do and we can move on to your final unit! You are almost done! keep up the good work Iona!",,"Mentor 2023-09-27, 20:06: Awesome! So I have opened up the adulting unit for us. Just to get the ball rolling here so we can have something to talk about, if you could share what you think you know about adulting, what questions you have about adulting and things you want to explore about adulting. Share as much you feel comfortable with and don't be afraid to ask questions! Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:55:  Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:56: I decided to do the adulting unit. That was the list. Iona Mentor 2023-10-29, 19:57: Hey Iona! It is great to hear from you again! We can start with the adulting unit since picked that one first. Awesome work on the identifying what skills and responsiblitles you are confident and not confident for adulting. I see you have confidence in grocery shopping, cleaning and finding a doctor. Those skills/responsiblitiles are absolutely crucial in having a healthy lifestyle and gaining independence on your own so that is amazing to see. In terms of things I see you are not that confidence such as bill, household repairs and banking, I can offer my 2 cents on some of this because I have had direct experience. For bills (theres going to be a lot lol) whether that be credit cards, phone bills, internet bills, electricity bills or water bills, the single most important thing is to pay as soon as possible. The reason for this is that if you dont pay the bills and you miss the deadline, interest (punishment for missing the payment on time) is added on to your bill making it even more expensive. So as soon as you get an email saying your monthly bill has arrived, make sure you pay it off. For household repairs, I have found that most of the time Youtube or the internet is your best friend as long as you have the right tools accessible. However, if something feels dangerous or you do not have the right equipment, it is best to call the professionals. In banking, theres many different aspects and all can be confusing so it is best to set up an appointment with an advisor to go over certain details. For me, a big mistake I made was not knowing the difference between a chequing account and savings account when purchasing groceries. If you use a debit card when purchasing, it will ask between choosing your chequing account and savings account. A chequing account will not punish you for using/withdrawing money. A savings account on the otherhand will charge a fee (say $5 dollars) for every withdraw you make. So as a tip of advice, make sure to always choose chequing account if you are purchasing something at a store. Awesome work once again on your worksheet. Feel free to ask any questions you have about adulting that are on your mind. If you dont have any feel free to move on to Lesson 2: on creating a budget. I look forward to seeing your worksheet for this one and hearing from you soon! Philip Mentee 2023-10-30, 16:34: Here is my budgeting worksheet. I found that for some of the expenses it was asking for did not apply to me yet so I just lableled them TBA for now. I also was not sure if I would really spend that much on entertainment and clothing so I was wondering it was a reasonable price limit. And I was assuming there would not be a free gym or pool facility at the university so I just added a yearly membership. I will try and keep up with these units :) Hope to hear from you soon, Iona Mentor 2023-11-01, 10:23: Hi Iona, Great work once again on your budgeting worksheet! Just a few things I would like to point out: Rent prices can vary greatly depending on where and how you live. For example, when I was at university, I chose to live very close to the school and this meant the rent prices were much more expensive than if I lived further away. Additionally, I also lived downtown and this also had an impact on raising the price of the apartment. A good possible way to offset if the housing is expensive, is finding roomates. I will say however, make sure you are comfortable and understand who you will be living with in the event that conflicts arise. In terms of cellphone, while there are affordable options that cover unlimited call and texting, consider the location you will be in as certain places may not have easily accessible wifi. This means data may be a requirment and may be of additional cost. As a final point, groceries similar to rent may have differences depending on location. As such it is important to have the thought that you may need to spend more on groceries than anticipated. This probably was my most difficult aspect in terms of budgeting. As we wrap up this discussion, do you have any questions remaining about adulting or budgeting? If not feel free to start on the rural to urban discussion! I look forward to hearing you soon!",,,"Mentor 2023-11-05, 23:04: As a warm up to this new unit of career exploration, feel free to share as much as you are comfortable with, what kind of career dreams did you have before or still have? Keep up the great work Iona! Look foward to hearing from you soon Mentee 2023-11-06, 14:33: Hi thse are some of my values regarding my future career. Do you know of some other careers that might fit my values as well? How did your values help you choose a career or degree? Hope to hear back soon! Iona Mentor 2023-11-06, 16:27: Hi Iona, Thank you for sharing your values and interests with regards to your career. Similar to you, I also enjoyed the sciences such as biology and chemistry and had the same values that I wanted to help people. Some possible careers that would also interest you are: - Physician -Pharmacist -Biochemist -Health Regulator - Pharmaceutical Research and Development and plenty more options than what I have just listed. I think the big question going forward is what kind of environment do you want to be helping people in? Inside a clinic? More behind the scences? your own independent practice? Within a large company? I think these questions can only be answerd through experience to find out what you like and dont like. As I have a listed a few things here, take a look at the videos from rural doctor, medical officer and nurse in lesson 1. These professions are all involved in helping people but there are quite a few differences. What do you notice about the way they go about their job? What values do you think they have beyond just helping people? What things do you like and dont like about each profession? Looking forward to hearing your answers about the videos soon! Mentee 2023-11-08, 14:09: Oh sorry I completely forgot to talk about the videos I watched haha. I watched the video of the rural doctor and the rural nurse. I don't think I want to work in a clinic. I want to help from behind the scenes, through research and experimenting. I think I also want to be more involved with sciences because as much as I enjoy math I struggle with it sometimes. Like in the video of the rural doctor I want to have a good balance between work and having fun. I don't think I woud enjoy being one of the only doctor's in the town's vincinity for hours. Being a doctor overall is a lot of stress and resbonsibility. They are constantly working. I know that's how life will be after university but I don't want to have a job that is that time consuming. I also agree that a great motivation to help others is from the seeing the situation of your own community like the rural nurse. I think staying within the community is great especially if it is a rural place that is in need for doctor's. I unfortunately want to leave anyways. I might come back in the future but I want to figure myself out at school first. About your interest in sciences, did you end up getting a profession in that area or are you working towards it?

Hope to hear back soon, Iona Mentee 2023-11-08, 14:15: I'm sorry for sending that last message multiple times! I was having trouble sending it. Mentee 2023-11-15, 23:51: Hi here is my career discovery assignment. How did you decide on you career? Were there any things you wish you’d known about career choices while you were still in high school? Hope to hear back soon, Iona Mentor 2023-11-18, 16:56: Great work on your career discovery assignment! What were you feelings overall on being provided as chemists, meteorologist and information systems analysts as your top three results? I think in choosing my career, I based it on a combination of things that I was good at (chemistry, communication skills) and the environment I wanted to be in (fast paced, always new). If I were to say something I wish I knew from high school, I would say don't get fixated on one job/career. Often times there's multiple different options open and by fixating on one career, you miss a lot of opportunities that could have been had. So while it is very important to have a goal/destination in mind, don't be afraid to explore different options and career paths. As we have completed this unit, do you have any questions regarding career choice? If not, we have covered all the required units for your class and you can now select 2 we have not covered from the green circle above? Let me know which ones interest you :) Mentee 2023-11-18, 19:43: Hi I would like to continue on with the well being and self care unit. Hope you're having a good weekend, Iona",,,"Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:26: Hi, This is my I am poem. I look forward to hearing from you! Iona Mentor 2023-09-21, 21:08: Hi Iona! Thank you for sending me your poem! I learned a lot about you! My name is Philip and I will be your mentor this semester! From the poem you sent, I can see you enjoy time at the pool and salmon. I too also enjoy swimming and eating salmon espcially when it is in poke bowls. I can also tell you have some interesting stories about the times your dad failed gym class and your mom's life in Japan. We can explore these topics/stories if you feel comfortable sharing them. A little bit about me, is that my favorite food is lasagna and my hobbies include swimming, kayaking and cooking new recipies. My dream place to be would be Cannon Beach in Oregon. My least favorite food surprisngly is cheese cake. Do you have any foods you dislike? Do you have any activities or hobbies you really like or dislike? Share as much as you feel comfortable with! Look forward to hearing you soon! :) Mentee 2023-09-26, 08:07: What?! You don't like cheesecake? I like cheesecake but my favourite desert would probably be an apple or berry crumble. I've mentioned that I like salmon and swimming in my poem but the other things like the stories and culture of my place not so much. I didn't find the poem prompts very accurate to describing who I am. I love reading, and playing piano and watching anime. And my cat Wendy. Mentor 2023-09-26, 15:33: I would have to apple crumble is something i would want as a dessert. It is true that sometimes the poem/assignment can constrain who we are and what we like so thank you for sharing about your other passions such as piano and reading as well as your pet cat Wendy. Now that we have been introduced to each other, it is time to jump into the material. From the Green Circle above, your teacher would like us to explore and discuss the following topics: - From Rural to Urban - Career Exploration, - plus 2 of your choice Let me know which one you would like to start with first and I can unlock the topic for us to explore :) Hope your week is off to a good start and look forward to hearing from you soon! Mentee 2023-09-27, 01:03: I would like to talk about the adulting unit. I know I want to leave home after highschool and this will definitely be a struggle for me. Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:27: Hi I'm sorry I have not responded in awhile. Other activities got in the way and I have not been keeping up with this well. Shoul I first complete the rural to urban unit or the adulting unit? At this point I'm fine doing either. Mentor 2023-11-10, 22:11: Hi Iona, It is great to see your well thought out responses to both videos you watched. You raised very good and valid points with respect to both careers and it is amazing to see you have already thought out about what you want your future to look like following graduation at university! I agree you with you that leaving for university might help inspire you or show you another path you have never previously thought about in pursing. In terms of your question about my interests in science, I am currently wokring towards that and I am very close to landing a position with that profession. I currently have a background knowledge in pharmacy and I close to landing a position within the pharmaceutical industry. I will say that, with pursuing a career in the sciences, it is important to also be able to combine it with with another aspect such as business so that you are able to communicate your ideas and knowledge to someone who may not have that background. If it is of interest to you, I would be happy to go more in-depth to different career routes you can pursue with research and experimenting. If not, feel free to move on to career exploration lesson 2, and take one of the WorkBC Career discovery quizzes. Share how you feel about your results such as was it surprsing to you? did you not like your results? did you find out something new? Keep up the great work Iona! I am very happy with the progress and enjoy reading your thoughts. Look forward to hearing from you soon Mentee 2023-12-01, 14:55: Hi, I was looking through the units and I think I want to do the dis and misimformation unit. Hope to hear back soon, Iona","Mentee 2023-11-01, 23:29: Here is my rural to urban assignment. Hope you are well, Iona Mentor 2023-11-03, 18:44: Hi Iona, Thank you for your very informative piece about your town and school. Your school definetly has a lot to offer and I noticed you mentiond you are someone who competes in competitions. What sports or activities do you enjoy doing the most at your school? In terms of getting around a big town, an added benefit is that there are buses and trains that come a lot more often and run a lot longer so it is possible to get around rather quickly. It is great to hear that you have a plan to pursue a career in the sciences! I find your purpose for why you want to do the sciences very inspiring and I believe you will create a meaningful impact in the future. For the next activity in lesson 2, watch the video attached in the link and notice the difference in transition from rural to urban. What thoughts or feelings do you get from watching the video? Let me know what are you thoughts on city living and feelings on city life! Keep up the great work! Mentee 2023-11-04, 23:10: Hi, I watched the video. It definitely made city living look super busy and stressful. There also seemed to be so much opportunity and action going on. Did you grow up in a rural or urban setting? Iona Mentor 2023-11-05, 23:02: Yes, I agree the city can be quite overwhelming for some. From the video, I recognize the city is actually Montreal because of the blue subway trains they show. I know this because I lived in Montreal as a unversity for 5 years there as a student. Prior to that I grew up in urban setting. However, my grandparents live in a very rural part and I would spend my summers there. I think the best part of living in a city as you already mentioned is the opportunity. Opportunity can quite literally mean in anything such as finding a new job, making friends, trying new food, doing fun activities and unique and interesting events. At the same time, opportunity also draws a lot of people and this can mean a lot of competition, crowds and noise. I think if you were to move to an urban area, the most important thing and tip I would provide would be to get out there and explore to see what it offers. This can be very difficult at first, but i think it is important to see, feel and understand the differences between rural and urban. Do you have any questions with regards to moving from rural to urban? If not i have opened the next unit which is Career exploration","Mentor 2023-12-01, 16:24: Awesome! I have opened up the unit for us. As a warm up activity, think and reflect back on stories you heard about growing up that turned out to be untrue. What aspect of the story made you believe it in the first place? Mentee 2023-12-04, 21:29: In the past I think I believed stories that were believeable. Like if a specific person had done something similar to what was being said about them then I believed that it must be true. I also believed the stories if I heard many people say the same thing or something close to the original story. I know that I should never assume and I was probably not helping the rumors by listening and talking about them. It is even harder in a really small town where everyone knows everybody. Hope to hear back soon, Iona Mentor 2023-12-06, 03:11: Its only natural to assume that what the person is telling you is the truth because you wish that they have your best interests at heart. However, this is not always the case. Take a look at the 2 links within the background material under Lesson 1 where it discusses how to identify and what to do with fake news. With the popularity of social media, it is only natural for us to post or view content online. What kind of emotions do you feel when you post and share content on social media? Mentee 2023-12-29, 02:00: Hello, I hope you have been having a nice winter break. I'm sorry I have not responded in awhile. December was busy with application deadlines and tests. I thought about how emotions play into what I choose to click on and share on social media and I would say I do not think about it too much. I normally end up sharing videos of my interests with friends and I have never really thought about the consequences just because they did not seem harmful to anyone. I am careful with what I post. I grew up without social media until grade 10 so I was already semi knowledgeable about the danger of mis and dis information. Even though most of the students think they know everything about social media, it really did help to have presentations throughout our school life to help us become more aware fo the situation of mis and dis information. It is a skill to have especially with newer technology making it harder to spot fake sites and videos on the internet. What habits have you developed to avoid mis and dis information? How do you deal with accidentally spreading misinformation? Happy holidays, Iona Mentor 2023-12-30, 08:56: Hi Iona! I hope your holiday season has been going well and I fully understand how busy application and exam sesason can be. It is good to hear that you are aware and are careful of what you post to social media, since everyone's digital footprint can always be traced no matter even if the content is deleted. I think for me to avoid mis and dis information, I try and read multiple news sources and try to find the middle ground between the 2. I have found that the truth is always in the middle or where the content being discussed is the same. Like you, I too am very careful with what I share to avoid spreading misinformation. I think it importnat you find and detemine the relevent facts before sharing the content you have in mind. I believe this wraps up the unit for mis and disinformation and concludes all the required course work to finish this portion of the program. Congrats Iona! It has been a pleasure discussing your thoughts with you on a variety of different topics. I hope our disucussions provided some insight on some thoughts and ideas to consider as you transition to the next stage of your life. Don't hesitate to reach out through this platform to me if you have any other thoughts or questions moving forward. I wish you the very best in your school, swimming and any other future pursuits! Great work through out this program! Best, Philip Mentee 2023-12-30, 12:14: Thank you for giving me a better understanding on these topics, it helped to learn about them from a different perspective. I was happy to get to know another swimmer. I hope you have a great New Year, Iona",,,

Right now I'm beginning my first year of law school at the University of Victoria. I've studied at a few other universities and colleges too - UBC and Douglas College. My interests are reading philosophy, watching anime, playing video games, and working out! I struggle with time management too, but I've gotten better with a few techniques over the years. It's definitely difficult, so I can try my best to help you with improving those skills. I also saw that your profile says you're interested in maybe being a philosophy professor - some of my favourite mentors in my life so far have been exactly that! Is there any specific philosopher you like? Or types of philsophy? Machining school sounds super cool too. I have a good amount of friends in the trades and they're doing great!

Whenever you get the chance, click the Navigation Wheel to access it and take a peek at the ""Warm-up"". What do you think about living in the city versus where you're living now? I think that's a good question to reflect on before we get into the Discussion prompts. If you want to share your thoughts, feel free to do so but no pressure :) After thinking about the warmup, let's go through the ""Lesson 1: Rural Living"" activity. When you're ready, send me a message with your answers to the discussion questions and we'll go from there! Let me know if you have any questions or are running into any issues accessing anything!

Overall, I feel underprepared for the responsibilities that come with being an adult, I am not familiar with, credit cards, taxes or loans. I think I will be able to save money on food by eating Clif bars and ichiban. Do you think you’re ready? I don’t think I am ready, but I will figure things out as I go and join the stock market, win the lottery. • What did they find surprising or challenging about transitioning to adulthood? What was the hardest struggle for you when becoming an adult and how did you cope. • Can they share advice about building the skills you are not yet confident in? What credit card do you use? Mentee 2023-11-09, 12:45: What do you recommend for trying to balance part-time work with school workload? Mentor 2023-11-14, 10:57: Hello, I'm sorry for another late reply. I've opened the ""Career Exploration"" unit. I believe it's also one of the required units for your class. I think that a lot of people don't feel prepared for adulthood, and even current adults are still learning lots of new things. In regards to financial stuff, there are online resources which explain things like loans and credit cards. Make sure that you take care of your health. I would reccommend at the time organising your finances where you allocate a certain amount towards different aspects throughout the month (for example, food). It's good to be prepared, but you also do learn things through practice. I wouldn't rely on the lottery or join the stock market without learning how it works though, because it can be risky (you could lose money). You can talk to a bank about investing your money though! For me, I think it was difficult to take on more responsibility in general, and learn to manage my time and money. I would reccommend looking into different credit cards. I use one from the bank I was already using before I got a credit card. About managing work with school, I don't currently have a part-time job, but I think the most important thing to know is how much you yourself can handle. Don't put too much on your plate when you're just starting out. I know a lot of people who take less classes so that they can put effort into both work and school. Also, note the times of your classes and how much studying you'll need to be doing for them. Make sure that you don't overload yourself so much that you don't have free time.",,,"Mentee 2023-11-28, 11:40: What do you value in life? I really value communication between friends and family. I think communication is the most important thing. • How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? For the small community im a part of in Prince Rupert I contribute and give back by volunteering for Special Olympics and The Special Events Society. To make a bigger impact outside of my community, other students and I have organized a trip to Ghana. We will be staying at The Royal Seed Orphanage, and hopefully building a school there. We need about $15000 to build the school and we are slowly working up to our goal by funrdaising. • Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? I would love to be a News Reporter, to cover important topics and shed light light on how we can help people in need. Mentor 2023-12-01, 18:22: Hello, I'm sorry about my delay in answering ! My semester is just about to finish, so there's a lot of work to do. Thank you for your responses ! Communication is going to be a really important thing in other various aspects of your life as well. It's great that you're doing things to help your community and the world. A news reporter definitely fits into these characteristics that you value. Can you do the Part 2 for this section ? There's a career quiz which might help you delve into a new/interesting career. Please finish this, but I have opened ""Getting Hired"" for you, which you can start if necessary for keeping time with your class. Best Wishes! Mentee 2023-12-07, 15:49: Hi genevieve I realized I also missed some questions from this unit here they are. How did you decide to become an english teacher? Do you have to compromise anything when choosing your caree?. What were the different careers you were considering? What are some things that you wish youd known about career choices while you were still in high school? • Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want? Yes My result for the career quiz was advertising marketing and public relations manager. How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer? I think this job offers lots of opportunity for marketing big brands. • Where will I need to live to pursue this career path? I think i could live anywhere i spoke the language and theer is a company I could advertise for. Mentor 2023-12-08, 22:20: I decided that I wanted to become an English teacher after experience as a peer tutor and working in programs with high school students. I really enjoyed working with students and hearing their opinions, and I also enjoyed studying English, so they fit together well. I think that there are compromises that people might need to make depending on what they want in their job. For example, a job that makes me really happy might pay less than one which would make me unhappy. I had a lot of trouble choosing my direction, I changed which jobs I wanted all the time haha From journalist, lawyer, librarian, etc.) I still haven't entered a career, so there are definitely things I still don't know, but I think that high school students should know that you don't have to stick with one career for your entire life if it doesn't suit you. That does sound like a versatile job ! Of course, I'd encourage you to pursue what you're truly interested in. Should we move on to the ""Getting Hired"" section now?",,,"Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:02: I am from poem http://5811_I_am_from_poem Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:09: This is my i am from poem. Mentor 2023-09-25, 15:14: Hello Ellie, it's nice to meet you. I'm Genevieve and I'll be your mentor for this program. I'm sorry for my delay in sending the first message. I will be prompt from now on. Thank you for sending your poem (What happened to your dad's phone?!?). I read your profile and you seem to have many different interests -- I'm looking forward to hearing about them. What type of music do you like playing on guitar? Do you have any movies that you'd reccommend? By the way, I saw that you wanted a mentor who is an experience traveller. I haven't travelled a lot, but I went to Japan for about a month in the summer in an internship program. I'm looking forward to being able to travel more in the future when I have the time and money. A little bit more about me: I'm studying English and History at SFU, and I'm planning to become a teacher in the future. Do you have any questions? Here's my I am from poem: I am from dusty books, from waterproof mascara and black nail polish. I am from buying gag gifts, from ""never give up!"". I am from foggy mornings, from cherry blossom trees. I am from autumn fireworks, from well-made dessert. From the long car rides, the fall into the pond, the garden in my backyard, where I watched flowers grow with my mother. Mentee 2023-10-04, 17:06: Hi Genevieve, I really enjoyed reading youre poem, it was very well written. I have always wanted to go to Japan mostly to eat all the food they have there. Thats a very cool trip you went on, id love to hear more about youre internship experience. At the moment i am learning to play Blackbird on the guitar, although my favorite song to play and sings is Shes so High. For movies id recommend Were the Millers, Redo and of course Pitch Perfect. Ive been looking at Universities to apply to because ive narrowed down my career choices. Im hoping i can apply to one or more of these udergrads journalism, media, communications or english arts. I gven it much thought and im pretty sure i want to become a news reporter, so id get to write and be on tv. I was wondering what programs or universities you suggest for that career path. I dont know where i want to go but i was considering Concordia, Western, Carleton and Uvic except i dont want to go to uvic it is if i dont get into the ones i want. thank you for being my mentor! Looking forward to hearing from you - Ellie Mentee 2023-10-04, 17:35: Ice breaker activity http://3333_ReMBC_Icebreaker_Activity.pdf Mentor 2023-10-07, 21:09: Thank you ?? There was definitely a lot of good food I ate in Japan. I went as an assistant for an English program at a couple different schools (I went to a new one each week), and I was able to stay with Japanese families while I was there-- they made really good food, it was nice to try stuff that I had never heard of before. Those songs are so nice ! I haven't played guitar in a long time, but now I feel like picking it up again. When I have free time, I'll check out those movies ! I usually don't watch a lot of movies so it's nice to have reccommendations. I think that all majors that you mentioned would lend well to the career that you want. I'd reccommend looking into each major and seeing which classes you think would interest you the most. An English major tends to have a lot of literature analysis (though you might also find some courses on rhetoric or writing). I personally don't know a lot about universities in Ontario or Quebec so I'll do some research on those. Of course, just let me know anytime if you have any questions or something you would like to discuss. Also, I'm sorry but I can't access the Ice Breaker Activity you tried to send. Could you try to send it to me as an attached file? Also, make sure to start working on the Rural to Urban section soon ?? Thanks, Genevieve Mentee 2023-10-13, 13:10: Hi Geneveive I dont know what Rural to Urban is. How do i start that activity?

Hopefully that was able to help a bit. I've been told that your class is starting the ""Adulting"" unit, so I will be opening it today. Your class also requires you to do ""From Rural to Urban"", so I'd reccommend you to start there first. You should be able to find it when you click on it's title on the right side of the green circle. When you scroll down, it will provide some more instruction, and there are some discussion questions related to your town that you may answer, for example, what's your favourite place in your town? Hope all is going well (: Mentee 2023-11-09, 12:49: Hi Geneveive whenever you have a moment can you please unlock the another section. Any section is fine i dont have a preference.

Management Mentee 2023-10-27, 14:26: Hi Genevieve I am unable to edit the documents with the questions so i will put it in the email itselg. From Rural to Urban Tell your mentor all about where you live! How many people live in your town and go to your school? There are over 12000 peope who live in Prince Rupert, I think there are 500 or 600 students at our school. • What do high school students do for fun and where do they hang out? Go to eachothers houses, waterfront, opa sushi, there is not much else to do. • What do students do for extracurriculars? I am on the girls school soccer team, and hopefully the rugby team as well. I am most excited for cheerleading that begins this monday. What makes your town special to you? The close community how everyone knows everyone. I like it and and hate it at the same time, its overwhelming how everyone knows everything about you but comforting at the same time. - Ellie, sorry i cant get the document to let me add my own words Mentee 2023-10-30, 14:40: • What do you already know about living in a city? Everything is expensive, you must always leave yourlself extra time to get somewhere because of traffic, and taxis and busses not being on time. You have to be minful of scammers, and weary of strangers because its not a small community. Dont buy street drugs. • Share your feelings about city life. • What you think are some advantages and challenges of city life? I think the advantages of living in a city are easy access to stores and bigger companies you need items from. Im assuming it would be easier to promote a small buisness to the public by handing out buisness cards and asking bigger companies to have posters/ buisness cards at their tills to catch peoples eye. The biggest advantage of living in a big city is more opportunities. Theres many places you can go just by bus, compared to rupert where you have to either drive 2 hours minimunm or fly to get to another town. Theres more activities to do in youre free time. If you want to get a job somewhere in the city you can go in person rather than applying online. Mentor 2023-11-01, 18:02: Hello Ellie, Sorry for my late response, it's midterm time at my university now! Don't worry about writing out your answers in this box. If you're having difficulties with editing the documents it's better if you write them in this message box :) Thank you for telling me about your town. I've always lived in a city, so it's interesting to hear about it ! When I was in high school I often hung out at my friends houses too. It seems like there are a lot of extracurriculars that you're in, I hope you're having fun with them ! You're right that you should be conscious of the time when travelling. I typically transit everywhere (using buses and the train), and while I don't usually have problems with buses being on time, some of my friends have in the past. I'm not sure of the price of things in your town, but there's definitely a lot of expensive things in the city, but if you look for it, you can find some cheaper items. I've never had any problems with scammers or people offering street drugs, but it is true that you should not be immediately trusting of strangers. Usually, people walk through the city with an attitude of minding their own business. I do think that there's easy access to stores and whatnot, along with a wide variety of different stores and restaurants, etc.). I don't have experience promoting a small business, but I know a lot of people who promote their small businesses through social media ! As I mentioned, I transiting is my main mode of transportation! And in the lower mainland, if you're a university student, with most universities you'll have access to an unlimited transit card, so it's pretty convenient. I think that in the city it's still more common to apply to jobs online nowadays. If you have any more questions, please ask me ! If not, I believe that we can move on to the ""Adulting"" section. You can do Lesson 1, and I believe there's a list you're meant to fill out. I hope you've been doing well lately :)",,"Mentee 2023-12-18, 13:15: Hi Geneveive I tried to send you my resume im not sure if it sent please let me know. Mentor 2023-12-19, 15:19: Hello Ellie, unfortunately, it didn't send. Could you try again ? Mentee 2024-01-14, 18:55: • If you have had a job interview before, how’d it go? I had a job interview at safeway pharmacy when I applied to be a pharmacy assistant. It was a very brief interview where they asked me about my shedule and how many hours i inttended on working a week. The interview wenr very well I ended up getting the job. A good tip I learned is to be upfront about your availability and be yourself. What did you do well, what could you have done better? I could have brought in a file with proof of my completed courses just in case they asked. I think I did well by cocming across as quietly confident. • If you have never had a job interview before, what are some things you’re nervous about, and what are you comfortable with? I was very nervous I would be asked what my biggest strengths are, I find it awkward trying to explain what my skills are. I was very comfortale with them asking me about my weaknesses and how I problem solve. What was your most memorable job interview? Mentor 2024-01-16, 15:41: Hi Ellie, thank you for answering the questions. I hope that you had a good winter break! Good job with your previous job interview, it seems like you did pretty well, and of course, it's good to be prepared. I'd say, as you mentioned, it's very important to think about your skills and provide a good picture of yourself to your interviewer. You could even say that one of your strengths is adaptability, or problem-solving. It's hard to think of one, but once I was getting interviewed to volunteer at the library to help children with reading. My interviewer asked me to read something to her, and I read it out normally, but she meant for me to read it to her like she was a child, as an example, so I felt embarrassed at the time. I just corrected, moved on, and was accepted to volunteer. By the way, could you let me know what module you'd like me to open next? It'll be your last one. (And if you can, try sending the resume. If you can't, don't worry about it.) Mentee 2024-01-18, 23:01: Hi Genevieve, thank you for being my mentor! I learned so much about you and learned lots of useful tools and skills. I feel better prepared for next year, thank you so much ! Mentor 2024-01-19, 09:37: Hi Ellie, thank you for your hard work this semester. I'm glad to hear that you learned a lot.

I am in my third year of undergard in a pre-medicine program. I grew up and still live in rural areas; small towns are all that I know.

I'm glad you chose this module, I think this is one of my favourite modules because I believe self-care is important and sometimes it is not talked about enough. Being physically and mentally healthy can sometimes not be prioritize because we have other ""more important"" things we want to do or accomplish, or at least in my experience. But it should not take the back burner because it does affect every aspect of our life if we are not healthy. Anyway, to start us off, I think my main warning signs are overthinking and procrastination. I think when I'm overwhelmed it becomes harder to be productive because I get ahead of myself and overthink, and being overwhelmed leads me to procrastinate because I don't know where to start. During these times, I try my best to break things down into smaller tasks to make it let overwhelming. In terms of things that I do to lift my mood, I do try to talk to my friends and family when I'm having a hard time to get some prespective, I enjoy watching sitcoms or stand up comedy, I paint-by-numbers (sadly not creative enough to paint free-hand), and I like getting spa related things (massage, nails, etc.) If you would like to share your warning signs and things that lift your mood, feel free to do so!",,"Mentor 2023-09-30, 10:52: Hello again! so I think there are a few things we can work on in this unit. Feel free to complete the warm up section if you'd like and I will respond to it. Alternatively, we can go straight into the background section which has a table of different skills and responsibilities and your level of confidence in completing them. Then you can have a look at the discussion and any questions you want to ask there. Let me know if there are any specific responsibilities you want to discuss or any questions outside of those on the list that I can try my best answering! You did mention that you already have an idea of what adulting is like so feel free to share what that is also. Mentor 2023-10-08, 16:39: Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the warm up session! I think what you have is pretty spot on in terms of what adulting can be. Of course there are always unexpected things and responsibilities that come up and part of being an adult is learning how to deal with them. I agree with you it is harder as adult because you are responsibility for so many things now, but of course there is nothing wrong about asking for help! Let me know once you read/complete the background section and we can discuss some of these responsibilities in more depth. Feel free to ask me about anything you are curious about.

Just to get the conversation going here, I think adulting can be exciting and daunting at the same time. For my own experience, I think you don't really have to know everything about everything once you're kinda on your own. You do learn as you go and I think one piece of advice I would say is don't be afraid to ask for help or to ask questions. It can seem intimidating or that people may be judging you but I'm a big advocate of making a phone call or sending an email if you don't know what you need to do. For example, this year I had to learn how to pay taxes and I just called CRA and they guided me through it and I was able to pay it on time. I also asked my mom for guidance, so if you have relatives or friends you can ask or double check with, that's always helpful! Mentee 2023-11-04, 12:46: Here you go Jihanne. My adulting sheet. Mentor 2023-11-05, 23:44: Thanks for sharing your adulting sheet! It seems like you have some concrete steps in line to figure it out the stuff you're not sure about, which is really great and proactive of you! If you are wanting to talk about this, as the discussion question suggested, do you think you are ready to take on responsibilities as an adult? And do you have any questions about certain responsibilities that I can maybe try to answer? Mentee 2023-11-08, 14:13: As of now im unsure whether or not, if i will move to a bigger city.

Mentor 2023-11-10, 13:55: That's great to hear! If you don't have any further questions, we can move on. I think we can focus on the ""From rural to urban"" unit, as I haven't heard what the next unit we need to be working on. Did your teacher mention anything to your class? I believe the only required unit left is Career Exploration, and then you can choose two others. So in the meantime, maybe you can think about what other 2 units you are interested in doing.",,,"Mentor 2023-11-14, 01:09: Hi there! So I opened the Career exploration unit for us as it is the last required unit. As usual, please check out the background videos for lesson 1 and the discussion questions. I found the videos to be interesting and its focus on working within rural communities which is totally in line with the conversation we are having in the Rural to Urban unit! To get us started, I'll share how I figured out what I wanted to do. I was living in the Philippines until I was 12, and at least in the school I went to, even as young as elementary school, we were all exposed to thinking about what major you would pursue in university. There were entrance exams to get into universities back home and they would post the results in big tarpoulines at the school. So being exposed to that, I just grew up with the idea that I would go to university plus almost everyone in family did. In turn, it was a question of what major will I choose and not necessarily if I should go to unversity/college or not. But I never felt forced to go to university. And so the class like the one you're in now Career Life Connections (we called it Planning then) actually helped think about my interests and I realized that as early as grade 8 I was interested in psychopathologies and mental health, so I decided to take psychology and I feel really lucky that the interest persisted. But honestly, I feel like I am a rare case where I knew what I wanted to do early on, I think it's actually more normal to be unsure or to not know at all. Mentor 2023-12-01, 21:01: Hi there! Just checking in as it's been a few days since I last heard from you. Hope you're doing well! I think we've wrapped up Adulting and From rural to urban, so now we can just focus on Career Exploration. So please see below my initial thoughts to get us going on this unit. Mentee 2023-12-08, 14:20: Hello Jihanne! sorry for thd long wait. Here are my answers for the first set of questions. My values in life is pretty simple. Just enjoy it and make other people happy, and to help them through the toughest of times. I want to be able to contribute to my community and the world by spreading hope, and happiness, and being an inspiration for the next generation of kids. Maybe some sort of career in photography, or being a teacher. Mentor 2023-12-09, 10:05: Thanks for sharing, Avel! The values you shared are simple but can also have a huge impact which aligns with your career aspiratioins relating to art and/or supporting the next generation. Are you leaning towards one of those careers more than the other? To be honest, I haven't really thought about my values in relation to my career goals as much. I know what drew to psychology is my curiosity and interest in understanding the relationship among the brain, body, and behaviour. And that also extends to helping people understand this relationship in relation to their own well-being and mental health. Mentee 2023-12-21, 10:50: Hello. Sorry for the late reply, been busy with school again. And to answer your question in leaning on both, maybe teacher as a full time, and Photography as a part time or side gig really. Mentee 2023-12-21, 11:05: Hi Jihanne. I waw curious if you could open a new module well being and self care, so i can work on that along side the other one were doing. Mentor 2023-12-22, 09:05: That is a great idea, I didn't even think of doing both but of course that is also an option! What kind of teacher do you want to be/what grade do you want to teach? Mentor 2023-12-22, 09:07: Also no worries about the late response, I understand it's a busy time of year! I appreciate your enthusiasm in doing the modules! I believe we are meant to only be working on one module at a time, last time we were working on 2 at a time because we were trying to keep up with your class. I haven't actually received any updates from your teacher, did they say we are supposed to be working on the Well-being and Self Care module now? If so, then I can open that module for us! Mentee 2024-01-11, 14:49: Im terribly sorry once again for the late replies. For the teacher question, i plan on maybe Kindergarten or daycare teacher. But im not too fully sure just yet. And for the second question, my teacher doesn't really mind me doing multiple modules, she just wants us too finish those, and she told us to work on other modules we want, for extra marks. Mentor 2024-01-12, 22:06: Hi Avel! No worries about the delayed response. Hope you had a good winter break! That makes sense about being unsure, it is a big decision. Are you ready to move on to Lesson 2: Career Discovery. I believe you have to take the Work BC Career Discovery Quiz then we can discuss your results. To get us going on that part, as I mentioned, I've always been interested in Psychology so I didn't really think of other career paths. I did learn about specific careers during my undergrad. And I think one thing I wish I knew in high school is that many professions require multiple degrees, so that kind caught me off guard but I think with it being something I am passionate about it helps with motivation. Also sounds good about working on 2 modules at a time! I will open Well-being and Self-care for us to work on! Mentee 2024-01-17, 11:09: I had a fun winter break thank you for asking. And yes im ready to move on to lesson 2, ile send my replies once im done with some of my english work, and work on my mental health work shortly after. And thank you for opening the 2nd module. Mentor 2024-01-20, 23:05: Thanks for the update, Avel! I appreciate you always keeping me in the loop with your schedule :) I look forward to your response to this lesson and the other module. Mentee 2024-01-27, 10:26: Hello Jihanne, these my questions for this field. And ile work on the others shortly, after this one, along with the last modules, and the wrap up. -Avel M. Do i have a strong personal interest in this type of work? For photography i find that im incredibly passionate about it, for me it's not just taking a photo, but taking a memory aswell. With photography i find that balancing it out with work and life easy, because most photographers just walk around, run etc, to take photos. And most photographers are solo, working, there are company photographers but im leaning more in as a solo photographer, so as a solo photographer it makes me able to manage my own time, and make me go on my own schedule. With photography, it being an incredibly expensive and, tedious career i doubt it will be a stable life, thats why most solo photographers have another job, or a second job atleast besides just being a photographer. Most solo photography jobs, involves events, and weddings, which are seasonal. With photography, ive done abit of research i find that it is a growing market, but until now, i find that if it is a stable career path im going to say not relatively, because as i said before, most photography jobs are seasonal, being weddings, events, my city alone has i think 3 profesional/known photographers, but does are only the 3 known ones, thats not including the people who aren't known, but for me I'll find a way to somehow manage it. For photography, i find that i can live anywhere basically to take a photo, if i wanted to i can stay in prince rupert my homecity, because Photography itself usually just depends on the creativity of the photographer themselves, and how they want to show their work. Mentor 2024-01-29, 21:15: Hi Avel, thank you for sharing your answers with me! I can see that you’ve given this career choice a great deal of thought. I can also sense your passion from the set of photos you’ve shared in the introduction activity and would like to say if I didn’t already, they were very beautiful! I see that you’ve laid out the pros and cons of this career choice and that you’ve thought about it realistically. I think that is a great sign that you will be successful in this career because you’ve considered all the ways in which you can succeed and possible sources of strain. Are you thinking about being a photographer and a teacher? As you said it is common to have 2 jobs. Nevertheless, I am glad to hear though that you have found something you are passionate about, which I hope will continue to motivate you as you progress in this journey. It is also a meaningful career as you said it is capturing moments and memories that are precious to those people you are photographing. Do you have a specific photography style? I’m not sure if I’ll recognize it as I don’t know too much about photography but I am open learning more about it.",,,"Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:34: Hi my names Avel, and here are six photos i would like to exchange with you. Mentor 2023-09-22, 19:05: Hi Avel, I am Jihanne. It's nice to meet you! I have also taken some pictures that I wanted to share with you. Thanks for sharing your pictures with me! I really enjoyed the moon pictures. Seeing those made me realize that every time I see the moon in the night sky, it does spark a bit of joy in me, not sure exactly why :) Why did you choose to share those moon pictures with me? Anyway, not sure if you have had a chance to read through my profile. I had a look through yours and it looks like they have made a great match for us! Please let me know if you have any questions so far. Mentee 2023-09-24, 04:08: Hi Jihanne it's me Avel. I choose those moon photos because im a night person, who likes to wonder and go into deep thoughts at night. Sometimes i would feel lonely so cause of that i just look up and see the moon, and whenever i look at it i feel less lonely, because i feel like as if someone else is looking at the moon somewhere, and cause of that i feel less lonely at night. Anyhow, i like your photo you took at Niagara falls, and i do agree with you that water calms the nerves, i think its more because of the sound and color of it, the color being blue a calm and relaxing color, and the sound of gushing water can be both calm and wild, and i tend to connect that with human emotions. Speaking of human emotions ive always had an interest in human emotions, ive studied it abit on my own time for 2 years when i was 11~13 i got a bit of information on it, but not much, but i did enjoy it however. And cause of me studying some human emotions i tend to put myself in peoples shoes and feel what they feel, and i tend to get hurt cause of that, i experience they're pain as if it is mine, and cause of that ive become a very logical and understanding person. And me wanting to be a better version of this ""Logican and understanding"" person i want to be, i studied stoicism, rn im listening to a spotify podcast about stoicism and it has taught me alot of stuff, on how to be nice and strong, and caring for people no matter how mean or weird they are. Mentor 2023-09-25, 21:10: Hi Avel, that's a really nice sentiment and it's a good reminder of our common humanity, we all have and experience these emotions and sometimes that can bring some comfort. I also really enjoy the blueness of water, and something about it flowing and even crashing can be quite calming. I too have a fascination with emotion. I'm actually looking into grad schools and I am searching for a professor who does research on emotion, specifically emotion regulation. You're describing very important characteristics of a mental health professional and really shows your interest. And stoicism sounds really interesting! Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Also we can continue this conversation, but I think we should start the first module as well. Which topic would you like to start with? Do you want to choose among the required courses: rural to urban, career exploration, or adulting? Mentee 2023-09-27, 14:16: If possible i would like to learn about adulting, because to me it sounds interesting and i think i already have a idea on what it is, and would be awesome if i was right. And im sorry for my weird spelling and grammar, my phone kept. auto-correcting it, and im also sorry for the slang words like ""rn"" i tend to forget, i need to be profesional about this. And to answer your question about stoicism, its a type of philosophy, and the one im learning/studying about right now is, ""Practical stoicism."" By Tanner Campbell. Its things and thoughts you can apply to your daily life, an example of one is ""Return their surliness with kindness"" because we don't know what the person has been through for him to act like that, its maybe because he has had a bad day, or something. Mentor 2023-09-30, 10:45: Yes for sure, we can start with adulting. I will open the unit for us! And no worries at all about the grammar and the slang. That sounds really interesting. I would love to learn more about that! And it makes sense that it's called practice since it seems easy enough to understand and follow in daily life. A lot of philosophy can be hard to do that with. We can continue this conversation if you want and you can respond in the new unit (Adulting) with your response so that we don't have to keep track of two conversations. But what got you interested in philosophy/stoicism? Mentee 2023-10-05, 13:03: Hello Jihanne here's my answer too the warmup questions. Mentee 2023-11-08, 14:48: As of now i am unsure whter or not if i will move towns or cities. Bur maybe moving in general probably, but as of now its nor too clear yet. Me and my friend do plan on living together, so that way we can share expenses, and it would be easier to manage the a house. Mentee 2023-11-08, 14:50: I am sorry i don't know why it sent multiple copies, and it sent it to the wrong module, those were supposed to go to the ""Rural to Urban sheet"" im sorry. Mentee 2023-11-11, 03:15: Yes i think thats the only one left and after that we can choose the other two, and after the last two we can decide whether or not we want to continue with mentor city. And i was wondering if its possible, for you to open the next module, the next time you reply to this message would be awesome. So that way i can start working on it alongside the ""Rural To Urban"" module. Mentee 2023-11-13, 04:51: Ive been to only one urban city and that being Manila, and honestly not a fan of it. Im not the best person when it comes to figuring out where to go in citiesn, but somehow i manage.and im not too curious regarding moving to cities, somewhat urban environments ive lived and been at the oast, just not overcrowded cities and stuff. Mentee 2023-12-01, 21:42: Hello Jihanne. Im sorry if i haven't responded in a week, I've been with our school play called ""Sumtn rotten"" as of now were almost done. Its the second night of our musical and tommorow will be the last day, so I've been focusing on it more cause i want too give the people of Rupert an outstanding performance. But as soon as its done ile respond back as fast as i can. -Avel Mentor 2023-12-01, 21:48: Hi again, thanks for the update! And that sounds so exciting! But totally understandable that you weren't able to respond sooner, plays/musicals take up so much time! Anyway, at the risk of soundy cheesy, break a leg! Mentee 2024-01-29, 21:23: Hi Jihanne Im sorry for the late replies, but this is nothing related to the topic atm. If possible i would like to continue conversations, so that way im able to get insight into adulthood, i may have not done alot of modules or replied much, but i can assure you that i am fully interested in alot of these stuff, and would love to learn more if possible, i won't take up much time at all, and as how you are able to tell that im pretty slow to reply at times, but when i do reply i am very critical on it, and always interested. Mentor 2024-01-29, 21:37: Hi Avel, thank you for expressing interest in continuing with the modules/our conversations. And I'd be happy to do so! Since your progress will not be related to a class, we can go at your pace, we don't have to rush. And I can tell that you are very throughtful with your responses, which I really appreciate! Mentee 2024-01-29, 21:40: Thank you for youe consideration Jihanne, and i once again i will always try my best answering as soon as possible, but if im unable too i will make sure to answer them as critically as possible. Thank you once again -Avel M. Mentor 2024-01-29, 21:43: Of course, it is no worries at all! and thank you as well I am glad that you have chosen to continue on as there are lots left we can talk about! And I am sure you will answer them critically when you do :) Also, feel free to ask me questions outside of the exact topics in the modules. Mentee 2024-01-29, 21:44: Will do thank you Jihanne. Mentee 2024-02-02, 08:48: Yes actually. I plan on becoming a photographer, and maybe teacher. As of now im taking a school program called (ECE) Early Childhood Education, and i plan on working there while i continue photography, and im hoping to get hired almost immediately, because of the shortages in (ECE) helpers/teachers. Yes it is. To me its a really meaningful career, and passion, because i know alot of my friends are leaving for colleges, and universities and alot of those friends are people who i acted with along for our school play (Something Rotten) and its just really nice being able to have a photo as a memory. Talking style wise, id say im more or of events photography, where i run around taking photos for an event. Mentee 2024-02-04, 02:16: Sorry this is just a follow up to my last one, cause i never fully finished it, because i was doing it in class and my teacher arrived. As i was saying i run around taking photos for an event, ive taken photos for my 50th FILCAN event, Seafest in prince rupert, and lastly the grade 9 feasy, where we let the grade 9's come into our highschool and welcome them, by having food. The photo attached to this letter is our current FILCAN president, Ely or tito Ely as i call him. I helped him setup the bahay Kubo as a decoration, and i also did a dance for called Maglalatik, which i did and had fun doing it. Mentee 2024-02-04, 02:27: Here's some of my best photos so far id say. https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zikd6p3vxdd25adnozlq9/h?rlkey=1t9u8k1vn041ixpip2gus2lya&amp;dl=0 Mentor 2024-02-04, 09:08: That sounds like a great plan. I've heard of the ECE program before and it seems like a great program to get a job as a teacher/EA. Do you have more courses to take after high school for this program before you can apply for jobs? Thanks so much for sharing the pictures you've taken and your experiences with photography so far. I can see how you are able to capture unique moments! Events must be really fun to do because you know how meaningful these are to the people you are photographing. Do you have a favourite event you've done so far? Side note, we also have a FilCan community group in my hometown that I wished that I participated more in when I was living there, so it's great to hear you are involved involved in your community group. I also haven't heard of the Maglalatik dance, but I will look that up! Mentee 2024-02-05, 10:30: I can choose to take more courses, for my full ECE certificate but, im not too sure what to do yet. Or Whether to get my ECE certificate. But i do plna on working for an ece job to gather enough money for an arts college. Specifically Emily Carr University of Arts in vancouver. Id say my favorite event's that ive photographed so far is probably, the filcan events, and my schools musical, and then just fun friend group photos. Lastly i think maglalatik is like a War mocking dance, or like a war dance. Mentor 2024-02-06, 19:33: I see, so are you currently doing something like a dual credit program? And once you graduate high school is there a different type of ECE certificate that you will get? That's very cool! I've heard great things about Emily Carr University of Arts! I'm guessing you'll major in photography? :) Those all sound very fun events especially since you're also partaking in the events themselves! Oh nice! I wish I learned more traditional dances. I think the only one I've ever done is the Pandanngo and I'm not even sure if that is what it was, I just remembered there being a candle as part of the dance and that's what Google said it was called haha Mentee 2024-02-22, 02:18: Hey Jihanne Sorry for the late reply. Was busy at school. Yeah im doing a dual credit program. I don't think I'll need to get a different type of ECE certificate, im not too sure. Yeah im definitely gonna major photography. Speaking of majoring i got full marks for it! Im proud and happy that i got full marks. Mentor 2024-02-22, 17:10: No worries at all! That sounds great, I knew of a few people who did dual credit for a different program and it seems like an efficient way to get a certificate. I'm sorry if I already asked this but do you know what grade you'd be interested in working with? Congratulations! And thanks for sharing! That's really cool that you guys have a photography class, what sorts of activities do you do in the class? Mentee 2024-02-26, 11:25: All good don't worry about asking again, in fact i like it when people ask me twice. I plan on maybe teaching kindergarten for now, but eventually work my way up to highschool so i can teach photography, to young minds like me. In photography class usually were just tasked with certain things, for example go out and take this photo rule of thirds, or go out take this photo, black and white landscape. It's a simple class, that gives you alot of freedom to do whatever you want, you can go downtown, or mcdonalds even, just make sure you get photos. Mentor 2024-02-27, 17:29: That sounds like a great plan! Get a bit of experience teaching with your ECE and then learn photography specific knowledge at Emily Carr, it's a good combo! Oh I see, sounds like a fun and like there's tons of room for creativity. Does your teacher give a bit of a lesson on specific things like that rule of thirds, etc?","Mentor 2023-10-08, 16:34: Hello! I just opened up this unit for us because I was told that your class is working on it so just in case you need access to it. Totally my bad, I think I was a little ahead by asking you to pick your preferred unit. I did not know they would tell us which unit we would work on. But anyway, we can focus on adulting for not though. Thanks for your understanding! Mentor 2023-10-17, 19:35: Hi there! Just checking as I haven't heard from you in a while. I was just informed that your class is wrapping up the Rural to Urban unit, which means we probably should be wrapping up the Adulting unit. They are starting the Adulting unit now, so I believe we should be starting the Rural to Urban unit. Sorry for the confusion there, but I think we're just doing the opposite of your class. But in short, we should be wrapping up the first unit and starting the next. They did say that we can work on both at the same time. Since we should be starting the 2nd unit, I thought I should pop in here and get us going. Again up to you if you want to do the warm up, but wanted to quickly share some of my thoughts. I think living in rural and urban both have their pros and cons. For example, a pro for rural is that it can be peaceful and quiet, which can be a con for urban areas as it is the opposite. On the other hand, urban area have more amenities, aka more things to do, while rural areas have less amenities and even not many stores. In terms of the discussion questions, I think one strength about rural areas is the connections you get to make and the network that you can build that can help you in your future career. Also living in a rural area provides unique experiences, and not sure if you are interested in research but that is something in psychology that people consider, like how your environment affects you. So having that lived experience helps in terms of being able to contribute in research. Let me know if you have any thoughts or things you are curious about and want to discuss! Mentee 2023-11-04, 12:27: Hello Jihanne here are the answers to my question 1. In my town there is abour around 12000 or more people residing here, atleast i got from google. And the students that go to my school are around 600 im pretty sure. 2. I mean i can't speak for all highschool students, but me personally i go home and just sleep. If i want to go have fun i hangout at a friend's house, and we would do karaoke and other fun stuff sometimes. 3. For extracurricular, our school offers a bunch of it, we have cross-country, choir, wrestling, etc. Im part of choir, and im also part of the school play for this final year i have. 4. I think what makes my town special to me is my friends, teachers, and the filipino community here. And im curios if you're from a rural or urban location. If so what's it like? And if you were to compare it to the previous place being either, rural or urban, which one is easier, or what are the differences between the two. Mentor 2023-11-05, 23:40: Hi Avel, thanks for telling me all about where you're from. I don't know if this is just my own bias but I feel like coming from a small town there is always that feeling of wanting to leave that small town for somewhere bigger, but it's good to remember that there are always great things that make our hometown special. For myself, when my family immigrated to Canada, we went to a small town, similar size as yours it sounds. But before coming here until I was 12, I lived in Manila which you probably know is a big city. So I had this opposite culture shock of going from somewhere big to somewhere small. And I think part of my bias may come from living in a big city once. But then I moved to a bigger city for university. However, in my personal opinion, since I'm still in northern BC, the energy or feel of the city I'm in doesn't seem like other cities like Vancouver or like Calgary . Aside from more amenities, the city I'm in right now feels like my small town. I'm not sure if that makes sense or if it answers your question but it's just my point of view. I do feel that there is a sense of ease with bigger cities since you don't have to go to the next biggest city to get stuff or do things or get stuff fixed. At least that was my experience, when I was in my hometown. We had to go 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to another town to access more stores and such. Honestly, though I'm a bit unsure right now of what I prefer, there's definitely pros and cons to either type of place and maybe the preference will depend on what a person needs in their life at that moment. Do you have plans of moving to a bigger city after high school? Mentor 2023-11-10, 13:50: Just copy pasting your response here so it's in the right module Avel: As of now im unsure whether or not, if i will move to a bigger city. But maybe moving in general maybe, just don't know where im moving yet, and me and a friend are also planning on living together for shared rent, and its easier to manage the house with multiple people. And no worries about the multiple sends and such haha I figured it was just a glitch! But yea, having a roommate can be great. Definitely to reduce your rent/utilities cost, but it will also be nice to figure out adulting things together! Have you visited many urban cities? What do you think of urban centres? Also was there anything else you are curious about regarding urban centres or even moving to a new city? Mentor 2023-11-14, 00:42: Just copy pasting your answer here: Avel: Ive been to only one urban city and that being Manila, and honestly not a fan of it. Im not the best person when it comes to figuring out where to go in citiesn, but somehow i manage.and im not too curious regarding moving to cities, somewhat urban environments ive lived and been at the oast, just not overcrowded cities and stuff. I totally get that, as I mentioned before I feel like there's a part of me that ""developed"" after living in a small town where I just felt the need to be at a bigger city. But after living in not so big cities for so long, I am starting to like this environment more and more! There's a different kind of convenience to it like with things being so close to each other and just an overall home-y feel. Mentor 2023-11-14, 00:47: I forgot that there was a lesson 2 to the From Rural to Urban unit. So please make sure to check the background info for lesson 2. In checking the discussion questions, we are already talking about the questions/prompts listed which is great! But let me know if there is anything else you want to discuss. Mentee 2023-11-20, 14:53: Hello Jihanne i think i have no other questions and nothing else to add. Mentor 2023-11-20, 22:23: Sounds good, Avel! So I think we can just focus on the Career exploration unit!",,,,

Just a quick clarification on what ""completing an activity"" means. First, please make sure to read through the material or watch the assigned videos. Then, share your thoughts with your mentor. You'll usually find several questions related to the activity, but often you're only required to answer one. Choose the question that resonates most with you so your mentor can provide feedback. Once you feel that you've completed the activity, you can request your mentor to advance you to the next unit. If you have any questions about this, feel free to reach out. Thanks, Management",,,,,,,"Mentor 2023-11-08, 13:32: Hey Aspen! For this topic, I think we're supposed to go back and forth on some of the topics and discuss them. We can start with these prompts: 1. What do you value in life? 2. How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? 3. Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? For me, I really value stability, happiness, and exploration in my life. I hope to be able to contribute to the aid of human suffering, as I am really interested in medicine and the intersection of minority status/priviledge and health status.

We can start with these prompts: 1. What do you value in life? 2. How do you want to contribute to your community and the world? 3. Any ideas for careers that might incorporate the first two points. They don’t have to be “realistic” – what are your dream careers? For me, I really value stability, happiness, and exploration in my life. I hope to be able to contribute to the aid of human suffering, as I am really interested in medicine and the intersection of minority status/priviledge and health status. For my dream career - I hope one day to get into medical school and be a doctor in my community where I have the power to help underprivileged people. Now your turn! Let me know your responses! -Mackenzie Mentor 2023-11-08, 13:36: (sorry I don't know why that sent 3 times) Mentor 2023-11-21, 11:09: Hey Aspen! No rush, just want to make sure to keep this on your to-do list so you can get done by the end of term! I hope everything is going well! -Mackenzie",,,"Mentor 2023-09-20, 18:48: Hi Kali! I'm your mentor Mackenzie! I'm excited to work with you and progress you quickly through this program. I hope I can keep you on track and help you be interested in the content! I am a little unsure of where your teacher wants you to start (what unit), so let me know and I'll open it up! Additionally, I'd love to learn a bit about you! Your plans for the future, a fun hobby you do, any pets, etc. anything you feel comfortable sharing! Let me know! -Mackenzie Mentor 2023-09-20, 18:49: Sorry, I meant Aspen! *facepalm* Kali was a student of mine last term. My bad! Mentee 2023-09-20, 18:58: hey! it's all good aha, it's nice to meet you! i'm really interested in carpentry and doing trades, i have 3 cats, 1 dog and 2 frogs. i'm a lesbian so that's cool, i have an amazing girlfriend which is cool too. i adore the ocean and all sea life. i wanna own my own business one day. im not sure what unit she wants us to start with, i'll ask her tomorrow morning. now u answer the questions lol tell me about urself! -asp Mentor 2023-09-22, 14:50: Awesome! You sound like you have a lot of amazing things going on in your life, very cool about the frogs. A little about me... I'm 22, did my undergrad at Queen's in bio, am currently doing a master's at SFU in marine climate change, also studying for the MCAT. I have a black lab named Pearl, a sister, and I'm on a women's bike team out here and we compete in all the local Canadian and American road races. It's so weird trying to sum youself up in a few sentences, but those are some of the main things lol :) I'm very happy to have you as my mentee, you're already miles above the other ones I've had because you actually introduced yourself! Woohoo! I'll open up ""other ways of knowing"" as a topic that we can start with, unless you teacher says to do a different one in which case we can skip it - but just in case you have class time in the meantime and want to work on a module I'll have it open. Talk soon! -Mackenzie Mentee 2023-09-30, 11:59: thank u! i'll probably start on tuesday because i left my laptop at school oops! aspen","Mentor 2023-09-30, 11:57: Hi Aspen! I got some info from your teacher that the first unit to start with would be ""from rural to urban"", so it's open now! Feel free to start whenever you want. -Mackenzie Mentor 2023-10-10, 12:45: Hey Aspen! No rush on starting, but I'd thought I'd keep From Rural to Urban on your mind for this week to complete if you have classtime for it. -Mackenzie Mentee 2023-10-26, 12:39: so how different is it living in the city rather than a small town? i dont really want to go somewhere bigger it seems like a big jump im not ever gonna be ready for. -aspen Mentor 2023-10-26, 17:17: Living in a big city can be overwhelming - I live pretty far away from my parents which can be annoying at times, and it's definitely harder to get out into nature. One thing thats different from when I was living in a smaller town is that there's always things to do - but it can be harder to make friends to do those things with. In a small town its easier to get to know people, but that doesn't mean its impossible in a bigger city! If you never feel like you want to move to a big city, that is totally ok! They both have their pros and cons but one isn't better than the other. -Mackenzie",,,,

It's currently extremely snowy here in Vancouver, and it has caused a bunch of problems for people. We're never ready for the snow, regardless of how much there is, haha. I'm told that we're ending our program together on Jan 26th, so I've just opened up the Wrapping Up section of the program for us to do. Don't worry about your other requirements, we will finish what we can and leave the rest! Beyond that, if you like to keep communications open, we can either keep working on the units together outside of the program or even just talk about how you are and have friendly chats. Hope to hear from you soon! Nate",,,"Mentor 2023-10-19, 16:34: Hey Asia, Just a heads up, your teacher wants us to start Adulting as soon as we are finished ""From Rural to Urban"". So I wanted to let you know you can move on straight to this unit once you've finished the last one and we can go over them together all at once! I know you were interested in seeing what this unit had to ask/say, so I'm glad this is the one we get to continue onto next. If you have any issues with any of the two units, please let me know. Feel free to ask any questions you may have as they come up, you can even compile a list and I can get back to all of them all at once! Let me know if you get stuck on anything or if any of the questions or prompts don't make sense and we can make sense of them together. Hope you're doing well! Warmly, Nate Mentor 2023-11-07, 10:44: Hi Asia, I hope you're doing well! I'm still around if you start and require any help as well as if you need help starting! Just shoot me a message and we'll go from there, it's not a problem if you're having issues starting on either module, I am here for you. Warm regards, Nate Mentee 2023-11-20, 21:17: Hi Nate! I am sorry for the ghosting again, to be honest I have been wrapped up in school and work a lot, everything on my plate right now is a little much. (also Mentorcity keeps glitching out and deleting my well thought out responses so i am angrily typing this for the second time) As for the adulting unit: i filled out the worksheet attached to the lesson, i feel pretty confident in most of the areas i think. The only issue im running into is my ability to manage all of these things in a timely manner and without overworking myself/ burning out. Harder tasks I tend to put off and procrastinate just because i know it requires more effort and thought. Like paying bills and getting my car maintained. These tasks i would likely put off for awhile, even though they are crucial to be done. I know i can do all these things separately; groceries, budgeting, paying bills etc, but when theres a day where i need to take care of 5 things all at once i get stuck in executive paralysis. I cannot jump from task to task, i end up just wasting all my time lying on the floor pretending like my responsibilities dont exist. And i know this isnt a healthy habit. I need help delegating my tasks, ive tried lists, ive tried focus timers. Ive tried it all at this point. But no, still i find myself struggling to get out of bed an start the difficult tasks. Did you ever run into the same problem? Or do you at least know something that might help? Thank you for your paitence with me :) much appreciated. Mentor 2023-11-22, 15:16: Hi Asia, It's wonderful to hear from you again. I hope that everthing isn't too overwhelming right now, you don't have to worry about being inconsistent in your responses, I will always be here to respond when you're able to talk about the modules. Even if you send a short message about how you're doing or if you need more time, I would understand too! I'm really sorry Mentorcity keeps glitching out, that sounds super frustrating. Usually what I do is I put my response on Notepad or Word before I copy and paste it over to send to you to try to avoid that situation. It is difficult to keep track and be on top of things that may cause you anxiety too. Especially with financial issue like bills and payments. That is totally normal though, that's where budgeting does come in handy! Learning more about what resources is available to you to support those bills and payments can also help. I'm glad to hear that you find yourself comfortable with doing things like groceries and the like, and I totally get where you're coming from when the tasks stack up and it becomes too much! It's also difficult when you come across a situation you keep telling yourself that you'll complete, especially if it feels like a smaller task, and then you find yourself unable to get around to it. For a lot of people, they build these tasks you've mentioned into their lives slowly, one at a time, and learn about them through their lived experiences. This allows them to be able to come to a point where they're running these tasks in the back of their head and planning for them passively. When you're younger and you've been tasked with all these situations (some of which you might not be comfortable with or have knowledge in), it all has to be actively considered and it creates a lot of pressure on you. I can see this being one of the reasons why you find yourself paralysed with finishing the tasks, not because you want to waste time or that you want to avoid them out of being distracted or forgetful. It's not your fault that focus timers or to-do lists don't work, sometimes anxiety really stops those conventional tools from being as effective as they can be. When I was in my early 20s and I just started University for the first time, I definitely had a long stint of time where I had the same problems. I had issues with my education, my personal life, and being an adult, and that became very overwhelming for me. For me, what helped was finding a new support system in new friends, and in people in my life that were more experienced in these issues I was having. I know that first step is often the hardest, it took me a few years after my troubles to actually be able to make it. But it never felt like wasted time, it always felt like I was growing as a person. All in all, the best thing I can suggest is to try to find people who might know more about different supports in your community, whether it be financial, social, or mental support systems. No problem! Like I said previouly, I am around if you want to check in or talk! And when you are able to, we can also work on the modules. I'm glad that you're making progress though, I'm always excited to hear about what you have to say! Warm regards, Nate Mentor 2023-12-19, 10:16: Hey Asia, Hope you're having a good December. Just checking in to see if there's anything I can do to help with your progress on the activities we've started. Just let me know, I'm always around to help! Warm regards, Nate",,,,,,"Mentor 2023-09-21, 10:11: Hi Asia, I'm pleased to meet you! It's exciting to have been matched with you. I see that you are interested in taking a gap year after you first graduate from high school to save up. I think that's a great idea, especially because it gives you time to start looking into the specifics of the trade programs that may interest you and plan ahead! I also see that you prefer to stay in a smaller town compared to moving out to a bigger city (like the Greater Vancouver area)! I would love to hear more about that. For your hopes of learning more about big city living, budgetting issues, substance issues, as well as family issues, please feel free to ask any questions whenever! I'm sure we will explore a lot of these concepts within the modules but don't be afraid to pitch me questions at any point if it ever comes up (as long as you're comfortable with it). As for information about me, I just recently graduated with my undergraduate in Applied Psychology with a focus on Counselling. Currently, I'm 28, and I worked after my first foray into post-secondary education. I only recently got back to finishing my degree! I am nonbinary, and I also go by they/them (or he/them) pronouns. I grew up in a single parent home with my younger brother. If you ever have any questions that you may be curious about regarding me and my life, also feel free to ask! I'll try my best to answer. Lastly, I see that you are only able to respond once a week and that you currently are extremely busy! Don't ever feel rushed to respond back. Please do let me know if it'll take you longer to reply if you're able though, and keep me updated so we can plan accordingly! Let me know which module you (or your teacher) would like to start with and we can begin whenever you're ready. Warm regards, Nate Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:42: Hi Nate! Nice to meet you! First regarding my response times: I said around once a week because I tend to forget to answer people occasionally and wanted to be honest with you. However, that may change, as I've been given specific class time to communicate with you, which I am very grateful for. Lately, I've been struggling with my social circle. Over the last year, I accidentally became popular. This year, during school I have been talking to many people during the day and it is getting kind of exhausting. I can pull myself through the day, but by Friday evening my social battery is completely out. To start off our units, maybe we could talk about family expectations and how to handle them. Recently I have been struggling at home with my dad. I feel like I have been working my ass off to try to prove to him that I'm doing well and being productive. But all he sees right now are my flaws. I am incredibly forgetful and my head is constantly cluttered, he doesn't understand how easy it is for something to slip my mind. I try my best to keep on top of everything, keeping lists, making mental notes and reminding myself later throughout the day. But nothing is enough for him. he doesn't often talk about them, but whenever I mess up, he likes to resurface everything I have been stressing about trying to fix for the past months. My dad and I are pretty close, we live alone with plans to move his girlfriend and her kid into the house very soon. This will definitely be a new adjustment as I am not close with her son very much. We are the same age, but nothing alike. This is also going to affect my dad's and my relationship. I feel like its going to cause both of us some stress having more people around 24/7, and not getting time to just us. Sorry to info dump to you in the first message lol, thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon. - Sincerely, Asia Asia's Who am I poem Mentee 2023-09-21, 14:45: Hi Nate, I just sent you a really long message and I am not sure if it sent Mentor 2023-09-21, 14:50: Hi Asia, Just responding really quickly to let you know that it sent and I will get around to responding very soon! Thank you for your quick response. It's lovely to hear from you! Warm regards, Nate Mentor 2023-09-25, 14:18: Hi Asia! I hope you had an excellent weekend, full of rest and recouperation. I'm glad to hear that being kept to a schedule helps you respond better, and I appreciate your candor. It's okay if you forget to message me back sometimes, it's also my job to remind you once in a while so you don't have to bear the burden of that alone! To help me orient myself, it would be helpful for me if you let me know when your specific class times are (which day of the week, what time, etc.) so we don't get our wires crossed and I can respond in a way that gives you optimal space and time to reply! I hear you on being exhausted because of having to socialize too much. However exciting it is to meet and get closer to new people, it is still taxing to have to consistently be ""on"". I'm sorry to hear that you are having this issue. Maybe one of the units we will be working through may help with remedying it or give a better base of understanding of what to do in these situations. With family expectations, I'm trying to figure out what would best fit what you are currently looking for. Your input would also be very appreciated, would you want to start with the ""Adulting"" unit or the ""Well-being and Self Care"" unit? I think one or the other would help address things like social life stress as well as family complications. Self-care is extremely important as you get older, especially for stress management and personal happiness. It sounds like you've really put effort into being productive despite sometimes being forgetful! What I can gather is that you've been continuously been working on yourself over the past months, and that sounds great. In other words, it sounds like you're already in a state of flux and the additional complications of both having your efforts dismissed as well as the potential additions of new people into your life in a more permenant way is causing you more stress. Having time to yourself is a very important part of being conscious of your own needs and I totally understand where you are coming from when you're worried you won't have enough space for yourself with two new people in the household. We can definitely talk more about your family worries once we delve deeper into the units. Thank you for your considerate nature! I am always happy to hear more about your life and whatever you feel comfortable sharing so please never feel apologetic about being more in-depth with your responses. I really appreciate your efforts in replying in such thoughtful ways. I hope you don't find MY responses to be too much, please let me know if it's too much work to get through everything I write and I can try to be more concise for you. Also your poem is so lovely, your use of specific sensory experiences really speaks to me. I'm not as eloquent as you but I've also attempted my own poem in a similar fashion. Who am I – A poem by Nate I am from Taiwanese pineapple cakes, From Salonpas and Advil, I am from the dusty, lived-in clutter of a home, Warm, sacred, loving hugs from my grandma From extremely long plane rides to extremely hot summers, just to see my loved ones I am from the beginnings of a new digital age, of awkward transitions and new discoveries From the fear of getting older, of chasing something I may have missed in my youth The stories of my parents, my grandparents, stories lost to the cruel progress of time I am from the movies and books that shaped me, from The Cat Returns to House of Leaves From the music that comforted me during tough times, and panels of a fat orange tabby who hates Mondays. I am from these moments – Continuously shifting and changing, like memories do, Another branch of the ancestral tree Anyways, I'm excited to hear back from you! Warm regards, Nate","Mentor 2023-10-03, 11:03: Hi Asia, I hope you had a restful long weekend! Mine was packed with activities everyday which was fun but left me with little respite, so I'm a little tired. However, I get to be a little more relaxed today so that's always a nice thing! I'm just checking in to make sure you're doing well and to let you know that, unfortunately, your teacher wants us to start from the unit ""From rural to urban"". I know that's not really something you are interested in but for now, I'm sure we can find some things in that unit that are relevant to you to talk about anyways! You should see the highlighted unit tab on your screen, if you press into it, you can respond in the unit instead of in ""Start here"". We can start whenever you like! Warmly, Nate Mentee 2023-10-03, 11:21: Hi Nate! Good to hear from you again, I'm sorry I forgot to respond to your message last week. I think the units you suggested would be better, but that's alright. I've lived in big and small cities all my life. I started in Prince George which is an average city I could say. In grade 5, I moved to Kelowna to be closer to my mom. However that only lasted a couple of years before I decided to move to the small city I'm in now. I have become accustomed to the moving process and I'm usually adaptable to my surroundings. As someone with social anxiety, living in a big, populated city is less desirable, but if the pros outweigh the cons, then I can suffer through and figure it out nonetheless. Hopefully this unit isn't too long, I would really like to dive into the other units, but ill get started on this one today. Thank you for your patience over the last week. My days have been packed full of house chores, moving people into the house, and escaping whenever I can to go hangout with friends. Hope to hear from you soon, Sincerely, Asia Mentor 2023-10-05, 14:00: Hi Asia, It's very nice to hear back from you. It's okay if you are slower to respond to my messages as long as we keep in contact! Thank you for sharing your living history with me, you've lived in more cities than I have! Moving is always a hectic and stressful process so it's good to hear that you're able to adequately adapt to your new situations. I totally can relate to having worries about being in a big city, especially when having to balance your anxieties. I'm sure we can talk about ways you can find to adjust to big city living so you won't have to suffer if you decide to move to somewhere like Vancouver. We can definitely work through it quickly and efficiently so we can talk about other units as well! We can start by talking about your current living situation. I'd love to hear about your school, like the size of it, the everyday activities the students do, things like that. I'd also love to hear about your thoughts on the strengths you may have gained through living in a more rural area, and the differences you've noticed between a city like Prince George/Kelowna and Prince Rupert. Thank you for your considerate comments! I'm always happy to wait if it means that you have ample time to give me your thoughtful responses, feel free to get back to me whenever! I hope it's okay if I give you reminders and that they don't sound like I'm nagging you to respond! Warmly, Nate Mentor 2023-10-12, 09:50: Hey Asia, Just checking in! Hope you had a relaxing long weekend and your week's been okay. Just let me know if you need any help with the first lesson, don't hesitate to ask questions. Warmly, Nate",,,,
1047567623,8/22/2022 13:06,1047627550,67329,,,,,"Mentee 2023-10-22, 21:13: Heyooo Sarah, I am doing my usual Sunday night to-do list. First off, I found it really funny that you are apologizing for typos and rambling when literally all of my messages are a complete mess of my thoughts all over the place. I really enjoy reading your long ""rambling"" paragraphs. They feel honest and true to yourself. I look forward to receiving your messages and they always brighten up my day. I have attached and filled out the adulting document that was provided. I was honestly really struggling with filling it out. I read your message on Thursday and it took me 4 days to respond because I just could not figure out what to say. From what I understand, there are a lot of skills and responsibilities you need to take on when you are living independently as an adult. Personally, I have always grown up with my mother looking after me. You briefly mentioned in the rural-to-urban unit about your parents being first-generation immigrants and you feeling kind of like an outsider. My parents are also immigrants and ever since I was little my mum has always done pretty much everything for me. She is definitely the best mother to exist. Yeah but anyway, I am kinda inexperienced in a lot of everyday things. It was only about a year ago when I even learned how to do my own laundry. Although, one of my strong suits is probably cleaning and keeping the house spotless. I have always been a massive germaphobe, and I like to keep everything organized. Even sitting here at my desk right now, everything is perfectly organized and dusted. I just cannot stand seeing even the tiniest mess, especially in my room. Secondly, I have always gone grocery shopping with my mother, and it is always really boring but it definitely is not hard. I am a really cheap person and it is really easy for me to ignore things I wanna buy. I am very good at controlling myself when it comes to spending money. Which leads to banking. Another one of my stronger suits. Especially due to my capstone project...which I still haven't talked to you about at all. I'll just really quickly throw this out there...I am trying to start a tutoring business, and it has been going pretty well so far. During this process, I have had to handle money in many different ways and whenever something doesn't make sense I always go to my brother for advice. In the last couple of months, I have managed accounts, made and accepted e-transfers, and even learned how to write cheques. Banking and budgeting are both things I can't imagine ever struggling to manage. As I am writing this, I am realizing my many weaknesses and my lack of experience in everything. First off, public transit. This is one that I chose to put in the middle in the document. It is something I am a lot less nervous about than others. I have plenty of experience in calling and taking taxis, and a very small but not terrible amount of experience in taking buses. With so many options in large cities, I feel like it'll be pretty easy to get the hang of bus routes and stuff. Another thing that doesn't seem too bad from what I have been taught and what I have heard is taxes. We are learning all about them in class right now and it doesn't seem like the end of the world. There is this culture around being scared of taxes and all that, but I think I'll be able to figure it out. Now we get into the disaster of my inexperience. To start, my mum has pretty much always cooked for me. I should probably start cooking soon...I do enjoy baking though. It is very fun. I really enjoy cooking, I just don't do it very often. I don't really know what to say about paying bills. I wrote not yet but that's because I have never had to pay any bills so far. I don't have anything to pay lol. As I mentioned earlier, I can't imagine struggling with budgeting so when it comes time that I do have to pay bills I am sure I will be able to stay on top of things. Spending money hurts my soul, so hopefully I can keep the spending to a minimum, but during college years I will probably be spending a lot of money. Finding somewhere to live...Once again, I have never really had to do this. I remember going house hunting with my parents when we first moved here, but for me, it was just fun. I was just a little kid who was having a great time fantasizing about which room would be mine and all the fun stuff I would do in every house we visited. I guess it is time for me to start looking for places to live. I think the first years usually have guaranteed housing, especially if I apply this early. Now...my biggest and most embarrassing problem...I cannot make appointments for the life of me!!!! I CAN'T EVEN ORDER FOOD ON THE PHONE! I DON'T KNOW WHY I JUST CANNOT. It is something I absolutely need to practice. Every time I try ordering food on the phone or try talking to my doctor on the phone, I just freeze up. I FORGET ENGLISH. I just stop functioning. It is so bad. Well now I have gone through pretty much everything that was listed and you have a decent idea of where I am at. Now, I would love to know what you struggled with. Maybe we have some things in common? I could definitely use the advice. I think it would be irrational to worry about these things. I am confident in myself. I will learn and adapt. Everyone has to learn these things eventually. It would just be nice to learn them the easy way rather than messing up really badly and then freaking out about it. As for anything else going on in my life that I wanna tell you about...I applied to the University of Calgary. I am planning on applying to UVIC and UofO. I don't see a point in applying to UBC because I know I don't wanna live down in Vancouver. But, in the back of my mind, I hear this voice that is like, ""What if UBC would actually be a great option and you are making a mistake...You are gonna regret not applying there."" Do you think I should just apply everywhere? It is kinda pricey though. My mum says I should apply everywhere because you only get to do it once in your life so why not? I know I most likely won't get rejected anywhere. I don't know why I would get rejected. They basically take anyone. My transcript is straight A's so I think I am fine. Applications for Shopify Dev Degree haven't opened yet, but I have been checking constantly. I am gonna put my heart and soul into that application. It needs to be perfect. I would usually say something genshin related but nothing much has happened. Play Neuvillette's story quest if you haven't. It is pretty cool. I am completely broke on primos but I've been doing my coms. I have about 20 pulls. If I want furina I am going to have to pray really hard lol. I'm sure she will have a rerun really quickly, plus I wanna wish for Arlecchino anyway so I am gonna keep saving. I wish you the best of luck on your furina pulls. Hopefully, you can get her early and not go completely broke after all that saving. OH! I was gonna ask...Are you f2p? Because I was until recently I bought my first welkin...Not my proudest moment but I allow it. Anyway, hope you had a great weekend. As usual, I am gonna be looking forward to your response. It always makes my day better. :) Mentor 2023-10-24, 01:45: Hi Ansh! I’m really glad that you find my messages enjoyable, I hope I can help you as much as possible. Don’t worry about replying to everything I say, honestly our paragraphs are getting so long I'm having a hard time keeping track of everything haha! I agree with a lot of what you say, especially about taking on so much more responsibility as you transition to becoming an adult. So I'm really similar to you in that my parents also really spoiled me as I was growing up, so I didn't really end up doing too many chores; however, when I went to university, I had to learn a lot more about doing things like keeping my room clean, making sure to wash my dishes right away, etc. It's really good that one of your strong suits is cleaning though because I think a lot of people at university (including me) are definitely not the cleanest. Even as someone who is kind of messy, I find that I still think my roommates are very very messy. Grocery shopping is a pretty difficult thing for me too as I tend to just buy the absolute basics but I have also noticed that a lot of the more nutritious stuff tends to be a little bit more expensive so make sure not to be too cheap when you're purchasing food for yourself. Your capstone project sounds insanely cool! I honestly could not imagine trying to run a tutoring business as I am just really bad at leadership positions in general. The fact that you're able to do this at such a young age is super impressive and it'll definitely help a lot in the future when you're learning to manage finances and even as you're trying to learn how to do taxes. Regarding some of the other things you mentioned, I think learning to ride transit is something that won't take you long to learn and there's a lot of apps out there now that can help you get around the city really easily. Cooking is definitely something that's very difficult to learn if you don't want to try. I know this as someone whose parents also cooked for me all my life! I had a really hard time learning to cook in university but as you stay here by yourself, you’re kind of forced into doing it and you'll basically have to learn in order to survive. However, I definitely think it's a really good idea to learn from your mom how to cook some very basic and easy to make dishes immediately so you won't have an issue right when you get there. You're also correct that you probably won't have too much of an issue with housing as most universities do have a first year guarantee for their residencies. I think it's really interesting that you're unable to make appointments because you seem like a very extroverted person that can talk to anyone but no worries if you can't! It will honestly just take some practice: you just have to remember that the person on the other end of the phone is really just trying to get through the conversation as fast as possible. As long as you give them the information they need, that's all you pretty much need to do. I know it sounds like it would be nice to learn things the easy way but I will be honest with you, you will definitely learn and remember things a lot more if you make a mistake. Lastly, it's very interesting that you applied to the University of Calgary; I think it's a really nice university campus wise but it's obviously not super ahead rankings wise. I think it's probably not a bad idea to apply to UBC if finances are not an issue for you but if you for sure you wouldn’t want to go, then it’s probably best not to waste the time and effort on it. Good luck on applying for the Shopify degree, I really hope you will get into that! P.S. I have not had the time to grind out Genshin recently because I had to work on this huge project for my physics class simulating galaxy collisions for the past two weeks but I will get to the Neuvillette’s quest as soon as possible since everyone has been saying it's super cool! I am also F2P mostly, I did buy welkin one time as well but aside from that, I am basically completely F2P. I hope you had a great weekend as well and I wish you luck on all of your applications! I know it can be a really stressful time right now but I promise that it'll get a lot easier. Mentee 2023-10-29, 16:12: Heyooo Sarah, Yes, it has been an entire week...And this coming week is even more busy. There is too much going on and I do not like it lol. BUT, adulting lesson 2 time. I am filling out the sheet as I am typing this and I am like very much struggling. I decided to choose Ottawa for this assignment because that is most likely where I am going. I searched the web for some housing and I found some epic stuff. First off, the student housing on campus is a complete scam and it is way too expensive. However, I did find these nice apartments about a 30-minute bus ride away. The housing prices in Ottawa are so much better. I think it's the best option for me. There are fully furnished apartments for around 500-700 a month depending on what you want. They are shared apartments with 5 bedrooms, a full kitchen, and a living room. You can also pay an extra 100 dollars a month for a private bathroom which is sick. The only downside is that it is 30 minutes away. I did some research and apparently, every student at UofO gets a bus pass included in their tuition. When I found that out I was hyped as heck. Is that normal for universities? Or, is UofO just being cool? Moving on to cell phone plans......I DID NOT REALIZE HOW EXPENSIVE THEY WERE! I am gonna buy the cheapest plan I can get. Groceries: I am gonna live off of a diet of eggs, chicken breast, and rice. Those are the 3 things I will be eating daily. Groceries are pricey in today's world. I asked my mom and she said it's probably gonna cost me around 400 a month. She says that my brother gets 500 a month from my parents and he eats way more than me. I will probably be able to manage. As for eating out, I will probably do it a couple of times a week because cooking takes too much time. I'll try to limit myself though. Car: I am not planning on buying anytime soon, although who knows what can happen. My brother may also buy a car which I could be able to use. There's no way to know what can happen. Which is why I am struggling with this assignment. Clothes and stuff: This one made me chuckle. I have no clue how much I will spend on this, but I will try to keep it low. I don't struggle with managing my money at all. I can overcome the temptation to buy stuff. I will only do things if they are necessary, like a winter jacket or boots. I currently pay my gym membership for 45 dollars a month. For entertainment, I can only imagine myself going to watch a movie, not sure what else I would do. There'll probably be special occasions where I spend more but that'll be rare. Medical and Dental I have no idea. Speaking of dental I had a dentist appointment today. For my annual cleaning and after my x-rays we found out that I HAVE TO REMOVE ALL 4 WISDOM TEETH SO YAY ME :((( Have you gotten your wisdom teeth removed? Please share your traumatic experience so I can know what to look forward to because I am the first person in my bloodline to have their wisdom teeth removed. Emergency Fund? I had to ask my mom and she said that I don't have many things to be worried about. I don't have a car or house or anything but things can still happen. The article it told me to read, briefly talked about credit cards. I know my brother has recently gotten his first one. I think I will wait a couple of years. Although it did say it is good to build credit score early. Do you have a credit card? If so, when did you get it and why? Do you think I should get one sooner or later? When I reached the income section of the worksheet I just completely gave up. I could write my current income. I tutor pretty much every day after school whenever I don't have rehearsals or practices. The problem is that I don't know whether or not I will be working part-time. Especially the first year. I wanna settle in and get used to living alone before I start working, On top of that, I don't know if my classes will be hard or not either, It gets even more confusing because scholarships and bursaries can't be filled out yet. I don't know how much money I'll receive for a while. I am sure I will get at least a little bit, but I am gonna have to leave that blank. Next, I asked my mom how much is in my RESP and she's not sure but she said around 25-30 thousand. I didn't know I even had an RESP until like a month ago which was such a huge relief. Thank you, parents! I also have been saving my own money as well. I am a money hoarder and spend nothing at all! I have about 6 thousand saved from working the last year. Hopefully, by the end of this school year, I can get up to 10 thousand. A lot of my friends have worked much more than I have and have saved much more than me which makes me feel really bad about myself, but my mom says I shouldn't worry and I shouldn't compare myself to other people. I do a job I love and I enjoy it a lot. There is a section that says family contribution and I am not sure what to put there, because my parents are willing to pay for the entire cost which I am SO SO SO grateful for. Are your parents paying for your schooling? Also, are you working? If you are, how do you manage to balance your epic and fascinating projects with your job? Speaking of your fascinating projects. SIMULATING GALAXY COLLISIONS??? THAT IS THE COOLEST THING EVER! I wanna do that so badly. Physics is the coolest thing ever. It must get so complex and detailed at the post-secondary level. I took and am taking high school physics and I already love it. I also tutor Physics 11 because I love it so much lol. Anyway, back to the assignment. So, unfortunately, I did just leave the income part blank, but I discussed my thoughts about it so hopefully that's okay! I am genuinely curious about your experience with budgeting. Tell me all the embarrassing stories! I wanna learn. I wanna know about your housing experience too! Was it hard to find places? Did you or are you living in a place you dislike? Do you have any other unique or crazy housing stories? As I typed all of this I think I asked questions as they came into my head. You know me, I just spam type and my thoughts are a complete mess lol. Now, for the stuff unrelated to the assignment. Are you a superhero fan? Spider-Man perhaps? Have you seen the new Spider-Man game? MY GOD WAS IT PHENOMENAL. IT HAS GOTTA BE THE BEST STORYWRITING I HAVE EVER SEEN. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH As for genshin...FURINA IS CLOSE!!! I am so excited about the new Archon quest. It is gonna be a banger I know it! I told myself I'd collect all the never hydroculi before the map expands again, but I haven't had any time at all! Even as I am writing this I am rushing because I have rehearsal from 5 till 9. I think that sums up adulting and stuff. I am pretty sure I get to choose the next one. If I do, then can we do strategic studying? That one sounds interesting, I have never studied in my life lol. I need advice for when I will need to study in the future. That reminds me, I have my Literacy 12 assessment tomorrow! How exciting...... I would spam crying emojis but I am not using my phone. I also have a biology 12 unit test on biochemistry. On Halloween, my friends and I are being Jedi. I even bought a super expensive custom lightsaber...It was so worth it. On top of that, I have a presentation this week too. Ugh. I don't know why I am saying all this but it is helping me remember everything lol. I am sure you are so much more busy. You should tell me about your physics assignments and projects more! I find them so inspiring and cool. Okay! Have a Happy Halloween! How does Halloween even work in big cities? I have no clue. I probably won't reply till the weekend again but I do always read your messages immediately after you send them. I look forward to them so much lol. Mentor 2023-11-01, 00:59: I am currently in the process of writing out a longggg response ahaha, I will try my best to get it to you by tomorrow! Mentor 2023-11-01, 21:52: Hi Ansh! It's interesting that in Ottawa the student housing is a complete scam and it's actually cheaper further away, as at UBC it's kind of the opposite; basically the houses nearby are insanely overpriced, whereas on campus housing is the only affordable option unless you're willing to commute more than an hour away. 500 to 700/month is insanely good so I would definitely recommend renting off campus, especially as commuting about half an hour isn't too bad. Most universities have a bus pass included in their tuition, or at least I know UBC definitely does. In terms of cell phone plans, there are definitely some very cheap options out there, I know the very 1st one I got was around $25/month for unlimited text and calling but there was unfortunately no data. Your diet sounds really healthy at least but I have a feeling you might get tired of it quickly. Don't be afraid to eat out every now and then, especially as I feel that's the main things uni students do to hang out, but obviously you should budget your outings. I don't think a car is very necessary in cities with good transportation; at least in Vancouver, I've never felt the need to use a car, since I just use my UBC bus pass everywhere. If you bring some of your pre-existing clothes to university you'll probably be able to save a lot. I don't think I needed to really buy anything new. It's interesting that your gym membership is 45 a month - I think a lot of universities either typically offer a gym pass for a lot cheaper or even for free. For example, at UBC it's $40 for the entire semester which is four months vs. I know from my friends at University of Calgary that their gym is completely free due to their tuition. Entertainment wise, I think going out to watch movies is definitely cool but it's a little bit hard to do that with friends. I think one of the best things to do with friends is just going out and eating/maybe exploring downtown and any new areas. I also had to remove my wisdom teeth a long time ago but I actually got it removed around the exact same time as you, which was in grade 12. I actually had five wisdom teeth that needed to be removed, so they just put me under and took all five out at once. I think getting the actual teeth removed wasn't bad at all, the worst part was definitely the recovery. My mouth was essentially bleeding every 10 seconds so I literally could not do anything but huch over the sink for three full days. I think I agree with your mom that you probably don't need to worry too much about an emergency fund cause she will have that covered mostly for you; however, I do think it's a really good idea to get a credit card early I got one as soon as I turned 18 in order to start building a good credit score. You won't have to worry too much about not being able to pay off bills because your mom can help you in the worst case scenario. It takes a long time to build up a good credit so you should definitely start as soon as possible. Just make sure your starting credit limit isn't too low so you don't accidentally overcharge your card, but also don't make it too high which might cause you to accidentally spend too much. I'd say for the first year, I recommend not doing a part time job because 1st year is a really big transition for a lot of people and it can be very difficult to kind of settle into taking classes and doing everything so independently while juggling a job. I don't think you need to worry too much about the fact that you haven't saved up as much as your friendsI - my friends and I didn't even really save for universities at all as our parents were paying for it so the fact that you have such a large amount saved up already is really impressive and really speaks to your commitment to going to university. I didn't really need to work during my university years, but I have done a couple of research internships over the summer and for two thirds of last year which helped me save quite a bit for uni. Most of my funding actually comes from student loans that I took from the province. I highly recommend applying to student loans as there is no interest. Similarly to what I said above, I thought that it would be a little bit too difficult for me to balance doing a part time job as well as classes so I opted to focus on my academics; however, that is a personal choice for everyone to make. When I was trying to find housing back at UBC after COVID, it was a huge mess since everyone was coming back to live on campus. My friend and I looked around 2 months in advance and were always beaten by other people. In the end, we managed to find a place but the landlord was really scammy and untrustworthy. It really is such a pain to deal with. Definitely start looking around 2-3 months in advance if you know the market is going to be competitive. I think regarding housing I've never really had too many issues with the places I stay at. However, I did decide to room with my best friend from first year and that was one of the worst decisions that ever made. We simply could not agree on cleanliness and it really deteriorated our friendship so be careful who you choose to room with in the future. I used to be a huge Marvel fan but I haven't seen some of the newer movies after End game. I have heard that the new Spider-Man game is amazing, but I’m way too busy right now and I don't have the time. In the future, I will definitely consider playing it, especially as the most important thing to me in a game is probably the plot. As for Genshin, I am also extremely excited about Furina! I can't believe there's less than a week until she comes out - not only that, the new Archon quest is definitely going to be amazing. I have been grinding the new areas non-stop since release to get as many Primogems as possible so I am definitely very ready. I think I've got close to 200-ish pulls now. I haven't gotten any instructions regarding which unit we can do next, but if we are allowed to choose the next one, I wouldn't mind doing strategic studying at all. As soon as I get the email from your teacher, I will open the new module. I'm very happy that this is helping you remember your assignments because I honestly also forget what I need to do all the time so I probably need to start writing that down too ahaha. As for the current physics assignment I'm working on, I'm investigating numerical techniques to evaluate ordinary differential equations. Essentially, there are a lot of unsolvable equations in math so you need to use special methods in order to approximate them. This one project already took me way too long to finish but I think I'm almost done. Also happy late Halloween!!! I'm so sorry I didn't get to reply in time, I hope you had a really awesome Halloween. Unfortunately, I didn't really get to do much, but I guess today I made a pizza at home which tasted really good. I'm really glad that you look forward to my messages. I also really appreciate the amount of effort and thought you put into your messages as it is really interesting to hear about all the cool things going on in your life. Good luck on all of your assignments and exams!",,,"Mentor 2023-11-20, 00:07: Just opened the Career Exploration unit! Honestly I'm not very surprised that a lot of your classmates don't like it; I had two mentees before you and it felt like they both just did the absolute bare minimum to get the questions done with. Like they mostly gave me 1-2 sentence responses and I had to tell them which questions to answer and which questions they could ask me. That's why when I was matched with you, I was shocked at the amount of effort and thought you put into your responses; it was just so different from my previous two mentees haha! I really appreciate how sincere and thoughtful you are. Hopefully at least some of the other mentors are as lucky as me. I honestly don't know anyone else in this mentoring program. I chose to do it because it seemed like a really accessible way to reach students that I would have no way of actually meeting in person, and I really want to help others not make the same mistakes I did when I was applying to university. Mentee 2023-12-03, 22:11: OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK, HEYO Sarah! It has been probably the most hectic week of my life so far but I also made some of the best memories I will make in high school! I'll tell you about it later. Let us discuss career exploration! So It asked me to watch at least one of the videos they provided but I just watched all of them lol. The first one I clicked on was the one with the snowboarding thumbnail because I thought it was gonna be about a professional snowboarder. Maybe like an Olympic athlete or something. But, I GOT SCAMMED. It was a doctor. He was still super cool though. The variety of the videos was kind of lacking in my opinion. There are a lot more jobs in the world than just doctors and nurses lol. Except for that one guy, who gave up his acting career when he got older. I can understand why he did that. Maybe I will do something like that too. All of them discussed similar things. The snowboarder guy obviously wanted to live somewhere where he could do his job and also be able to get out on the fresh powder on the same day or kayak. Pretty cool dude in my opinion. He talked about being surrounded by wildlife and mountains and trees and nature. He also mentioned no traffic, no crime, and some other things. I feel like that's a bit farfetched because although I can relate to everything he talks about being in a small town myself, there is still quite a bit of crime and especially poverty, at least where I live. Other than that, a lot of what he values reflects on me. I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing urban life YET but I am soon to do so. I don't think I could possibly enjoy it more though. There's just something so nice about how friendly the people are and the fresh air. I wake up in the morning and see fresh snow on the mountain right outside my window. It is just the best feeling. My favourite part of Prince Rupert is the fresh ocean breeze every day. The second video with the rural nurse was super short and felt less like an interview and more like an advertisement for UNBC which is hilarious lol. I am quite close to UNBC and a lot of the people I know either go there or have graduated from there. In this video, the nurse talked about helping out back in her home and giving back to the community. It is too soon for me to decide what I want in terms of coming back home or not. I have aspirations and desires and I wanna accomplish things. To me, coming back home limits me from pushing myself to achieve bigger things in life. Everything I just said could be a complete lie. I have absolutely no clue what I want yet. The next video was about Dr Evan Adams, once again a super cool person. He took a break from school to go into acting which is epic. He said some really important things which stood out to me in this interview. This video was a much better interview than the previous one. It was very informative and he had a lot to share. One thing that caught my attention was him talking about having the burden to ""get an education and help the people"" which yes I agree is a burden. Being a teenager it has been drilled into our minds that we absolutely have to follow along that path. Additionally having immigrant parents, who worked incredibly hard to build a future for me and my brother, makes it pretty much mandatory for me to get an education (not that I don't want to). He talked about wanting to help people and how healthcare is always in need and growing and all that as well. Lastly, the final video was about a registered nurse. She seems like a super friendly person. The main thing I took from this video is her not knowing what to do after high school. And later she mentions how she didn't go to school until 26 or 27. She recommends you go straight after high school just to get your education out of the way. To her, it seems that work is super important to her. She loves her job and just wanted to get through her studies as fast as she could so that she could work and be a nurse. Although I understand where she is coming from, personally I have genuine curiosity, and love learning. I wish that I could continue to study for my entire life. Working the same job everyday of your life must become so boring after a while. I wanna do something where I can change it up and have fun with it. I want to have some creative freedom. For example, being a teacher. You can do different things with your class, you can decorate your classroom for different holidays, you can participate in community events, get involved, and every year you get new students! You are also helping the next generation get their education. Just like healthcare, it is a job that is always in demand. My life values definitely include helping the world. I wanna make a difference. I want to contribute to society. But, not in this way. I want to be an engineer to help the environment and help make advancements for humankind. There are so many jobs I wanna do. I wish I could study for my entire life and do as many jobs as I want. I cannot imagine myself doing one job for my entire life, I will keep changing it up here and there if the opportunities face me. As for other values, I wanna touch on the rural vs urban but to be completely honest I can't answer that yet without being biased. You know my thoughts on rural and urban already lol. I obviously want to be able to afford a decent lifestyle and some hobbies. But, I also wanna do something where I have to use my brain. All my life I have always been drawn to puzzles. I love math, chess, and even Rubik's cubes. I got into speed solving a few years back and I have been collecting speed cubes since then. I am part of my school's math club and love to participate in competitions. Those math problems are like puzzles that are just so enjoyable to me. I don't know why. The other thing that I love is music, as I have probably already told you a million times. Both making and listening to music, are my two favourite things ever. I don't have a clue where I'll be 10 years from now, but, I do know that I am not gonna stick to one job. I really wanna join a band during university. I am not studying music, but I want to continue pursuing my main passion. I also wanna get into producing music as a side hobby. I have always wanted to write music. Other than music, you know about my passion for teaching. Part of teaching for me is getting to do the math myself lol. I love being able to share my passion for problem-solving with other people. I love seeing their eyes glow up when they get it and they have that clicking moment. I wanna inspire people to like math and science. Because science is the coolest thing on the planet, and if your science teacher sucks, then you will hate science. But, if your science teacher is cool as heck, then you'll be inspired to study science! I am going into mechanical engineering because I find it absolutely sick. I am gonna get to do the coolest stuff next year, and I get to learn about all the stuff I wanna learn about. I get to do math and physics! And AND AND I get to solve problems and build stuff! It will be so cool! Why are you studying physics? I know I have to ask you this for the unit question but I have just genuinely wanted to ask you that anyway. I feel like you've told me the answer before, but I wanna hear more about it! Tell me about what you are planning on doing next year. Also, YOU GOTTA TELL me about some of the stuff you've learnt! Studying physics for 4 years must've been so interesting. I would love to do that but I don't know what to do with a physics degree lol. Where are you applying for next year? And what for? What are your long-term goals? Alright, moving on, I have so flipping much to tell you. You have absolutely no idea. FIRSTLY....I got accepted into Carleton....and they gave me a 4 thousand dollar entrance scholarship renewable for 4 years! So that's pretty cool. I applied for a mechanical engineering co-op program. Carleton is looking promising, I might accept their offer in the coming months. My dream program application is opening on the 4th! So I can't wait for that. Although, I hope I have the time to do the application lol. MMMM NEXT, THE MUSICAL WAS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST! We have rehearsal every night this week until 11. It was very painful but also super memorable and fun. I am gonna miss it a lot. We had 3 shows at our local theatre. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 7:30 pm. All of them ended at around 10:00 pm. Friday was definitely our best show, and it was absolutely crowded. I'd say around 200 people, which is pretty good for us. On Saturday, when the show ended, before everyone got up, all the grads (including me) went out on the stage and did a big speech for our drama teacher and band teacher who are both absolute legends. Then we gave them both gifts and flowers. It was really wholesome but also emotional because it was our last musical in high school. It's over now and I feel like this void inside of me. I feel empty. I hate this feeling. we have been working so hard for the last few months. I remember telling you about it when we first started rehearsals. I got a bunch of pictures with friends and stuff. I got some flowers from friends and family. We took some cast photos in the lobby and we got some pictures of all the grads together too. As I am writing all of this to you I am getting super emotional lol. It really was an amazing experience and I am glad to have experienced it with all my friends. We are a really tight-knit group of theatre/band kids. We had an after-party where we did Secret Santa and karaoke and it was super fun! I would send you all the photos I took but I am not allowed to show you pictures of myself. What about group photos? OR photos that I am not in but other people are? I am probably not allowed any of that, unfortunately. I have a few pictures of the theatre and my drum kit but there are other people in those pictures otherwise I would send them. Also, sorry for not messaging all week. I felt really bad about that but I was super busy with rehearsals and then obviously the shows themselves. I didn't even have time to do any of my schoolwork...I just caught up on everything today. I have been doing this week's work that I missed all day today. Tomorrow is gonna be so weird at school because we won't have rehearsal. AH, I HATE THIS FEELING. Tell me you can relate lol. I need some wise words from you Sarah! I am so emotional right now! There's definitely a bunch more stuff I have to tell you but at the moment after talking about the musical I am losing my mind lol. Anyway, If I remember anything I wanted to say I will let you know! I am looking forward for you to get back to me! It always makes my day. Hope you have a great week! LAST THING, when you messaged me to check up on me that was like one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. Thank you so much, it warmed my heart. I had a grin on my face when I read that lol. Mentee 2023-12-04, 16:39: i just realized that i wrote snowboarding in my message...clearly i was pretty exhausted lol. pls pretend it says skiing Mentor 2023-12-06, 01:16: Hi Ansh! Glad to hear you finally made it through this week! It has also been an INCREDIBLY busy last few weeks for me so I totally get you. Can’t say I got any good memories out of it though ahha mainly because I was really just grinding out assignments. I agree that the variety of videos is definitely lacking. I think in general these types of activities want to restrict the job types to things you're more familiar with such as doctors or nurses because some of the more obscure positions tend not to be considered by a lot of people. Mainly I think they're just trying to cover the most popular options that are considered by most people in high school. I think it's cool that the doctor chose to work in a rural area in order to both do his job and also explore nature when he's not working. I think when he mentioned that there was not much traffic and crime, he was overselling rural life a little bit, as I completely agree that there is definitely still a lot of that regardless of where you are. However, I think it's great that you agree with him that rural living is such a big part of your life. As someone who has lived in a large city for the vast majority of my life, I think I am definitely not as connected with my community and the natural world, so it's cool to hear from people who do live in those types of communities. I think it's a great idea to move away from home for university as it's the first time that you're truly independent from your parents and able to make a lot of decisions and choices for yourself. A lot of my friends who went to university in the same city for their undergrad still feel very attached to their parents and their current social group but they haven't really tried living by themselves yet. One of my friends actually went to our hometown university for undergrad but ended up going somewhere else after undergrad and found that she actually really enjoyed living independently as well, so I think it's really important to move away from home in order to explore your interests. I agree with Dr Adams that the burden to get an education and help people is something that a lot of high schoolers experience when they're trying to first choose their career and university programs. You feel that you really need to not only find a job that is beneficial to a lot of people, but also something that will help you earn a lot and be able to live a comfortable life. However, a lot of the time those two things don't really intersect, and so you really have to choose between the two. There's also a lot of pressure from other people to succeed and do well so you can take care of the people around you which is obviously another big thing that can clash with personal interests. I'm really similar to you in that my immigrant parents built up a future for me and my sister by coming here to Canada, so I really want to be able to pay them back by getting into a good career and take care of them when they grow older. I think what the nurse said about not knowing what to do after high school is actually a very very common thing that all high schoolers experience. One of the postdoctoral students I worked with a couple of years ago said that after high school, she decided to take a gap year off just to work in a grocery store so she could have a little bit more time to think about what she actually wanted to do. I think that the nurse might say to go straight to high school because it is her experience that she probably would have preferred getting her education out of the way as soon as possible; however I also hear the opposite from a lot of people who did decide to pursue their education right away and feel that they should have taken some more time to think about it. Basically, grass is always greener on the other side. If you really enjoy learning you could always pursue becoming a professor or essentially any job that requires a lot of innovation on a daily basis as you’ll always be learning about new ways to improve teaching, designing, etc. I think that becoming a teacher is definitely a great idea; as you said, you can always do different things with your class everyday and the fact that you get new students every year means you will experience the same year in a row. It’s a really important role to essentially teach and even inspire the next generation too! For example, my junior high math teacher was the one that really inspired me to get into math, as I had previously absolutely hated it and that motivated me to get into physics later on. It's really interesting that you mentioned you really want to learn and do as many jobs as you want; I recently saw an influencer online who was literally doing that, and basically trying out a hundred different jobs to see how they are and show people the realities of that position. However, I think for most of us, we have to try our best to choose the job that we think will be most interesting to do for a while and then continue in it. Of course, it's always possible to switch careers later on but it can be a lot more difficult especially if you have to get another education. I think it's amazing that you love math and science so much, as it will be really beneficial to you if you decide to pursue anything in the sciences really, and especially engineering. If you're really into solving math problems and those types of things, there are a million clubs at university that you could join and be a part of. In my first year, I joined an aerodesign team and more recently a software design team to see if I could pursue it as a career. Music is also a huge part of universities and the clubs here. I know a lot of classmates who joined the university acapella group or even the symphonic orchestra for fun, so there are definitely a lot of different options out there. In your first year, I think it's a really good idea to try to branch out and join as many clubs and groups as possible so you can really try everything out and make a lot of friends along the way. I studied physics because I first got interested in it when my dad used to show me these physics documentaries when I was a kid. The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene was an extremely interesting documentary to me at the time when I watched it in grade 6, and it basically inspired me to pursue physics for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, as you may know, physics is not the most employable degree unless you go past your undergrad. BUT, you do pick up a lot of transferable skills along the way and I know a lot of people who do physics eventually end up doing something computer science or software related as physics usually involves a lot of coding. So basically my career plans are most likely to pursue a PhD in physics in order to explore my interests and then probably transition into something more industry related in order to be able to make a good living. Currently, that means I'm just mostly applying to grad schools across Canada but I think I really do just want to stay at UBC as I really enjoy it here. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ENTRANCE SCHOLARSHIP, THAT’S AMAZING!!! Honestly, it’s such a good option if you choose Carleton because that means there will be a lot less of a financial burden on both you and your family and Carlton's pretty good in terms of engineering I think. I do hope that you still apply to your dream program and get in so good luck on that! I'm glad to hear that your musical went really well! I know it sounds like it's the end of a good thing but you'll always have the opportunity to do things like this in the future with both old and new friends. I know it can seem sad right now because it seems like everything is ending and that you'll be leaving everyone soon but remember you can always keep in touch with everyone and continue to do things together if everyone really wants to. Additionally, you'll always have the opportunity to create new memories with the people that you meet at university. From talking to you, I can tell that you're definitely very good at making friends so I don't think you'll really have problems anywhere you go. I am honestly so jealous that you guys have time to party right now as I am drowning in so many assignments and work right now. Don't worry about not being able to send the photos - it is technically true that we're not supposed to send any photos that contain people in them. When I left for UBC, I also felt the same way as my core group of friends (which included people I had known since kindergarten) threw me a farewell party which made me really sad about leaving. In the 4 years since though, I have met so many new and amazing people, and it hasn’t hurt my relationship with my old friends at all! In fact, I make them intermingle too ahhaa. Don't worry about not messaging me all week. I was genuinely so busy last week as well that I probably wouldn't have been able to reply right away. This is the first time that I've had to really work so hard to finish all my assignments. Even if you don't have rehearsal, maybe you could try to meet up with everyone to see if they want to study together or do things together so that it kind of still recreates that environment with everyone? Maybe also take a break and do something that you enjoy so you can distract yourself and recuperate after what is probably a very emotionally and physically exhausting time. I'm glad that you enjoy my replies and that you're doing okay because I know you're usually very timely at responses so I was slightly worried that you hadn't replied in a while. Good to know that you were just busy doing amazing things! Of course, let me know if you have anything you want to talk about for the rest of this week and I wish you luck on all of your remaining assignments, exams and applications! P.S. Sorry if some of my sentences don’t quite make sense or if there are a lot of grammatical issues, I started rambling after a while hahaha Mentee 2023-12-12, 22:45: Heyoo Sarah, Today has been quite a crazy day, but today has also been a nice treat. Basically, I woke up this morning to get ready for band, just the usual routine. Then I drove to school, and as I got there, it was unusually dark. Then I realized that the school had no power. By the way, this entire time, there is a crazy storm blowing my car around, and the rain is so heavy I can't see even 5 meters in front of my car. So yeah! Turns out that that entire side of town has had no power since last night. Something bad must've happened. At the time of my writing this, they still don't have power over there, but thank god we do over here. Anyway, today was so needed. Holy crap, am I sick of school...and the amount of assignments. Never in my life has school been even slightly overwhelming, but this year, I don't know what's wrong with me. I have like mentally given up, and I don't care anymore. I leave everything until the last minute, and then I get a reality check, desperately rushing to finish everything. I think I just finished the last essay I will ever have to write in high school. Isn't that crazy? I am so old now... Besides all that, today allowed me to sleep in and relax and also allowed me to do some homework. It's time to do lesson 2 of career exploration. It asked me to do the quizzes on workplace BC. It said to do one. I did all 3 of them lol. The results are whacky but also cool. Some of the attributes it described me with are directive, innovative, dexterous, and great learning ability. The results are funny. Wait until you hear about the jobs I chose. It told me to choose 3, so out of the three quizzes, I chose Optometrist, Professor, and Architecture and Science Manager. The third one is something I have never heard of, but I had to choose something, lol. The job description is planning, organizing and directing the activities of an architecture, landscape architecture, scientific or statistical department, service or firm. Sounds pretty cool. It says you get to work for architecture firms and scientific research companies, which is sick. I would love to work for a research company, depending on what they are researching. There are a lot of new companies popping up these days, researching, developing, and even applying ways to stop different kinds of pollution. Anyway, that is completely unrelated to the assignment. Here I am, ranting again. UHHhhhhh. Let's talk about professors.....because, as I have mentioned a billion times, I would love to be a professor down the line. When I saw the word professor pop up on the screen, I jumped a little, lol. ""Do I have a strong personal interest for this kind of work?"" Duh, you know I do, lol. ""Will this career allow me to achieve the work/life balance I want?"" This is a great question because I have seen several teachers who have a strong separation between their work life and personal life, but there are also a lot of teachers who don't. I have never met university professors, but my friend's mom and dad are both professors at our local community college, and they are pretty cool. They don't have the greatest work-life balance. Oftentimes, they will have classes during the day and then again in the late evening, so to me, it sounds inconvenient to have to go back and forth all the time. That is probably why I often hear about teachers just staying at the school for extended periods of time. For example, my chemistry teacher, who is probably my favourite teacher ever to exist, stays at the school till 6 or 7 pm literally every day. I respect her a lot for that. Especially because her kids are both in high school, and she has to go give them rides and take care of them, too. Personally, if I am teaching something I really enjoy, and the kids I am teaching are nice, then I wouldn't mind staying at the school. I wanna decorate my classroom and make it feel homey. That is a dream of mine lol. I think when you are a teacher, it is more enjoyable to teach than if you are a professor. As a tutor, every time I teach a new student, I always end up befriending them in just a couple of days. I love getting to know the students and seeing what they enjoy and don't enjoy. Or seeing what they find funny and what they don't. Some of my favourite students are the ones who enjoy being roasted by me and also absolutely roast me back. I love having that level of friendship with those kids. It makes it easy for everyone to be comfortable, and I don't have to worry about saying something that might upset them. Obviously, there are rational boundaries, but I'm sure you know what I mean. Anyway, the point is that when you are a professor, I feel as though you definitely don't get that same type of relationship with your students. Do you even get to talk to your professors? My brother said he has never said a word to a single one of his professors in four years. You guys are the same age, by the way. I don't know if I've said that. ""Will this career offer me financial security?"" Uh, I hope so. On workplace BC it says professors have an annual salary of around 100 thousand dollars. That is great by my standards. Plus having the summers off. That kind of goes back to the work-life balance question. Having summers off is great. It allows you to mentally reset before going back to work in the fall. It also gives you a chance to visit any family or travel without having to worry about booking time off. Back to financial security, though. With the current state of Canada, even a 100k salary isn't that much. Which is brutally depressing. It is still definitely enough to survive off of comfortably. Plus, having a permanent teaching position gives me mental security, too, because it's a stable job, and I know I am not in danger of losing it or anything. If I have a job as a teacher, I can settle down, and I would be comfortable starting a family at that point. I am thinking way too far ahead lol. ""How much opportunity or job security does this career path offer?"" As I just mentioned, WE ALWAYS NEED TEACHERS! These days, they are hiring anyone in small communities. Trust me, some of the substitute teachers I get these days....I often question how they even got hired. Some of them are really bad. Like REAL BAD. It's pathetic. But no hate...The point is that it is super easy to find a job once you get your education, so that's good. And, if you know what you want to teach and have the qualifications for it, then it's even easier and you get paid more. Although, that's for teaching. For professors its a lot of school....which is literally the only thing that is keeping me from like fully committing to being a professor. It would take forever. I would rather teach at a high school level. BUT, we don't know what I will decide in the future yet. Either way, both are super stable jobs, and you can get hired in many places. ""Where will I need to live to pursue this career path?"" Once again, I just kind of mentioned this. There is a lot of flexibility. Depending on where you want to work, you can really choose. It's great! I wanna go back to the work-life balance section for a second. I had the realization that I was making it sound way nicer than it is. I think the work/life balance is pretty bad. Professors are always working weekends and evenings too. I think I mentioned that, but I played it off like it wasn't that bad. In my opinion, the summer off is a great trade for working weekends. As I am finishing this message, at almost 11 pm lol, the power is back at my school...meaning I have to go to school tomorrow. Unfortunate, but I am glad I got a random day off. I really needed it to be honest. I think everyone can use an unexpected day off like this. Just wanted to quickly mention the 4.3 trailer. I AM SO WISHING FOR NAVIAAAAAAAAAAAA. GUARANTEED NAVIA FOR MEEEEEEEEE. I dont care if shes good. I also dont care if I need other geo characters to make her useable. I have 0 geo characters but I want her anyways. Also, I built keqing after losing on furina and believe it or not I have actually been enjoying playing her way too much. I have been playing aggravate keqing with 4p thundering fury, so I get to spam her skill like every 2 or 3 seconds and its really fun, especially for bosses. I honestly like her so much that I am like kind of maining her at this point lol. Other than that...GOOD LUCK ON FINALS! My brother had a huge exam today too. It was like several hours long. IM SURE YOU WILL CRUSH YOUR EXAMS. YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE PHYSICS GOD. GO BE A COOL PHYSICS NERD! Lol...Have a good week Sarah! Mentee 2023-12-12, 22:52: I FORGOT THE PART WHERE I ASK YOU QUESTIONS......You kind of already told me about how you chose your career, but If there are more stories, please share them! I would love to know what you are excited about in the future vs what you aren't. I want to hear the realest answer. Tell me what you absolutely hate about your future lol... Also, what other careers have you considered? There's gotta be a few. It's probably all math-related. FUN. I LOVE BEING A NERD. Are you still considering those career options? Why did you give up on some of them? At one point in my life, I wanted to be an astronaut. Im not gonna lie I still haven't given up on that dream...I have huge dreams of going out there one day... Lastly, what are some things about careers you wish you were told in high school. For me, my entire life I have always been pissed at how unrealistically positive people are. Like no you cant be whatever your heart desires all the time lol. Sometimes you gotta be real with yourself. I don't want to hate on peoples dreams but some people need a reality check lol. When I was little especially I would get mad (mentally) at my teachers for being so unreal about it. Looking back, it was elementary school, so they cant like crush a kid's dreams when he says he's gonna be a pro soccer player without ever playing soccer before. Anyways, that's kind of embarrassing to share. I swear I am not insane.... Anyway! SORRY BOUT THAT. I forgot that I get to ask you questions that are probably not very enjoyable to answer lol. Mentor 2023-12-16, 18:08: Hi Ansh! Wow, that is insane! It reminds me of 2013 floods in Calgary where I showed up to school but it turns out the school was flooded so no one was there. I was honestly a little bit disappointed because I had signed up to do a talent show that day but since the school was closed obviously no one was there. I'm really glad that you got a much-needed break during what is probably one of the busiest times in your entire life. I totally get what you mean by mentally giving up - even thou","Mentor commented at 1:39AM November 17 
OH NOOOOO IM SO SORRY ?? It's ok that means guaranteed next time at least!  Also, for the next unit, are you supposed to do career exploration? I see that it's one of the required units but I just wanted to ask you first.
Mentee commented at 12:20PM November 16 
HOW IS THAT FAIR????? ?????? I PULLED LAST NIGHT. 76 PITY AND I LOST 50/50. I GOT KEQING.....She's cool i might main her but IM SO SADDD. IVE LOST 3 50/50s IN A ROW ??
happy for you though!.....

Mentee commented at 5:45PM November 15 
IM SORRY WHAT??? WHAT IS YOUR BANNER LUCK???? THATS INSANE! I AM LIKE FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW. 
Just had to quickly say that lol
Mentor commented at 2:35PM November 15 
Hi Ansh!
Don't worry, this is a really busy week for me too. Honestly, I'll probably be super busy until the end of December but I'll do my best to reply to you as soon as possible. It's really cool seeing all of the studying techniques that you learned from the video as I think they will be very useful for when you go to university. 
I’ve actually tried using spaced practice or the Pomodoro Technique many times; however, I don't know if I just have a really bad attention span, but I find it really difficult to focus for 25 minutes at a time, so instead I tend to just try and focus for as long as I can. I think it definitely works for some people but I’ve also seen people complain that 25 minutes is actually too short but maybe it's just because I have ADHD so I really cannot focus for that long.
I definitely really like interleaving or study swapping between different topics - as you may have noticed, I get distracted very easily so it helps to be able to switch to something new in order to kind of keep on track.
The interesting thing is I also have never heard of elaboration, although I think I have heard of the general idea before. Trying to make tangible connections from what you're learning to your everyday life helps to be able to build new neural connections that allow for your memory to be strengthened every time you think on those connections. I think it's really great that you are already able to do that, especially with the insulin glucagon example! The funny thing is I kind of used a very similar method for a lot of the biology terms that I had to study back when I was in first year.
Using pictures is definitely super helpful as its supplements text. As you may have heard before, a picture is worth a thousand words. It really allows you to more easily understand difficult concepts. However, there can also be times (especially in physics and math) where everything is just so mathematical and abstract that there's actually just no way to visualize things. I guess that’s why high level math and physics can be so difficult to understand; the concepts are just so out there that there really is no way to make a picture of it or to be able to connect it to something you already know. BUT I think that's honestly mostly just quantum mechanics so as long as you avoid that you’ll be fine aha. 
I think I'm going to attempt retrieval practices as well! I've heard of it but I've never really tried it but it sounds really useful. I think the reason I probably haven't tried it is because it sounds like more of a memorization type technique whereas in physics, problem solving is more of the skill you want to learn. However, I think this could still probably be a really useful technique for conceptual questions. 
It really does seem like you actually do know all your studying techniques. I'd say I actually don't really know my studying techniques, I should really be learning from you instead haha! Really all I do to study is look back at the homework questions, look at some of the practice questions, take out the ones I already know how to do, and then struggle through the ones I don't know how to do, and that is basically how I study which is probably not that good. I think the key to doing well in physics and probably by extension, engineering, is actually not necessarily a study technique but the desire to truly understand how a question is solved rather than just caring about getting the answer. Often, it can be really easy to come up with a correct answer, but if you don't understand why, it will hurt you when you get to really difficult problems. That is kind of the philosophy that I use when I study and I think it's helped me a lot so far. I'm definitely not a physics god but I tend to do ok so it must be somewhat useful. 
I am really impressed that you managed to get all of your applications done. I am struggling through my applications right now and I actually opted out of applying to a couple of universities just because I don't think I would have enough time to write applications. Congratulations on your acceptance to UofC!!! I know you probably won't go there, but congrats anyways and it's honestly a really cool university as well if you do end up going there somehow. I really hope you get into your dream program though!
I also finished the Archon Quest literally the night it came out. It was genuinely the most amazing quest so far and really reinforced my love for Furina. On that note, I was extremely successful with my pulls for her and I actually could not believe my luck. I had saved up about 220 pulls but got her on my 20th pull so I opted to go for the weapon banner which was also extremely lucky. I did one 10 pull and got the other Jadefall’s Splendor weapon and then another 10 pull and got her signature weapon. Then, I decided to go back and pull for her constellations and after using 60 pulls I got to her C2 constellation. After that I decided to stop and save my remaining 60 pulls for any future characters that might be interesting. I’m thinking of pulling for Navia too cuz she also had amazing character development during the Archon Quest. It’s really interesting that people are having mixed opinions about the archon quest because I have only heard absolutely positive reviews about it. I could totally see why Childe's fans might be mad though because he literally only showed up for 2 seconds and then he got thrown out of a portal by Skirk so it doesn't paint him in the most positive of lights. 
Good luck on your musical! I hope it goes really well, but I'm sure you guys will do absolutely amazing. The weather must have just been really bad across all of BC because not only did we have horrible rain and wind, it actually managed to cause three power outages on UBC so we basically had no lights or Internet all night. However, it's really funny we were facing another apartment and people started doing light shows where we basically just used the flashlight on our phone and waved it around at the other apartments. I think it's super interesting that you guys are able to rent a carpet cleaner, I've never actually used one but I see the really satisfying videos of carpet cleaners online and they look super fun. Once again, I wish you luck on all of your applications and I hope you hear back soon from your dream programs!

ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT....ITS TIME......
Heyooooo Sarah, 
I have wanted to write this message all week, but god, it has been hectic. I have so much to tell you, but I shall do the unit first. 
I just watched that video, and now I wish I had taken notes or something because there was a lot of juicy info packed into a short amount of time. Now here's the thing. I think I have mentioned this before, but I have no studying strategies whatsoever. Growing up school has kinda always been easy. I often wish I could take harder courses to challenge me but advanced courses aren't offered here. I know for a fact I would struggle in courses like that though. I chose this unit because I am going into mechanical engineering, and from what I have heard, engineering is not easy. I AM GONNA NEED TO STUDY. WHATS STUDYING?? I dunno...
Ok, so I am gonna go back and rewatch the video and take stuff out of it. Maybe I'll check the timestamps.
1. Spaced Practice - First off, I have never done anything like this, but I have heard of this type of strategy many many times. I know it is very popular and also quite effective. I think once I watched a Ted Talk about the Pomodoro Technique. I am sure you've heard of it. All you do is set a timer for 25 minutes and try to work with full intensity. Then, you take a 5-minute break. You repeat this process 4 times and then take a 30-minute break. I have never actually tried this method (obviously lol I dunno how to study) but, based on its fame I assume it is quite effective. This is something I will keep in the back of my mind for sure when desperate times come my way in the near future....
2. Interleaving - This method in simpler words just means swapping between different topics while you study. Once again I have not done this one either but this is something I would probably do anyway. If I were to study something I am not interested in, I would get bored very easily. So, to keep myself focused I believe switching between topics could prove to be quite effective.
3. Elaboration - This method forces you to explain and describe ideas with as many details as you can and connect the ideas to your daily life and experiences. This forces you to understand and explain what you’re learning, and connect it with what you already know. I took that word for word from the video lol. I like this one. It isn't something I have heard from any video or teacher before. Although I think we all do this unintentionally. At least I do. I always question everything I learn, which at times must be annoying for my peers and teachers. I don't truly understand something until I go and research it on my own. I often make stupid little metaphors and inside jokes with my friends and I to help remember stuff. In classes like biology, I like to take fancy words and play around with them, by using words that sound similar. I remember about a month ago, I convinced the entire class including the teacher to start saying  ""IN""sulin and Gluca""GONE"" to represent insulin raising blood glucose levels and glucagon lowering them. I know it's dumb, but it served quite useful to not just me but a large majority of the class (which is hilarious btw). Anyway, I know that is not quite the same as making connections to daily life and experiences but I feel like it plays the same role by in a way explaining ideas, even if it is farfetched sometimes. 
You know, I am unintentionally kind of treating this message as a way of ""studying"" this video. I am taking the information out and writing about it. It's actually helping me memorize these techniques which could prove useful later on.
4. Concrete Examples - This is similar to what I ranted on and on and on about in the elaboration section. Although I don't do this intentionally, I always find myself making connections to the real world when learning things, especially in science (which is the only thing I find interesting). I don't know what my problem is but I am always curious. But like, too curious, to the point where I question everything. I won't settle down until I have ""concrete"" evidence from the real world to help me understand the topic.
Maybe I am actually on the right track. Maybe I will find success in studying. Perhaps I am not doomed. After analyzing this video, comparing myself, and thinking hard about my habits, I don't feel as lost. I guess I have been using studying strategies my whole life without even realizing it. 
5. Dual Coding - Using pictures and text together. This is something I love. Pictures give me examples and evidence to calm my curiosity. My teachers have always used diagrams and images in notes and worksheets and they always prove most useful to me.
6. Retrieval Practice - Recalling what you know. I have used this technique a billion times. It is most useful in French. For years, the way I have studied for French tests is by writing down everything I know and then only studying what I don't know. And then repeating this process over and over until I know everything. It is such a great way to memorize anything! It is good because you can space out the studying times too! So, for example, I could write down everything I know on Monday (which would take only 5 mins) and then Tuesday do it again, and then Wednesday and so on. Another reason it is good is because it forces you to remember the older information too as you are constantly thinking back to it when you rewrite everything over and over.
I am going to leave it there for the video. This video has made me realize that I am a fraud,,,,, I think that...I gaslit myself into believing I don't know how to study when clearly after further consideration I seem to know what I am doing!
Now, I am wondering...being a physics student, first off I assume you love physics, which means that you are cool and amazing because people who like physics are epic. But, there's no way it's easy right? I'm sure university is quite challenging  (in your field of studies at least). Mechanical Engineering will be really fun because it combines all the things I love, but I think that any studying strategies you have would probably be useful for me too since physics is very similar.
Was there a major change in pace when going from secondary-level studies to post-secondary? Is it significantly harder? If you noticed this sudden change of pace, how did you handle it? Were you stressed at first? I assume you are probably permanently stressed lol, but that's just like I guess.
Do you study often? Do you use any of the strategies in this video? Or. are you an absolute god and physics is easy for you? I bet it's the second option...
 
I think that about wraps it up for strategic studying for now. I've got a lot of things to tell you!
First off, I finally got around to getting my applications done! I applied to the University of Ottawa, Carleton, and UVIC this weekend. ALSO. The University of Calgary has sent me an acceptance letter! I am most likely not gonna go there unless I somehow manage to get my hands on a scholarship. But yeah! Exciting News! I have been excited to share that with you. Also, I have decided to not apply to UBC at all because I am 100 percent sure I don't wanna live in the lower mainland. So that takes out a few other potential options as well.
Shoot now that I am getting the opportunity to tell you all the things I have been wanting to tell you all week I am starting to blank! 
OH, THATS RIGHT! I FINISHED THE ARCHON QUEST! I was going to start this message yesterday since last night I finally got some free time. But, instead, I decided to play Act 5 so that I could write about it in this message! I hope you've played it already. Obviously, I won't spoil it, but IT WAS SO GOOD! I wanna know your opinions on it once you have played it (I hope you have) because I have heard mixed opinions, especially from Childe fans.
Hmmm, what else...The musical is coming along! We had rehearsal from 1-9 today. It was exhausting but rehearsals are always fun times to make memories. When the musical ends I am gonna be quite emotional. I can already tell!
Um. I have 70 pity on Furina's banner! BUT I AM HAVING AN EXTREME GACHA CRISIS. I am not sure if I want her. Like yes, she is really good, but I am broke and It's not like I want her THAT bad or anything. Navia comes out in 4.3 and I am hoping she is good (she's geo so I shouldn't expect much). I hope they somehow make her good without needing c6 Gorou, albedo, and Zhonlgi...She's such a good character and she got her chance to shine in the final act quite a bit. So now I am conflicted... Is Arrlecchino going to be playable soon? Is Clorinde a 5 star? What other Fontainian characters are they hiding from us? 
DID YOU FINALLY GET FURINA? I sure hope you did! And I hope you got her weapon too (without wasting too many primos...). 
Well, anyway as usual it was really fun to write this message. Hope you are having a good day...or week I should say. The rain has been crazy up here! I also had 2 massive pipe bursts downstairs in my whole! It was crazy! My mother woke me up at like 7 in the morning (after I had gone to bed at 5) and I rushed downstairs to a massive puddle of water. I had to put on boots! It was crazy. After we got it all fixed by the plumber I went and rented a carpet cleaner and used it for the first time. It is super fun to use! ITS SO SATISFYING!
I went on another completely unrelated rant when I was about to end the message... oopsie. I cant help it lol. Alright BYEE!

Awesome sounds good! I just opened it.","Mentee commented at 9:26PM January 16 
Hi Sarah, 
Bad news....I don't think I am gonna be able to do this unit for at least a few days. Hopefully I can before the end of the semester. I have got a few scholarship deadlines coming up and I haven't even started some of them. I have also got some final exams to study for, and a few projects to work on. 
The painting is almost finished! I will send a picture of it when it's done I promise! I am also learning a song on the piano as another project (idk why i do this to myself). I am learning Do You Hear the People Sing? from Les Miserables. 
I dunno if you can send videos on the ementoring program. You probably can if you just attach the file. If it sounds decent i'll send it to you. I know your standards are probably really high though so I'm too scared to send it to you lol. I don't wanna get judged for being terrible. 
I've also got a rehearsal coming up for one of the bands i'm in this weekend and a couple of the songs we are running I haven't even played before ?? SO... I need to prioritize that....
Anyway, I'm sorry about not being able to get back to you. I swear I care! (I don't care about the unit....But i definitely care about you!) Regardless of whether the semester ends or not keep an eye out for a message from me in the next week or so. I have got a lot of exciting news and stuff to share with you. I can't wait to tell you lol. 
 
For now i'm gonna go try to pull off a last minute response for these scholarship questions...
Ok bye!

AHHHH HAPPY NEW YEAR
Sorry I haven't responded this week. I had my capstone presentation and a few projects due that I worked on over the break. I'll try to get back to you. Right now i'm working on a painting for my english class. I'll send you a picture when I finish! (if it looks good...)

Hi Ansh!
Happy New Year! I hope you had an amazing break. This is probably the last unit we will be working on as I think your school's participation in this program ends around the end of January. Feel free to get started!",,"Mentor commented at 12:56AM October 19 
Also I am so sorry if I sound like I'm rambling or made a lot of typos, the paragraphs just got so long I lost track ahaaha. If anything sounds unclear, just ask me!
Mentor commented at 12:55AM October 19 
Hi Ansh!
Sorry for the late reply, I got absolutely bombarded by assignments this week haha. Man, it always gets so busy towards the middle of the semester! Anyway, regarding your questions: I totally get how you feel about city life. As someone who grew up in big cities all my life, it was kinda hard to find community, especially outside of school. I think it really depends on the type of person you are - I really enjoyed city life due to the abundance of opportunities available and just the sheer amount of fun things to do. Honestly, even though Calgary and Vancouver are ""big cities"", I've been to much bigger cities in Asia where the air literally feels electric with the millions of people present in one city - it makes you feel super alive and excited. At the same time, I sometimes wish I had the safety and comfort of growing up in a small community where you kinda know everyone. My parents were immigrants who came here when they were relatively young so I kinda always felt like an outsider growing up. However, I found a lot of cool friends through school and really enjoyed the rapport I built with all my classmates over the many years we were together. Eventually though, we all split and went to different high schools, which caused me to again really struggle with making friends. I was able to overcome it after I came to university, where everyone mostly came from somewhere else. Big cities can feel very foreign and cold; I really felt that about Vancouver when I came here.  Everyone has this strange aloofness that can make it really hard to approach anyone, but with time and effort I think everyone is able to find a suitable social circle. That's why it's pretty important to make friends as soon as possible when you go to uni as it can be a lot more difficult once everyone has started forming friend groups. I think cities will definitely be a lot less accessible than you're used to, especially as you'll need to bus pretty far to get to anywhere. As for the ocean, I think going to UBC would be a perfect idea if you haven't considered it! It's right by the ocean and you're about a 10-15 min walk away from the beach, but I think I remember that Vancouver wasn't in your potential list of cities to go to. Montreal I've hard has beautiful scenery and plenty of places to hike but I do remember that Toronto was very much a concrete jungle haha (I promise it was still a very fun city though). Even though it's really tempting to stay inside your room all day, I highly recommend taking the time to explore a new city. It can be a little scary by yourself, but in my first year I chose to explore Vancouver with a bunch of new friends so we can find fun things together. Because first year can feel so exciting, making new friends and taking risks also feels super fun!
As you mentioned, I think the main advanatge of city life is just the sheer amount of things to do. You can meet so many different people, places, things, opportunities, it's just insane! A lot of the cool stuff I did through my life probably wouldn't have been possible if I didn't live in a bigger city. I'm kinda similar to you in that I haven't really experienced any disadvantages in a big city, but that's probably just because I've never really lived in a rural area. I think meeting new people may be a little harder since you definitely have to put in the effort if you want to meet people outside of your classes. I will admit I'm a huge introvert so I never really felt the need to make too many friends, but my friends who are more extroverted will often go out with their friends to escape rooms, arcades, movies, the mall, play sports, etc. It's usually helpful to pursue some type of passion, hobby or interest that will get you meeting others who are also interested in the same things as you! Of course, it will always take some effort to become good friends with anyone. I think you also make a really interesting point about seeing so many people you won't get to know. Sometimes, something worse can also happen where you kinda get to know someone very briefly, and then never talk to them again. I think you can always fix this by making the effort to approach them next time. 
Lastly, housing is a huge issue that definitely won't be fixed anytime soon. Unfortunately, you're mostly right to be worried about housing. It really is a widespread issue across Canada right now, particularly in big cities. I think as long as you live with someone you know it's usually not too bad to room together. If you know anyone who's planning to go to the same university, I think usually you can request to room together. Or you could consider staying with your older brother, which I think would really help you save on rent. It's unfortunate that it's very possible that you could end up with horrible roommates but I think that's just a part of the university experience ahaha. Everyone I know has had that one horrible roommate (for me it was actually my best friend!) and there are many ways to deal with bad roommates as usually universities have ways to mediate conflicts. I think a lot of the time it unfortunately just comes to everyone having different standards of living so it really is just luck whether you get matched with someone who is close to you. I can't guarantee that you'll love city life but I can say that it really is a lot of fun to me. Even if you end up not enjoying it too much, it's alays possible to return to Prince Rupert after you're done university. As long as you keep an open mind and heart, I'm sure you'll have a blast in some bigger cities too!
Next, I think we can move onto the Adulting unit and you can get started on those questions!
P.S. I am literally counting down the days till Furina is here. I honestly really like Wriothesley too but I have to get Furina ahahaha. I have like 200 pulls saved. I don't even care if she's good or not as this point I MUST HAVE HER. Also YES it would be so cool if Arlecchino is playable, I really think she will be

Heyoo, It is Sunday and I am catching up on my massive to-do list. I am going to answer the lesson 2 discussion questions.
Honestly, these questions are tough to answer for me. I know pretty much nothing about city life. I know it must be hectic and probably overwhelming, but I don't know much. I've been down in the lower mainland countless times, and I have visited Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa as well. I was born in White Rock but moved up north when I was just 5, so I haven't experienced living in a city at all.
I haven't formed any strong emotions for city life, positive or negative. It looks both exciting and also kinda terrible in a way. I'm not sure exactly what I mean by terrible. I kinda feel unsafe downtown in a large city. Well, that's probably because it is generally unsafe compared to small towns like mine. I feel like being surrounded by tons of people, large buildings, and heaps of traffic is probably just not pleasant. For visiting it is nice to experience but I feel as though it just gets annoying eventually. I'm worried it'll get annoying enough to the point where I just won't wanna go outside, and I'll just sit in my apartment or dorm all day...Realistically I will probably do that anyway so.......I like to have somewhere to escape to, and I want to find someplace like that wherever I end up. I want a place where I get just feel like I'm out of all the chaos. Here in Rupert, I like to head down to the waterfront. There is a really nice dock there, as well as a beautiful sunset view. The most convenient part is how easily accessible it is. It takes about a 5-minute drive to get down to the water. I have grown up with the ocean next to me and I don't think I can live without it. Just the idea of being completely landlocked sounds kinda terrible. Plus the ocean breeze is like my favourite thing to exist. I am also very surrounded by nature here. If I look out my window right now there is a huge mountain right next to me. There's always deer just wandering around, there are plenty of trails and hikes with lots of wildlife too. That's the one thing I think I'll really miss. 
As for advantages, well once again I don't know how to answer that. I bet there's a lot to do. There's always interesting things happening. Probably festivals, celebrations, concerts etc. There is new food to try, and new places to visit, and depending on where you live, it could be really accessible too. I really don't see any advantages of city life. I'm sure there is a lot, but without having experienced it myself I can't say much.
I'd love to know your opinion on city life. Do you like it? What advantages do you feel you've had? Is there anything that you wish you could do/have that you don't get in city life? Is there anything that you love a lot that you know I don't get to experience?
Another thing that I just realized is that cities are way too large and diverse for you to ever really feel like you are welcome or I guess ""at home"" in a sense. I feel as though you permanently feel like a stranger because of how chaotic it is. Whereas in small communities you eventually feel connected to the city and the people around you. How do you meet new people if there are so many people? That question doesn't really make sense but I can't imagine making friends when there are just so many people. What other opportunities do you get to make friends besides your classes and roommates? I feel as though there are just so many people that you never actually get to meet them. On top of that, you just see new faces every day. Faces that you will never see again just casually pass by.
My last and probably main concern is housing. I always hear the worst stories about housing and roommates too. The prices must be insanely high these days. And, I am scared I'll be paying a ridiculous amount of rent just to end up with roommates that are terrible and make my living conditions a mess. I don't wanna have to clean up after other people and that would drive me insane. 
Are my fears rational, or am I just being crazy and farfetched? I am really looking forward to your response lol. 
I think my fears might be influenced by my older brother because he hasn't had the greatest most exciting stories to tell me about his experience in city life. But, everyone's experience is different and he could just be unfortunate. I want to be optimistic about city life. There's gotta some great parts about it. Seriously....otherwise why do people even live there? That's not how it works, is it...
Anyway, hope you had a great weekend. I have no other exciting news to share this time. I usually do but nothing interesting this time sadly. I am looking forward to Furina though! I'm not sure if you allow yourself to look at genshin leaks, but in case you don't, just to get your hopes up, Furina looks really broken, so BE EXCITED. I am gonna try to really push my luck and ""build pity"" on her banner when it comes out. I want Arlecchino super badly though. I REALLY REALLY hope she's playable. SHE IS SO COOL AHH.

Hi Ansh!
Yep you are correct, all of the modules are basically like this! Usually, you have to maybe read through something or watch a video as well and then comment on it as part of your response but it's not strictly necessary. The really coincidental thing is I very recently met someone from Prince Rupert over the summer while I was working at CERN! His name is Thomas and he's currently doing a Physics degree at UNBC. Also, it's so funny that your high school only has 700 people because my graduating class was about 700 (our school is about 2100, but we are one of the largest high schools in Alberta). It's really interesting that your shcool was known for the arts, because at my high school we were kinda the opposite; we were a heavily academic high school, with some people even making it into Harvard every now and then. We were also really good at badminton and I played on the badminton team for two years before I got too stressed about winning in order to maintain our city championship so I quit ahha. 
Calgary is considered a urban city because it has a population of over 1 million but honestly after coming to Vancouver, it really doesn't feel all too different. Even though I didn't really grow up in a rural community, I was in a specific school program called TLC with a bunch of my classmates from kindergarten all the way until grade 9. After grade 9, we all went to separate high schools so it was a really big struggle for me to make friends in high school where it felt like everyone already knew each other. I think when I came to university it was much easier because in uni everyone is usually new, so there aren't too many preexisting groups which makes it easier to find new friend groups. However, even now I am still in contact with two of my best friends, one of which I've known since kindergarten.
Being from a rural community has really big advantages when you apply to certain university programs as they tend to be biased towards rural students since they haven't had the same access to opportunities. For example, most medical schools in Canada have a separate applicant stream for rural applicants that makes it much easier for rural applicants to succeed. Being from a rural community, as you mentioned, also means you probably don't have too much experience with people outside of your close knit community, but that can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. I think it's really nice to have a really reliable network to fall back onto when you finally decide to leave, but it might also be stressful when you come to more urban areas. From talking to you though, I think you would be perfectly fine in a bigger city especially with how friendly and social you seem!
Unfortunately, I don't know too much about Ottawa, but a lot of my friends went there and to Montreal and Ontario. I was actually originally born in Toronto but moved to Calgary when I was 6 months old. I have been back to Toronto over the summer and it is a really awesome place but really windy ahah. Montreal I've heard is gorgeous due to its architecture and obviously McGill is an amazing school. I've never heard of the Shopify DevDegree but it looks really cool and a good fit for you! I also think moving in with your brother would be a great idea as that means you'll always have someone you feel comfortable with nearby. I think that's partially why my sister followed me to UBC hahaha. I think it's a great idea to apply to the Loran scholarhsip as it's really prestigious and would look amazing on your resume and to help fund your university degree. Also don't worry about writing long essays, it just means you're really good at reflecting about yourself!
Feel free to move onto question 2 now, and lastly, happy belated Thanksgiving to you too!
P.S. CONGRATS ON GETTING HOMA WOOOO, really hope I can get Furina's weapon when it comes out too hahahha.

Hihi, Sarah! I am going to answer the Rural Living discussion questions.
I am from a small town on the coast of British Columbia, called Prince Rupert. Am I allowed to say that? I think so. Anyways, our population (according to Google) is around 12,300 people, BUT IN MY OPINION, our population is about half of that. I refuse to believe we have that many people. Like, where are they on a daily basis? The roads are empty and it's always deserted. We have one high school here. It is called Charles Hays Secondary School. Once again, according to Google, my high school has 700 PEOPLE??? WE DO NOT. I swear we have like half of that. Regardless, I do like my community. Our school is known for many things.
In my school, the drama/theatre department is very famous and has a high reputation. We have an annual musical at the beginning of December. It is like a tradition we have here. This year we are working on a musical called ""Something Rotten."" It is a really funny one. Basically, there are 2 brothers (Nick and Nigel Bottom) who are trying to become playwriters but are outshined by the rock-star playwright of the Renaissance, William Shakespeare. Nick goes to a crazy psychic person to try to find out what Shakespeare's greatest play will be in the future. This is when the psychic discovers something called ""Musicals"" which is unheard of at the time. He says that Shakespeare will write a musical called ""Omelette"" (which is supposed to be like Hamlet except the psychic is crazy and is slightly off). In a desperate attempt to become successful Nick and Nigel try to write ""Omelette: The Musical,"" and that is basically the plot simplified. It is a really funny musical and I am excited to deliver it to the audience. I personally do not have the talent to act on stage, but as I have mentioned before I am the drummer in the pit band. Every year we have a full house at the Lester Centre of the Arts, which is like our theatre for all community performances. The capacity is pretty large. I'm not sure the exact number but a few 100 people, and last year we had a FULL HOUSE! It was epic.
The other major thing our school is known for is basketball. Our basketball team is called The Rainmakers, because it rains almost every day here. I forgot to mention that earlier, but Prince Rupert is one of the rainiest places in the world (literally). Actually, I just searched it up, and Prince Rupert is LITERALLY the rainiest city in Canada. So, I guess that's kinda cool. But anyway yeah our basketball team has had quite the success in the last few generations. We even won provincials just a couple of years ago.
Those are what I would say are our two most popular activities in this community. Our music department is pretty epic too. I love my band teacher. We have a jazz band, a concert band, and a choir. Obviously being the band kid I am, I am a member of all 3 of those courses. 
I do like living here. I don't have any experience living in a city, but I really like being in a small community. Maybe I would like city life too. What makes a small community special to me, is that everyone is pretty tight-knit around here. There's lots of kindness and positivity. You know everyone personally and they all know you. That has its upsides and downsides though.  Sometimes I wish everyone didn't know me, so maybe that's an upside of city life. Another pro of living here is the transportation. I can leave my house at 8:40 and still make it to school pretty much on time even though I live on the other side of town.
I honestly don't know what strengths I have gained from living here. I was told that being from a small town is good for some program and scholarship applications. If anything, I feel like I have developed weaknesses living here. I don't get punished for being unpunctual. I rarely need to leave my comfort zone because I am surrounded by the same people all day. I have been surrounded by the same kids my whole life growing up here. Do you know any advantages I have from growing up in a rural community? There definitely are advantages I have just never thought about it like that.
As for how my future education can help with the struggles my community faces, I don't think I am interested in coming back here. Or, at least I am not interested in living here, but I may visit once in a while. I want change. I have lived here for almost my whole life. I moved here when I was 5 years old from the lower mainland. I want to go out and explore the world. I am actually quite excited to see how city life will treat me. But, I know it will be a massive change, and change is always stressful.
I remember that you mentioned you are from Calgary. I think you said that. I have been there a couple of times but I don't know much about it. Would you say that living in Calgary your childhood was more rural or urban? I feel like it would probably be somewhere in the middle right? We probably share some similar experiences then, but also some very drastically different experiences. I'd love to hear about your experience growing up in Calgary.
Anyways, I have written quite an essay for you to respond to lol, I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but I apologize for the massive message. Another thing I wanted to tell you about is that I did my application for the Loran scholarship. I don't know if I have any chance of qualifying for it, but my older brother told me that there's no point in not applying because you have nothing to lose. He is a 4th year student at McGill University. In the near future, I am thinking of applying to the Shopify DevDegree program. Have you heard of it? It is like my dream program and if I got into it that would be like a dream come true. The applications aren't open yet but I am patiently waiting. It should open in another week or 2. I am planning on moving to eastern Canada. Ideally, I would like to be in Montreal, Ottawa, or Toronto. Big cities are scary, and gross. But, I want to experience city life during my university years so that when I grow up I can have experience in both types of lifestyles so I can choose which one I prefer. My brother and I are planning on potentially living together over there next year. Nothing is set in stone but it is a potential plan of mine. I want to study something along the lines of Mechanical Engineering, Physics, or Computer Science. 
OKOK ONE LAST THING. I was wondering what the units would be like. Are all the units like this? Are they all like questions and discussion topics for us to talk about together? Because if so, I really like this. I genuinely really enjoyed answering those questions and I can't wait to learn from your response. 
LASTLY, 
Happy Thanksgiving! Hope you had a great weekend!",,,,
